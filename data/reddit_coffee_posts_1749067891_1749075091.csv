I know I could stand to lose weight but this is not the way I was hoping to lose it.
I am terrified. Let me start by saying I have another primary care appointment scheduled this month (3rd one since this started) and I‚Äôm hoping to ask for a GI referral and possibly an ultrasound for any new ovarian cysts (had a teratoma removed in 2019 and bilateral salpingectomy in 2023 during c section- tubes were found to be full of cysts).
Symptoms of nausea upon waking, some days lasting all day, early satiety, weak, shakey, cold sweats(because I feel hungry but have to be functioning throughout the day as I have 4 children). I have tried all the tricks from crackers in bed to small, bland snacks throughout the day, hydroxyzine(helps with eating because I get so sleepy and high feeling I get the munchies real quick before I fall asleep).
I do get acid in my throat after eating a lot more often now, even something like a half a banana feels like it‚Äôs burning and coming back up. I have taken pepto bismol a few times, tried tums. I can‚Äôt say they don‚Äôt help but they only take the burning away. I drink a lot of water, always have. I can‚Äôt even finish my 1 cup of coffee anymore.
This started out as persistent diarrhea and progressed to severe nausea and I‚Äôm in and out of the bathroom all day (not diarrhea every time but I got to go).
This has caused me to start losing weight and I‚Äôm getting worked up and panicky thinking something is seriously wrong- which of course makes me feel more shakey and sick feeling.
I quit taking Prozac for OCD and anxiety around Dec of ‚Äò24 because I thought that was causing the GI issues.
Have had stool sample taken, CBC, blood work to check vitamin levels, thyroid, A1C, and all looks normal. Also have been to the ER for heart palpitations and SOB, contrast CT was normal, D-Dimer was high (like .59 or something so idk if that HIGH high or just barely elevated) but ER and doc not concerned after scan, also had a 14 day zip patch on 2 separate occasions with findings of only rare PVCs or ectopic beats.
I‚Äôm trying to remain calm. Can this loss of appetite, nausea, and weight loss be harmless? Is there anything I should have tests for specifically? Do you know someone who‚Äôs gotten relief from daily nausea without meds that make them fall asleep?",1,1749074862.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1l3iiek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3iiek,"Layout feedback, modernizing and opening up in a 1930s house","I'm looking for any feedback you have on this layout. Thank you!

# Background:

It's a 1930s house. The kitchen will be the most modern-looking room on the ground floor; for the others we want to try and keep the period elements. In the kitchen I expect our period elements will be limited to trim, lights and choosing paint colors to flow with the rest of the floor.

The original layout had separate kitchen and dining rooms, with a breakfast nook in the kitchen and bump-out extensions for the fridge and a pantry closet. We're keeping the extensions and taking down the walls to the nook and the dining room. There's going to be approx. 15"" bump-outs on either side for beam support footings.

Range is moving from the inside wall without ventilation, to the old sink location. I would much prefer a peninsula to a completely open concept, so the sink is moving there, which means the dishwasher has to move with it. It does make for a slightly tight walkway to the dining room, though.

We're turning the nook into an appliance pantry type idea: sink, coffee maker, microwave and storage. I think there's enough space for one person to use as a secondary prep area, but it's pretty narrow in there.

# Cabinets and Counters:

On the right of the walkway into the kitchen we can fit an 18D cabinet. We're want to get a trash pull- or tilt-out in half of this, which will probably need to be custom. The other half is vertical storage for bakeware. Right now, this cabinet is 41H to match the peninsula bar, but that might go back down to 36"".

Peninsula holds sink and dishwasher, with the dishwasher at the end (so needs an end panel). Everywhere else I've tried to put it, the door interferes with something; in particular, I can't swap the sink and the dishwasher over without making things very inconvenient.

For the blind corner base cabinet between the range and the peninsula, I'm looking at the \[LeMans II\](https://www.hafele.com/us/en/product/lemans-ii-set-for-blind-corner-cabinets/P-00856493/) pull-out.

For the wall with the range, in the far-left narrow wall cabinet I'm hoping to get some sort of pull-down or pull-out so it's more easily accessible. This might have to be custom-made. Or, I can bring it down so it's level with the others.

The right of the range will have a spice rack pull-down in the wall, and silverware/utensils/etc below.

The old bump-out pantry to the left of the blue door will be split into two: the left will be a tall, narrow broom closet, and the right will have roll-out shelves. This should let us fit a full-depth refrigerator in here; the previous owners had a counter-depth pushed back into the bump-out extension so they could open all the doors.

For the new appliance pantry area, we found a 12-inch microwave with an under-cabinet mount kit that fits the space. We don't use the microwave much, and I'd rather have a range hood than an over-the-range microwave, so this helps preserve counter space. The coffee maker can live underneath, and any condensation will end up on the metal and not the wood if people don't pull it forward to use.   
  
I've also got a couple of built-in cutting boards in the layout; we have them at our current house and like them a lot.

With the Bye rounds well and truly underway, we are now in the Reaping phase for the proverbial Sowing of our trade decisions for the first half of the year. Many otherwise robust teams struggled this round, but it's important to maintain perspective; while you may do poorly one round owing to lots of Bye players, others will likely do poorly in rounds where you will score well, so consider the Bye ""block"" (and associated rank change) as a whole when assessing your performance. 


There's an additional layer of complexity this round, which for many will be obvious but I'll talk through it nevertheless.   A player who has already had their Bye (WBD/CAR/PTA/NTH) is worth extra points when trading them in from this point onwards when compared to players who are yet to have their bye (in which they will score 0). If we compare Rozee (531K, 104 average) and Holmes (519K, 104 average) and assume they will score at their average for the rest of the year Rozee nets 1248 points while Holmes scores 1144, which for Holmes effectively means he averages 95.3 for for the rest of the year despite scoring 104 each week that he plays. So while in the above comparison (ignoring team performance + role concerns) Rozee seems to cost 12K more than Holmes, he's in effect averaging 9 points higher per week than Holmes for the rest of the year making him the better trade in. The difference in apparent average varies slightly depending if we are comparing players predicted to score 90 (~7.5) or comparing players predicted to score 130 (~10.8), but for our purposes we can say most players will effectively average 9 higher per game after their Bye than their equivalent non-Bye counterparts. This gets muddied a bit when taking Rookie cover for a Bye player into consideration, but considering how few playing rookies most teams have and the possibility of more injuries it's a very real possibility for some that you may not be able to cover someone in their Bye week.


All that is a long winded way to say ""trading players post Bye = good"".


**DEFENDERS**


There's very few defender options this week - either they're coming off the Bye and aren't amazing picks, or they have an upcoming Bye. If you can, you should probably wait until next week and then bring in Wanganeen-Milera.


**Rozee - 531K - post-Bye,** if you need a value pick this week then Rozee is a reasonable price and looks to have kept the half back role over previous weeks. Could average 105-110 and slot in to D5-6. Only dangers over the coming 3 weeks are the Bedford and Jordon tags, but we can hope that at least the Bedford tag will go to Butters given that Bedford usually tags in the midfield, however Rozee did cop the Jordon tag when they last met.


**Dale - 552K - post-Bye**, I have previously avoided recommending Dale, but he's a decent price and a bit of a POD in the backline, and WBD have an amazing run home - noting both their easy matchups and that they play primarily at Marvel for the rest of the season. He's not as good as some of the other options at ~550K (Whitfield/Ash/Zorko/Clark) but it's hard to pick them this week with their upcoming (or current) Byes. If you must have a decent enough POD defender this week, then Dale is your guy.


**Ash - 552K**, if you're looking for reliable at the cost of a round 16 Bye, then Ash could be the one to pick. He's flown under the radar this year compared to Whitfield, but he's only scored under 100 three times (95/85/80), has a BE of 108, is averaging 111, and is only in 10% of teams. 


**Speculative Defence Picks**


**Stewart - 429K**, was decent enough last week and looks to be emerging from the cycle of injury / resting / playing through injury / resting. He's not quite back to his best, but he's cheap if you want to gamble that he averages 105+ with a few spike scores from here. He's not for me given the recent injury history and his barely adequate performances.


**MIDFIELDERS**


Let's discuss the Bont first.


**Bontempelli - 643K - post-Bye**, this is the big question this week, whether or not to bring in the Bont. Usually I stick to recommending value options, and I have to say that the Bont this week fits the bill. He's coming off a Bye, has a BE of 137 (and has scored more than that in half of his games this year), he has an easy opponent in an undermanned/underperforming HAW this week, WBD have an amazing run home, he's only 30K more expensive than his lowest price of 610 in the past 2.5 years, and he's averaging 129 (which the previous 2 years have demonstrated is sustainable). The only trouble is last time he played Hawthorn he was tagged out of the game by Nash and scored 63. So the question of bringing in Bont really comes down to 3 questions:


1. Do you think he will be able to break a tag this week (because if not, you should wait until next week to bring him in)?


2. Do you think he'll continue to outscore all the other options we have available (noting as well he plays an extra game coming off the Bye) and provide a weekly captaincy option?


3. Will you still be able to complete your best 22 over the next couple of weeks (+/- some semi-premos eg Roberts/Daniel) if you spend 100K extra on Bont compared to the alternatives?


If the answer to all three questions is Yes, then you should bring him in. If No, then either 1) wait a week, 2) pick someone else who may score similarly (and I don't think there are any in the midfield excepet perhaps Butters), or 3) choose a value option that lets you finish your team. I'm bringing him in.


**Cerra - 513K - post-Bye**, one of the very few mid-pricers that people gambled on at the start of the season to pay off, and after 12 rounds I'm finally convinced that he's a decent value option if you want a cheap not-quite-M8 player to sit at M8. He's got a BE of 42 and plays ESS/WCE/NTH and is a near certainty to score well and go up further in price over the coming weeks.


**Merrett - 546K**, has a BE of 77 and is currently sitting at  M9 for the year. He's priced well below everyone above him (except Hewett, but we can talk about him next week), and it's plausible that he outscores Anderson and Hewett to finish M7-8. I should note, however, that Essendon have a bit of a tricky run home (in part by virtue of not getting to play Essendon). Merrett has unfortunately continued to be a victim of the role-player deficit at the club, and spent much of last game in the backline. We can only hope that he's returned to a high CBA role, but that may depend in part on the performance of another player who will be discussed below.


**Speculative Midfield Picks**


Perhaps more reliable this week than most.


**Caldwell - 440K**, 70+% CBAs the previous two weeks saw Caldwell hit two scores of around 120. He looks to be playing exceptionally well and has recovered from his injury. He won't be able to sustain this scoring in the long run (either by injury, being managed, role change, or just regression to the mean) but for now he's at the best price we can expect to see for the next few weeks. If you wait to after his Bye he could be 500K+, so now is the time to get him. He seems to be a good sort of player that you might want in the flex, can score decently most weeks (but probably isn't top of the line) and is cheap for what he brings.


**RUCKS**


The two big guns, as always, are out of reach for most.


**T. De Koning - 528K - post-Bye**, he wasn't superb in what was a difficult match up for Rucks in his last match against Briggs, but people seem to be quick to forget how well he performed across the first 7 weeks. He was admittedly looking tired in recent matches, but he came straight back for in Pittonett the moment he was available which is reassuring, and resting 3 of the past 4 weeks should bolster what should be easy matchups against Goldstein, Flynn, and Sweet/Visentini in 3 of the next 4 games. He's a decent price for an R3 or a cheap R2.


**FORWARDS**


Slim pickings this week in the forward line, if you can you should probably wait for JHF in round 15.


**Kennedy - 496K - post-Bye**, another like Ash who has flow under the radar. Kennedy is just about averaging 100 which in this year's forward mix is actually a decent effort. He's got an easy run home, and the next 5 weeks should be easy for a MID/FWD, especially given Hawthorn's backline depletion this week. The only question mark is what happens to his CBAs (currently ~60%) once Treloar comes in.


**Speculative Forward Picks**


None this week.


**ROOKIES**


Finally, last week's Chosen One (Gray) survived the bubble week and looks to be a decent pick (let's hope he's selected this week with Balta in the team). Please don't pick Rory Atkins, he goes out for any of the returning port defenders.


**A. Clarke - DEF - 113K**, cheap, BE 73, still hit 40 despite a tough opponent last week, he's a lock for this week and the wing spot is firmly his with Jones and El-Hawli out with injury.


**Pedlar - FWD - 150K**,  has had a good first couple of games and could hopefully make 150K+ if he stays in the team; he peaked at 313K in his last full season (2023). As with all rookies there is the sub risk, but if Berry and Draper are selected alongside him they should be first in line for the vest. The only additional consideration in picking Pedlar is the (slightly) elevated price - some may find they need the extra 40K saved going for a cheaper option (not that there are many) to facilitate their trades for this or next week.


**McCarthy - DEF/MID - 99K**, 1st pick in the mid season draft. With a good performance off half back in the WAFL last week and being well liked by McQualter, he's looking likely to get some time in the main team over the next few weeks. It is an exceptionally early pick, but in the latter half of the seasons with the number of trades dwindling each week, one strategy is to ensure you get maximum value out of your trade-outs by bringing in almost exclusively 99K players. If you're going to do this, then why not pick someone like McCarthy who's going to get some game time and has a useful DPP? Otherwise, I'd wait for his first game or two to see if he can play at AFL level.

I'm considering Yokohama, Kawagoe, Hakone or Fujiyoshida (Mainly Honcho Street to get a nice view of Fuji). Others? Thing with Hakone/Onsen though is I have tattoos.

Not sure if its a waste to just stay within the Kanto region. I may consider Sapporo/Hokkaido or Fukouka even though they're far away from Tokyo if its worth it during September.

**Mainly asking for suggestion on cities/areas to visit outside of Tokyo and the golden route.**

**Interest are:** Historical Sites/Nature, Food/coffee. Music (Hip hop, R&B, Jazz/Funk), Martial Arts (Muay thai/Kickboxing), Streetwear/Classic Menswear/American Heritage Clothing, Anime, and JDM (although I'm not too knowledgeable on the latter).

Recently I replied to an Instagram story of hers and then we just started texting back and forth, I suggested we catch up and a few days ago we ended up getting coffee and that lasted for 2.5 hours.

Later we were talking about how she likes yoga and she mentioned that she'd love to go together sometime.

She's always smiling and has great energy all the time, so I don't know if it's the same or if she's likes me. I for the life of me have never been able to read the damn signs, wouldn't notice it if it hit me like an 18 wheeler going at 60 mph.

1l3ib6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1l3ib6d/karma_bites_back_at_the_overnight/,Karma bites back at the Overnight,"I recently talked to my old boss the other day about something, and I asked her how the hotel was doing. She told me this story, which she was okay with me sharing here; I did not witness this story, just sharing what was told to me.

Back before I was the assistant manager at my current hotel about 20mins from a major Division I university, I used to work at a hotel right on the edge of said university. At that hotel, we used to have an overnight person who wasn't a team player, but we were forced to have him because overnight positions are very tough to fill and everyone knew that he needed this job (he couldn't get a job elsewhere as he barely got a high school diploma). Let's call him Steve (not his real name). While I did feel for Steve, he was an asshole.

As I mentioned, Steve wasn't a team player and he didn't like doing work, which I suspected why he couldn't get a job elsewhere. Thankfully, Overnight doesn't have much in terms of tasks to take care of. The two biggest things overnight needs to do is switch over the day on the system at 3am, and start breakfast prep at \~5am. Besides those tasks, if there are no walk-ins or people that still needed to check-in, there isn't anything else we expect of overnight for at least six hours of an eight hour shift.

Now cue in another employee; let's call him Edwin (not his real name). Edwin has been the afternoon shift for nearly four years at this particular time and was a stellar employee. He started part-time when he was pursuing his undergraduate degree, working full-time in the summers, and graduated a year ago from this particular date. He then got accepted into a graduate school program at the same university after I left that hotel, but since it was only offered online, the boss and he made an agreement that he'll continue working full-time hours so long as he is allowed to prioritize his graduate school stuff & go to the online live lectures while at the desk; like I said, he was an amazing employee when I worked with him and I know the boss didn't want to lose him.

For the most part, all the other employees worked with Edwin; morning shift was happy to make sure laundry was all done, the cleaning person took a few extra cleaning tasks, and the managers were not mad if every little detail wasn't complete (like if he forgot to turn the pool lights off for example).

Edwin never took advantage of this arrangement according to the boss, and I can also say that he never had that personality when I worked with him. When Edwin didn't have school stuff to take care of, he was making sure everything was done at the hotel, even doing extra tasks to relieve some stress from overnight/morning shift or even the non-front desk staff such as maintenance and the cleaning people.

Long story short, Edwin suddenly went to the boss and put in his resignation, effective immediately, which shocked everyone. He said he was leaving without malice towards the boss/hotel, so he did say that he would talk to the boss with a casual exit interview. When questioned why he was suddenly leaving, this is what Edwin told the boss:

All of Edwin's weekly coursework was due at 11:59pm on Tuesday's, which everyone knew. Edwin didn't mind working Tuesday's as it was one of the quiet days of the week. He mentioned that the previous Tuesday (which was two days before this exit interview), there was a group assignment due, but one of the other group members didn't do their part, so Edwin had to scramble to get that finished before the due time. He even ended up staying at the hotel an extra 30mins after his shift shift ended at 11pm. According to Edwin in the exit interview, after he clocked out and went to the lobby to finish that assignment, Steve, who was his relief, came out and started screaming at Edwin because he didn't pull the coffee pots from the coffee station or turn the light off in the pool room at 10pm. Edwin said he apologized and would take care of it once his assignment was complete, but Steve didn't like that and yelled that Edwin needed to do it that second. Not trying to fuel the anger, Edwin took care of it that second. When he was done, Steve started to lecture him again, saying it was unacceptable and that he was just doing it on purpose so Edwin can ""play games on his computer."" (this was Edwin quoting what Steve supposedly said specifically).

Edwin then said to the boss that that was the breaking point and he would not work with Steve anymore if he would be up in his business like that.

When I asked what my old boss did as a result, she snickered and said that she did the following:

After talking with Edwin more during that exit interview, he said that he didn't want to quit, but didn't want to feel guilty for doing his graduate school stuff as he knew that his focus was divided. The boss gave him the option to take as much time off from the hotel if Edwin would want it, even going as far to offer a total of two weeks paid leave if he agrees to come back and work after that time off, stressing that it would not be a termination. When Edwin asked who would cover the shifts, she said that she and her daughter would cover some of them, but she would schedule Steve for a few 12hrs so he would have to do some of those afternoon tasks that he yelled at him about. Apparently, that was not the first time someone complained about Steve, but because there was nobody to fill his spot, there wasn't much that could've been done. Edwin agreed and ended up taking a month off.

From what my old boss told me, Steve was not too happy that Edwin ""quit,"" but had to accept the new terms after it was stated that Edwin quit because of what he did to him that day. ",10,1749074156.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,1,1.0,False

1l3iao5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1l3iao5/may_2025_trip_report/,May 2025 Trip Report,"**\*\*WARNING\*\* This is a long post...**

Please be aware, much, if not all, of the information below will be redundant as you've probably already read it before if you've spent any amount of time searching this sub. The below is my own thoughts and experiences after only one trip to Iceland so I'm definitely no expert and your mileage may vary but I hope something I say may help you.  Money wise, we spent $573.42 on gas (diesel) and $359.38 on campsites. Flights, food and anything else varies by traveler so I won't go into what we spent there but if you really need to know, DM me and I'll share.

**START OFF WITH A PLAN -** Main thing I learned from this sub about Iceland, and it makes perfect sense, was that you simply cannot do it all in one trip. I started my research and quickly became overwhelmed with choices and sites that I wanted to see. Analysis paralysis and FOMO... Take a step back and choose what is most important to you for the time you have and enjoy what you can fit in for your trip but don't rush it trying to fit EVERYTHING in. 

**ITINERARY -** Our plan was to complete the ring road anticlockwise. We wanted to keep it very loose so only created a general schedule as we didn't want to feel pressured to 'stay on schedule' or cut ourselves short at a location because we needed to be at the next one soon. We made a list of sooo many recommended sites, hikes, waterfalls and lagoons to overfill the schedule then tried to rate them as ""must see"" or ""if we have time"". By the 4th day, yet another majestic foss was not highest on the list but we still managed to fit more in. Between renting a camper van and keeping the schedule flexible, we never felt rushed and had all the time in the world to stay at one location or move on. 

**CAMPER VAN -** Ultimately we went with the Happy Campers Happy 3 van which is overkill for just the two of us since it says it sleeps 5 but we appreciated being able to stand while changing clothes and the extra space. Also, the sleep 5 is relative anyway since that upper sleep area is great for kids but akward for an adult to get in and out of. We made the reservation many months in advance to ensure we could secure the van we wanted and take advantage of early booking discounts. Keep an eye out for deals though as we noticed Happy Campers ran a deal around Black Friday. A thing I learned is if I'd paid the total balance when I booked I'd have saved myself a couple hundred $ since the Dollar vs Euro conversion changed quite a bit between booking and paying upon arrival. Something to note, campsites charge per person, not per vehicle so the prices I post for the places we stayed are for two adults. You may find a different price for yourself.

**APPS -** Checked all the apps and outlook daily just to be sure but had no warnings and great weather the whole trip (Vedur, RoadConditions, SafeTravel, etc.)

**WEATHER -** OK, this was nuts. We prepped for the worst and received the most amazing weather ever heard of. May 9 we encountered sun, rain, hail, sleet, light snow fall with avg temp around 3C (37F) all between 1100 and 2000 in our first day just like you'd expect. May 10 to May 20 was literally bright sunny days with temps ranging from mid teens (\\\~15C/59F) all the way up to (21C/70F), very light winds (except at the top of Saxholl Crater and once on the road around Snaefellsnes when a gust hit the van and a very quick correction kept me from going off the road. Winds are serious and the huge kite I was driving would NOT have been fun in the typical heavy winds of Iceland. 

**DRIVING -** I don't want to harp on this because it is so very well covered in the sub but please please heed ALL the warnings you read on this sub. I ran into every warning you've heard of. Yes, the road really is very narrow and you may white knuckle passing a tractor trailer because they are hugging the center line. Yes, I had someone gawking at an Instagrammer posing off the side of the road and drifted well into my lane (I swear I thought it was going to be in a head on collision because I was braking hard and laying on the horn but there was nowhere to go since the shoulder is non-existent. If it was you and you're reading this... you're a d\*ck). Yes, I saw some poor tourists in an Indie Camper who had drifted off the road into the shoulder (only slightly) and their van was about to tip over since the gravel adjacent to the road is soft. Yes there are sheep loose and wandering the roads and they are unpredictable. I drove around 93kph and we were regularly passed but it didn't bother me in the least. Use your right turn signal to tell the car behind that it is safe to pass, slow up a little to let them by, and they will likely hit their emergency flashers for a couple blinks to say thanks.

**PARKING -** Parking was pretty straight forward and I'd already downloaded the Parka app. But I found that parking for all the places we went was covered by 3 different types: Parka - vast majority, like 95%, of parking is paid through Parka to include some campsites. Get the app, register your vehicle as soon as you get there and you're good to go, Checkit.is - a few places we visited used checkit.is. There is usually a QR code you can scan to pay but you need to load in your credit card to yet another app, and EasyPark - I only remember Yoda cave using this but I might be wrong. Maybe one other?

**CLOTHES** \- We knew we would be doing laundry somewhere along the trip (brought detergent sheets) so tried to go light. Turns out, could have gone even lighter cause some things just never got worn. I'd still bring it but things I didn't use at all: puffer jacket once, never wore the base layer leggings (the fleece lined pants were plenty and even overkill because of the lucky weather), heavy gloves. My second pair of hiking shoes came in handy because they are much lighter but not waterproof and I didn't need waterproof much... again, weather. 8 underwear, 8 pairs socks, 4 wool T-Shirts (way too many), 2 set of base-layer wool leg, 2 long sleeve base-layer wool shirt, 1 fleece lined pants, 1 regular hiking pants, 1 fleece mid-layer, 1 puffer coat, 1 set waterproof raincoat & pants, 1 wool cap, 1 buff, 1 pair light gloves, 1 pair heavy gloves, 2 hiking boot/shoes, 1 pajama or sweat pants, 1 sleep shirt, 1 slip on shoes (good for heading to facilities at night without getting my boots on), 1 flip flops for baths/pools. A thought on shoes since lots of folks ask here. I had mid-height waterproof boots that I wore 98% of the time and low hiking shoes (not waterproof). My better half looked well in advance but had problems finding good waterproof boots that she like but settled on some anyway. Thing is, she would have been fine in the waterproof sneakers she likes, hiking boots were overkill. We didn't do any real *hiking*, mostly just walking on dirt trails that were very easy. Up to you what footwear you bring but consider how much actual hiking you're going to do vs just trail walking but absolutely have waterproof and some water will be deeper than your sneakers.

**NON-CLOTHING SUPPLIES -** I'll break this into two lists of stuff we didn't use and stuff that I'd never go without. We brought all this (yes overkill but we had plenty of van space and lots of check luggage allowance so why not)

Wouldn't go again without: Clothes Pins, dog poop bags for trash (very handy), small magnets (really helped to close the van curtains for privacy), magnetic hooks (very useful), clothes line, lots of travel tissues (cold makes my nose run), car phone mount (HappyCamper had one we could have gotten but I like mine), car usb charging plug (only because I needed a USB-A and the van only had one in the back otherwise all the van had was USB-C), chapstick, moisturizing lotion, sun screen, blister bandages (still ended up buying more in Husavik), lighted travel mirror (my better half used this every morning), towel for wiping inside van windows in morning (was nice to have an extra for this cause we needed it daily),

Would not bring next time: Binoculars (never used), reusable shopping bags (bought the piggy Bonus bag and love it), plastic bags for wet clothes (wasn't necessary really)

**OUR EXPERIENCE (CAUTION, FILLED WITH PERSONAL OPINION)**

May 9 (Keflavik --> Selfoss camp ground)

* Arrive Reykjavik 0945 - I don't have a problem sleeping on a plane and it was a 7hr flight so we hit the ground running once we arrived.
* Pick up Happy Camper - (shuttle provided, met us at arrivals, but were at least 45min late with no communication) - Saw Kuku campers and Go Campers pick up their people but we were still waiting and with no SIM card I emailed them cause that was the only way I had to connect (they never emailed back). Frustrating to say the least not knowing if they forgot, were busy elsewhere, or what. Checking out the camper, the employee was showing us around it, got to the water and said ""oh looks like it's empty so you'll get to learn how/where to fill it"" and left it at that, didn't show me where or how. Granted it isn't difficult but made me wonder, don't they check these things before renting them out? Were the dishes clean? Was the bedding washed? What else wasn't checked prior to giving to me. Bottom line, I saw more HappyCampers on the road than any other campers but myself, even with a returning customer discount, I'd look to another company before I go with Happy again. Just wasn't the best experience.
* Grocery shopping in Keflavik - There is a Bonus two blocks from HappyCamper around Keflavik that we went to. Suggestion is to have a plan before you go in. We didn't and it was a bit overwhelming at first. Ended up getting the mandatory Skyr, granola, fruit, bread, lunchmeat, and a few other snacks to round out a day. Skyr, granola, and fruit was a daily thing and I miss it. It just isn't the same now that I'm home. Sandwiches for lunches, pasta and easy meals for dinners.
* Fri√∞heimar tomato farm and restaurant (need rez in advance) - Made my reservation a month in advance for as late in the afternoon as I could. Glad I did because after everyting else and drive time, we had to head straight there THEN go see other sites and this was the first indication that timing was going to work out as intended. Place was busy. If you didn't have a res, you probs weren't getting a table. We walked straight in to our table and sat down. Restaurant is nice, food decent, the soup is much different than I'm used to and that was a good thing. I didn't get the reflux I typically do with tomato soup.
* Br√∫arfoss Waterfall (Parka 750ISK) - Good first stop after Fri√∞heimar. Short walk to the falls. Water is sooo blue and vibrant! Bonus fun was watching all the Chinese Instagrammers going through their poses with their man behind the camera. Not the last time we'd encounter this
* Geysir (Parka 1000ISK) - People seem to downplay this and I'm not sure why. Granted I've not been to Yellowstone but even if I had this place seemed to offer a good bit to look at and explore. Wasn't busy at all and we watched the geyser go off a few times while we played in the snow.
* Gullfoss Waterfall (Free or I just couldn't find the sign to pay) - There was almost nobody here. It was cold, so cold, could have been and glad it wasn't colder. The size and intensity of the falls takes you back a little. Was nice to have it almost to ourselves but the weather made for grey misty pics
* Selfoss camp ground ($47.60) - very basic campsite and nothing special, there were showers but I think you had to pay, and washer/dryers I think. We didn't explore the common areas much.

May 10 (Selfoss camp ground -->  Vik Camping)

* Gj√°in & H√°ifoss - I only now realize that Google took me on a wrong turn. We came at it from the East on 32 and Google had me turn off just after Sultartangavirkjun. Ultimately we could not reach from this minor un-numbered dirt road and would have needed 4x4 to cross small water area with steep banks. Other vehicles were turning around here too. Now I see that I needed to go further down 32 and turn off on 332. DAMN YOU GOOGLE!!! Long detour to not find our destination but that's on me for not checking more closely and verifying Google Maps. Sad we missed this. **Learn from my mistake and verify what Google is telling you**
* Seljalandfoss (Checkit.is 1000ISK) - you WILL get wet. It's pretty cool and pretty large and popular for a reason. Was fun and very crowded, there were I think 3 busses there plus the multitude of cars. Glad it wasn't the 'busy' season.
* Glj√∫frab√∫i - short walk down from Seljalandfoss, again you WILL get wet but it's totally worth it.
* Sk√≥gafoss (Parka 1000ISK) - Its huge! Great stop and great views. Took the stairs to the top and continued along the trail past Sk√≥gafoss for a ways. There are other waterfalls along the trail but we only went a couple kilometers.
* Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach (Parka 750ISK (parking log #2) or 1000ISK (closer lot)) - First lot you run into is Lot#2 which is cheaper, you can go to lot #1 if you want. Literally saw a couple Chinese tourist get soaked by sneaker wave but they made it out of the water. (I'm not going to say here what one local told us they call this beach). Very difficult to get a pic without some ass-hat sitting high on the columns just hanging out watching the people.
* Smi√∞jan Bruggh√∫s (brewery) - $85 for two burgers, 1 shared fries, 2 beers but it was really good
* Vik Camping (4300 ISK) - very large campground, lots of facilities, showers (don't recall if free or not), nice large common room with multiple stoves and sinks for cooking and such.

May 11  (Vik Camping  -->  Skaftafell Tjaldsvaedi camping)

* G√≠gjagj√° (aka Yoda cave) (EasyPark 1150ISK) - Fun little stop. Super long walk to the water/beach if you wanna go. I think I saw a red lounge chair out in the sand for no apparent reason but we didn't go investigate.
* Mossy Lava Fields - Didn't stop but looked pretty cool from road. Could see the moss for miles/kilometers
* Fja√∞r√°rglj√∫fur Canyon (Parka 1000ISK) - Canyon is just as cool as it looks. Short hike and super easy walking and fairly full of tourists like ourselves
* Svartifoss (2.5km 30min hike from campground) - Not sure how much parking is if not camping, we stayed here for the night. The hike is pretty easy and the falls themselves are really cool. Seemed to be a good number of people going well past the ropes to hang out on the rocks which makes for getting a pic without peeps in it difficult. Also drones in the no-fly zone took away from the scene. Jerks...
* Skaftafell tjaldsv√¶√∞i camping (don't recall the ISK - $42.99) - Free showers! Felt nice to get clean again, great view of glacier and mountains. Theres a few hikes you can take from the campsite to include Svartifoss and a glacier overlook.
* This was also the first day we got gas. We had fobs on the camper keys for N1 and others, but before leaving for the trip, I joined Orkan and had the Orkan card in my Apple Wallet that I'd scan before pumping gas. Change the screen to English (if necessary) and scan the Orkan card, get 12 ISK off per liter, no PIN, no hold on my credit card, just quick and easy. We used Orkan exclusively. You also get a free coffee at Orkan when you go in and scan your card :)

May 12  (Skaftafell tjaldsv√¶√∞i camping  -->  Fossardalur camp site)

* Glacial Discovery with Local Guide Glacier Hikes (\\\~4hrs): \[https://localguide.is/\](https://localguide.is/) ($167 per person) - Met at N1 Station 5 minutes drive from Skaftafell camping, received crampons, ice pick, helmet, harness then a short 4x4 ride to the foot of the glacier. Amazing time spent on the glacier and incredible views. Looked in lots of cracks and crevices, great photo ops, blue ice, good time. Our group was only 6 people, we saw other groups of at least a dozen. Smaller size felt more personal and we appreciated that. We dressed in many layers expecting cold but halfway through the hike, people had stripped down to just a t-shirt so bring a backpack to put your extra gear in. Also bring water and a snack or something. Also warnign, wear light gloves if you can. I slipped and put my hand down to catch myself and received lots of little cuts on my palm cause the ice is sharp. Or just don't slip like I did.
* Mulagljufur Canyon (Parka 1000) - Amazing views again! I read somewhere it's a 37min hike, yeah right! We spent 3 hrs hiking this cause we went to the very top which I suggest. Maybe if you just want that one view everyone takes a pic of (1st pic on Google Maps) then yes, maybe 37 minutes. We took our time, sat at the top for a while, took in the scenery. Good high vantage point to look out to coast and glacier lagoons.
* J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Glacier Lagoon (Parka 1040) - Very touristy for a reason. So many icebergs in the lagoon, and seals. Food trucks, small cafe, drinks etc.
* Diamond Beach (Free if you walk from Glacier Lagoon)- short walk under bridge from Glacier Lagoon. Lots of ice on the beach this day.
* Fossardalur camp site (5400 ISK) - Long drive to campground this day after spending 4+ hrs on glacier, 3 at Canyon, and another hour or more at glacier lagoon. Pretty small camp ground, free showers, nice very big common room, loved the scenery. Drive through East Fjords late in the evening was so pretty. We had the road to ourselves almost, didn't see another car going in either direction for almost an hour. Sad that we drove past some really cool things like Hofn and such but again, you can't see everything...
* This was the day the engine light came on in the van about half way to the next camp site. This is also the day I learned you have to have the WhatsApp number in your contacts (couldn't just dial directly) to call the 24hr emergency line HappyCamper gave me. Lesson learned. The light wasn't a big deal and went out in a day or two.

May 13  (Fossardalur camp site -->  Camp Egilssta√∞ir)

**DO NOT TAKE 95 OVER THE MOUNTAIN PASS UNLESS ABSOLUTELY SURE IT IS CLEAR AND WEATHER IS GOOD**

* Weather was clear, took so we took 939 to 95 over the mountain. Rough gravel road and somewhat scenic. If I was to do it again, I'd probably take 1 around East Fjords instead. Yes, longer drive but better road and probably more scenic.
* Hengifoss (& Litlanesfoss) (Checkit.is 1000ISK) - a food truck that looked interesting but we didn't try it. Hike is pretty simple
* Borgarfjar√∞arh√∂fn (Free parking) - Puffin view point really close up, puffins there in early morning or late afternoon/eve. We got there around 3:30PM and there were a few puffins around, but most were still out to sea. The drive to get here is really scenic and was nice. There's a live webcam \\\[http://myiceland.net/webcams/borgarfjordur\\\_eystri/\\\] you can look at to see if the Puffins are around before you go I guess. Along the way, we passed the Sj√°lfsali - Vending Machine on 94 and I wish I'd know what this was before we passed (could have stopped but didn't). Looked interesting, just a very small building on the side of the road with a guy sitting outside. Googled later and he's got a cool story. Can't see everything...
* Vok Baths (6990 ISK per person) - This was our first baths and not a bad one to start with. Yes, please shower naked, nobody cares about your nudity, really. Nice view of mountains and lake. Pretty relaxing overall. Not sure what we were expecting but the algae on the bottom took us off guard a little. I mean I get it for sure but didn't expect it for some reason. Spent a few hours here just relaxing, having a beer, cold plunging in the lake and just taking it all in. Having gone to Forest Lagoon, we agree we prefer Forest though.
* Camp Eglisstadir (5900 ISK) - Campround was pretty basic. Had lots of washer/dryers but did not use. Need to go into Parka and reserve a space, you don't just show up and pay, well you can but they will charge you more. Grabbed a pizza and a cpl beers from Askur pizzria this night, it was different from what we are used to and pretty decent.

May 14  (Camp Egilssta√∞ir -->  M√°n√°rbakki/Camping 66.12 North)

* Stu√∞lagil Canyon (Parka 1000) - We went to East side parking, bit of a walk to canyon but not difficult. West side parking is probably faster but you cannot get down into the canyon and can only look from high overlook platforms. This is where we saw an Indie Camper van who went too far to side of dirt road, got into the loose gravel on the 'shoulder' and was precariously about to tip over. Luckily people were there to try and help already. Be careful driving and stay on the road.
* Studlafoss - Small waterfall but still kinda cool that is right off the trail while walking to the Stu√∞lagil Canyon from East Side
* N√°mafjall Hverir Viewpoint (Parka 1200) - Geothermal area with pretty cool mud flats and bubbling pots of grey ooze. Looks like another planet and so different from anywhere else we'd been except maybe a little like Geysir area. Place stunk too, there were people gagging LOL
* Dettifoss West side (Free) - West side (862) is paved road, better drive but not as good of a view from what I understand. We didn't mind our view at all on West side. 864 is usually closed this time of year and showed closed on app but we saw busses taking the road from 1 and could see people on other side. May not have been fully open but could get to Dettifoss I guess?
* Selfoss - Short walk down a trail from Dettifoss. Seemed they roped off the trail and we couldn't get all that close but still a pretty cool waterfall.
* Hlj√≥√∞aklettar & The Lava Church -  Took 888 just a few kilometer North of Dettifoss. There were still some road closures which would have made the hike to Hlj√≥√∞aklettar & The Lava Church kinda long so we skipped it. However, the overlook area we stopped at looked brand new and was completely empty. Nice high viewpoint of Dettifoss and surrounding area. Very short drive from Dettifoss and worth a peek if you have 10 minutes to spare.
* √Åsbyrgi Canyon (Free cause it's a National Park) - This place doesn't get as much love in the sub as most stops but for us it was such a very cool canyon and very much worth a stop. Small forested area, nice lake at the end of the canyon, waterfall that wasn't flowing at the time. Nice peaceful walk through the trees and lots of short trails to check out. Really enjoyed this area, nice and peaceful. Seems this one isn't on most tourists itinerary which we appreciated because there was almost nobody around. Nice break
* M√°n√°rbakki/Camping 66.12 North (4000 ISK) - Pretty basic camp site really. It's located right on the water and the view of the sunset was amazing! This is also where I learned to say ""good evening"" instead of ""how are you"". First meeting went like this: Him ""Good evening""; Me ""How are you?""; Him ""Are you Canadian or American? Always with the 'how are you' 'how are you' 'how are you'""; Me ""I'm terribly sorry, what would you prefer?""; Him ""Just say good evening""; Me, smiling on the outside, LOL in the inside ""Good evening"" :)

May 15  (M√°n√°rbakki  -->  Camping Varmahl√≠√∞)

* Casual driving day and taking it slow, stopping at towns to browse and look around
* H√∫sav√≠k - Great early lunch at Salka Restaurant. Seriously, the food was really good! Walked up to Jaja Ding Dong H√∫sav√≠k but they were closed :(  Sad too cause they were having a Eurovision watch party but it didn't fit out timeline. Iceland was in the Eurovision finals while we were there so I thought that was super cool.
* I'd read in this sub that 84 was a nice drive so we took 84 around the mountain to Akureyri instead of going through the long tunnel since it was such a beautiful day. 15 more min drive time and the view was awesome looking down on Akureyri.
* Akureyri - Forest Lagoon (6900 ISK per person) - Yes, shower naked but there are private cubicals if you really need. Lounged here for hours. Better than Vok Baths in our opinion. They are also expanding. Not sure if they had this at Vok or not but theres a centrifugal spinner by the showers that you can put your suit in to 'dry'. It doesn't get it completely dry but gets most of the water out.
* Tr√∂llaskagi Peninsula (Troll Peninsula) via 82 to 76 around the top. The drive was pretty easy in my opinion (cause I was driving) but my better half may disagree. Winding road, not always best shape, couple of really long one way tunnels (this was new but very easy), and some steep grades coming down made her more nervous than should have been IMO. The views were spectacular! Very tall jagged mountains, small communities, just a lovely drive overall.
* M√≠gandifoss Viewpoint - No other place to stop and see this waterfall. Small waterfall that dumps directly into the ocean that I thought was really cool. Need a decent zoom to get a good pic tho. The turnoff from the road is pretty steep and I saw another vehcile slow up, looked, but continued on without stopping.
* Ap√≥tekarastofan in Bl√∂ndu√≥s - was a nice little shop with some really good desserts and a coffee. Lady running the place was very nice and her crafts for sale were great. We bought an Icelandic wool hat for my better half from her and she confirmed that my new hat I thought was Icelandic wool was in fact Norwegian wool but hand knitted by the Icelandic woman I bought it from. That was news to me, I thought it was 100% Icelandic. Other cool story, she said she was the person who got to push the plunger that completed the East to West sides of the long tunnel between Husavik and Akureyri. True or not it was a cool story from a really nice lady with great homemade desserts. Great stop
* Grafarkirkja (The Oldest Church in Iceland) (Free) - Saw a sign and stopped on a whim. Couldn't go inside but it was pretty cool for a quick stop.
* Camping Varmahl√≠√∞ (5000 ISK) - Seemed steep comparatively speaking with other sites. Again, pretty basic. They had just opened the day prior. Very small common area. Bonus tho.. Bounce Pillow!! I know this is for the kids but we had to try it before we left and we were laughing like little kids by the time we quit. So fun LOL

May 16  (Camping Varmahl√≠√∞  -->  Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur)

* Reykjafoss (1500ISK or $10 or something Euro donation for parking) - This is private property. The falls were nice. Seen a BUNCH of falls by this point so wasn't all that spetacular, but still a cool fall nonetheless. The real bonus was the hotspring, Fosslaug - hot spring at the top of the falls that will fit 6 - 8 people I guess. There is no changing area so plan accordingly or show your bits to the world. We wore suits under our clothes and walked there in flip flops. Really nice to lounge and just enjoy the scenery. Met and chatted with a really nice couple from Poland. Water bubbling out of the rocks between Fosslaug and the river is VERY hot, don't touch (I did and yikes). Yes, I'm that guy.
* √ûr√≠stapar (Free) - This was another on the whim type stop without knowing what it was but we saw a marker and decided to stop. It's the site of Iceland's last execution. Grim story, there's a QR code with audio guide as you go around the site that will tell you all about the story.
* Koluglj√∫fur Canyon (Free) - pretty cool spot. Lots of good photo ops.
* Selvallafoss (Free) - Small waterfall right off of 56 that you can walk behind and get far less wet than Seljalandfoss. I really liked it and we had fun here.
* Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur campgound (2800 ISK) - worst campground we stayed at with HappyCamper campground a close second. Only had a very small section open so it got crowded early. Water in mens room had be be turned on/off when you wanted to use the sink cause I think something was broken. Very small bathrooms. Kitchen area is non-existent but there are two outdoor sinks for doing dishes

May 17  (Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur -->  Campsite √ìlafsv√≠k)

* Did a drive by of Kirkjufell and snapped a pic without stopping. We saw this all eve the day before so weren't compelled to stop. Besided, I've seen so many pics of this and my son sent me his pic from 2022 and his looked just like every other pic I've ever seen of it.
* B√∫landsh√∂f√∞i View Point (Free) - Overlooks the ocean. Stopped to look for whales, didn't see any.... yet
* Murals of Hellissandur (Free) - Walked around checking these out. Pretty cool in my opinion. There are quite a few so don't just take a quick stop and move along. Look around. But there's not much else here but we did see a small coffee shop we didn't stop at.
* √çrskrabrunnur (Free) - Just an old empty well with a whale bone on top for no apparent reason. Not overly interesting but makes a cool Stranger Things type pic that makes everyone say ""WHAT is THAT??""
* Skar√∞sv√≠k Beach (Free) - Stopped here to make some lunch and chill a bit. Nice little beach area and just watched the waves for a bit. Very enjoyable
* √ñndver√∞arnesviti Lighthouse - lighthouse itself isn't all that interesting to me but the surrounding area was interesting. Lot of remains of older buildings and an old well. Highlight was we were able to watch Orcas from the shore feeding in the bay. Stayed here a while just watching the whales and enjoying the ever present Icelandic sun and warm weather.
* Sv√∂rtuloft Lighthouse - Too close already to not check it out since it's really close to √ñndver√∞arnesviti Lighthouse. Was a nice cliffs area and cool views of Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull Glacier in the distance.
* Saxh√≥ll Crater (Donations appreciated) - I may be in the minority but what can I say here... it's a crater. 384 steps on a very wide staircase to the top. Was super windy up there but I left unimpressed, don't hate me.
* Dj√∫pal√≥nssandur Beach (Free) - The sound the water makes when the waves are receeding is sooo cool. The ""beach"" is actually small round rocks, not sand. The fishing trawler remains were literally just some old rusted pieces scattered on the beach that are unrecognizable and as anything without a sign telling you what they are. Stone lifting game if you want to try.
* Campsite √ìlafsv√≠k (4000 ISK) - Guy comes around at night and again the morning to collect for camping. Not a bad campsite overall. Love the little town. This was the night we encountered a multi-family caravan in multiple RV's who who camped here and took over the entire common area. Managed to get a shower but there is only one for M or F (woman came out of the M showers). Waterfall you can hike to if you're up for it (we'd seen so many by this point were just shrugged it off)

May 18  (Campsite √ìlafsv√≠k  -->  HappyCampers campsite)

* Vatnshellir Cave (5400ISK/person) - We stopped on yet aother whim and a tour was leaving in 5 minutes so we joined them. Best lava cave I've ever been in  :)  Guide was super knowledgable and it was a nice tour overall.
* L√≥ndrangar Parking-arctic fox (Free) - Didn't see any foxes but the view was pretty amazing (I feel like I'm overusing 'amazing')
* S√∂nghellir Cave - Had it on our list but realized it's a mix of three digit road and F road. Didn't have 4x4 and didn't feel like a long hike given we had a 2 wheel drive mini-bus/camper but we'd already seen the 'best' cave anyway
* Arnarstapi (B√°r√∞ur Sn√¶fells√°s Statue, Gatklettur, M√∫sagj√°) (Free) - This was a super hot day and we wished we had shorts. Saw people with shorts, tanks tops, and flops in Iceland! Had ice cream across the street from main parking lot. Not what we expected as it was just vanilla soft serve with some flavored sauce dripped across top. Not terrible but.... We spent a good amout of time here just wandering and looking at all the cliffs and such.
* Rau√∞feldsgj√° Gorge (Free) - This was nice. Make sure you have waterproof shoes or that you don't care, you will get wet if you wanna go to the end. The end for me was at the short waterfall that I didn't want to climb up. Not sure how far back you can go. Also recommend some light gloves if you have them, the sides of the gorge are sharp and we are whimps and I still had cuts from the glacier hike
* Bu√∞ir black church - Had to check it out cause why not, I've seen hundreds of photos. Yep, it's still a church and it's black. Not trying to down play it and got the pic.
* Bjarnarfoss (Free) - Last waterfall we took in. Climbed waaay to as high as we could, trecherous climb, be careful. But the view is... amazing
* Ytri Tunga (parking via \[Checkit.is\](http://Checkit.is) 900 ISK) - It's a long walk across large round stones (think ocean jetty) to get to the point to see the seals. Yep, they're seals... lounging, scratching, looking at you looking at them, more scratching, see one in the water swimming, .... repeat. We sat and drank a Thule (wish I knew Gull was better) we had picked up at a Bonus for super cheap if I remember correctly. Not a great beer and very little alcohol if that's what you're looking for, but I've been drinking NA beer lately anyway so this was just fine. So sitting on the rocks, watching seals scratch themselves while drinking a crappy beer on a warm day was a great way to almost end our trip.
* Ger√∞uberg Cliffs - Could have easily stopped but missed this and a little bummed we did. We were thinking of Reykjavik at this point.
* On our way back to HappyCampers, we took a short detour to Blue Lagoon just to check it out. Kinda cool seeing all the new lava and the old road with fresh lava on it. But don't be a looky-loo like us...
* HappyCampers campsite (4200 but we paid 3060ISK with discount code HAPPY) - Got a 'discount' reserving through the app and using code HAPPY as a HappyCamper renter. Close second for worst campsite and it felt weird to stay there then in the morning literally drive around the corner to turn in the camper. As a rental of campers, I'd expected a little better campsite. Run down, dirty, no common room. Just not what I'd expect.

May 19  (Reykjavik)

* Flyover Iceland ($77 for us both) - This was a good way to end the trip. The ride is very similar to Soarin if you've ever been to Epcot at Disney. Wrap around screen, hitting you with mist, your seat moves while you're 'flying' on the screen. Was fun to see how many of the sites we'd seen in person. A little pricey for the short ride but it was fun.
* Bolt and Hopp scooters - I had a Bolt account from my trip to the Baltics so it was easy to rent the two scooters. Took these down to Flyover Iceland as it's a pretty decent walk. There's a bus you could take but scooters are more fun. Cost around $20 for two scooters to/from Flyover and back to around our hotel area.
* Sk√≥lav√∂r√∞ust√≠gur Rainbow Street - just as you'd expect and have seen 100 times. Still snapped a pic tho, it's the law (I think)
* The Icelandic Phallological Museum  - Yes, we did the penis museum. It's full of penises and giggling girls. If you are a late teen girl, maybe this isn't for you, not judging, just sayin you might not be mature enough to 'handle it' LOL
* Bastard Brew & Food - decent food, nothing special
* Lebowski bar - decent food, nothing special
* K√≠k√≠ Queer Bar - very small place but they had a happy hour and we are suckers for a happy hour
* Kaldi Bar/Caf√© - had a picture worthy gin drink here that was amazingly tasty. Bartenders were actually Icelanders!
* The Old Bookstore in Reykjav√≠k - wish we found this place earlier. It was rocking with live music and packed! I'd put this as the top recommendation for a spot to grab a drink and chill. Check what time the band starts and head there early to get a seat.
* The Irishman Pub - seemed like a decent place, can't vouch for the food. There was a guy playing guitar until we left around midnight",4,1749074120.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

1l3i7v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l3i7v3/i_need_some_help/,I need some help...,"Hi. I've been married for 15 years now and we were happy. We struggled to conceive, but finally we had a beautiful baby who is turning 2yo soon.
I suffered from depression for many years but I always managed to work and have a normal life. 
When covid hit, my daddy was diagnosed with cancer (64y) . I was living abroad but I left almost all behind to support him and my mom for almost a year and half. My husband was very supportive all along and we managed to concile our time together ( at least once every 3 weeks.)
In that time I was so confused and sad to see my daddy loosing his life  and losing his battle...he only lived 8 months post diagnosis.
A few months after my daddy passed, I discovered that my husband was using heavy drugs. I always thought something wasn't quite right all those years spent together but I was too busy struggling with my mental health and my father's disease to see that. He confessed and I was in total shock. Mostly because he is a fighter, he works really hard, we live comfortably. Not the kind of addict I used to know ( or thought I knew).
Well, he is an occasional consumer ( opioids) he manage to control himself and that's really good and then take pills to deal with the addiction. Since I got pregnant he stopped consuming and I really know it's true . It's been almost 3 years and apparently he manage to deal with that. But... Since our child is born, his behaviour towards me changed in a level I couldn't never imagine. I stopped working to be a full time mummy ( not by real choice, but I really want to be with my baby and my husband refuses to leave the baby with anyone else. Even my family or his family. Not even for few hours. 
I spent all my days alone with my baby, that's not bad, I love to spent time with him but since I gave birth I can't even visit my mom with my husband being a total jerk. I feel like I'm being held hostage in my own house and life. If I want to go to the grocery shop, or even have a coffee with a friend I must do it quickly and I need to justify every move I make. Sometimes I just need to spend 1 hour alone, but it's impossible because my role as a mother is to take care of my baby. He's a very lovely father to our baby, but I feel like I'm always doing things wrong...
I have lower self esteem, I feel invisible... 
He works, I don't work but I have a paycheck too ( maternity leave ) . I do all the chores in the house ( it's normal, I'm a stay at home mum. I do laundry, groceries, paperwork but it seems that's not enough. We have an olive tree planting and there's a lot of work to do there but I don't have the energy to that after all week with the baby 24h/7. Sometimes I would like to leave the baby with someone I really trust ( my mum, my sisters, even my niece who's 25yo and very responsible) . Just to be able to breath a little. 
My husband became a narcissist And a controller. ( Im sorry, but English is not my native language) . He's always in a bad mood and very defensive in every way. Seems like he is competing with me. I tried to talk to him about it, but he says I don't see the world the way he does ( like his vision of the world was the best one) I suffer from this situation. I feel really tired and I really need a break. 
I see a therapist since 2016 and he helps me a lot, but I fell so low in the ground that I don't have energy to fix it. My husband thinks he's right all the time and that I'm overthinking and I don't have to because he provides me and our son a comfortable life. He's the money maker, the only one who does sacrifices and I'm just a mum who's supposed to be just a mum. 
He doesn't seem to see that I work a full time job since our baby is born. He helps with the baby, but.. come on. He's his father too. 
I love my husband and I know he loves me but right now I started to emotionally detacheded from him. I'm just happy when he needs to leave for work for a few days. I feel free. 
Sorry for the long post. He's a nice person but right now I almost hate him .",1,1749073915.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

During the first months of our relationship we were living in two different cities five hours away from each other. We were able to see each others only during the weekends. 

We both got tired of the distance, so we decided to move in together, and she officially moved with me a month ago. I love living with her, she is an amazing person to share my 'spaces' with. But, after a month living together, i couldn't help myself but notice her eating habits. Bad, really bad eating habits.

She doesn't do any sports - which, i don't see any problems with it - but it's the way she eats that bothers me. She will start the day by eating two heart krapfens and a cappuccino. Then she will go out, and in her way to work she will have a second breakfast. Another croissant and cappuccino. She always eat biscuits and Nutella after lunch as a sweet. Or cakes. Then she have a go√ªter around 17:00, another latte and coffee and sweets. Then dinner - she always goes for wraps, pastas, or heavy plates - and ANOTHER sweets before bed. She isn't fat, but even tho, eating all this sweets is bad.

Three days ago, we were both home. She was watching a series while i was reading some work papers. After a while I could see her stand up and walk to grab a pack of biscuits. At that, i couldn't stop myself and i commented. I told her that she should stop eating all that sugar or she will get fat. She clearly didn't expect my comment, and i get that i used a bad tone, but i didn't have any bad intentions.

I tried to explain myself, and tell her that eating like that isn't good, but it felt like talking to a wall. She captured just one word 'fat'. She got pissed at me, and told me to mind my business, and she is still now sulking at me. But I said what i said out of concern.

She was everything to me. We had been thru a lot of turmoil together, many moves, but also many joyous times.
I'm a total mess today and can't seem to pull myself back together again. I've been trying to do work but after today I think I'll be taking this day off from now on.

It's crazy how hard her death hits me some years.
I wish for the cat distribution system to deem me worthy of another kitten so I can heal a little. Obviously nothing can replace her, but I need a little fluff I can smother with love. I won't adopt or go buy one as I've done than and it didn't turn out well.

The way Katja came into my life was very random and pure chance. I heard her mewing from under an office trailer inside the flooring. When I actually located her by crawling underneath, she was the only kitten there. It was late at night and figured mom was out hunting, so I left her outside very close to where I extracted her and I moved very far away to not scare off mom for when she comes back. Well over an hour later and with the kitten constant mewing, I couldn't bare it anymore. Maybe I stole her from her mom or maybe I saved her. Regardless she was now my responsibility and I couldn't have been happier. 
She was tiny, could almost fit in my shirt pocket. I spent the next couple of weeks bottle feeding her every 3-4hrs. I was mom from then on. Anywhere I went she was always 10 steps behind.
I always tried to be a good cat mom, some try to say dad but the bottle feeding made me mom. Every place I lived was somewhere she would be safe and accepted. Wife and I bought a new home last year.. I hate that Katja never got the chance to enjoy it. She would have ruled the neighborhood ü•∞

I had to write something down. It helps some and I want to honor her however I can. Crying has given me a hell of a headache. I can go on forever but Thank you if you read all this.

[TLDR: grab some tea or coffee.]","Ok, so these last few weeks, I happened to stumble upon a lot of TVXQ content, along with discussions about sasaengs, especially in relation to NCT. With TVXQ in particular, I fell into a rabbit hole. The more I read about them, and about NCT and EXO, later on, the more I saw fans asking the same question:¬†**Why the hell does SM still not do anything about stalkers and obsessive fans?**

And even though there was always the obvious and correct answer of ""Honey, SM wants the money and they don't care about the idols. Of course, they‚Äôre not gonna do anything,"" I think there‚Äôs more to it, and it‚Äôs not talked about enough.

It‚Äôs not just that SM ignores terrible and downright dangerous fans, it‚Äôs that they go out of their way to cultivate them. And¬†**the biggest reason why is TVXQ and their success**. I know to Cassies (TVXQ fans), what I‚Äôm saying is nothing new. But even inside the fandom, I really believe it‚Äôs not talked about enough just how much SM wants this kind of environment for their groups, and how much they actually put their hand in making it happen.

# TVXQ's Shippers & Sasaengs: The ""Unexpected"" Goldmine.

For the uninitiated, TVXQ debuted as a 5-member boy group in 2003 under SM.

* [**Junsu**](https://imgur.com/a/qqsoJZq)
* [**Yoochun**](https://imgur.com/a/HBUlXya)¬†(as you can see, the dude is not a good guy and has done some messed up stuff that includes heavy drugs, not weed, as well as way too many SA allegations)
* [**Jaejoong**](https://imgur.com/a/BxHCVTp)
* [**Changmin**](https://imgur.com/a/sj9Uqlk)
* [**Yunho**](https://imgur.com/a/oXFDHdF)

I‚Äôm not gonna get into much info on names, nicknames, and stuff, because I‚Äôm not an expert, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think it matters for this specific post. What does matter is that the group debuted during a tough time for the industry and the economy, and SM did everything to create a group people would love and give money to. And they stumbled upon a goldmine.

The TVXQ members not only were, and still are, extremely talented; they were also very good-looking. So much so that¬†[Jaejoong](https://gr.pinterest.com/pin/204069426871071304/), like SNSD‚Äôs Yoona, set the standard for male visuals. A visual member with incredibly strong vocals to match, looks that, to this day, SM keeps trying to recreate (~~SM is more obsessed with Jaejoong than most Cassies lol)~~. The rest of the members similarly had a huge number of fans; some were even more popular than Jaejoong domestically. But undeniably, especially in Japan, where they were HUGE, the man was¬†*the*¬†IT boy.

The group as a whole has, hands down, some of the worst stories and interactions with sasaengs and antis I‚Äôve ever come across in K-pop.

* We‚Äôre talking about breaking into their homes and other living spaces, photographing them while they were asleep¬†**on their beds**, imagine waking up and seeing a random person just¬†*watching*¬†you.
* An anti gave Yunho juice spiked with glue, which sent him to the hospital.
* They were stalked and followed¬†*everywhere*.
* People found out their addresses, rented or bought houses next to them, and would ring their doorbells constantly, the list goes on.

**Extreme, consistent harassment of the members, with many incidents being flat-out dangerous, and yet the company never took any real action against it.**¬†Because they knew that these fans give away a ridiculous amount of money. Even the Yunho incident, from SM‚Äôs perspective, just made the fans more protective and more obsessed with the boys.

And not only did they never protect the members, their privacy, or even their safety, but they also took notes for their future groups. But I will talk about it in a moment.

**For me, though, there‚Äôs another group of fans SM pretty much made sure to keep at all costs, fans that can be just as toxic and obsessive, and who are often kind of ignored: shippers.**

From very early on, the group had its first major ship: YunJae, the ship between JaeJoong and Yunho. And SM exploited it¬†*so well*¬†and to such a huge extent that they basically made skinship and fanservice from idols a norm in K-pop.

The two idols were close in age and were¬†[friendly and close](https://media.tenor.com/rlRCGubqs8gAAAAM/angai313-yunjae.gif)¬†with each other when TVXQ was debuting. There was never any awkwardness between them, something fans picked up on pretty quickly, and in general were touchy-feely. And of course, the ship started to sail.

What‚Äôs crazy, though, is what happened¬†*after*. As TVXQ became increasingly popular, YunJae became a well-known ship in K-pop. Shipping in K-pop wasn‚Äôt unheard of, of course, but as I was looking around, I honestly never saw a company react so openly and intentionally to a ship like SM did.

Read this¬†[two-part post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/16z08tx/kpop_the_divorce_of_the_century_the_rise_and_fall/), OMG, it‚Äôs excellent and hilarious, but I‚Äôll also put a summary of what SM actually¬†*did*¬†with that information, for people who don‚Äôt have time or just don‚Äôt want to read the whole thing right now.

**In 2006, SM hosted a competition to find the best TVXQ fanfiction. The winner would get 1 million won, the possibility for the fanfiction to become a drama, and a date with TVXQ.**

When I tell you I¬†*lost my shit*¬†when I first heard about that, I cannot even describe it. This is INSANE. You have a group that‚Äôs being stalked constantly, and in¬†*2006*, there was even an attempted assassination via poisoned juice aimed at the leader of the group, and you think it‚Äôs a good idea to plan a¬†*date*¬†with a fan who writes fanfiction about them??

**WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.**

We actually do not know how that went, but what is known and pretty clear is the fact that SM noted how much shipping and especially this specific ship was bringing in fans and attention.

**And SM promoted this ship to NATIONAL TELEVISION**.

As the post I mentioned previously explains brilliantly:

>Dangerous Love is an episode of the series¬†[*Banjun Drama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjun_Drama?useskin=vector),or¬†*Reverse Drama*¬†in English. Each episode of¬†*Banjun Drama*¬†was a stand alone mini-drama episode, with celebrity guests invited on to, as Wikipedia put it, ""...act in a very humorous and sarcastic way not seen in regular dramas."" Think of each episode as if an SNL skit and a Kdrama had a child, and you're on the right path. You can probably tell where this is going---TVXQ were the celebrity guests on an episode, and that episode was¬†*Dangerous Love*.

In fact, I will quote the whole part because the explanation is superb.

>To understand why we care about¬†*Dangerous Love*, we need to watch¬†*Dangerous Love*.¬†[Dangerous Love is best experienced in its original 480p resolution](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4dwo5w). But for those of you who don't want to watch a 45 minute long episode in Korean, I'll try to sum up the plot:

>Yunho shows Jaejoong gay fanfiction of the two of them (*Dangerous Love*¬†has TVXQ acting as themselves). Jaejoong reads the gay fanfiction. Jaejoong imagines himself and Yunho as he reads the gay fanfiction. If you watch a single thing from¬†*Dangerous Love*,¬†[watch this](https://youtu.be/jiP2_rZ1TeI?si=Qj3kDH0-g8Te8o0A&t=151). Afterwards, Yunho starts being weirdly nice to Jaejoong, convincing Jaejoong that Yunho is gay for him. The rest of the episode consists of Yunho being nice while Jaejoong is unable to think of anything but him and Yunho being gay together. Sexy music plays every time they interact from now on.

>Yunho tells Jaejoong that he needs to confess something to him. Jaejoong cuts him off, tells him he understands his feelings, and then gives him the world's least intimate hug. This confuses Yunho, because he is not in fact gay for Jaejoong. He's been acting nice because he broke Jaejoong's new camera. Jaejoong cusses him out, chases him around, everyone laughs, and the episode ends with no actual gay wrongs having been committed. That's¬†*Dangerous Love*.

>This would be insane to film and air anywhere in South Korea in 2006, but just to make sure we are all on the same page about how absurd this is, I need to clarify that¬†*Dangerous Love*¬†aired on¬†*national television*. On a Sunday morning, in a timeslot that was consistently the #1 most watched program on Sundays in the nation.¬†*Dangerous Love*¬†aired to¬†[13.8% viewership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Sunday?useskin=vector#2006). Millions of people, moms, dads, grandparents, watched this gay episode when it aired on TV.

**This is UNHINGED. This is absolutely insane behavior.**

Fans today talk about the exploitation of queer relationships in KPOP, right now Irene and Seulgi, who, undeniably, have a much more tasteful approach, are the hot topic, and meanwhile, in 2006, SM was doing this.

The skinship and fanservice between the two members also seemed to ramp up more from that point on, by the way. Both the post I mentioned and various videos and forum conversations suggest that SM probably¬†*told*¬†them to turn it up a few notches, actually. I‚Äôd even say that might‚Äôve been the point where other companies started actively cashing in on shippers, too. And now it‚Äôs just become such a norm. Maybe there were other instances previously, but they were not THAT popular. Yunjae popularized this. And the more I think about it, the crazier it is, because¬†**imagine Simon Cowell actively promoting Larry**.

# The ""Unfortunate"" legacy of TVXQ

It‚Äôs undeniable that TVXQ has been one of the biggest, most important, and legendary groups in K-pop. The legacy they‚Äôve left, and what they‚Äôve done for the industry, and most importantly, for other idols, is probably some of the most significant change we‚Äôve seen.

Because of the members of TVXQ, slave contracts stopped being so exploitative in K-pop. They went up against a¬†*colossus*¬†of the industry. They got blacklisted, they lost fans, they lost money, and still, in the case of Junsu and Jaejoong, they came out on top, no matter all the shit SM put them through.

Their talents have inspired so many newer idols. But TVXQ was also living proof to SM¬†*(and to an extent to other companies, because for years others were pretty much following SM's lead)*¬†that toxic fans, solos, antis, sasaengs, shippers, you name it, aren‚Äôt a liability. They‚Äôre an¬†*asset*.

EXO had so many sasaengs and shippers because SM marketed them as yet another talented, funny, hot-membered boy group, same with SHINee and NCT. And it‚Äôs not just the boy groups. SNSD, f(x), Red Velvet, and aespa, same story.

When the stalkers and crazy fans started to show themselves, SM protects the sasaengs, not their idols. They rarely take legal action. They didn‚Äôt take legal action against the girl who tried to poison Yunho. They didn‚Äôt do anything about the guy who went on stage and¬†*grabbed*¬†Taeyeon. They didn‚Äôt do anything about sasaengs invading hotel rooms, houses, and other private spaces of multiple groups.

They didn‚Äôt care about the bullying and threats Sulli was getting, because all of it gave traction to the groups.

Isn‚Äôt it funny how some of the most¬†*batshit crazy*¬†stuff happens to SM groups, and in the end, we see:  
‚Äú\[Insert Idol\] didn‚Äôt want to ruin this person‚Äôs life, so no legal action was taken.‚Äù

The amount of comments I‚Äôve seen saying things like, ‚ÄúOh, Yunho is just really polite, I would sue,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTaeyeon is so soft,‚Äù or ‚ÄúJaejoong is so kindhearted.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt buy that¬†*all*¬†these idols are¬†*sooooo*¬†good-hearted that they¬†*never*¬†ask for legal action against people who tried to¬†*kidnap*¬†them, broke into their¬†*homes*, or literally¬†*TRIED TO KILL THEM*.

SM was hosting fanfic competitions where the literal¬†*prize*¬†was a date with the boys of TVXQ. They‚Äôre planning NCT concerts with ticket bundles that include transport¬†*and*¬†rooms in the¬†*same hotel*¬†as the members. They have aespa performing in boys‚Äô schools.

And the list goes on, and on, and on.

Everyone hates SM, yet everyone loves their groups, and I‚Äôve come to the sad realization that most likely, nothing is going to change. They will never protect their idols.

The only chance,¬†*and I mean a small chance*, for change is if the fans who do have issues with this stop financially supporting them when something crazy happens again and SM tries to brush it under the rug¬†*again*.

But even then... the crazies (bc they are) are a huge part of the group's success, and fans will always feel bad for the members if boycotting ends up hurting them. Which is¬†*completely normal*, it‚Äôs¬†*not*¬†the idols‚Äô fault. They're already dealing with a shitty company¬†*and*¬†stalkers.

But it‚Äôs just so exhausting to keep watching the cycle. We all know SM doesn‚Äôt do anything about these types of fans. But the more I look into their groups, sasaengs, and how the company handles things, the more I start to think they actively want these things to happen.

They never take action against these people, so what message does that send to the crazies?¬†*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, nothing will happen.‚Äù*

The idols‚Äô security seems non-existent, especially considering how often these things happen, and how often they happen to specific groups. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs a deliberate decision too.

**All in all, fuck SM.**

They have an unfortunately sharp eye for talent, talent they¬†*continually*¬†fail.",16,1749073454.0,kpop_uncensored,3,0.86,False

I start my tamoxifen tomorrow. I feel so lucky to have had such kind drs and techs helping me fight my disease. Partial mastectomy was pretty easy. I almost opted for no chemo because of other health issues but I am so glad I did it. For the most part the effects were manageable. I took the medication they gave me, drank tons of water and rested a lot and by day 8 I was feeling pretty much back to normal. The worst part for me were the sores in my mouth, headaches and dry eyes. Very little nausea. My 3rd chemo infusion almost killed me but only because I got Influenza A 3 days after treatment. Very high fevers (104), sick everywhere and every which way. But I was able to get my 4th albeit 2 weeks late. My radiation started a month later where I received 15 reg treatments and 5 boost. I only live about 2 miles from the treatment center, and I had the first slot of the day, so I was back home sitting in my favorite chair, drinking coffee, in about a half an hour almost each day.  I used the cream they gave me like instructed but still did get the blisters but with another prescription cream, they were much less itchy and eased the burn. I have RA and unfortunately when my immune system came back to life, it has been kicking my ass ever since. I hope these symptoms will subside. But that is a topic for another board.

1l3hw49,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1l3hw49/that_face_continuation/,That face (continuation),"A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me. *Those* Daniel's eyes. I spoke of code efficiency, while my own mind was an indecipherable chaos. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

""A true cryptographer doesn't just decipher the code,"" I said, my voice rising a little higher than normal, ""they *feel* the logic, they *breathe* it. Where is that spark? Have you become mere automatons repeating what you're taught?"" I stared fixedly at Daniel, looking for a reaction.

His face remained expressionless, like a porcelain mask. ""Dr. R√≠os, emotional fervor is not a requirement for mathematical effectiveness,"" Daniel replied in a voice that was too calm, too perfect.

It was the last straw. My mind, which had resisted madness for weeks, broke in that instant. This impostor, this being who dared to imitate *my* Daniel, was challenging me, denying his own essence.

""You're not him!"" I screamed, my voice echoing in the stunned silence of the classroom. My hand slammed against the desk, sending papers and the pen flying. The graphic tablet fell to the floor with a dull thud. ""You're not Daniel! I don't know who you are, but you're not him!""

Heads turned. Murmurs erupted like a swarm of bees. Dozens of eyes, between confusion and fear, stared at me. I saw my students, other professors passing in the hallway, stop, their faces reflecting the same question: *Has Dr. R√≠os lost her mind?*

Suddenly, the fury dissipated, replaced by a cold, lacerating knowledge. It was me. *I* was the one who screamed. The one who lost control. The one who looked like a lunatic. The impostor... he remained as serene, as perfect as ever. Defeat struck me with the force of lightning. I had crumbled, and he had witnessed it.

Without another word, I clumsily gathered my bag, stumbling over a chair. I had to leave. I had to get away from those eyes, from that room full of accusing stares. I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me. His touch, again, that contact that was identical but felt so... false.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look. I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drop me off and pick me up from work, and my car was in the shop. I needed to get home. I needed my sanctuary. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real?

The ride to my apartment was agony. My head wouldn't stop processing, searching for logic in the chaos. I reached my door, flung it open, and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency overwhelmed me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of his closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A secret note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was.

But David wasn't in the apartment. It was almost three in the afternoon. He would be at work. What exactly was I looking for? My mind screamed in silence. I needed the impostor to tell me where he was. But he wasn't here. And I, only I, was completely alone with the hell in my own head.

A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me... those Daniel's eyes. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drive me to and from work, but I needed to get home. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real? The ride to my apartment was agony. I reached my door, flung it open and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency invaded me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of the closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was. David wasn't in the apartment... it was almost three in the afternoon, so he would be at work. What exactly was I looking for?

Time faded in the urgency of my search. Finally, my gaze fell on the old wooden trunk that David had brought when he decided to stay and take care of me. It was his grandmother's, full of memories, and I had always considered it his personal treasure chest, something I respected and had never rummaged through. But now, privacy was a luxury I couldn't afford. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk. Inside, among old photo albums and yellowed letters, my fingers stumbled upon something hard. A notebook. It wasn't just any notebook. It was the small leather agenda David carried everywhere. The same one he used to jot down his ideas, his to-do lists, even small sketches. He never left it out in the open. He always kept it in an inside jacket pocket, or on his nightstand. How had I not noticed it was here, so exposed?

My hands trembled as I opened it. The first pages were grocery lists, meeting scribbles. Then, a series of dates and names I didn't recognize. But further on, on a page near the end, I found what I was looking for. A pattern. They weren't words, or codes, or hidden messages. They were a series of numbers, dates, and times, followed by brief descriptions:

""Samanta visit - OK"" ""Daniel coffee - No anomalies"" ""Call Samanta's mother - High concern""

And what chilled me to the bone:

""Table test (Monday) - No reaction"" ""Anecdote question (Tuesday) - Success"" ""Thesis (Wednesday) - All in order.""

It was a record. A logbook of my interactions with the impostor. Of my ""tests."" It was as if this being was monitoring my behavior, evaluating his own performance... assessing how convincing he was being, his success rate. I imagined this impostor making nocturnal reflections and considering which parts of his act he needed to refine. Rage boiled in me, but beneath it, a chilling terror spread. Not only was he an impostor, he was a methodical observer, a being who analyzed my paranoia and adjusted his facade.

My heart pounded so hard it resonated in my ears. The trunk, the things scattered across the floor... they didn't matter. The proof was there, in my hands. It was undeniable. This notebook was confirmation that the David with me was not my David. It was something far more sinister. A knock on the door. Then, the sound of a key turning.

David.

The seconds stretched. I dragged myself, the notebook clutched to my chest, to the darkest corner of my room. I curled up, knees drawn to my chest, feeling the cold of the wall against my back. I heard his footsteps in the living room, the rustle of the things I had thrown.

""Samanta? I'm here! Samanta!"" His voice, so familiar, but now laden with a concern that sounded like a sham.

I heard him enter the kitchen, then the bathroom. The footsteps approached my room. I didn't move, didn't breathe. The notebook was my shield and my weapon. This was the evidence. I was going to unmask him, no, I had to, and I had to know where my David was. The real one. The door to my room slowly opened. The hallway light spilled over the mess I had created. David stopped in the doorway, his face pale and his eyes wide with surprise at seeing the chaos.

""Samanta... What happened here? Are you okay?""

His gaze swept over the mess, then stopped on me, huddled in the corner. His face showed pure concern, the same face I had loved for years, but which now felt like a chilling mask. He didn't know I had the proof, and I was going to force him to confess.

""What do you want?"" I snapped, my voice harsh, charged with a fury I could barely contain. I stood up slowly, my muscles stiff, my eyes fixed on his.

He took a step towards me, hands raised in a reassuring gesture. ""I've been calling you, Sam. The university called your mom, she said you weren't well. They told me what happened in your class. I apologized for you, Sam, they... they're worried. *I'm* worried. You shouldn't have come back so soon, Sam. The doctors told you to relax.""

His words, so calm, so rational, only fueled my anger. Relax? After what I had seen? After what I knew? Apologize for me? Humiliation mixed with terror. This impostor was trying to control me, to cover up the truth with a pretense of concern.

""Worried?"" I let out a hollow laugh, full of bitterness. ""Sure, 'worried.' Do you know what we're talking about?""

He stopped. His gaze was confused, but I no longer believed him. ""Samanta, I know this is stress. What's happening to you is... It's a lot. We've talked to the dean, to some professors. Everyone understands that you need a break, away from everything. We've decided the best thing is for you to take a vacation.""

He came a little closer, and my heart clenched with a mix of dread and despair. ""I've been looking for a place,"" he continued, his voice soft, almost whispering. ""A center. Far from the city. No phone, no work, no anything. A place where you can detox from all this stress. Where you can be yourself again, *my* Samanta.""

A mental institution. A psychiatric center. The unspoken words echoed in the air, cold, relentless. He wanted to lock me up, he wanted to silence me. He knew... *He knew that I knew!* And this was his plan to neutralize me!

The notebook in my hands felt like a bomb about to explode. My mind stopped reasoning, stopped looking for logic. There was only one certainty: this being wanted to take my David, my Daniel, and now, *me*.

""No!"" I screamed, the sound tearing through the silence. ""You're not going to lock me up! I won't let you! I know who you are!""

He looked at me, perplexed. ""Samanta, what are you talking about?""

""No!"" I roared, my voice now a raw growl. I held up the notebook, showing it to him as if it were irrefutable proof. ""I know you're not David! Look at this! Look at your own damn record! I know about your 'tests,' your 'anomalies'! I know you're monitoring me, trying to perfect your role! I know you're an impostor!""

His eyes fell on the notebook. Confusion transformed into something else, a flash of surprise, then... understanding? But it wasn't the understanding of someone exposed, but of someone who had just solved a problem.

""Samanta, I don't understand... It's my agenda, yes, but what you're saying...""

""Shut up!"" Rage consumed me completely. I lunged at him, the notebook still held high. ""You're not going to trick me! Not again! Where is he?! Where is my David?! What did you do to him?! And Daniel! Where are they?! Tell me! Now!""

My hand lunged for his neck, my nails grazing his skin. Desperation gave me brutal strength. I pushed him against the wall, my eyes fixed on his, searching for any hint of fear, of recognition of his true nature. ""Tell me where they are! Tell me how to get them back! I swear, if you don't, I will kill you!""

The impostor tried to back away, his eyes filled with confusion tinged with profound pain. Tears welled in his eyelids. ""Samanta, please... You don't know what you're saying. It's the stress. It wasn't a good idea to go back to the university. You need help, my love.""

""Sam, please! You're hurting yourself! You're not well!""

He tried to grab me, but I struggled, my screams echoing in the apartment. I ran; I had to get out of that place... he ran after me. My thoughts were a whirlwind: I needed to hurt him, I needed to make him talk, to confess. He wasn't going to lock me up. I was going to bring them back.

My gaze locked onto the knife block on the counter. They gleamed under the kitchen light. They were my only chance. I lunged. The impostor, anticipating my intention, was faster. His strong hand closed over my wrist, preventing me from reaching a knife handle. We struggled, my rage against his strength. He was taller, stronger, and his eyes, clouded with tears, looked at me with a pity that infuriated me even more.

I felt his fingers squeeze mine, pulling me away from the knives. He was winning. He was going to immobilize me. I was going to lose. As we struggled, my other hand, the one he wasn't holding, slid across the counter. My fingers closed around something cold and metallic. The kitchen shears, the same ones we used to cut chicken. The imposter's face, contorted by the effort of restraining me, was inches from mine. My fist rose, the shears hidden in my palm. My mind processed the only solution I had left... and I did it.

As best I could and with what little strength I had, I plunged the kitchen shears into the impostor's arm, the very arm that held my wrist and partially immobilized me. Those hazel eyes looked at me with pain, pain and... pity? Damn crazy! What was he trying to do? His arm was hard, not like cement, more like old meat. Even so, I managed to pierce through layers of fabric, skin, and muscle. The impostor screamed, letting out a squeal like a pig being hit, and a crimson stain spread on his clothes. He released my wrist to grab his arm, where my precious shears were still lodged. I fell to the floor while he slid, leaning against the edge of the counter, to the floor. His grimaces of pain and the blood made me know that this impostor was not immortal. Maybe... if I got rid of him... my David would return! Why didn't I think of this before?! Of course!

Coming back to my senses, I noticed the impostor desperately checking his pant pockets, surely looking for his phone. I got up from the floor, approached the knife block, and took one of them. I'm glad I've always made sure to keep them sharp; what can I say? I like barbecues too much. Knife in hand, I walked up to the impostor. He was already dialing a number or searching through his contact list, but there was nothing he could do... I was going to get *MY* David back.

""Tell me where David is... NOW."" I said in a voice I didn't know I had, that I didn't know I could produce from my throat.

""Sam, please. Why are you doing this? Stop, let's talk... I need help, Sam."" He could only sob, only cry, only make that disgusting grimace of pain, the disgusting grimace that etched itself onto *my* David's precious face. I was not going to let this man or monster or thing, whatever it was... continue walking the world with *MY* David's face.

""Tell me... tell me what you've gained thanks to that face you have? How many more people have you been deceiving? Where the hell do impostors like you come from?"" I had never been so convinced of anything before in my life... and I had never felt so much... control.

""Sam, Sam, Sam... please, love, I need you to st...""

""Shut up! Your excuses are useless... admit you lost. Admit you both lost.""

""What? Who are you referri...?"" A glimmer of understanding crossed that face dampened by tears, sweat, and saliva... it was disgusting. ""NO! NO, Sam! Stop! Daniel is your student, your best student... Sam, please. You're going to ruin your career, your life... What the hell is happening to you?!"" His choked, pained voice sounded so desperate.

""What do you know about my life and my career?! Oh... right, you impostors have the memories of the people you take, right? With me, you never could, you never could... I noticed it right away, I was just waiting. I needed proof, I needed confirmations. And you've given them all to me..."" This voice coming from deep inside me was... ironic, soft, playful. I was enjoying it. And how could I not? I was about to get rid of one of the impostors... at last.

""Samanta! It's me, it's YOUR David. Please don't do something you might regr..."" And silence reigned in my apartment.

I crouched down to his level with the knife clenched in my hand. I gave him a small smile while, with all my strength, I plunged that knife into his damn mouth.

""Shut up, damn it! I'm sick of seeing you wearing his face."" I pulled the knife out and plunged it in again, this time into one of his eyes.

""You don't deserve to see with this face! You don't deserve to speak with that mouth! You don't deserve to breathe with MY David's face!"" I stabbed him again and again and again and again and again and again. Blood bathed his clothes, his face, my apartment floor, and myself until he stopped moving.

HE stopped struggling, stopped trying, stopped making those erratic movements that resembled convulsions. Finally! MY David would return... without this substitute, without this thing that stole the body and life of MY David, he... he would return. But the other one was missing... Daniel was missing. The idea, so clear, so irrefutable, invaded me like a purifying fire. I wasn't the only one affected; families, partners, friends, colleagues... all deceived by that false and perfect mask. By that detailed study of memories, manners, gestures, everything! I had to stop him.

Without a second thought, I grabbed David's car keys. I tossed them in my hand; the sound of the notebook, still on the floor, screamed at me that I wasn't wrong. I left the apartment. The cold air hit my face, but I didn't feel the cold as such; my mind was a tunnel, a direct highway, with no detours. David's car roared under my hands. Red light, I ignored it. A deafening horn, I ignored that too. People walking, other cars. Nothing. My only goal was to get there, to put an end to all this. Daniel's image, his face... repeated in my mind like a furious mantra: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

I arrived at campus. I didn't park. I didn't bother to turn off the engine or lock the car. I just left the car askew, the tires screeching on the pavement, and shot out, the back doors open, leaving an oil stain and a silent warning. The stares... I felt them, the weight of strangeness and concern, from the students, from the security staff. But I saw nothing, felt nothing, heard nothing but Daniel's name resonating in my head. And rage... rage at the deception. And a desperation that screamed at me that I was the only one who could fix it. The only one who had realized. Or maybe, perhaps others also suspected, but no one had dared to do anything?

I burst into the first classroom I saw. The professor, halfway through an equation, looked at me, perplexed. My eyes scanned the students' faces, searching for the impostor, almost smelling the subtle changes. Nothing. I left, heading to the cafeteria, looking closely at each person, their expressions, their forced smiles. My pulse was a drum in my temples. He wasn't there. I went to the lab, to my office, even to the men's restroom. Where was he? Daniel's name choked in my throat, and frustration burned me.

Finally, I saw him... in a study room, hunched over some books, his backpack at his feet. The impostor. I entered like a fury. He looked up, his supposed student's eyes widened, not in surprise, but in genuine panic. Without hesitation, I pushed him against the wall, my hands gripping his shoulders. I needed to corner him, look at him closely, make sure he hadn't changed faces again.

""You! I know who you are! I know what you did! Deceiving everyone with that face! You're not Daniel! Tell me where they are! Where are the real ones!"" My words... every syllable was a hammer striking the truth. But Daniel, the impostor, just shook his head, his eyes pleading.

""Dr. R√≠os, please... What are you saying? Stop! You're hurting me!""

My hands, my nails, closed around his neck. I applied force. He kicked, his hands scratching mine, trying to break free, but I was the only one who could stop this. And fury gave me brutal strength, a strength I didn't know I had, a strength to avenge my David and my Daniel. I was strangling him. His legs moved frantically, then his movements became slower, more erratic. His face turned purple, his eyes bulging. He seemed to be losing consciousness... I wouldn't have to see this horrible creature using my student's face anymore. No longer.

It was then, as the impostor struggled for air, my free hand slipped inside my coat. My fingers grasped the familiar coldness of the knife handle. The same knife. The same one that had finished off the first one. I gripped it, the gleam of the metal promising the end of the deception. But just as I was about to raise my arm, chaos erupted around me. Screams. Heavy footsteps.

""Stop! Security! Let him go, Dr. R√≠os!""

A whirlwind of bodies surrounded me. Security guards, accompanied by more professors and students who lunged at me. I struggled, kicked, tried to stab him. But there were too many. My arms were pinned, the knife snatched from my hands with a sharp clang. They dragged me away from the impostor, who fell to the floor, coughing, his face bruised and red marks on his neck. Other students rushed to help him, their terror and relief palpable.

""They're impostors! All of you! You're deceiving me! Don't let them! Look closely at them! They're among us! You have to stop them!"" My words were drowned out by the noise, by the force with which they dragged me away. My eyes, fixed on the faces of those dragging me, of those looking at me with horror. To me, they were still the proof.

I woke up in a white, spotless room, with cold sheets on the bed. The smell of disinfectant was stronger here than in the hospital. The nurse, with a kind face but eyes that seemed to observe my every move, brought me a tray of bland food. It had been a while since I had last eaten. At some point, in my mind, I had believed the impostor had stopped moving.

I didn't clearly remember how I had gotten here, only fragments: the screams at the university, the force with which they dragged me away, the desperate warning to everyone about the impostors. And now, they had brought me to this place... the place where they had silenced me.

My mother came to see me, her eyes red and swollen. She hugged me, crying, begging me to let her help. She saw a broken daughter. I saw a mother who, like everyone else, had been deceived by the perfect masks. I tried to explain to her, again and again, the notebook, the changes in David, Daniel's coldness, and how I had gotten rid of the impostor who had taken my David. She just nodded, with that compassionate look that told me she didn't believe a word.

""You're tired, my love. You're very sick,"" she said.

Daniel, my student's impostor, didn't come. Which, for me, was a confirmation. One less. The university hadn't called me back. That was another sign. They were covering it up. Or planning their next move? At night, in the solitude of my room, my mind ran free. The logic of my own prison. I knew I was the only sane one in a world that had been invaded by those... damn impostors! All of this was their fault... I saw the news on a small television in the common room... faces that at first I didn't know were now familiar. But how many of them were also impostors? When had the world broken? What happened to the real people? Would they ever return?

The only certainty was that I, Samanta R√≠os, the cryptographer, was the only one who could see the truth. And that, in this white and silent place, was the heaviest burden of all. The medications dulled me, trying to cloud my perception. But they couldn't erase the image of his face. Nor the satisfaction of having stopped him. My David would return. I just needed to wait.",1,1749073104.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False

1l3hvm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3hvm9/that_face_continuation/,"That face, continuation","A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me. *Those* Daniel's eyes. I spoke of code efficiency, while my own mind was an indecipherable chaos. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

""A true cryptographer doesn't just decipher the code,"" I said, my voice rising a little higher than normal, ""they *feel* the logic, they *breathe* it. Where is that spark? Have you become mere automatons repeating what you're taught?"" I stared fixedly at Daniel, looking for a reaction.

His face remained expressionless, like a porcelain mask. ""Dr. R√≠os, emotional fervor is not a requirement for mathematical effectiveness,"" Daniel replied in a voice that was too calm, too perfect.

It was the last straw. My mind, which had resisted madness for weeks, broke in that instant. This impostor, this being who dared to imitate *my* Daniel, was challenging me, denying his own essence.

""You're not him!"" I screamed, my voice echoing in the stunned silence of the classroom. My hand slammed against the desk, sending papers and the pen flying. The graphic tablet fell to the floor with a dull thud. ""You're not Daniel! I don't know who you are, but you're not him!""

Heads turned. Murmurs erupted like a swarm of bees. Dozens of eyes, between confusion and fear, stared at me. I saw my students, other professors passing in the hallway, stop, their faces reflecting the same question: *Has Dr. R√≠os lost her mind?*

Suddenly, the fury dissipated, replaced by a cold, lacerating knowledge. It was me. *I* was the one who screamed. The one who lost control. The one who looked like a lunatic. The impostor... he remained as serene, as perfect as ever. Defeat struck me with the force of lightning. I had crumbled, and he had witnessed it.

Without another word, I clumsily gathered my bag, stumbling over a chair. I had to leave. I had to get away from those eyes, from that room full of accusing stares. I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me. His touch, again, that contact that was identical but felt so... false.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look. I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drop me off and pick me up from work, and my car was in the shop. I needed to get home. I needed my sanctuary. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real?

The ride to my apartment was agony. My head wouldn't stop processing, searching for logic in the chaos. I reached my door, flung it open, and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency overwhelmed me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of his closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A secret note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was.

But David wasn't in the apartment. It was almost three in the afternoon. He would be at work. What exactly was I looking for? My mind screamed in silence. I needed the impostor to tell me where he was. But he wasn't here. And I, only I, was completely alone with the hell in my own head.

A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me... those Daniel's eyes. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me.

My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look; I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drive me to and from work, but I needed to get home. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real? The ride to my apartment was agony. I reached my door, flung it open and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency invaded me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of the closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was. David wasn't in the apartment... it was almost three in the afternoon, so he would be at work. What exactly was I looking for?

Time faded in the urgency of my search. Finally, my gaze fell on the old wooden trunk that David had brought when he decided to stay and take care of me. It was his grandmother's, full of memories, and I had always considered it his personal treasure chest, something I respected and had never rummaged through. But now, privacy was a luxury I couldn't afford. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk. Inside, among old photo albums and yellowed letters, my fingers stumbled upon something hard. A notebook. It wasn't just any notebook. It was the small leather agenda David carried everywhere. The same one he used to jot down his ideas, his to-do lists, even small sketches. He never left it out in the open. He always kept it in an inside jacket pocket, or on his nightstand. How had I not noticed it was here, so exposed?

My hands trembled as I opened it. The first pages were grocery lists, meeting scribbles. Then, a series of dates and names I didn't recognize. But further on, on a page near the end, I found what I was looking for. A pattern. They weren't words, or codes, or hidden messages. They were a series of numbers, dates, and times, followed by brief descriptions:

""Samanta visit - OK"" ""Daniel coffee - No anomalies"" ""Call Samanta's mother - High concern""

And what chilled me to the bone:

""Table test (Monday) - No reaction"" ""Anecdote question (Tuesday) - Success"" ""Thesis (Wednesday) - All in order.""

It was a record. A logbook of my interactions with the impostor. Of my ""tests."" It was as if this being was monitoring my behavior, evaluating his own performance... assessing how convincing he was being, his success rate. I imagined this impostor making nocturnal reflections and considering which parts of his act he needed to refine. Rage boiled in me, but beneath it, a chilling terror spread. Not only was he an impostor, he was a methodical observer, a being who analyzed my paranoia and adjusted his facade.

My heart pounded so hard it resonated in my ears. The trunk, the things scattered across the floor... they didn't matter. The proof was there, in my hands. It was undeniable. This notebook was confirmation that the David with me was not my David. It was something far more sinister. A knock on the door. Then, the sound of a key turning.

David.

The seconds stretched. I dragged myself, the notebook clutched to my chest, to the darkest corner of my room. I curled up, knees drawn to my chest, feeling the cold of the wall against my back. I heard his footsteps in the living room, the rustle of the things I had thrown.

""Samanta? I'm here! Samanta!"" His voice, so familiar, but now laden with a concern that sounded like a sham.

I heard him enter the kitchen, then the bathroom. The footsteps approached my room. I didn't move, didn't breathe. The notebook was my shield and my weapon. This was the evidence. I was going to unmask him, no, I had to, and I had to know where my David was. The real one. The door to my room slowly opened. The hallway light spilled over the mess I had created. David stopped in the doorway, his face pale and his eyes wide with surprise at seeing the chaos.

""Samanta... What happened here? Are you okay?""

His gaze swept over the mess, then stopped on me, huddled in the corner. His face showed pure concern, the same face I had loved for years, but which now felt like a chilling mask. He didn't know I had the proof, and I was going to force him to confess.

""What do you want?"" I snapped, my voice harsh, charged with a fury I could barely contain. I stood up slowly, my muscles stiff, my eyes fixed on his.

He took a step towards me, hands raised in a reassuring gesture. ""I've been calling you, Sam. The university called your mom, she said you weren't well. They told me what happened in your class. I apologized for you, Sam, they... they're worried. *I'm* worried. You shouldn't have come back so soon, Sam. The doctors told you to relax.""

His words, so calm, so rational, only fueled my anger. Relax? After what I had seen? After what I knew? Apologize for me? Humiliation mixed with terror. This impostor was trying to control me, to cover up the truth with a pretense of concern.

""Worried?"" I let out a hollow laugh, full of bitterness. ""Sure, 'worried.' Do you know what we're talking about?""

He stopped. His gaze was confused, but I no longer believed him. ""Samanta, I know this is stress. What's happening to you is... It's a lot. We've talked to the dean, to some professors. Everyone understands that you need a break, away from everything. We've decided the best thing is for you to take a vacation.""

He came a little closer, and my heart clenched with a mix of dread and despair. ""I've been looking for a place,"" he continued, his voice soft, almost whispering. ""A center. Far from the city. No phone, no work, no anything. A place where you can detox from all this stress. Where you can be yourself again, *my* Samanta.""

A mental institution. A psychiatric center. The unspoken words echoed in the air, cold, relentless. He wanted to lock me up, he wanted to silence me. He knew... *He knew that I knew!* And this was his plan to neutralize me!

The notebook in my hands felt like a bomb about to explode. My mind stopped reasoning, stopped looking for logic. There was only one certainty: this being wanted to take my David, my Daniel, and now, *me*.

""No!"" I screamed, the sound tearing through the silence. ""You're not going to lock me up! I won't let you! I know who you are!""

He looked at me, perplexed. ""Samanta, what are you talking about?""

""No!"" I roared, my voice now a raw growl. I held up the notebook, showing it to him as if it were irrefutable proof. ""I know you're not David! Look at this! Look at your own damn record! I know about your 'tests,' your 'anomalies'! I know you're monitoring me, trying to perfect your role! I know you're an impostor!""

His eyes fell on the notebook. Confusion transformed into something else, a flash of surprise, then... understanding? But it wasn't the understanding of someone exposed, but of someone who had just solved a problem.

""Samanta, I don't understand... It's my agenda, yes, but what you're saying...""

""Shut up!"" Rage consumed me completely. I lunged at him, the notebook still held high. ""You're not going to trick me! Not again! Where is he?! Where is my David?! What did you do to him?! And Daniel! Where are they?! Tell me! Now!""

My hand lunged for his neck, my nails grazing his skin. Desperation gave me brutal strength. I pushed him against the wall, my eyes fixed on his, searching for any hint of fear, of recognition of his true nature. ""Tell me where they are! Tell me how to get them back! I swear, if you don't, I will kill you!""

The impostor tried to back away, his eyes filled with confusion tinged with profound pain. Tears welled in his eyelids. ""Samanta, please... You don't know what you're saying. It's the stress. It wasn't a good idea to go back to the university. You need help, my love.""

""Sam, please! You're hurting yourself! You're not well!""

He tried to grab me, but I struggled, my screams echoing in the apartment. I ran; I had to get out of that place... he ran after me. My thoughts were a whirlwind: I needed to hurt him, I needed to make him talk, to confess. He wasn't going to lock me up. I was going to bring them back.

My gaze locked onto the knife block on the counter. They gleamed under the kitchen light. They were my only chance. I lunged. The impostor, anticipating my intention, was faster. His strong hand closed over my wrist, preventing me from reaching a knife handle. We struggled, my rage against his strength. He was taller, stronger, and his eyes, clouded with tears, looked at me with a pity that infuriated me even more.

I felt his fingers squeeze mine, pulling me away from the knives. He was winning. He was going to immobilize me. I was going to lose. As we struggled, my other hand, the one he wasn't holding, slid across the counter. My fingers closed around something cold and metallic. The kitchen shears, the same ones we used to cut chicken. The imposter's face, contorted by the effort of restraining me, was inches from mine. My fist rose, the shears hidden in my palm. My mind processed the only solution I had left... and I did it.

As best I could and with what little strength I had, I plunged the kitchen shears into the impostor's arm, the very arm that held my wrist and partially immobilized me. Those hazel eyes looked at me with pain, pain and... pity? Damn crazy! What was he trying to do? His arm was hard, not like cement, more like old meat. Even so, I managed to pierce through layers of fabric, skin, and muscle. The impostor screamed, letting out a squeal like a pig being hit, and a crimson stain spread on his clothes. He released my wrist to grab his arm, where my precious shears were still lodged. I fell to the floor while he slid, leaning against the edge of the counter, to the floor. His grimaces of pain and the blood made me know that this impostor was not immortal. Maybe... if I got rid of him... my David would return! Why didn't I think of this before?! Of course!

Coming back to my senses, I noticed the impostor desperately checking his pant pockets, surely looking for his phone. I got up from the floor, approached the knife block, and took one of them. I'm glad I've always made sure to keep them sharp; what can I say? I like barbecues too much. Knife in hand, I walked up to the impostor. He was already dialing a number or searching through his contact list, but there was nothing he could do... I was going to get *MY* David back.

""Tell me where David is... NOW."" I said in a voice I didn't know I had, that I didn't know I could produce from my throat.

""Sam, please. Why are you doing this? Stop, let's talk... I need help, Sam."" He could only sob, only cry, only make that disgusting grimace of pain, the disgusting grimace that etched itself onto *my* David's precious face. I was not going to let this man or monster or thing, whatever it was... continue walking the world with *MY* David's face.

""Tell me... tell me what you've gained thanks to that face you have? How many more people have you been deceiving? Where the hell do impostors like you come from?"" I had never been so convinced of anything before in my life... and I had never felt so much... control.

""Sam, Sam, Sam... please, love, I need you to st...""

""Shut up! Your excuses are useless... admit you lost. Admit you both lost.""

""What? Who are you referri...?"" A glimmer of understanding crossed that face dampened by tears, sweat, and saliva... it was disgusting. ""NO! NO, Sam! Stop! Daniel is your student, your best student... Sam, please. You're going to ruin your career, your life... What the hell is happening to you?!"" His choked, pained voice sounded so desperate.

""What do you know about my life and my career?! Oh... right, you impostors have the memories of the people you take, right? With me, you never could, you never could... I noticed it right away, I was just waiting. I needed proof, I needed confirmations. And you've given them all to me..."" This voice coming from deep inside me was... ironic, soft, playful. I was enjoying it. And how could I not? I was about to get rid of one of the impostors... at last.

""Samanta! It's me, it's YOUR David. Please don't do something you might regr..."" And silence reigned in my apartment.

I crouched down to his level with the knife clenched in my hand. I gave him a small smile while, with all my strength, I plunged that knife into his damn mouth.

""Shut up, damn it! I'm sick of seeing you wearing his face."" I pulled the knife out and plunged it in again, this time into one of his eyes.

""You don't deserve to see with this face! You don't deserve to speak with that mouth! You don't deserve to breathe with MY David's face!"" I stabbed him again and again and again and again and again and again. Blood bathed his clothes, his face, my apartment floor, and myself until he stopped moving.

HE stopped struggling, stopped trying, stopped making those erratic movements that resembled convulsions. Finally! MY David would return... without this substitute, without this thing that stole the body and life of MY David, he... he would return. But the other one was missing... Daniel was missing. The idea, so clear, so irrefutable, invaded me like a purifying fire. I wasn't the only one affected; families, partners, friends, colleagues... all deceived by that false and perfect mask. By that detailed study of memories, manners, gestures, everything! I had to stop him.

Without a second thought, I grabbed David's car keys. I tossed them in my hand; the sound of the notebook, still on the floor, screamed at me that I wasn't wrong. I left the apartment. The cold air hit my face, but I didn't feel the cold as such; my mind was a tunnel, a direct highway, with no detours. David's car roared under my hands. Red light, I ignored it. A deafening horn, I ignored that too. People walking, other cars. Nothing. My only goal was to get there, to put an end to all this. Daniel's image, his face... repeated in my mind like a furious mantra: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

I arrived at campus. I didn't park. I didn't bother to turn off the engine or lock the car. I just left the car askew, the tires screeching on the pavement, and shot out, the back doors open, leaving an oil stain and a silent warning. The stares... I felt them, the weight of strangeness and concern, from the students, from the security staff. But I saw nothing, felt nothing, heard nothing but Daniel's name resonating in my head. And rage... rage at the deception. And a desperation that screamed at me that I was the only one who could fix it. The only one who had realized. Or maybe, perhaps others also suspected, but no one had dared to do anything?

I burst into the first classroom I saw. The professor, halfway through an equation, looked at me, perplexed. My eyes scanned the students' faces, searching for the impostor, almost smelling the subtle changes. Nothing. I left, heading to the cafeteria, looking closely at each person, their expressions, their forced smiles. My pulse was a drum in my temples. He wasn't there. I went to the lab, to my office, even to the men's restroom. Where was he? Daniel's name choked in my throat, and frustration burned me.

Finally, I saw him... in a study room, hunched over some books, his backpack at his feet. The impostor. I entered like a fury. He looked up, his supposed student's eyes widened, not in surprise, but in genuine panic. Without hesitation, I pushed him against the wall, my hands gripping his shoulders. I needed to corner him, look at him closely, make sure he hadn't changed faces again.

""You! I know who you are! I know what you did! Deceiving everyone with that face! You're not Daniel! Tell me where they are! Where are the real ones!"" My words... every syllable was a hammer striking the truth. But Daniel, the impostor, just shook his head, his eyes pleading.

""Dr. R√≠os, please... What are you saying? Stop! You're hurting me!""

My hands, my nails, closed around his neck. I applied force. He kicked, his hands scratching mine, trying to break free, but I was the only one who could stop this. And fury gave me brutal strength, a strength I didn't know I had, a strength to avenge my David and my Daniel. I was strangling him. His legs moved frantically, then his movements became slower, more erratic. His face turned purple, his eyes bulging. He seemed to be losing consciousness... I wouldn't have to see this horrible creature using my student's face anymore. No longer.

It was then, as the impostor struggled for air, my free hand slipped inside my coat. My fingers grasped the familiar coldness of the knife handle. The same knife. The same one that had finished off the first one. I gripped it, the gleam of the metal promising the end of the deception. But just as I was about to raise my arm, chaos erupted around me. Screams. Heavy footsteps.

""Stop! Security! Let him go, Dr. R√≠os!""

A whirlwind of bodies surrounded me. Security guards, accompanied by more professors and students who lunged at me. I struggled, kicked, tried to stab him. But there were too many. My arms were pinned, the knife snatched from my hands with a sharp clang. They dragged me away from the impostor, who fell to the floor, coughing, his face bruised and red marks on his neck. Other students rushed to help him, their terror and relief palpable.

""They're impostors! All of you! You're deceiving me! Don't let them! Look closely at them! They're among us! You have to stop them!"" My words were drowned out by the noise, by the force with which they dragged me away. My eyes, fixed on the faces of those dragging me, of those looking at me with horror. To me, they were still the proof.

I woke up in a white, spotless room, with cold sheets on the bed. The smell of disinfectant was stronger here than in the hospital. The nurse, with a kind face but eyes that seemed to observe my every move, brought me a tray of bland food. It had been a while since I had last eaten. At some point, in my mind, I had believed the impostor had stopped moving.

I didn't clearly remember how I had gotten here, only fragments: the screams at the university, the force with which they dragged me away, the desperate warning to everyone about the impostors. And now, they had brought me to this place... the place where they had silenced me.

My mother came to see me, her eyes red and swollen. She hugged me, crying, begging me to let her help. She saw a broken daughter. I saw a mother who, like everyone else, had been deceived by the perfect masks. I tried to explain to her, again and again, the notebook, the changes in David, Daniel's coldness, and how I had gotten rid of the impostor who had taken my David. She just nodded, with that compassionate look that told me she didn't believe a word.

""You're tired, my love. You're very sick,"" she said.

Daniel, my student's impostor, didn't come. Which, for me, was a confirmation. One less. The university hadn't called me back. That was another sign. They were covering it up. Or planning their next move? At night, in the solitude of my room, my mind ran free. The logic of my own prison. I knew I was the only sane one in a world that had been invaded by those... damn impostors! All of this was their fault... I saw the news on a small television in the common room... faces that at first I didn't know were now familiar. But how many of them were also impostors? When had the world broken? What happened to the real people? Would they ever return?

The only certainty was that I, Samanta R√≠os, the cryptographer, was the only one who could see the truth. And that, in this white and silent place, was the heaviest burden of all. The medications dulled me, trying to cloud my perception. But they couldn't erase the image of his face. Nor the satisfaction of having stopped him. My David would return. I just needed to wait.",1,1749073066.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Location isn‚Äôt just about where you live‚Äîit‚Äôs about how you live. For digital nomads, geography is everything. It dictates your cost of living, your access to co-working spaces, and even your tax obligations. But most importantly, it defines your freedom.

You can work from anywhere, but not everywhere offers the right mix of affordability, connectivity, and culture. That‚Äôs why smart nomads don‚Äôt just wander‚Äîthey strategize. They choose destinations that align with their income, lifestyle, and long-term goals. And they do it with purpose.

*üåç Ready to find your ideal location? Let‚Äôs get started:* [*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Asia has become the epicenter of digital nomadism. Places like Bali, Chiang Mai, and Phuket are no longer just vacation spots. They‚Äôre full-fledged hubs for remote workers. Why? Because they offer high-speed internet, affordable housing, and a community that gets it.

But it‚Äôs not all about the beach. These cities also provide coworking spaces, networking events, and a thriving ecosystem of freelancers, startups, and entrepreneurs. The combination of low costs and high productivity makes them irresistible. Yet, they‚Äôre far from the only options.

Europe is catching up fast. Lisbon, Tallinn, and Athens are emerging as top choices for nomads who want to balance affordability with quality of life. These cities have embraced the digital revolution and are offering long-term visa programs tailored for remote workers.

But Europe isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. Some countries demand more from you than others. You‚Äôll need to understand local laws, language nuances, and cultural expectations. Otherwise, you risk alienating yourself or getting stuck in bureaucratic limbo.

*üöÄ Want to know which European city suits you best? Run the free diagnostic now:* [*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

The Caribbean is another hidden gem. Barbados and Jamaica are leading the charge with tax incentives and streamlined visa processes. Imagine working from a beachside caf√© while enjoying a tropical breeze and a local coffee. It‚Äôs not fantasy‚Äîit‚Äôs strategy.

Grenada and St. Lucia are following suit, offering residency programs that allow you to stay for months at a time. But don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking it‚Äôs all smooth sailing. Infrastructure, healthcare access, and banking systems vary widely. You need to plan accordingly.

Latin America is the new frontier. Cities like Medell√≠n, Mexico City, and Cusco are gaining traction among nomads seeking rich cultural experiences without breaking the bank. But this region comes with its own set of challenges‚Äîlanguage barriers, fluctuating currency values, and sometimes spotty internet.

Still, the rewards outweigh the risks. Latin America offers a unique blend of history, natural beauty, and affordability. Plus, the people are warm, the food is diverse, and the pace of life is often slower. If you can navigate the local bureaucracy, it could be your next big move.

Africa is quietly becoming a hotspot for digital nomads too. Cape Town, Marrakech, and Tulum (Morocco) are attracting remote workers with their vibrant cultures and growing tech scenes. However, infrastructure remains inconsistent. You‚Äôll need patience and flexibility to make it work.

*üí° Still unsure where to land? Get clarity now:* [*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

The Middle East is evolving rapidly. Dubai, Tel Aviv, and Istanbul are bridging the gap between East and West, offering modern amenities, cosmopolitan vibes, and business-friendly environments. But these cities come with unique considerations‚Äîreligious holidays, dress codes, and social norms that differ from Western standards.

If you‚Äôre looking for a high-energy environment with global connections, the Middle East might be your match. Just be prepared to adapt your lifestyle to fit local customs.

Australia and Oceania present a different kind of dream. Sydney and Byron Bay offer laid-back lifestyles with world-class beaches and cafes. But if you‚Äôre chasing a nomadic path, you‚Äôll quickly run into immigration hurdles. Visa restrictions make it tough to stay long-term unless you‚Äôve got a solid plan.

That said, some parts of Australia are experimenting with digital nomad visas. Keep an eye on policy changes‚Äîthey could open doors for longer stays.

North America isn‚Äôt just about Silicon Valley anymore. Cities like Austin, Montreal, and Portland are becoming affordable alternatives for remote workers. They offer strong internet, supportive communities, and lower costs compared to major tech hubs. But don‚Äôt ignore the weather extremes or overcrowded urban centers.

*üîë Don‚Äôt settle for second-best‚Äîfind your perfect spot:* [*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

‚ÄúDigital nomad villages‚Äù are popping up around the world. These curated communities bring together like-minded remote workers in shared spaces. Think of them as retreats with structure‚Äîcomplete with mentorship, workshops, and peer support.

These villages aren‚Äôt just for escaping reality; they‚Äôre for building a sustainable lifestyle. They help you avoid isolation, foster collaboration, and keep you grounded in your goals.

Cost of living is a critical factor in choosing your destination. Rent, groceries, and healthcare can eat into your income faster than you expect. A place that seems cheap today could drain your savings tomorrow if you‚Äôre not careful.

Balance is key. Look for locations that offer value for money without sacrificing your quality of life. And remember‚Äîlow cost doesn‚Äôt always mean low quality.

Internet speed and reliability should never be underestimated. Whether you‚Äôre coding, editing, or streaming meetings, a stable connection is non-negotiable. Fiber-optic networks are ideal, but satellite or mobile hotspots may be necessary in certain regions.

Safety and security go beyond physical crime. Political instability, health risks, and natural disasters can disrupt your work and peace of mind. Always research local conditions and have contingency plans in place.

Insurance coverage is another overlooked element. Even if you think you‚Äôre invincible, medical emergencies happen. Make sure you have adequate international health insurance to protect yourself and your assets.

Community and culture matter more than you think. Joining local meetups or online groups helps you build meaningful connections. These relationships can lead to collaborations, job opportunities, and friendships that last years.

But don‚Äôt underestimate the challenge of adapting to new cultures. Misunderstandings, language barriers, and differing values can create friction. Be open, curious, and respectful. That‚Äôs how you thrive abroad.

Language proficiency affects your integration. While many places speak English, fluency in the local language opens doors to deeper engagement. It builds trust, enhances your experience, and gives you a competitive edge when hiring locals or outsourcing tasks.

*‚ú® Don‚Äôt wait for problems to arise‚Äîact now:* [*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Visa regulations are a minefield. Some countries offer long-term digital nomad visas, while others require constant reentry permits or tourist extensions. Getting caught without proper documentation can result in fines, deportation, or being blacklisted.

Do your homework. Understand the legal framework of each country you visit. Hire a local expert if needed. It‚Äôs worth the investment to avoid costly mistakes.

Tax implications vary drastically by region. Double taxation agreements can save you money, but they require strategic planning. Withholding taxes, reporting requirements, and jurisdictional conflicts complicate matters further.

Healthcare access is another deciding factor. Public systems work well in some countries, but private insurance may be necessary elsewhere. Always verify what‚Äôs covered and what‚Äôs not. No one wants to face a medical emergency without a safety net.

Transportation and mobility define your ability to explore and connect. Airports, trains, and buses shape your travel options. Visa requirements for neighboring countries affect how easily you can move between locations.

So, where do most digital nomads live? The answer is simple: wherever the conditions align with their ambitions. It‚Äôs not just about finding a place to stay‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a life that works for you.

The right location can transform your career, enrich your experiences, and boost your income. But without the right knowledge, you risk settling for less than you deserve.

Make an informed decision. Explore your options. And let data guide your journey. The future of work is borderless‚Äîbut your success depends on where you choose to plant your flag.",1,1749073066.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

1l3hurr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1l3hurr/that_face_continuation/,That face (continuation),"A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me. *Those* Daniel's eyes. I spoke of code efficiency, while my own mind was an indecipherable chaos. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

""A true cryptographer doesn't just decipher the code,"" I said, my voice rising a little higher than normal, ""they *feel* the logic, they *breathe* it. Where is that spark? Have you become mere automatons repeating what you're taught?"" I stared fixedly at Daniel, looking for a reaction.

His face remained expressionless, like a porcelain mask. ""Dr. R√≠os, emotional fervor is not a requirement for mathematical effectiveness,"" Daniel replied in a voice that was too calm, too perfect.

It was the last straw. My mind, which had resisted madness for weeks, broke in that instant. This impostor, this being who dared to imitate *my* Daniel, was challenging me, denying his own essence.

""You're not him!"" I screamed, my voice echoing in the stunned silence of the classroom. My hand slammed against the desk, sending papers and the pen flying. The graphic tablet fell to the floor with a dull thud. ""You're not Daniel! I don't know who you are, but you're not him!""

Heads turned. Murmurs erupted like a swarm of bees. Dozens of eyes, between confusion and fear, stared at me. I saw my students, other professors passing in the hallway, stop, their faces reflecting the same question: *Has Dr. R√≠os lost her mind?*

Suddenly, the fury dissipated, replaced by a cold, lacerating knowledge. It was me. *I* was the one who screamed. The one who lost control. The one who looked like a lunatic. The impostor... he remained as serene, as perfect as ever. Defeat struck me with the force of lightning. I had crumbled, and he had witnessed it.

Without another word, I clumsily gathered my bag, stumbling over a chair. I had to leave. I had to get away from those eyes, from that room full of accusing stares. I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me. His touch, again, that contact that was identical but felt so... false.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look. I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drop me off and pick me up from work, and my car was in the shop. I needed to get home. I needed my sanctuary. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real?

The ride to my apartment was agony. My head wouldn't stop processing, searching for logic in the chaos. I reached my door, flung it open, and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency overwhelmed me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of his closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A secret note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was.

But David wasn't in the apartment. It was almost three in the afternoon. He would be at work. What exactly was I looking for? My mind screamed in silence. I needed the impostor to tell me where he was. But he wasn't here. And I, only I, was completely alone with the hell in my own head.

A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me... those Daniel's eyes. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look; I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drive me to and from work, but I needed to get home. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real? The ride to my apartment was agony. I reached my door, flung it open and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency invaded me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of the closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was. David wasn't in the apartment... it was almost three in the afternoon, so he would be at work. What exactly was I looking for?

Time faded in the urgency of my search. Finally, my gaze fell on the old wooden trunk that David had brought when he decided to stay and take care of me. It was his grandmother's, full of memories, and I had always considered it his personal treasure chest, something I respected and had never rummaged through. But now, privacy was a luxury I couldn't afford. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk. Inside, among old photo albums and yellowed letters, my fingers stumbled upon something hard. A notebook. It wasn't just any notebook. It was the small leather agenda David carried everywhere. The same one he used to jot down his ideas, his to-do lists, even small sketches. He never left it out in the open. He always kept it in an inside jacket pocket, or on his nightstand. How had I not noticed it was here, so exposed?

My hands trembled as I opened it. The first pages were grocery lists, meeting scribbles. Then, a series of dates and names I didn't recognize. But further on, on a page near the end, I found what I was looking for. A pattern. They weren't words, or codes, or hidden messages. They were a series of numbers, dates, and times, followed by brief descriptions:

""Samanta visit - OK"" ""Daniel coffee - No anomalies"" ""Call Samanta's mother - High concern""

And what chilled me to the bone:

""Table test (Monday) - No reaction"" ""Anecdote question (Tuesday) - Success"" ""Thesis (Wednesday) - All in order.""

It was a record. A logbook of my interactions with the impostor. Of my ""tests."" It was as if this being was monitoring my behavior, evaluating his own performance... assessing how convincing he was being, his success rate. I imagined this impostor making nocturnal reflections and considering which parts of his act he needed to refine. Rage boiled in me, but beneath it, a chilling terror spread. Not only was he an impostor, he was a methodical observer, a being who analyzed my paranoia and adjusted his facade.

My heart pounded so hard it resonated in my ears. The trunk, the things scattered across the floor... they didn't matter. The proof was there, in my hands. It was undeniable. This notebook was confirmation that the David with me was not my David. It was something far more sinister. A knock on the door. Then, the sound of a key turning.

David.

The seconds stretched. I dragged myself, the notebook clutched to my chest, to the darkest corner of my room. I curled up, knees drawn to my chest, feeling the cold of the wall against my back. I heard his footsteps in the living room, the rustle of the things I had thrown.

""Samanta? I'm here! Samanta!"" His voice, so familiar, but now laden with a concern that sounded like a sham.

I heard him enter the kitchen, then the bathroom. The footsteps approached my room. I didn't move, didn't breathe. The notebook was my shield and my weapon. This was the evidence. I was going to unmask him, no, I had to, and I had to know where my David was. The real one. The door to my room slowly opened. The hallway light spilled over the mess I had created. David stopped in the doorway, his face pale and his eyes wide with surprise at seeing the chaos.

""Samanta... What happened here? Are you okay?""

His gaze swept over the mess, then stopped on me, huddled in the corner. His face showed pure concern, the same face I had loved for years, but which now felt like a chilling mask. He didn't know I had the proof, and I was going to force him to confess.

""What do you want?"" I snapped, my voice harsh, charged with a fury I could barely contain. I stood up slowly, my muscles stiff, my eyes fixed on his.

He took a step towards me, hands raised in a reassuring gesture. ""I've been calling you, Sam. The university called your mom, she said you weren't well. They told me what happened in your class. I apologized for you, Sam, they... they're worried. *I'm* worried. You shouldn't have come back so soon, Sam. The doctors told you to relax.""

His words, so calm, so rational, only fueled my anger. Relax? After what I had seen? After what I knew? Apologize for me? Humiliation mixed with terror. This impostor was trying to control me, to cover up the truth with a pretense of concern.

""Worried?"" I let out a hollow laugh, full of bitterness. ""Sure, 'worried.' Do you know what we're talking about?""

He stopped. His gaze was confused, but I no longer believed him. ""Samanta, I know this is stress. What's happening to you is... It's a lot. We've talked to the dean, to some professors. Everyone understands that you need a break, away from everything. We've decided the best thing is for you to take a vacation.""

He came a little closer, and my heart clenched with a mix of dread and despair. ""I've been looking for a place,"" he continued, his voice soft, almost whispering. ""A center. Far from the city. No phone, no work, no anything. A place where you can detox from all this stress. Where you can be yourself again, *my* Samanta.""

A mental institution. A psychiatric center. The unspoken words echoed in the air, cold, relentless. He wanted to lock me up, he wanted to silence me. He knew... *He knew that I knew!* And this was his plan to neutralize me!

The notebook in my hands felt like a bomb about to explode. My mind stopped reasoning, stopped looking for logic. There was only one certainty: this being wanted to take my David, my Daniel, and now, *me*.

""No!"" I screamed, the sound tearing through the silence. ""You're not going to lock me up! I won't let you! I know who you are!""

He looked at me, perplexed. ""Samanta, what are you talking about?""

""No!"" I roared, my voice now a raw growl. I held up the notebook, showing it to him as if it were irrefutable proof. ""I know you're not David! Look at this! Look at your own damn record! I know about your 'tests,' your 'anomalies'! I know you're monitoring me, trying to perfect your role! I know you're an impostor!""

His eyes fell on the notebook. Confusion transformed into something else, a flash of surprise, then... understanding? But it wasn't the understanding of someone exposed, but of someone who had just solved a problem.

""Samanta, I don't understand... It's my agenda, yes, but what you're saying...""

""Shut up!"" Rage consumed me completely. I lunged at him, the notebook still held high. ""You're not going to trick me! Not again! Where is he?! Where is my David?! What did you do to him?! And Daniel! Where are they?! Tell me! Now!""

My hand lunged for his neck, my nails grazing his skin. Desperation gave me brutal strength. I pushed him against the wall, my eyes fixed on his, searching for any hint of fear, of recognition of his true nature. ""Tell me where they are! Tell me how to get them back! I swear, if you don't, I will kill you!""

The impostor tried to back away, his eyes filled with confusion tinged with profound pain. Tears welled in his eyelids. ""Samanta, please... You don't know what you're saying. It's the stress. It wasn't a good idea to go back to the university. You need help, my love.""

""Sam, please! You're hurting yourself! You're not well!""

He tried to grab me, but I struggled, my screams echoing in the apartment. I ran; I had to get out of that place... he ran after me. My thoughts were a whirlwind: I needed to hurt him, I needed to make him talk, to confess. He wasn't going to lock me up. I was going to bring them back.

My gaze locked onto the knife block on the counter. They gleamed under the kitchen light. They were my only chance. I lunged. The impostor, anticipating my intention, was faster. His strong hand closed over my wrist, preventing me from reaching a knife handle. We struggled, my rage against his strength. He was taller, stronger, and his eyes, clouded with tears, looked at me with a pity that infuriated me even more.

I felt his fingers squeeze mine, pulling me away from the knives. He was winning. He was going to immobilize me. I was going to lose. As we struggled, my other hand, the one he wasn't holding, slid across the counter. My fingers closed around something cold and metallic. The kitchen shears, the same ones we used to cut chicken. The imposter's face, contorted by the effort of restraining me, was inches from mine. My fist rose, the shears hidden in my palm. My mind processed the only solution I had left... and I did it.

As best I could and with what little strength I had, I plunged the kitchen shears into the impostor's arm, the very arm that held my wrist and partially immobilized me. Those hazel eyes looked at me with pain, pain and... pity? Damn crazy! What was he trying to do? His arm was hard, not like cement, more like old meat. Even so, I managed to pierce through layers of fabric, skin, and muscle. The impostor screamed, letting out a squeal like a pig being hit, and a crimson stain spread on his clothes. He released my wrist to grab his arm, where my precious shears were still lodged. I fell to the floor while he slid, leaning against the edge of the counter, to the floor. His grimaces of pain and the blood made me know that this impostor was not immortal. Maybe... if I got rid of him... my David would return! Why didn't I think of this before?! Of course!

Coming back to my senses, I noticed the impostor desperately checking his pant pockets, surely looking for his phone. I got up from the floor, approached the knife block, and took one of them. I'm glad I've always made sure to keep them sharp; what can I say? I like barbecues too much. Knife in hand, I walked up to the impostor. He was already dialing a number or searching through his contact list, but there was nothing he could do... I was going to get *MY* David back.

""Tell me where David is... NOW."" I said in a voice I didn't know I had, that I didn't know I could produce from my throat.

""Sam, please. Why are you doing this? Stop, let's talk... I need help, Sam."" He could only sob, only cry, only make that disgusting grimace of pain, the disgusting grimace that etched itself onto *my* David's precious face. I was not going to let this man or monster or thing, whatever it was... continue walking the world with *MY* David's face.

""Tell me... tell me what you've gained thanks to that face you have? How many more people have you been deceiving? Where the hell do impostors like you come from?"" I had never been so convinced of anything before in my life... and I had never felt so much... control.

""Sam, Sam, Sam... please, love, I need you to st...""

""Shut up! Your excuses are useless... admit you lost. Admit you both lost.""

""What? Who are you referri...?"" A glimmer of understanding crossed that face dampened by tears, sweat, and saliva... it was disgusting. ""NO! NO, Sam! Stop! Daniel is your student, your best student... Sam, please. You're going to ruin your career, your life... What the hell is happening to you?!"" His choked, pained voice sounded so desperate.

""What do you know about my life and my career?! Oh... right, you impostors have the memories of the people you take, right? With me, you never could, you never could... I noticed it right away, I was just waiting. I needed proof, I needed confirmations. And you've given them all to me..."" This voice coming from deep inside me was... ironic, soft, playful. I was enjoying it. And how could I not? I was about to get rid of one of the impostors... at last.

""Samanta! It's me, it's YOUR David. Please don't do something you might regr..."" And silence reigned in my apartment.

I crouched down to his level with the knife clenched in my hand. I gave him a small smile while, with all my strength, I plunged that knife into his damn mouth.

""Shut up, damn it! I'm sick of seeing you wearing his face."" I pulled the knife out and plunged it in again, this time into one of his eyes.

""You don't deserve to see with this face! You don't deserve to speak with that mouth! You don't deserve to breathe with MY David's face!"" I stabbed him again and again and again and again and again and again. Blood bathed his clothes, his face, my apartment floor, and myself until he stopped moving.

HE stopped struggling, stopped trying, stopped making those erratic movements that resembled convulsions. Finally! MY David would return... without this substitute, without this thing that stole the body and life of MY David, he... he would return. But the other one was missing... Daniel was missing. The idea, so clear, so irrefutable, invaded me like a purifying fire. I wasn't the only one affected; families, partners, friends, colleagues... all deceived by that false and perfect mask. By that detailed study of memories, manners, gestures, everything! I had to stop him.

Without a second thought, I grabbed David's car keys. I tossed them in my hand; the sound of the notebook, still on the floor, screamed at me that I wasn't wrong. I left the apartment. The cold air hit my face, but I didn't feel the cold as such; my mind was a tunnel, a direct highway, with no detours. David's car roared under my hands. Red light, I ignored it. A deafening horn, I ignored that too. People walking, other cars. Nothing. My only goal was to get there, to put an end to all this. Daniel's image, his face... repeated in my mind like a furious mantra: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

I arrived at campus. I didn't park. I didn't bother to turn off the engine or lock the car. I just left the car askew, the tires screeching on the pavement, and shot out, the back doors open, leaving an oil stain and a silent warning. The stares... I felt them, the weight of strangeness and concern, from the students, from the security staff. But I saw nothing, felt nothing, heard nothing but Daniel's name resonating in my head. And rage... rage at the deception. And a desperation that screamed at me that I was the only one who could fix it. The only one who had realized. Or maybe, perhaps others also suspected, but no one had dared to do anything?

I burst into the first classroom I saw. The professor, halfway through an equation, looked at me, perplexed. My eyes scanned the students' faces, searching for the impostor, almost smelling the subtle changes. Nothing. I left, heading to the cafeteria, looking closely at each person, their expressions, their forced smiles. My pulse was a drum in my temples. He wasn't there. I went to the lab, to my office, even to the men's restroom. Where was he? Daniel's name choked in my throat, and frustration burned me.

Finally, I saw him... in a study room, hunched over some books, his backpack at his feet. The impostor. I entered like a fury. He looked up, his supposed student's eyes widened, not in surprise, but in genuine panic. Without hesitation, I pushed him against the wall, my hands gripping his shoulders. I needed to corner him, look at him closely, make sure he hadn't changed faces again.

""You! I know who you are! I know what you did! Deceiving everyone with that face! You're not Daniel! Tell me where they are! Where are the real ones!"" My words... every syllable was a hammer striking the truth. But Daniel, the impostor, just shook his head, his eyes pleading.

""Dr. R√≠os, please... What are you saying? Stop! You're hurting me!""

My hands, my nails, closed around his neck. I applied force. He kicked, his hands scratching mine, trying to break free, but I was the only one who could stop this. And fury gave me brutal strength, a strength I didn't know I had, a strength to avenge my David and my Daniel. I was strangling him. His legs moved frantically, then his movements became slower, more erratic. His face turned purple, his eyes bulging. He seemed to be losing consciousness... I wouldn't have to see this horrible creature using my student's face anymore. No longer.

It was then, as the impostor struggled for air, my free hand slipped inside my coat. My fingers grasped the familiar coldness of the knife handle. The same knife. The same one that had finished off the first one. I gripped it, the gleam of the metal promising the end of the deception. But just as I was about to raise my arm, chaos erupted around me. Screams. Heavy footsteps.

""Stop! Security! Let him go, Dr. R√≠os!""

A whirlwind of bodies surrounded me. Security guards, accompanied by more professors and students who lunged at me. I struggled, kicked, tried to stab him. But there were too many. My arms were pinned, the knife snatched from my hands with a sharp clang. They dragged me away from the impostor, who fell to the floor, coughing, his face bruised and red marks on his neck. Other students rushed to help him, their terror and relief palpable.

""They're impostors! All of you! You're deceiving me! Don't let them! Look closely at them! They're among us! You have to stop them!"" My words were drowned out by the noise, by the force with which they dragged me away. My eyes, fixed on the faces of those dragging me, of those looking at me with horror. To me, they were still the proof.

I woke up in a white, spotless room, with cold sheets on the bed. The smell of disinfectant was stronger here than in the hospital. The nurse, with a kind face but eyes that seemed to observe my every move, brought me a tray of bland food. It had been a while since I had last eaten. At some point, in my mind, I had believed the impostor had stopped moving.

I didn't clearly remember how I had gotten here, only fragments: the screams at the university, the force with which they dragged me away, the desperate warning to everyone about the impostors. And now, they had brought me to this place... the place where they had silenced me.

My mother came to see me, her eyes red and swollen. She hugged me, crying, begging me to let her help. She saw a broken daughter. I saw a mother who, like everyone else, had been deceived by the perfect masks. I tried to explain to her, again and again, the notebook, the changes in David, Daniel's coldness, and how I had gotten rid of the impostor who had taken my David. She just nodded, with that compassionate look that told me she didn't believe a word.

""You're tired, my love. You're very sick,"" she said.

Daniel, my student's impostor, didn't come. Which, for me, was a confirmation. One less. The university hadn't called me back. That was another sign. They were covering it up. Or planning their next move? At night, in the solitude of my room, my mind ran free. The logic of my own prison. I knew I was the only sane one in a world that had been invaded by those... damn impostors! All of this was their fault... I saw the news on a small television in the common room... faces that at first I didn't know were now familiar. But how many of them were also impostors? When had the world broken? What happened to the real people? Would they ever return?

The only certainty was that I, Samanta R√≠os, the cryptographer, was the only one who could see the truth. And that, in this white and silent place, was the heaviest burden of all. The medications dulled me, trying to cloud my perception. But they couldn't erase the image of his face. Nor the satisfaction of having stopped him. My David would return. I just needed to wait.",1,1749073003.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False
1l3htpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1l3htpw/that_face_continuation/,That face (continuation),"A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me. *Those* Daniel's eyes. I spoke of code efficiency, while my own mind was an indecipherable chaos. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

""A true cryptographer doesn't just decipher the code,"" I said, my voice rising a little higher than normal, ""they *feel* the logic, they *breathe* it. Where is that spark? Have you become mere automatons repeating what you're taught?"" I stared fixedly at Daniel, looking for a reaction.

His face remained expressionless, like a porcelain mask. ""Dr. R√≠os, emotional fervor is not a requirement for mathematical effectiveness,"" Daniel replied in a voice that was too calm, too perfect.

It was the last straw. My mind, which had resisted madness for weeks, broke in that instant. This impostor, this being who dared to imitate *my* Daniel, was challenging me, denying his own essence.

""You're not him!"" I screamed, my voice echoing in the stunned silence of the classroom. My hand slammed against the desk, sending papers and the pen flying. The graphic tablet fell to the floor with a dull thud. ""You're not Daniel! I don't know who you are, but you're not him!""

Heads turned. Murmurs erupted like a swarm of bees. Dozens of eyes, between confusion and fear, stared at me. I saw my students, other professors passing in the hallway, stop, their faces reflecting the same question: *Has Dr. R√≠os lost her mind?*

Suddenly, the fury dissipated, replaced by a cold, lacerating knowledge. It was me. *I* was the one who screamed. The one who lost control. The one who looked like a lunatic. The impostor... he remained as serene, as perfect as ever. Defeat struck me with the force of lightning. I had crumbled, and he had witnessed it.

Without another word, I clumsily gathered my bag, stumbling over a chair. I had to leave. I had to get away from those eyes, from that room full of accusing stares. I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me. His touch, again, that contact that was identical but felt so... false.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look. I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drop me off and pick me up from work, and my car was in the shop. I needed to get home. I needed my sanctuary. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real?

The ride to my apartment was agony. My head wouldn't stop processing, searching for logic in the chaos. I reached my door, flung it open, and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency overwhelmed me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of his closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A secret note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was.

But David wasn't in the apartment. It was almost three in the afternoon. He would be at work. What exactly was I looking for? My mind screamed in silence. I needed the impostor to tell me where he was. But he wasn't here. And I, only I, was completely alone with the hell in my own head.

A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me... those Daniel's eyes. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of ""passion"" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

""Dr. R√≠os! Wait! Samanta!""

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me.

""Let go of me!"" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look; I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drive me to and from work, but I needed to get home. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real? The ride to my apartment was agony. I reached my door, flung it open and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency invaded me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of the closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was. David wasn't in the apartment... it was almost three in the afternoon, so he would be at work. What exactly was I looking for?

Time faded in the urgency of my search. Finally, my gaze fell on the old wooden trunk that David had brought when he decided to stay and take care of me. It was his grandmother's, full of memories, and I had always considered it his personal treasure chest, something I respected and had never rummaged through. But now, privacy was a luxury I couldn't afford. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk. Inside, among old photo albums and yellowed letters, my fingers stumbled upon something hard. A notebook. It wasn't just any notebook. It was the small leather agenda David carried everywhere. The same one he used to jot down his ideas, his to-do lists, even small sketches. He never left it out in the open. He always kept it in an inside jacket pocket, or on his nightstand. How had I not noticed it was here, so exposed?

My hands trembled as I opened it. The first pages were grocery lists, meeting scribbles. Then, a series of dates and names I didn't recognize. But further on, on a page near the end, I found what I was looking for. A pattern. They weren't words, or codes, or hidden messages. They were a series of numbers, dates, and times, followed by brief descriptions:

""Samanta visit - OK"" ""Daniel coffee - No anomalies"" ""Call Samanta's mother - High concern""

And what chilled me to the bone:

""Table test (Monday) - No reaction"" ""Anecdote question (Tuesday) - Success"" ""Thesis (Wednesday) - All in order.""

It was a record. A logbook of my interactions with the impostor. Of my ""tests."" It was as if this being was monitoring my behavior, evaluating his own performance... assessing how convincing he was being, his success rate. I imagined this impostor making nocturnal reflections and considering which parts of his act he needed to refine. Rage boiled in me, but beneath it, a chilling terror spread. Not only was he an impostor, he was a methodical observer, a being who analyzed my paranoia and adjusted his facade.

My heart pounded so hard it resonated in my ears. The trunk, the things scattered across the floor... they didn't matter. The proof was there, in my hands. It was undeniable. This notebook was confirmation that the David with me was not my David. It was something far more sinister. A knock on the door. Then, the sound of a key turning.

David.

The seconds stretched. I dragged myself, the notebook clutched to my chest, to the darkest corner of my room. I curled up, knees drawn to my chest, feeling the cold of the wall against my back. I heard his footsteps in the living room, the rustle of the things I had thrown.

""Samanta? I'm here! Samanta!"" His voice, so familiar, but now laden with a concern that sounded like a sham.

I heard him enter the kitchen, then the bathroom. The footsteps approached my room. I didn't move, didn't breathe. The notebook was my shield and my weapon. This was the evidence. I was going to unmask him, no, I had to, and I had to know where my David was. The real one. The door to my room slowly opened. The hallway light spilled over the mess I had created. David stopped in the doorway, his face pale and his eyes wide with surprise at seeing the chaos.

""Samanta... What happened here? Are you okay?""

His gaze swept over the mess, then stopped on me, huddled in the corner. His face showed pure concern, the same face I had loved for years, but which now felt like a chilling mask. He didn't know I had the proof, and I was going to force him to confess.

""What do you want?"" I snapped, my voice harsh, charged with a fury I could barely contain. I stood up slowly, my muscles stiff, my eyes fixed on his.

He took a step towards me, hands raised in a reassuring gesture. ""I've been calling you, Sam. The university called your mom, she said you weren't well. They told me what happened in your class. I apologized for you, Sam, they... they're worried. *I'm* worried. You shouldn't have come back so soon, Sam. The doctors told you to relax.""

His words, so calm, so rational, only fueled my anger. Relax? After what I had seen? After what I knew? Apologize for me? Humiliation mixed with terror. This impostor was trying to control me, to cover up the truth with a pretense of concern.

""Worried?"" I let out a hollow laugh, full of bitterness. ""Sure, 'worried.' Do you know what we're talking about?""

He stopped. His gaze was confused, but I no longer believed him. ""Samanta, I know this is stress. What's happening to you is... It's a lot. We've talked to the dean, to some professors. Everyone understands that you need a break, away from everything. We've decided the best thing is for you to take a vacation.""

He came a little closer, and my heart clenched with a mix of dread and despair. ""I've been looking for a place,"" he continued, his voice soft, almost whispering. ""A center. Far from the city. No phone, no work, no anything. A place where you can detox from all this stress. Where you can be yourself again, *my* Samanta.""

A mental institution. A psychiatric center. The unspoken words echoed in the air, cold, relentless. He wanted to lock me up, he wanted to silence me. He knew... *He knew that I knew!* And this was his plan to neutralize me!

The notebook in my hands felt like a bomb about to explode. My mind stopped reasoning, stopped looking for logic. There was only one certainty: this being wanted to take my David, my Daniel, and now, *me*.

""No!"" I screamed, the sound tearing through the silence. ""You're not going to lock me up! I won't let you! I know who you are!""

He looked at me, perplexed. ""Samanta, what are you talking about?""

""No!"" I roared, my voice now a raw growl. I held up the notebook, showing it to him as if it were irrefutable proof. ""I know you're not David! Look at this! Look at your own damn record! I know about your 'tests,' your 'anomalies'! I know you're monitoring me, trying to perfect your role! I know you're an impostor!""

His eyes fell on the notebook. Confusion transformed into something else, a flash of surprise, then... understanding? But it wasn't the understanding of someone exposed, but of someone who had just solved a problem.

""Samanta, I don't understand... It's my agenda, yes, but what you're saying...""

""Shut up!"" Rage consumed me completely. I lunged at him, the notebook still held high. ""You're not going to trick me! Not again! Where is he?! Where is my David?! What did you do to him?! And Daniel! Where are they?! Tell me! Now!""

My hand lunged for his neck, my nails grazing his skin. Desperation gave me brutal strength. I pushed him against the wall, my eyes fixed on his, searching for any hint of fear, of recognition of his true nature. ""Tell me where they are! Tell me how to get them back! I swear, if you don't, I will kill you!""

The impostor tried to back away, his eyes filled with confusion tinged with profound pain. Tears welled in his eyelids. ""Samanta, please... You don't know what you're saying. It's the stress. It wasn't a good idea to go back to the university. You need help, my love.""

""Sam, please! You're hurting yourself! You're not well!""

He tried to grab me, but I struggled, my screams echoing in the apartment. I ran; I had to get out of that place... he ran after me. My thoughts were a whirlwind: I needed to hurt him, I needed to make him talk, to confess. He wasn't going to lock me up. I was going to bring them back.

My gaze locked onto the knife block on the counter. They gleamed under the kitchen light. They were my only chance. I lunged. The impostor, anticipating my intention, was faster. His strong hand closed over my wrist, preventing me from reaching a knife handle. We struggled, my rage against his strength. He was taller, stronger, and his eyes, clouded with tears, looked at me with a pity that infuriated me even more.

I felt his fingers squeeze mine, pulling me away from the knives. He was winning. He was going to immobilize me. I was going to lose. As we struggled, my other hand, the one he wasn't holding, slid across the counter. My fingers closed around something cold and metallic. The kitchen shears, the same ones we used to cut chicken. The imposter's face, contorted by the effort of restraining me, was inches from mine. My fist rose, the shears hidden in my palm. My mind processed the only solution I had left... and I did it.

As best I could and with what little strength I had, I plunged the kitchen shears into the impostor's arm, the very arm that held my wrist and partially immobilized me. Those hazel eyes looked at me with pain, pain and... pity? Damn crazy! What was he trying to do? His arm was hard, not like cement, more like old meat. Even so, I managed to pierce through layers of fabric, skin, and muscle. The impostor screamed, letting out a squeal like a pig being hit, and a crimson stain spread on his clothes. He released my wrist to grab his arm, where my precious shears were still lodged. I fell to the floor while he slid, leaning against the edge of the counter, to the floor. His grimaces of pain and the blood made me know that this impostor was not immortal. Maybe... if I got rid of him... my David would return! Why didn't I think of this before?! Of course!

Coming back to my senses, I noticed the impostor desperately checking his pant pockets, surely looking for his phone. I got up from the floor, approached the knife block, and took one of them. I'm glad I've always made sure to keep them sharp; what can I say? I like barbecues too much. Knife in hand, I walked up to the impostor. He was already dialing a number or searching through his contact list, but there was nothing he could do... I was going to get *MY* David back.

""Tell me where David is... NOW."" I said in a voice I didn't know I had, that I didn't know I could produce from my throat.

""Sam, please. Why are you doing this? Stop, let's talk... I need help, Sam."" He could only sob, only cry, only make that disgusting grimace of pain, the disgusting grimace that etched itself onto *my* David's precious face. I was not going to let this man or monster or thing, whatever it was... continue walking the world with *MY* David's face.

""Tell me... tell me what you've gained thanks to that face you have? How many more people have you been deceiving? Where the hell do impostors like you come from?"" I had never been so convinced of anything before in my life... and I had never felt so much... control.

""Sam, Sam, Sam... please, love, I need you to st...""

""Shut up! Your excuses are useless... admit you lost. Admit you both lost.""

""What? Who are you referri...?"" A glimmer of understanding crossed that face dampened by tears, sweat, and saliva... it was disgusting. ""NO! NO, Sam! Stop! Daniel is your student, your best student... Sam, please. You're going to ruin your career, your life... What the hell is happening to you?!"" His choked, pained voice sounded so desperate.

""What do you know about my life and my career?! Oh... right, you impostors have the memories of the people you take, right? With me, you never could, you never could... I noticed it right away, I was just waiting. I needed proof, I needed confirmations. And you've given them all to me..."" This voice coming from deep inside me was... ironic, soft, playful. I was enjoying it. And how could I not? I was about to get rid of one of the impostors... at last.

""Samanta! It's me, it's YOUR David. Please don't do something you might regr..."" And silence reigned in my apartment.

I crouched down to his level with the knife clenched in my hand. I gave him a small smile while, with all my strength, I plunged that knife into his damn mouth.

""Shut up, damn it! I'm sick of seeing you wearing his face."" I pulled the knife out and plunged it in again, this time into one of his eyes.

""You don't deserve to see with this face! You don't deserve to speak with that mouth! You don't deserve to breathe with MY David's face!"" I stabbed him again and again and again and again and again and again. Blood bathed his clothes, his face, my apartment floor, and myself until he stopped moving.

HE stopped struggling, stopped trying, stopped making those erratic movements that resembled convulsions. Finally! MY David would return... without this substitute, without this thing that stole the body and life of MY David, he... he would return. But the other one was missing... Daniel was missing. The idea, so clear, so irrefutable, invaded me like a purifying fire. I wasn't the only one affected; families, partners, friends, colleagues... all deceived by that false and perfect mask. By that detailed study of memories, manners, gestures, everything! I had to stop him.

Without a second thought, I grabbed David's car keys. I tossed them in my hand; the sound of the notebook, still on the floor, screamed at me that I wasn't wrong. I left the apartment. The cold air hit my face, but I didn't feel the cold as such; my mind was a tunnel, a direct highway, with no detours. David's car roared under my hands. Red light, I ignored it. A deafening horn, I ignored that too. People walking, other cars. Nothing. My only goal was to get there, to put an end to all this. Daniel's image, his face... repeated in my mind like a furious mantra: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

I arrived at campus. I didn't park. I didn't bother to turn off the engine or lock the car. I just left the car askew, the tires screeching on the pavement, and shot out, the back doors open, leaving an oil stain and a silent warning. The stares... I felt them, the weight of strangeness and concern, from the students, from the security staff. But I saw nothing, felt nothing, heard nothing but Daniel's name resonating in my head. And rage... rage at the deception. And a desperation that screamed at me that I was the only one who could fix it. The only one who had realized. Or maybe, perhaps others also suspected, but no one had dared to do anything?

I burst into the first classroom I saw. The professor, halfway through an equation, looked at me, perplexed. My eyes scanned the students' faces, searching for the impostor, almost smelling the subtle changes. Nothing. I left, heading to the cafeteria, looking closely at each person, their expressions, their forced smiles. My pulse was a drum in my temples. He wasn't there. I went to the lab, to my office, even to the men's restroom. Where was he? Daniel's name choked in my throat, and frustration burned me.

Finally, I saw him... in a study room, hunched over some books, his backpack at his feet. The impostor. I entered like a fury. He looked up, his supposed student's eyes widened, not in surprise, but in genuine panic. Without hesitation, I pushed him against the wall, my hands gripping his shoulders. I needed to corner him, look at him closely, make sure he hadn't changed faces again.

""You! I know who you are! I know what you did! Deceiving everyone with that face! You're not Daniel! Tell me where they are! Where are the real ones!"" My words... every syllable was a hammer striking the truth. But Daniel, the impostor, just shook his head, his eyes pleading.

""Dr. R√≠os, please... What are you saying? Stop! You're hurting me!""

My hands, my nails, closed around his neck. I applied force. He kicked, his hands scratching mine, trying to break free, but I was the only one who could stop this. And fury gave me brutal strength, a strength I didn't know I had, a strength to avenge my David and my Daniel. I was strangling him. His legs moved frantically, then his movements became slower, more erratic. His face turned purple, his eyes bulging. He seemed to be losing consciousness... I wouldn't have to see this horrible creature using my student's face anymore. No longer.

It was then, as the impostor struggled for air, my free hand slipped inside my coat. My fingers grasped the familiar coldness of the knife handle. The same knife. The same one that had finished off the first one. I gripped it, the gleam of the metal promising the end of the deception. But just as I was about to raise my arm, chaos erupted around me. Screams. Heavy footsteps.

""Stop! Security! Let him go, Dr. R√≠os!""

A whirlwind of bodies surrounded me. Security guards, accompanied by more professors and students who lunged at me. I struggled, kicked, tried to stab him. But there were too many. My arms were pinned, the knife snatched from my hands with a sharp clang. They dragged me away from the impostor, who fell to the floor, coughing, his face bruised and red marks on his neck. Other students rushed to help him, their terror and relief palpable.

""They're impostors! All of you! You're deceiving me! Don't let them! Look closely at them! They're among us! You have to stop them!"" My words were drowned out by the noise, by the force with which they dragged me away. My eyes, fixed on the faces of those dragging me, of those looking at me with horror. To me, they were still the proof.

I woke up in a white, spotless room, with cold sheets on the bed. The smell of disinfectant was stronger here than in the hospital. The nurse, with a kind face but eyes that seemed to observe my every move, brought me a tray of bland food. It had been a while since I had last eaten. At some point, in my mind, I had believed the impostor had stopped moving.

I didn't clearly remember how I had gotten here, only fragments: the screams at the university, the force with which they dragged me away, the desperate warning to everyone about the impostors. And now, they had brought me to this place... the place where they had silenced me.

My mother came to see me, her eyes red and swollen. She hugged me, crying, begging me to let her help. She saw a broken daughter. I saw a mother who, like everyone else, had been deceived by the perfect masks. I tried to explain to her, again and again, the notebook, the changes in David, Daniel's coldness, and how I had gotten rid of the impostor who had taken my David. She just nodded, with that compassionate look that told me she didn't believe a word.

""You're tired, my love. You're very sick,"" she said.

Daniel, my student's impostor, didn't come. Which, for me, was a confirmation. One less. The university hadn't called me back. That was another sign. They were covering it up. Or planning their next move? At night, in the solitude of my room, my mind ran free. The logic of my own prison. I knew I was the only sane one in a world that had been invaded by those... damn impostors! All of this was their fault... I saw the news on a small television in the common room... faces that at first I didn't know were now familiar. But how many of them were also impostors? When had the world broken? What happened to the real people? Would they ever return?

The only certainty was that I, Samanta R√≠os, the cryptographer, was the only one who could see the truth. And that, in this white and silent place, was the heaviest burden of all. The medications dulled me, trying to cloud my perception. But they couldn't erase the image of his face. Nor the satisfaction of having stopped him. My David would return. I just needed to wait.",1,1749072934.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

*Run the Nomad Income Detector‚Ñ¢ to uncover Your Nomadic Income profile*  
*[Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

You think you're living the dream‚Äîworking remotely while sipping coffee on a beach in Bali, but here's the catch: your income isn't invisible to governments. Every digital nomad who dreams of freedom must face one harsh truth: taxes don‚Äôt stop just because you do.

The myth of tax-free travel is seductive. It paints a picture of endless horizons and zero responsibilities. But the reality is far more complex. Governments are smart. They track not just where you live, but how long you stay, what kind of work you do, and whether you‚Äôve declared it. And they‚Äôre getting better at it every day.

*üö® Want to know if your current setup could land you in tax trouble? Run the free diagnostic now: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

Let‚Äôs cut through the noise. Tax residency isn‚Äôt just about having a house in a country. It‚Äôs about where you spend most of your time, where your bank accounts are, and even where your children attend school. If you cross that invisible line‚Äîoften 183 days a year‚Äîyou might suddenly find yourself liable for local taxes.

But it doesn‚Äôt end there. Countries have different rules. Some offer favorable treatment to remote workers, others slap you with penalties. You can‚Äôt treat them all the same. You need a strategy. And that starts with understanding the basics.

---

Double taxation agreements exist to prevent you from being taxed twice on the same income. Sounds great, right? But these treaties are written in legalese, and their benefits often depend on how you structure your finances. One wrong move and you could end up paying more than if you‚Äôd stayed home.

DTAAs aren‚Äôt a magic shield. They require careful planning. For example, some countries only exempt income if you meet specific criteria like holding a certain type of visa or not receiving public services. You can‚Äôt assume your income is automatically protected.

*üöÄ Ready to decode your tax obligations across borders? Let‚Äôs get started: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

Freelancers, independent contractors, and gig workers face unique challenges. Unlike traditional employees, you don‚Äôt have a payroll department handling your taxes. You invoice clients, and that‚Äôs when the clock starts ticking. Each payment is a potential taxable event, and if you‚Äôre not tracking it, you‚Äôre risking everything.

Invoicing without proper documentation is like playing Russian roulette with your finances. You need records, receipts, and a clear paper trail. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be scrambling during tax season trying to piece together where your money came from‚Äîand where it should go next.

---

Cryptocurrency adds another layer of complexity. If you earned Bitcoin in Dubai and sold it in Thailand, which country‚Äôs tax laws apply? The answer isn‚Äôt always clear. Staking rewards, mining profits, and even crypto tips count as taxable income in many jurisdictions.

This frontier is still evolving, but one thing is certain: governments are watching. If you‚Äôre using crypto to mask income or avoid reporting, you‚Äôre playing a dangerous game. Transparency is key‚Äîeven if it feels counterintuitive.

Social security contributions are another minefield. If you freelance, you‚Äôre likely responsible for both the employer and employee portions of social security taxes. In the US, this means self-employment taxes (SECA), which can take a hefty chunk out of your earnings.

And let‚Äôs not forget, if you work in a foreign country, you may also be required to pay into their social security system. That‚Äôs where reciprocity agreements come in‚Äîbut again, they‚Äôre not universal and often have strict conditions.

*üí° Still unsure where you stand? Get clarity now: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

The IRS hasn‚Äôt been sitting idle either. With the rise of remote work, they‚Äôve ramped up enforcement against offshore tax evasion. Programs like FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) require financial institutions to report accounts held by US citizens abroad. If you‚Äôre hiding assets, the IRS will find them.

Expatriate tax exclusions exist, but they come with strings attached. You must meet strict requirements, including physical presence and income thresholds. Even then, you might still owe taxes on certain types of income. This is not the wild west‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully policed territory.

---

Self-employment taxes are the silent drain on your earnings. Whether you file as an LLC, sole proprietor, or something else, you‚Äôre on the hook for quarterly payments. Failing to do so can lead to penalties, interest, and even legal action.

Deducting expenses is part of the game, but it requires discipline. From laptops to Wi-Fi bills, you need to track every business expense. Otherwise, you‚Äôre leaving money on the table‚Äîor worse, overpaying.

Tax evasion is a criminal offense, but tax optimization is a legitimate strategy. The line between the two is razor-thin. What looks like a clever loophole to you could be seen as fraud to the authorities. Proceed with caution.

*üîë Don‚Äôt risk it all blindly‚Äîknow where you stand: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

Health insurance is another area where digital nomads stumble. Many rely on domestic health plans, but those may not cover you overseas. Others try to use HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) as a tax-advantaged way to fund coverage. Either way, you need to understand the implications.

Passive income‚Äîrental income, dividends, interest‚Äîis often overlooked. If you own property in a foreign country or earn investment income while traveling, you must declare it. Ignoring these sources can trigger audits and costly corrections.

---

Estate planning is rarely discussed in the context of digital nomadism, but it‚Äôs essential. If you die without a will, your assets could be distributed according to the laws of the last country you lived in. That‚Äôs not ideal. Setting up trusts or other structures ensures your wishes are honored.

Tax professionals are worth their weight in gold. They help you navigate the maze of international tax law, identify deductions, and avoid common pitfalls. Don‚Äôt try to handle it alone unless you enjoy surprises.

Software solutions are emerging to simplify the process. Platforms tailored for remote workers automate tax filing, track expenses, and ensure compliance across multiple jurisdictions. These tools are becoming indispensable for serious digital nomads.

*üß© Need a roadmap before diving in? Discover your path today: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

Offshore bank accounts may seem like a way to protect your privacy, but they come with risks. Secret accounts can attract attention from regulators. The cost of secrecy is high, and it often outweighs the benefits.

If you‚Äôre audited, it‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äúif,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù Red flags include inconsistent income reporting, unexplained cash flows, and frequent changes in residency. Being prepared is the only defense.

The future of taxation for digital nomads is uncertain but inevitable. As remote work becomes the norm, governments are pushing for global standards. Tech-driven systems are making it easier to track and collect taxes, regardless of where you live.

---

Staying compliant doesn‚Äôt have to feel like climbing Everest. With the right tools and strategies, you can manage your taxes effectively without losing your mind. Start by building a system that works for your lifestyle and income sources.

You‚Äôre not just chasing sunsets and surfboards anymore. You‚Äôre navigating a complex web of tax laws, treaties, and obligations. The question isn‚Äôt whether you should pay taxes‚Äîit‚Äôs how to do it smartly.

*‚ú® Don‚Äôt wait for problems to arise‚Äîact now: [Start Diagnostic NOW](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

So, are digital nomads paying taxes? Absolutely. The challenge is doing so correctly. With the right knowledge and tools, you can keep more of what you earn while staying on the right side of the law.

The road ahead is paved with opportunity, but it‚Äôs also lined with traps. Don‚Äôt let taxes derail your journey. Take control today and make informed decisions tomorrow.

I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn‚Äôt even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that‚Äôs what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou‚Äôs guys their morning pleasantries.

‚ÄúMorning, Brandon‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, Jo‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the Dream‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dream or someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we‚Äôve had about a thousand times now.

*It‚Äôs too bad.*

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at ‚ÄúLou‚Äôs Plumbing and Heating Co.‚Äù Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

‚ÄúHere comes the straggler!‚Äù says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn‚Äôt say walk. It‚Äôs more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He‚Äôs a dick. He‚Äôs also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He‚Äôs been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

*Lies.*

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHoly shit, you know how to read?‚Äù says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre one to talk, didn‚Äôt your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn‚Äôt even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúLadies please‚Äù

In walks Bill. He‚Äôs our boss and Lou‚Äôs adopted brother.

‚ÄúWhat my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.‚Äù I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

‚ÄúHey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just decommissioning it, we‚Äôre replacing it, Jo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.‚Äù

*They're all burning.*

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you‚Äôll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

‚ÄúFuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh, how big is the contract?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve million‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?‚Äù

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

‚ÄúAre we removing the old boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly, we‚Äôre going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.‚Äù

Whatever you do won‚Äôt work. It will happen again.

‚ÄúWhen can I see the plans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNext week, I‚Äôll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.‚Äù

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we‚Äôve had since 1987. We‚Äôre real cavemen here at Lou‚Äôs. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just so the old bat, who‚Äôs been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She‚Äôs a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

‚ÄúSo Darryl, what do you have for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember Frank?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank Sinatra?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Farmer Frank, your best buddy.‚Äù

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he‚Äôs my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs going on at my buddy‚Äôs place?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn‚Äôt do anything to help his situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.‚Äù

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I‚Äôm more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

‚ÄúHe asked for you, he‚Äôs been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It‚Äôs a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd take Mini Zeke with you. Can‚Äôt leave the boy sheltered all day and I can‚Äôt send him with Turd.‚Äù

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn‚Äôt hear what Darryl said.

*He hears everything.*

I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He‚Äôs a wizard. He can look at a system that‚Äôs just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was‚Ä¶

Interesting.

‚ÄúJohnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,‚Äù he said angrily.

‚ÄúGreedy fucker.‚Äù

‚ÄúLou never listens when we tell him anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That‚Äôs an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there‚Äôs never enough heat coming out of them.‚Äù I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, ‚ÄúBecause when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.‚Äù

I chuckled at that.

‚ÄúWhatcha laughing about boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember the old Angel Fire commercials?‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.‚Äù

We‚Äôre the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

‚ÄúHe gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven‚Äôt changed. Sure they‚Äôve gotten smaller, more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we‚Äôll get the call saying it‚Äôs too cold. Lou‚Äôs pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. ‚ÄúNobody makes a furnace for our weather, it‚Äôs -50 some days, and 30 above the next.‚Äù He‚Äôs right when you‚Äôre dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they‚Äôre selling at the supplier they‚Äôre great. The only issue is that they get too hot‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

‚ÄúSo what do you figure is wrong with Frank‚Äôs? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, Franks a smart old fucker, he‚Äôd have checked that. He only calls if he can‚Äôt figure it out.‚Äù

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

‚ÄúI reckon it‚Äôs the burner box, there‚Äôs a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I‚Äôve only ever changed one in 40 years.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why do you think it‚Äôs that then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that‚Äôs why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.‚Äù

*When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.*

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou‚Äôs part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn‚Äôt work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou‚Äôs. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.‚Äù

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about The Plant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.‚Äù

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the barn‚Äù

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They‚Äôre big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

‚ÄúThat must be Frank,‚Äù Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

‚ÄúHey, Frank!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, how are you now boys?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood and you?‚Äù Me and Mini said at the same time.

‚ÄúBetter since you two are here.‚Äù

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70‚Äôs, still spry for an old fella.

*Tic toc, tic toc.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the damn thing, I can‚Äôt get it to light, I can‚Äôt get the pump to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck boys‚Äù

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn‚Äôt get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could‚Äôve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.

‚ÄúWell Mini, want to try the thermal reset?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you said there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the thermal reset.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, is it possible I was wrong and there‚Äôs only one way to cut power to the entire system and it‚Äôs through that reset, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,‚Äù he says as a smirk appears on his face. ‚ÄúSmart ass‚Äù

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he‚Äôs got a manual for this thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. ‚ÄúSo does he have anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúSays he might have it in his attic. He‚Äôll come over if he finds it.‚Äù

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the manual boys.‚Äù

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It‚Äôs said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

*4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.*

‚ÄúThanks, Frank‚Äù

Frank walked back to his tractor

‚ÄúAlright Mini, keep cleaning, I‚Äôm going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be nice, sit in the heat and I‚Äôll stay out here and freeze.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have been a smart ass then.‚Äù

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

*When hell freezes over.*

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

‚ÄúHow the fuck did Johnny change that?‚Äù I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

‚ÄúYea?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it in the furnace.‚Äù

He paused

‚ÄúUnderneath it was the thermal reset switch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Mini?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt warm when I grabbed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFurnace could‚Äôve still been holding some heat.‚Äù I reassured him.

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to Frank about it. Don‚Äôt worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù

I‚Äôd started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it‚Äôs just my imagination. It must‚Äôve taken longer to get here than I thought.

‚ÄúFucking Lou should‚Äôve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.‚Äù

Customers don‚Äôt like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

‚ÄúHey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dog?‚Äù He solemnly chuckled

‚ÄúSadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn‚Äôt want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.‚Äù

He laughed sadly again.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing, but the‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my wife. She went missing last year‚Ä¶ the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that again Frank.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, she wasn‚Äôt herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn‚Äôt my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I‚Äôm sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I‚Äôll let you get back to work.‚Äù

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

‚ÄúHuh, must‚Äôve been a longer chat than I thought.‚Äù

Mini was covered in soot.

‚ÄúHey Mini, are you running for office with that face?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He said curtly

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want this job to be done. I want to go home.‚Äù

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. ‚ÄúDamn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.‚Äù

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. ‚ÄúMini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.‚Äù The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

‚ÄúThat was easy. Got the new one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

And with that, it was in.

‚ÄúMini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.‚Äù As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

‚ÄúMini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I‚Äôll go fire on the pumps inside.‚Äù

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

‚ÄúHuh, didn‚Äôt think that walk was very long. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.‚Äù

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking creep up and scare me like that, you‚Äôve done that four times already.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you're going crazy buddy, here I‚Äôll take the bill and tell Frank he‚Äôs all good.‚Äù

*Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.*

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

*And close the door.*

I shouted

‚ÄúFRANK!‚Äù

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

I'm depressed. I barely go outside because I don't have the energy to. I'm a college student, I live with my older siblings, mostly one. Every room is hard to stay in.

The living room - I sleep there, on the couch. I can't fully open the blinds because there are no curtains and we're on ground level. I put up some heavy curtains with some thread that I tied on the windows, but I can barely open the window now. The room is never bright. There are ants under the couch I sleep on. They've been climbing on the couch these past few days. My legs and head hitch because I'm scared of having ants walking over me. In the evening, I sometimes notice that the floor wasn't swept well enough and there are clusters of ants under the coffee table, right in front of the couch. I have to spray them then crush them with toilet paper and I can feel them through the paper. It's hard to sleep.

The WC - There's water dripping down from the ceiling and into a bucket. There are two holes now, I'm scared there might be more to come. The toilet paper is on a cardboard box on the floor. It was directly on the floor before, so at least it's not dirty now.

The kitchen - There used to be ants there too. I hate the kitchen because the fridge is always filled with the most nonsensical things. There are 4 packs of cheese right now. They're all open. There's always food going bad or already completely rotten. If it's not in the fridge, it's food containing dairy and meat that has been left out overnight. I used to be okay about cooking, but now I hate it because everything goes into the trash anyway. Everyday I cook, and everyday I know at least a third of it is going to get thrown away. I spend too much on groceries, but I feel like we're never going to eat vegetables if I don't buy them. I'm tired.

The hallway - I can hear every noise from outside the apartment. It's stressful, because I sometimes feel like people are opening doors inside the apartment. I got quite used to it, now.

The bathroom - It's not that bad. I guess I only dislike it because it's where I see my reflection. Messy hair, dark circles and dry skin because I can't be bothered to care anymore.

The bedroom - My sibling's bedroom. The only place that feels safe. It's a bit messy, but I can fully open the blinds. I can open the window too, even if it smells like gas and oil outside sometimes. There are no ants anymore. The noises that come from inside or outside the apartment are easy to distinguish. The heater is still attached to the wall. But my sibling sleeps there, and my sibling stresses me out.

I need money so I can leave. I've been living here for more than a year and a half now. I can't wait to graduate get a job so I can leave before the year ends and get away from everything. I'm tired.",1,1749072672.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Future Mate,

I‚Äôm a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who‚Äôs also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I‚Äôm talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I‚Äôve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something‚Äôs missing... a mate who‚Äôs down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some ‚Äúlife unpacking‚Äù over coffee or a fire pit.

What I‚Äôm not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

**How Many Hours a Day Do Digital Nomads Work?**

The digital nomad lifestyle isn‚Äôt just about beaches and co-working spaces‚Äîit‚Äôs a rebellion against the 9-to-5 grind. But here‚Äôs the unspoken truth: freedom doesn‚Äôt come without its costs. You‚Äôre trading office walls for airport lounges, but your hours? They might still feel like a cage.

Let‚Äôs cut through the hype. Digital nomads work *on average* 40‚Äì50 hours a week, but the devil‚Äôs in the details. Some burn the midnight oil in Bali, while others chase sunrise productivity in Lisbon. The myth of the ‚Äú4-hour workday‚Äù is just that‚Äîa myth. The reality is a chaotic dance between client demands, time zones, and the relentless pressure to outwork everyone else.

**Average Hours vs. Traditional 9-to-5**

You‚Äôre not clocking in at an office, but your hours might still mirror the corporate grind. A 2020 Gallup poll revealed 67% of remote workers wanted to keep their newfound flexibility post-pandemic. Yet, 50% of digital nomads report working the same or more hours than before. The illusion of freedom? You‚Äôre just trading a cubicle for a beach chair.

The key difference? Flexibility. A digital nomad in Chiang Mai might work 10 AM‚Äì2 PM, then surf until sunset. But this isn‚Äôt laziness‚Äîit‚Äôs a calculated strategy. Time zones are your weapon. Work when your clients are asleep, and sleep when they‚Äôre awake. But don‚Äôt confuse this with leisure. The hours just look different.

**Peak Productivity Times and Chronotype Chameleons**

Digital nomads aren‚Äôt robots. Your body has a rhythm, and ignoring it is a recipe for disaster. Some are larks, rising at dawn with a coffee in hand. Others are owls, hitting their stride after midnight. The best nomads? They‚Äôre *chronotype chameleons*, adapting to their environment like a lizard changing colors.

But here‚Äôs the rub: clients don‚Äôt care about your circadian rhythm. A designer in Phuket might start at 6 AM to meet a U.S. deadline, then crash at 9 PM. Meanwhile, a developer in Lisbon might work 10 PM‚Äì4 AM to align with European clients. The result? A fractured sense of time, where ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hours are a relic.

**Work-Life Balance Dilemmas**

Balance isn‚Äôt a myth‚Äîit‚Äôs a myth you‚Äôve been sold. Digital nomads live in a liminal space where work and life bleed together. Your laptop is your lifeline, but it‚Äôs also your prison. A 2021 FlexJobs survey found 60% of nomads earn less than $50K annually. When your income is tied to hustle, when do you stop?

The answer? You don‚Äôt. Many nomads work 12-hour days to make ends meet, then scramble to find ‚Äúfun‚Äù in between. The irony? You‚Äôre traveling the world but still feel trapped. The solution? Build passive income streams. Real estate, dividends, or affiliate marketing‚Äîanything to reduce the pressure of hourly hustle.

[*Start Diagnostic NOW*](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

**Client Demands and Time Zone Juggling**

Clients are the puppet masters. A copywriter in Bali might juggle three time zones, answering emails at 6 AM for a German client, coding at noon for a U.S. startup, and wrapping up at 6 PM for a UK agency. This isn‚Äôt multitasking‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-time circus act.

The stakes are high. A missed deadline in one zone can tank your reputation. To survive, you become a time zone ninja. Tools like World Time Buddy and Trello become your lifeline. But even with planning, the chaos is relentless. You‚Äôre not just working‚Äîyou‚Äôre constantly calculating, negotiating, and adapting.

**Income Level and Financial Pressure**

Money talks, and it‚Äôs not pretty. The 2021 FlexJobs data shows 40% of nomads earn $50K or more, but 60% make less. If you‚Äôre in the lower bracket, your hours are a numbers game. You‚Äôll work longer, take on more clients, and sacrifice quality for quantity.

The pressure to hustle is everywhere. Blogs tout ‚Äúside hustles,‚Äù and influencers flaunt their $10K/mo incomes. But behind the curtain? Many are burning out. A 2020 study found 35% of nomads experience burnout within two years. The lesson? Income isn‚Äôt just about hours‚Äîit‚Äôs about strategy.

**Burnout and Mental Fatigue**

Burnout isn‚Äôt a phase‚Äîit‚Äôs a phaseout. Digital nomads face a unique cocktail of stressors: isolation, unstable income, and the constant grind to outperform. The brain isn‚Äôt built to work 10-hour days in a tropical paradise. It‚Äôs a recipe for mental exhaustion.

The symptoms are insidious. You‚Äôll start skipping workouts, ignoring friends, and questioning your life choices. A 2022 Outsite survey found 50% of nomads reported anxiety or depression. The antidote? Boundaries. Schedule ‚Äúoff‚Äù hours, take breaks, and invest in mental health. But in a world that glorifies hustle, this is easier said than done.

**Physical Health Implications**

Your body is the first casualty of long hours. Sitting in co-working spaces for 10+ hours a day leads to back pain, eye strain, and poor posture. A 2023 study linked nomadic work to a 20% increase in musculoskeletal issues. You‚Äôre not just working‚Äîyou‚Äôre aging faster.

The solution? Motion. Stand-up desks, yoga, and walking meetings are non-negotiable. But again, the hustle culture pushes you to ‚Äúgrind through the pain.‚Äù The truth? Your body can‚Äôt keep up with your ambitions. Prioritize health over hustle.

**Time Blocking and Pomodoro Techniques**

Time blocking is the nomad‚Äôs secret weapon. By scheduling every hour, you create structure in a chaotic world. A designer in Costa Rica might block 9‚Äì11 AM for client work, 11‚Äì1 PM for emails, and 2‚Äì4 PM for creative projects. The key? Stick to the blocks like they‚Äôre sacred.

The Pomodoro Technique is your ally. Work 25 minutes, rest 5. It‚Äôs brutal but effective. The trick is to batch similar tasks. Don‚Äôt let your inbox eat your day. And when the blocks fail? That‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôve lost control.

**Leveraging Automation Tools**

Automation isn‚Äôt just for robots‚Äîit‚Äôs for survival. Tools like Zapier, Trello, and Notion streamline your workflow. A content creator in Mexico might automate social media posts, while a developer in Lisbon uses GitHub for version control. The goal? Reduce repetitive tasks and focus on high-value work.

But automation has limits. It can‚Äôt replace creativity or client relationships. Use it to buy time, not to eliminate the need for hustle. The best nomads are those who automate the mundane and outsource the complex.

**Freelance Designer in Bali**

Meet Alex, a graphic designer who splits his time between Bali and Barcelona. He works 9‚Äì1 PM local time to meet U.S. clients, then surfs until 5 PM. His secret? Passive income from stock photography sales. This buffer lets him take days off without financial panic.

But it‚Äôs not perfect. Alex admits to working 12-hour days during tax season. His advice? ‚ÄúPlan your breaks like you plan your projects.‚Äù

**IT Consultant in Lisbon**

Maria, an IT consultant, thrives on time zone arbitrage. She works 10 PM‚Äì4 AM to align with European clients, then sleeps in and freelances for U.S. startups from 10 AM‚Äì2 PM. Her income is stable, but the hours are grueling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a night owl,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut even owls need to roost.‚Äù

Her solution? A strict shutdown at 4 AM. She‚Äôs learned that sleep isn‚Äôt a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity.

**AI and Automation Redefining Productivity**

The future is here, and it‚Äôs coded. AI tools like Jasper and [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai) are rewriting the rules of content creation. A digital nomad can now generate 10 blog drafts in the time it took to write one. But this isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. The real win is using AI to outsource menial tasks and focus on strategy.

The catch? AI can‚Äôt build relationships or think creatively. It‚Äôs a tool, not a replacement. The best nomads will be those who master both human and machine.

**Global Work Culture Shifts**

Companies are catching up. Remote work is no longer a perk‚Äîit‚Äôs a standard. But this shift creates new challenges. Nomads must now compete with global talent, and clients expect 24/7 availability. The playing field is flattening, and the pressure to work more is rising.

The answer? Niche expertise. Focus on a skill that can‚Äôt be outsourced. Become the go-to expert in your field, and you‚Äôll dictate the terms‚Äînot the other way around.

**Crafting Your Nomadic Work Ethic**

Your work ethic is your weapon. The digital nomad lifestyle isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it‚Äôs for those who refuse to be boxed in. The hours you work will vary, but your strategy should be unwavering. Automate, delegate, and outsource. Protect your time like it‚Äôs gold.

And when the hustle gets too loud? Take a breath. The world is vast, and so are your possibilities. But remember: freedom isn‚Äôt free. It‚Äôs earned in every hour you choose to work, and every hour you choose to rest.

1l3hmir,https://i.redd.it/hnlahfycaz4f1.jpeg,I guess I‚Äôm just burnt out (USA),"Got promoted as a manager when the new gm showed up without a team. She took over this store with limited amount of managers and so three months later I started to take responsibilities(without  the right pay) for two months to open at 4AM for them.
Rarely got treated right and respected as a manager at the beginning. People don‚Äôt listen to me but when it comes to duties and responsibilities I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs on the grill. 
First got told on the phone I‚Äôll be paid 16.5/hour and in my state it was nearly minimum wage for a manager. Months later found out on my paper check I was paid 16/hour as rate. Talked on the phone with gm and she claimed that she didn‚Äôt have a clue and all the payment information was sent the right way to the supervisor and the owner. Then waited for another month to now, still no update of whether it‚Äôs fixed or not.
I work morning rush hours and 75% of the time I don‚Äôt have enough people to handle sending breaks and sometimes I even ended up only having 2 people in front. Sales are good on the amount in the morning but because of all the promos and discounts we don‚Äôt generally sell a lot of money, which resorts to a higher labor number before noon. And because the new gm cares about her KPI a lot, like she needs it to prove that she can do a good job(which I understand), I end up being sent home early once or twice a week.

Financially it‚Äôs a small amount taken out of my check, but the unfairness stays within. I was able to run the floor to make OEPE consistently stay around 85 seconds to 108 seconds, which are really good numbers compared to the rest of the day. My gm first complimented the whole morning team in the group chat, then later on, asked me(the floor manager) to clock out 15 minutes early and leave at 10:45AM.

I worked hard. Got in very early at 4AM when most people can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to. Busted my a** for the rush hour with hundreds of orders just by the drive thru. Then when not needed, I‚Äôm the first to go home.
The funny thing is they brought up this whole FIFO thing for fixing labor, saying first come in should be first to leave because schedule is easier to fix with people coming later still being there. I get it, it‚Äôs got a point for working the whole schedule system but it means unfair treatment to the morning shift people having to wake up super early to help and ended up mostly not having enough hours to make a living.

I guess I‚Äôm a little burnt out. I feel like being used a little. 
I‚Äôm starting to apply elsewhere to build more connections from a second job, part time and resume up myself before leaving. I still plan to leave with strategy. Make sure I have another job first so that I don‚Äôt starve myself.

Just checked my steps today and it said I walked 10KM just today from inside to parked cars (We parked every car when the food isn‚Äôt ready from the kitchen and 80% of the time when people ordered big breakfast or bagels, we have to park them)

I‚Äôm very tired every day. I work window, food packaging, making coffee, running parked cars every morning for hours before the manager who‚Äôs always late showing up at 8:30ish to have enough people to send breaks, and that‚Äôs 4 hours and a half non stop working for me every morning.

Just venting here. Hopefully got some response. Or maybe just some messages to make me feel better. I‚Äôll survive for sure. ",4,1749072438.0,McDonaldsEmployees,1,1.0,False

1l3hhru,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1l3hhru/nuvio_streams_everything_you_need_to_know_qa/,[ NUVIO STREAMS ] Everything You Need to Know- Q&A,"Hey r/StremioAddons and Nuvio Users!

After all the questions and comments lately, I thought it would be helpful to put together this Q&A about the Nuvio Streams Addon. I'll try to cover everything important and be transparent about how things work.

# üîó Quick Links

* [**Nuvio Streams Addon Page**](https://beta.stremio-addons.net/addons/nuvio-streams) \- Install or rate the addon
* [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon) \- Source code and issues
* [**Koyeb Public Instance**](https://aesthetic-jodie-tapframe-ab46446c.koyeb.app/) \- Current public instance
* [**Vercel Public Instance**](https://nuvio-streams.vercel.app/) \- Still online (uncertain duration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Slow Streaming/Buffering Without a Personal Cookie? ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Many users who aren't using their own personal FebBox cookie are experiencing significant slowdowns, buffering, and failed streams with the ShowBox provider. These streams will have a `[SLOW]` tag next to them, so you can easily identify them.

The reason is pretty straightforward - the default shared cookies have monthly quotas (FebBox gives 100GB of fast streaming per month), and these get used up really quickly when lots of people are using the same cookies.

**Want better performance? Set up your own personal FebBox cookie.** When you have your own cookie configured, your ShowBox links will show a ‚ö° lightning emoji instead, which means they'll be much faster and more reliable. Just click the ""How to Get"" button next to the cookie input if you need help with this.

**Q1: What exactly is Nuvio Streams?** A: It's a Stremio addon that finds direct streaming links from various public websites. No torrents or P2P stuff - just direct HTTP links you can stream right away.

**Q2: Who is this addon for?** A: Mainly for:

* People who prefer direct streaming links over debrid services
* Users who understand that scrapers rely on public sources that can be unreliable
* Anyone willing to take a few minutes to set things up properly (especially the cookie part)

# Features & Providers

**Q3: What's new in the latest versions?** A: I've added quite a few things:

* **New Providers:** Hianime for anime content
* **Provider Selection:** You can now pick which providers to use (turn off the ones you don't need)
* **Quality Filters:** Set minimum quality preferences if you only want HD content
* **Backend Improvements:** Various optimizations that you won't see but will definitely feel
* **Open Source:** The addon is now on GitHub ([Repository Link](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon))

**Q4: Which providers are currently available?** A: The addon includes several providers for movies, TV shows, and anime content. For the most up-to-date list of available providers and their features, please visit the addon configuration page. Provider availability may change over time as streaming sites evolve.

# Performance & Reliability

**Q5: Why does fetching streams sometimes take time?** A: A few things contribute to this:

* **Multiple Providers:** The addon has to check several different sources
* **Provider Speed:** Some sites are just slower than others
* **Your Connection:** Your internet speed and traffic can affect things
* **Server Load:** Public instances get hammered with requests from many users
* **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Sites use Cloudflare and other protections that we have to work around

**Q6: How reliable is this addon long-term?** A: Let's be honest - this is a **scraper addon**, so:

* **No Guarantees:** It only works as long as the sites it scrapes from don't change or block us. When they do (and they will), that source stops working until I can fix it.
* **Limited Resources:** I'm just one person working on this in my spare time.
* **Personal Project:** I built this to learn and to share something useful with the community.

**Q7: What's the difference between using your own cookie vs. the default?** A: Night and day difference:

* **Without Your Own Cookie:** You're sharing with everyone else. The 100GB monthly quota gets used up quickly, and you're limited to streams under 9GB (no 4K). Result: slow, unreliable streams.
* **With Your Own Cookie:** You get your own 100GB monthly quota, faster speeds, and access to all quality levels including 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision.

**Q8: ShowBox sometimes gets the wrong movie or episode?** A: This happens. Matching titles accurately with ShowBox's system is tricky. I'm working on improving the matching logic, but for now, if you encounter this, try a different stream or provider.

**Q9: Why do ShowBox links sometimes not appear at all?** ‚ö†Ô∏è A: This is usually because of request limitations. When many users are accessing ShowBox through the addon at the same time:

* Too many uncached requests are hitting the ShowBox website simultaneously
* This can trigger rate limits or temporary blocks
* The first request might fail, but subsequent ones often succeed

**Solution:** If no ShowBox links appear on your first try, **wait a moment and refresh**. The second or third attempt usually works because by then, the results have been cached on our servers. This is especially common for new/popular content that hasn't been cached yet.

# Development & Adding New Providers

**Q10: Why haven't you added the provider I requested?** A: I wish it were easier, but adding providers is surprisingly difficult:

* **Solo Dev:** It's just me working on this.
* **Anti-Bot Measures:** Most streaming sites actively try to block scrapers.
* **IP Restrictions:** Some sites have complicated rules about IP addresses:
   * Some need your viewing IP to match the request IP (impossible for public instances)
   * Others block IPs that make too many requests (which happens on shared servers)
* **Constant Changes:** Sites frequently change their code, breaking our scrapers.
* **Maintenance:** Honestly, keeping the existing providers working is already a challenge.

# Hosting: Vercel, Koyeb & Self-Hosting

**Q11: What happened to the Vercel instance?** A: Surprisingly, the Vercel instance (https://nuvio-streams.vercel.app/) is still online despite hitting resource limits. I'm not sure how long it will remain available - it could disappear at any time. I recommend using the Koyeb instance or self-hosting for more reliability, but you can still try the Vercel instance if you prefer.

**Q12: What about the Koyeb instance?** A: The Koyeb instance (https://aesthetic-jodie-tapframe-ab46446c.koyeb.app/) is just a temporary solution:

* Don't count on it being around forever - it could hit limits too
* It has ShowBox, SoaperTV, and Hianime
* Cuevana isn't available on this public instance

I added a tool to the Vercel page to help convert your personalized URLs to the Koyeb format.

**Q13: Why do you recommend self-hosting?** A: Because it's better in almost every way:

* **Stability:** Your own instance isn't fighting with thousands of other users
* **All Providers:** Self-hosting is the only way to get Cuevana
* **Privacy:** Your streaming activity stays on your own system
* **Control:** You can modify things as needed
* **Fewer Blocks:** Your personal IP is less likely to get flagged

**Q14: How do I self-host?** A: The code is on GitHub: [https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon) Clone the repo, install dependencies, set up your .env file, and run it. The README has details.

**Q15: I'm struggling with the environment setup for self-hosting. Any plans to make it easier?** A: I know several self-hosters are having difficulties with the .env setup. I'm actively working on simplifying things to make the self-hosting process more straightforward. In the meantime, reach out for help if you're stuck.

# üåé Multilingual Content üåç

**Q16: I'm looking for content in other languages (Spanish, Italian, French, etc.). Does Nuvio support this?** A: While Nuvio currently has limited multilingual support (mainly through Cuevana for Spanish content), I **strongly recommend** checking out:

>üîó [**WebStreamr**](https://github.com/webstreamr/webstreamr) üîó

Rather than duplicating this functionality, I recommend using WebStreamr alongside Nuvio for the **best possible streaming experience**. Many users have requested multilingual support, and this is currently the best solution!

**Q17: If I self-host on a free platform, will Cuevana work?** A: Probably not. Free hosting platforms usually share IPs between users, so you'll likely have the same IP blocking issues. For Cuevana to work properly, requests should come from your own unique IP.

# Specific Provider Details & Known Issues

**Q18: What about Cuevana for LATAM users?** A: Cuevana is only available if you self-host. Many LATAM providers need specific regional connections, which works better in a self-hosted setup.

**Q19: Streams aren't loading on the Android app?** A: Yeah, I know about this issue. It affects some users but not others. Could be how the Android app handles requests, provider compatibility, or network settings. If you run into this, detailed feedback on GitHub helps me troubleshoot.

# Open Source, Community & Support

**Q20: Why did you open-source this project?** A: A few reasons:

* **Sustainability:** More people can help maintain it when I'm busy
* **Transparency:** Everyone can see how it works
* **Flexibility:** You can host it yourself or customize it

**Q21: How can I contribute?** A: Several ways:

* Improve the code
* Fix bugs (submit issues and PRs on GitHub)
* Enhance documentation
* Research new providers

**Q22: How often do you update or fix issues?** A: When I can. I work on this in my free time, so sometimes fixes happen quickly, sometimes they take a while.

**Q23: Where should I report issues or ask questions?** A: You can:

* DM me on Reddit (I'll respond when I can)
* Comment on relevant Reddit threads
* For technical issues, use GitHub's ""Issues"" section

# üí¨ Community Platform

**Q24: Are there any plans for a community platform?** A: I'm considering starting a Discord server for Nuvio users in the near future. This would be a place to:

* Discuss issues and troubleshooting
* Share configuration tips
* Help each other with setup
* Suggest improvements

This is still in the planning phase - I'm not very familiar with Discord yet. If you're interested in helping set this up or would like to join when it launches, please let me know via DM or in the comments.

**Q25: How can I support this project?** A: If you find this useful:

* [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/tapframe) (helps with server costs)
* Give the addon a star on the [Stremio Community Addons page](https://beta.stremio-addons.net/addons/nuvio-streams)

I ate some noodles with seitan (vital wheat gluten), nutritional yeast, vegan cheese and some broth I made from onion spices and veggie bouillon. have been feeling a slightly discomforting heartburn ever since 5 pm yesterday.

my question are - does this sound like a normal onset? based on what I'm reading, it's kind of text book. I normally lay in bed all day on my laptop because I WFH, I smoke, I have a large history with alcohol although I quit in January and haven't drank since and my diet was absolute shit for years.

should I immediately take some prilosec OTC since it hasn't even been a week since the onset?

I am just sitting there covering my face and then she tells me that she's gonna get mad at me too if I don't drink my coffee.

My Mechanika IV is overheating very quickly. When I bought it used, I could run it for an hour and make two coffees no problem. Now it overheats within 15 minutes, and if I leave it on too long, only steam comes out.

What could be the issue, and how can I fix it?

The ""Roll 20 short calls"" for CRWV is a link to a write-up I did on these rolls.

Both IBIT and RGTI had little value left, so I decided to roll today rather than wait.

Net cash out for the day was $226,476.33, of which there was an outflow of $175,475 for long term holdings and an outflow of $51,001.33 for short options.\*

The two accounts under consideration are up 4.5% week to date, compared with the S&P 500 which is up 1.0%.

\* At some point I may do a write-up on this issue. The weekly summary will show a large negative in the options section due to the CRWV roll, but the LT holdings line will be increased by $71.5k more than it would have otherwise been had I not rolled, assuming assignment at the end of the week.

The tour itself was unremarkable except for their sustainability efforts and some of the intricacies of having a distillery in a basement.  I think if the tour guide hadn't been drunk with a cocktail in his hand, this may have been a better presentation.  What was decent, however, was the tasting afterward.  We had samples of citrus vodka, gin, whiskey, Roaring Dan's (Google him) rum, cherry liqueur, and coffee liqueur.  I've developed a botanical nemesis, but otherwise the gin was pretty good.

Where it really got good was the tasting room.  They have $1 samples as well as a fine cocktail list and an attached takeout place.  I had a neat shot of the barrel aged gin and found it better than their unaged gin.  My wife was enamored with the cherry liqueur.  What's not to love about the taste of cherry pie filling in a bottle?  We also came away with the little bottle of Underberg digestif, and a 4 pack of Top Note tonic (not pictured).  While the Holiday gin was drinkable, it wasn't standout enough for me to pick up a bottle.

I got treatment but didn‚Äôt complete it at the time (stupid decision), I didn‚Äôt take care of myself the way I should have I‚Äôd still been drinking coffee & fatty spicy foods. Shortly after the partial treatment the pain came back, upper abdominal pain and soon after that I started to burp all day everyday. I went back to my dr and tested negative, switches drs due to insurance and I took a test in April I believe that came back negative and he put me on pantoprazole which helped a bit at first but   I‚Äôm still experiencing these symptoms, it‚Äôs taken a toll on me I‚Äôve developed depression due to these symptoms and no answers yet. I just got off the phone with my new PCP, he wants me to retest for hpylori next month then send me to GI. Sometimes I feel like I have to drink water in order for my food to fully go down as if it‚Äôs stuck in chest/end of throat.

My husband worked with a woman for about 10 years in a close setting. Due to the nature of their profession, they got to know each other well and worked well together. To my knowledge, when they worked together they would occasionally go on walks during breaks or to coffee. I am not aware of other meetings 1-on-1 outside of work, but it is possible they did happen.

Fast forward to about 3 years ago. She moved out of state and my husband got a new job around the same time. I knew they were Facebook friends, but during the time since she had moved he would meet up with her one on one for coffee and to chat during holiday breaks when she would come to visit. I did feel this was kind of strange, but I didn't say anything until recently. This past winter she came home for Christmas and he let me know they were meeting up again. They did and I just asked him why and he said it was just to catch up about family and work and that type of thing. He did get a little defensive. Since that time I have been increasingly curious about the nature of their relationship. I did snoop on his phone and could see they had taken a selfie together. They have used phrases like ""I miss you"" in text messaging, but nothing more intimate.

A couple of weeks ago I went to greet my husband outside and he was in his truck talking to someone. I had a really weird feeling. He said he called the dentist, but because he acted so guilty like he was trying to hide something, I checked to see who he was talking to. It was the former coworker. She had also left a message where she said ""I have been thinking of calling you every day"" and ""I miss you a lot"" and that was about it. I have brought this up to my therapist and she says I have no reason to believe they are not just friends. AITAH for feeling like there is something off about this connection? For me, using phrases like ""I miss you"" is not appropriate and I wouldn't say that to another man who is not a family member. Is it crossing a line?

IMPORTANT DETAILS:

I need to be honest that I am an insecure person with anxious attachment issues. I am also neurodivergent (ADHD, very likely undiagnosed autism) and struggle with anxiety. I also have severe body image issues but have been told throughout my life I am attractive.

My husband is very outgoing and I am more introverted. So naturally, he makes and maintains more friendships than I do.

This adds a layer of complication to the issue. The former coworker is also attractive and looks a lot like me-so much so we could be related. This is not just something I have noticed, but others who have seen us together. For that reason, it makes me more insecure there could be a sexual attraction there.

All three of us are in our early 40s. My husband and I have two kids and the coworker is also married with 2 kids.",4,1749071141.0,AITAH,20,1.0,False

He believed in quarterly reports and soil-pH strips. He also believed in the raise he‚Äôd pocket if the UA-Wiregrass Experimental Station could prove that Gallberry‚Äôs heirloom tomatoes out-performed those Texas hybrids. All summer he‚Äôd rattled along red-clay county roads, clipboard flapping against the doorframe like a weathervane.

What Eli didn‚Äôt believe in‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt afford to‚Äîwas the Crimson Cropper.

Yet every porch rocker along Cottonmouth Lane warned the ‚Äúcollege boy‚Äù that a headless share-cropper stalked the rows come first blush‚Äîsame as that bell out on the Foster place, they‚Äôd said. Eli smiled, wrote local folklore = tourism angle in his notebook, and asked where to find the sweetest fruit.

Most folks pointed him to Culver Patch, just off Peach Orchard Curve, run by June Culver, grand-niece of the original Amos ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Culver. June was thirty, sun-browned, and a far better mechanic than conversationalist. She had one rule: ‚ÄúNobody in the fields after sunset, not even you, Professor.‚Äù

Eli, who fancied himself more empiricist than professor, nodded but didn‚Äôt promise.

___________________________

An Evening Uncounted

On the second Friday of June, a surprise electrical storm pinned Eli and June beneath the tin packing shed. Rain ricocheted off roof panels; heat lightning stitched the horizon violet. While they waited out the deluge, June talked‚Äîrare for her‚Äîabout how the Cropper couldn‚Äôt cross running water, how he carried a jar of panicked fireflies where a head should be, how every year someone ignored curfew and found their truck doors peeled ‚Äúlike boiled shrimp.‚Äù

Eli listened, half amused, half admiring the cadence of her voice. He noticed, too, the way Bo Lawson‚ÄîMayor Figsbee‚Äôs nephew, broad as a barn door‚Äîwatched from his pickup at the gate. Rumor claimed Bo had courted June since high school; rumor also claimed he‚Äôd lost three contracts this spring because Culver tomatoes drew the higher price. Competition, Eli concluded‚Äîseasoned with a dash of jealousy.

When the rain faded, June slammed the shed door and locked up. ‚ÄúSee you at first light,‚Äù she said, driving off before Eli could offer to follow.

He stood in the breathing quiet, dusk melting into night. His clipboard still lacked one last set of sugar readings.

Ten minutes, he told himself‚Äîclip a sample, note the row, be gone.

He headed into the vines.

___________________________

The Lantern

Nine minutes later, the world went silent. No frogs, no cicadas‚Äîonly the drip of trellis twine drying in the dark. A faint glow bobbed two furrows away: a Mason-jar lantern, fireflies flickering inside like sparks in a bell jar.
A small click‚Äîglass settling on metal‚Äîcarried on the breeze, and for a heartbeat Eli pictured nothing spookier than a forgotten hurricane lamp.

Then the glow moved.

A shape emerged‚Äîbroad shoulders in sagging overalls, empty space where neck met night. In its hand: a six-foot tomato stake, tip dark with rust.

Eli‚Äôs throat sand-papered shut. He fumbled his phone: no signal. Hollow friend, was all his brain produced before a memory surfaced‚ÄîJune laughing at supper: ‚ÄúBo swears he‚Äôs seen the Cropper twice. I think he sees what he‚Äôs paid to see.‚Äù

Paid? Eli stared again. The silhouette‚Äôs gait was heavy, deliberate‚Ä¶ decidedly human.

‚ÄúBo?‚Äù he called, forcing bravado. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs you, joke‚Äôs finished.‚Äù

The figure stopped. The jar brightened until every firefly inside blinked frantic SOS. Rain-wet air tasted like a nine-volt battery on the tongue.

The Cropper‚Äîor prankster‚Äîraised its stake, pointed it at Eli‚Äôs chest, then rested the butt on the earth and waited.

Eli backed up, heel catching a loose rock. He hit the soil hard, dropping flashlight and samples; tomatoes burst under him like lungs expelling air. His breath fogged, though the heat still clung thick as syrup. When he scrambled upright, the glow had vanished.

Not faded‚Äîvanished. No footfalls, no branch snap. Just night.

___________________________

Evidence and Absence

Eli didn‚Äôt remember driving to town, only that the lone stop-light flicked yellow as he coasted through. He parked at the gas station, hands trembling too much to fit the key into the slot.

Deputy Ruth Bramble listened without comment and drove out with him to Culver Patch. June, called from bed, met them at the gate, hair braided like a no-nonsense rope.

‚ÄúEvening, June-Bug,‚Äù Bramble said, gentle as dew.

They found:

‚Ä¢ Eli‚Äôs flashlight‚Äîlens cracked, batteries missing.

‚Ä¢ A Mason jar smashed beside it, rim fused as if kissed by lightning.

‚Ä¢ A single tomato stake planted upright, its tip glistening with something that smelled metallic; penny-water on a hot gate.

‚Ä¢ No footprints but Eli‚Äôs, thanks to fresh rain.

‚Ä¢ Possum Fork Creek at the field‚Äôs edge, running high, banks unsullied.

Bo Lawson? Bramble learned he‚Äôd been playing dominoes in Gallberry American Legion Post 128 until 9:30 p.m.‚Äîthough the score sheet showed Bo had stepped outside for a ‚Äúsmoke break‚Äù lasting nearly an hour.

Electrical discharge? Weather service recorded no ground strikes after the storm passed.
Kids with a drone? Possible, but what kid discarded an antique jar instead of a GoPro?

June eyed the evidence, lips thinning. ‚ÄúYou went in after dark,‚Äù she said softly‚Äîdisappointment, not accusation.

Eli started to apologize, then caught a glance‚Äîa flick of her eyes toward Deputy Bramble, who logged everything with bureaucratic calm. Was she angry because he‚Äôd broken her rule, or relieved the legend might keep rival growers out?

At dawn they locked the gate. Bramble kept the stake and jar. June drove Eli back to his truck; she spoke once, offering coffee, then let the engine fill the silence. When he thanked her, she shrugged.

‚ÄúYou leaving town?‚Äù

Curiosity still buzzed in his chest; pride bristled at the thought of looking foolish; and, if he was honest, June‚Äôs steady eyes tugged at him like gravity.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStill got numbers left to run.‚Äù

June nodded, unreadable. In the windshield, sunrise bled iron red over the rows.

___________________________

What Folks Remembered:

‚Ä¢ That afternoon Eli mailed his soil data to UA-Wiregrass‚Äîand resigned the project three days later, citing ‚Äúhealth reasons.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ June harvested alone that season. Her yields broke county records.

‚Ä¢ Deputy Bramble kept the fused jar on her desk; tourists on the Kudzu Crawl called it a hoax, engineers called it impossible, and neither could explain the firefly wings vitrified inside the glass.

‚Ä¢ Bo Lawson gave an interview years later: ‚ÄúCity boy spooked himself. Happens.‚Äù Asked if he‚Äôd ever worn a lantern to frighten competition, he laughed but never said no.

‚Ä¢ Eli Ramsey never wrote publicly about Gallberry again, but sometimes, at conferences, colleagues caught him sketching a jar glowing where a head ought to be.

And every June, when the tomatoes blush, the night frogs fall silent for one heartbeat longer than they should‚Äîlong enough for locals to wonder whether superstition guards their fields, or whether some flesh-and-bone sentinel still walks the furrows, stake in hand.

## Key Features Analysis

The 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle market has evolved substantially, offering a range of features designed for durability, convenience, and hygiene. let's examine some of the most important specifications to consider:

**Material and Construction:**

Stainless steel is the primary material used in these bottles, typically food-grade 304 or 18/8 stainless steel.this type of steel is known for its resistance to corrosion, rust, and leaching, ensuring that your water remains pure and free from contaminants. Construction quality is crucial; look for bottles with seamless welding or robust construction to prevent leaks and ensure long-term durability.The thickness of the stainless steel also impacts the bottle's ability to withstand dents and impacts.

**capacity and Dimensions:**

The standard capacity, of course, is 5 gallons (approximately 18.9 liters). However, the dimensions can vary slightly between brands and models. knowing the exact dimensions is critical for storage purposes, especially if you plan to store the bottle in a specific location, such as a car, pantry, or camping setup. Heights typically range from 18 to 24 inches, while diameters can vary between 10 and 14 inches.

**Spigot and Dispensing Mechanism:**

A well-designed spigot is essential for easy dispensing. Some bottles feature simple on/off spigots, while others offer more advanced mechanisms such as push-button or locking spigots to prevent accidental spills. Material quality of the spigot matters too; stainless steel or BPA-free plastic are preferred for hygiene and durability. The flow rate of the spigot should be sufficient to fill cups and containers quickly without creating a mess.

**Lid and Sealing:**

The lid should provide a tight and secure seal to prevent leaks and contamination. Look for lids with silicone gaskets or O-rings that create a watertight barrier. Some bottles also feature threaded lids for added security. The lid's design should also facilitate easy filling and cleaning. Wide-mouth openings are generally preferred for ease of access.

**Handle and Portability:**

Given the weight of a 5-gallon water bottle when full, a sturdy and agreeable handle is a must.Look for handles made from durable materials such as stainless steel or reinforced plastic. Ergonomic designs that distribute weight evenly are ideal for reducing strain when carrying.Some bottles also feature secondary handles or grips to make pouring easier.

**Insulation (If Applicable):**

While not all 5-gallon stainless steel water bottles are insulated, some models offer double-walled vacuum insulation to keep water cold for extended periods. This is especially useful for outdoor activities or events where you want to maintain the water's temperature. insulation effectiveness varies between brands, so check self-reliant reviews and specifications to determine the bottle's thermal performance.

Key features of a high-quality 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle include:

*   Food-grade 304 stainless steel construction
*   Durable spigot with reliable flow control
*   Secure lid with tight sealing
*   Sturdy and ergonomic handle
*   Optional double-walled vacuum insulation

## Core Benefits

Investing in a 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle provides several key benefits, improving convenience, promoting health, and ensuring preparedness in various situations.

**Enhanced Portability:** Transporting large quantities of water becomes much easier with a durable and well-designed 5-gallon bottle. Instead of carrying multiple smaller containers, you can consolidate your water supply into a single, manageable unit. This is particularly beneficial for camping trips,sporting events,and other outdoor activities where access to clean water is limited.

**Improved Water Quality:** Stainless steel is non-reactive and doesn't leach chemicals into the water, preserving its purity and taste. Unlike plastic containers, stainless steel doesn't impart any unwanted flavors or odors, ensuring that your water remains fresh and clean. This is crucial for maintaining hydration and overall health, especially when sourcing water from perhaps questionable sources.

**Emergency Preparedness:** Having a 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle is an essential component of any emergency preparedness plan. It allows you to store a significant supply of water for unexpected events such as natural disasters, power outages, or water supply disruptions. This ensures that you and your family have access to safe drinking water when you need it most.

**Eco-Friendly Solution:** By using a reusable stainless steel water bottle,you reduce your reliance on single-use plastic bottles.This helps minimize plastic waste and its negative impact on the surroundings. Stainless steel is also a recyclable material, further contributing to its sustainability. Choosing a stainless steel water bottle is a responsible choice for environmentally conscious consumers.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a stainless steel water bottle may be higher than disposable plastic alternatives, it proves more economical in the long run. You eliminate the need to constantly purchase bottled water, saving money and reducing waste. A durable stainless steel bottle can last for many years, providing ongoing value and convenience.

## faqs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about 5-gallon stainless steel water bottles:

**How do I clean a 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle?**
Cleaning a large water bottle can seem daunting, but it's relatively straightforward. Begin by rinsing the bottle with warm, soapy water. Use a long-handled brush to scrub the interior,paying attention to the bottom and sides. Rinse thoroughly with clean water. For stubborn stains or odors, use a mixture of baking soda and water, or vinegar and water. Let the solution sit for a few hours before scrubbing and rinsing. Allow the bottle to air dry completely before storing.

**Is it safe to store water in a stainless steel bottle for extended periods?**
Yes, it is generally safe to store water in a stainless steel bottle for extended periods, provided the bottle is made from food-grade stainless steel (304 or 18/8). Stainless steel is non-reactive and won't leach harmful chemicals into the water. Though,to ensure optimal water quality,it's recommended to replace the water every few months,especially if the bottle is exposed to sunlight or temperature fluctuations.

**Can I use a 5-gallon stainless steel water bottle for liquids other than water?**
While primarily designed for water, you can use a stainless steel water bottle for other non-carbonated liquids such as juice, tea, or coffee. However, be mindful that flavored liquids can potentially leave residue or odors in the bottle. Thorough cleaning is essential after each use to prevent cross-contamination and maintain hygiene. Avoid using the bottle for acidic or corrosive liquids, as they may damage the stainless steel over time.

**What should I look for in a durable spigot?**
A durable spigot should be made from high-quality materials such as stainless steel or BPA-free plastic. Stainless steel spigots are generally more resistant to corrosion and wear, while BPA-free plastic spigots are a more cost-effective option. Look for a spigot with a secure and leak-proof design. The spigot should also have a smooth and consistent flow rate, allowing you to dispense water easily without spills or splatters.

My main issue would be money most likely. I used to cook a lot more often and buy groceries and keep up with all that. not sure what happened but now a majority of the time cooking sounds like the most exhausting, soul crushing burden to have to deal with on the daily. i rarely buy groceries anymore, when i do they often sit in the fridge until they rot. i get home from work and im so tired and done with the day that id rather rip my hair out than cook dinner. so we eat out. and eat out and eat out and eat out. i get my morning coffees, we get late night sweet treats. I‚Äôm gaining weight, spending more than i‚Äôm making, running my credit cards up, wasting food. I‚Äôm ashamed. I know what I should be doing but like I said, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt control myself and I don‚Äôt understand why. it‚Äôs causing so much stress, destroying my self esteem, affecting my health. 
Don‚Äôt even get me started on the naps. I need one every day after work. I‚Äôm literally proud of myself when I don‚Äôt take one. Like clock work after picking up dinner and eating, it‚Äôs nap time. 
Am I lazy? How the hell do I discipline myself? 

I used to have a budget and it worked really well for me. now when i think about making a budget i feel so overwhelmed and like i can‚Äôt handle it and i don‚Äôt know what im doing. like what the hell has happened to me. I never want to go out unless it‚Äôs for food. 

Some other things resulting in my lack of self control: dishes piling up for days, vaping, being addicted to marijuana and spending way too much on it(it‚Äôs legal where i live), laundry piling up for weeks. I would love to change all these things, seems so simple. I‚Äôve quit weed and vaping for a few months before then relapsed and haven‚Äôt been bothered to try and quit again. It‚Äôs like I want to but I don‚Äôt at the same time. I know in order for me to make change I have to truly want to, and I feel like I do. But I also feel like a part of me doesn‚Äôt. 

I have a possible career change coming up after summer which is extremely anxiety inducing. I also have one test left to pass to get my GED, also anxiety inducing. 

Sorry if this was all over the place.

When I confronted them, I started hemorrhaging badly‚Äîblood pouring down my legs. But Sebastian.........","Chapter 1

The day I found out I was pregnant, I walked in on my husband having sex with his adopted sister on our couch.

When I confronted them, I started hemorrhaging badly‚Äîblood pouring down my legs. But Sebastian just scooped Vivian into his arms and stormed out, shouting:

""Don't be so damn judgmental! Vivian was born without a vagina‚Äîit's a birth defect. As her brother, I just want her to experience intimacy before her reconstructive surgery!""

""If you can't handle this, we'll divorce tomorrow. Once Vivian's surgery is over, we can remarry!""

They rushed me to the ER as I bled everywhere. During my six-hour emergency surgery to save the baby, my phone kept buzzing. Vivian was sending me explicit videos, one after another.

Our bedroom, his car, his office... her mouth on him, his hands all over her body, grinding against each other in every way possible...

I realized they'd been doing everything except actual penetration this entire time‚Äîoral sex, mutual touching, dry humping like teenagers who couldn't go all the way.

That night, I calmly signed the divorce papers and left the Walker family behind.

Three years later, while volunteering at a rural Maine orphanage, I ran into my ex-husband.

He wore that same arrogant smirk.

""I'm New York's richest man now. Still think you made the right call walking out over something so trivial? I'm giving you one shot to come back.""

What he didn't know was that I'd remarried‚Äîand my two-year-old was napping upstairs.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

""Julia, this is pretty pathetic, don't you think?""

""Radio silence for three years, then you magically show up in this dump right after I hit the Forbes list? Don't tell me this is some coincidence.""

""Cut the act! I'm here on important business. Until you properly apologize to Vivian for what you did, I'm not taking you back!""

Sebastian froze mid-step as he climbed out of his Maybach, spotting me outside the community housing. After a beat, he let out a mocking laugh.

Vivian gracefully followed, her hand‚Äîadorned with a massive Graff wedding ring‚Äîcasually sliding around Sebastian's arm.

They looked like the perfect power couple.

Even after three years, seeing them together like this still messed with my head.

Back then, when Sebastian's father brought home a girl with a birth defect to be his adopted sister, teenage Sebastian completely lost it, pinching his nose and yelling:

""Get her out of here! I don't want some freak as my sister! That's disgusting!""

Watching Vivian huddle in the corner, trembling, I smacked Sebastian upside the head and took her cold hand in mine. I led her to the bathroom, wiped away her tears, and got her into soft pajamas.

That's how Vivian became part of the Walker family.

Her condition made her incredibly insecure and timid. Kids at school constantly bullied and mocked her.

So I held her hand and taught her makeup, helped her pick out her first dress, stayed up all night helping her with homework.

Watching Vivian grow more confident and radiant each day, getting closer to Sebastian‚ÄîI thought I was doing something beautiful. I never imagined the two people I loved most would end up stabbing me in the back.

When I didn't respond, Sebastian's eyes swept over the run-down housing behind me, his expression full of pity.

""You regret leaving me, right? Look at yourself‚Äîyou can't even afford decent rent. The dogs Vivian and I have live better than this.""

""Think about it‚Äîyour parents are dead. Besides me, your childhood sweetheart, who else do you have left?""

Sebastian seemed to soften slightly, sighing.

""Look, Vivian's feeling carsick. Stick around for a few days and take care of her. If she forgives you, you can come home.""

""But remember‚Äîno more of that crazy jealous crap from three years ago. Vivian and I are innocent. Your paranoia just makes things uncomfortable for everyone.""

Vivian immediately started stomping her feet, grabbing Sebastian's arm and whining like a child.

""Babe! I'm never forgiving her!""

""She ghosted us for three years‚Äîdidn't even show up when you were in the hospital. Now that you're loaded, suddenly she appears!""

Sebastian laughed and leaned down to kiss her lips softly.

""Relax, baby. I'm just screwing with her. Why are you getting all worked up?""

""You forgot we're getting married soon anyway.""

That instantly cheered Vivian up, though she kept shooting me dirty looks.

I took a deep breath and stepped back.

""You've got this all wrong. I'm here volunteering.""

I'd been coming to this small Maine town for a year now, ever since I met Principal Charlotte and promised to help out annually.

Mr. Lewis, the sweet old teacher coordinating everything, nervously tried to back me up.

""Yeah, yeah, Mr. Walker, you got it wrong about Ms. Grace. She's this botanist our principal brought in special. I was just giving her a ride since I was coming this way...""

Sebastian snorted, his face turning cold.

""Oh, cut the crap! Nice little performance! Maybe work on not stuttering through your lines next time?""

""Julia, I was being generous here! If this is how you're gonna play it, then just screw off and stop wasting my time!""

""Come on, Viv! Standing here another second is beneath us!""

His engine roared as they peeled out, kicking up dust that had me and Mr. Lewis coughing our lungs out.

Even with my usual patience, I was ready to tell them both where they could shove it.

My phone buzzed‚Äîa text from my husband.

\[\*Hey babe, you make it to town okay? Don't skip breakfast.\*\]

Followed by some ridiculous cat cuddle GIF that was so unlike his usual serious self‚ÄîGod knows where he finds this stuff.

I couldn't help grinning, my mood instantly lifting as I typed back.

\[\*Matthew, you're being cute again! Already ate. Heading into town now‚Äîmight lose signal.\*\]

Mr. Lewis drove me in his beat-up van along crazy winding mountain roads for over three hours before we finally made it to the community center.

He was leading me to the office to check in when I walked through the door and immediately wanted to turn around and leave.

Chapter 2

The normally quiet office looked like some kind of smoky boardroom. Cigarette smoke everywhere, tables covered with coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays.

Sebastian and Vivian were sitting there like king and queen, surrounded by a bunch of fancy-dressed businessmen kissing their asses.

""Mr. Walker, you're incredible! Youngest billionaire in New York, and now you've got connections with the old-money families‚Äîsky's the limit for you!""

""My company's nothing compared to yours‚Äîwe're gonna need all the help we can get, Mr. Walker!""

I coughed from all the smoke.

Sebastian looked over at me with this ""I fucking knew it"" expression, holding up his hand to shut everyone up while staring at me like I was dirt.

""Well, well. Julia, you really followed me all the way out here? That's even more desperate than I thought.""

Everyone turned to stare at me.

""Mr. Walker, who's this?""

Sebastian's smirk got even nastier as he put on this fake sympathetic act.

""Guys, meet my pathetic ex-wife. Now that I'm successful, she's stalking me like some psycho.""

""Julia, since you begged your way out here, how about you start by getting everyone coffee? Maybe if you grovel enough, I'll throw you a bone.""

All the businessmen immediately looked at me like I was trash.

Someone looking to kiss Sebastian's ass immediately piped up.

""Damn! Mr. Walker and his lady are relationship goals‚Äîeveryone knows he's crazy about her. You're not even good enough to shine his shoes!""

""Mr. Walker, you're way too nice! This bitch probably got used up and tossed aside, and now she's back 'cause you're loaded. Watch yourself!""

Another guy shoved his cup forward aggressively:

""Yo, waitress! Where's my water? How you gonna win back Mr. Walker with shitty service like that?""

As the insults got worse, Vivian was cracking up like it was the best entertainment ever. She casually flicked her perfectly manicured nail, sending her water glass crashing to the floor.

""Whoopsie! My bad, Julia sweetie! Clumsy me! You're such a doll‚Äîyou'll clean this mess up and grab me a fresh glass, won't you?""

Everyone erupted in laughter while Sebastian sat there with that cruel smirk, watching me like I was dirt.

I chuckled softly and grabbed the water pitcher.

I was about to drench the whole damn table when Mr. Lewis went bright red and frantically blocked me.

""Ms. Grace, no! Please, let me‚Äî""

""Folks, Ms. Grace here is VIP‚Äîour principal flew her in special from New York...""

Sebastian slammed his foot into the table, his voice ice-cold.

""Cut the shit! Same fucking story on repeat‚Äîwe get it!""

""She's my pathetic ex-wife! She screwed me over, so when I say jump, she asks how high! End of discussion!""

One businessman made a show of standing up.

""Well, if this is your idea of hospitality, you can kiss that funding goodbye...""

Mr. Lewis completely lost it, running around trying to stop people from leaving, practically in tears.

""Wait, please! You can't go‚Äîour principal's in the ICU and she trusted me to take care of you...""

""She's gonna kill me if you all walk out...""

I set down the pitcher, took a deep breath, and smiled at Mr. Lewis.

""It's fine. They're our guests‚ÄîI got this.""

Watching me pour water for everyone, Sebastian finally looked pleased, giving me an approving nod.

""There we go, Julia. Much better.""

I ignored him completely, just kept their glasses filled.

The conversation shifted back to business deals, Sebastian throwing in comments here and there while keeping his predatory gaze locked on me.

What nobody saw was Vivian under the table, her fingers clawed together in rage, eyes burning with pure hatred.

That afternoon, Mr. Lewis took me around to meet the kids.

They were all hiding behind doorways, peeking out at me shyly.

I pulled out the candy I'd brought and suddenly they were all over me like excited puppies, chattering non-stop.

This sweet little girl named Lily Shaw picked some wildflowers and bashfully handed them over.

""Ms. Grace, are you gonna be our teacher? You're so pretty‚Äîlike a princess in the movies!""

I grinned and scooped Lily up, taking her flowers.

I had no clue that one innocent moment was about to royally screw us both over.

Chapter 3

Next morning, I was alone in my room working on lesson plans.

CRASH!

Someone kicked my door clean off its hinges.

Sebastian barged in, dragging little Lily by the arm, with teary-eyed Vivian and those angry businessmen right behind him.

Sebastian looked absolutely murderous as he grabbed my wrist, examining it closely.

The second he spotted my emerald bracelet, his eyes went black with fury.

""Julia! Are you out of your goddamn mind? You're so hell-bent on screwing over Vivian that you got a kid to steal for you?!""

I was totally lost, yanking my wrist away from Sebastian's death grip.

""What are you even talking about?""

Vivian stepped up, laser-focused on my emerald bracelet with tears pouring down her cheeks.

""I'm not wrong. That bracelet‚Äîmy mom walked barefoot for three days to reach the Vatican. She prayed for hours on those stone steps until her knees bled, just to get this blessed by the Pope himself before she died. I'd know it anywhere.""

""Julia, why'd you steal the only thing I have left of her?""

""Is this... is this payback for asking you to serve coffee yesterday?""

""I swear I didn't mean it like that‚ÄîI was just testing to see if you really loved Sebastian...""

Vivian completely broke down while everyone looked at me like I was absolute trash.

""Jesus, stealing from a dead woman‚Äîthat's low even for you.""

""Poor kid was just being nice and this psycho pulls this shit.""

Sebastian looked at me like I made him sick.

""Julia, I actually thought you'd grown up. When you served everyone yesterday, I figured maybe you were finally ready to fix things between us. Turns out you were planning this twisted crap the whole time!""

""God, I almost felt bad for you!""

Little Lily was trembling, staring up at me with scared eyes.

""Ms. Grace... I found a purse and gave it back to the lady, but she says stuff's missing...""

Everything suddenly made perfect sense.

I pulled Lily behind me and laughed bitterly.

""Vivian, you should've researched before trying to set me up. This bracelet was personally blessed by Pope Francis for my husband's family‚Äîit's literally one of a kind. Like you could ever have connections like that.""

Vivian's pupils dilated‚Äîshe obviously had no clue this simple-looking bracelet had such prestigious origins.

But everyone just burst out laughing at my words.

""This crazy bitch is making up stories now.""

""Stop it!"" Sebastian's face twisted with disgust. ""Enough with the lies, Julia! When the hell did I ever get you papal jewelry?""

""The Vatican doesn't just hand out blessings to nobodies like me. Quit making a fool of yourself! And one more thing...""

He smirked, his voice dripping with contempt.

""Don't call me your husband. We're divorced, remember?""

I took a deep breath, ready to tell him exactly where he could shove it.

""Sebastian, I'm already married to‚Äî""

Suddenly Vivian hit the floor hard.

Her whole body started seizing, foam bubbling from her mouth‚Äîit was horrifying.

Sebastian went white, diving into Vivian's bag and pulling out an emergency inhaler, jamming it between her teeth like he'd done it a million times.

A few seconds later, the convulsions stopped and Vivian curled up in Sebastian's arms like a broken bird, silently shaking.

Everyone was freaked out by what just went down.

When Sebastian looked at me again, his eyes were pure venom.

""Julia! You know damn well that three years ago your drama gave Vivian PTSD seizures that she still hasn't gotten over...""

Vivian weakly grabbed his shirt.

""Babe, stop... I know Julia's not evil. She's just pissed about what happened before, pissed that I'm wearing your ring now.""

""This bracelet is all I have left of my mom. If Julia gives it back, I'll get out of your lives forever...""

Everyone was eating up this poor suffering angel act.

They all started going off on her behalf.

""Mr. Walker, you can't seriously consider taking back someone like her! Don't do that to your girl!""

""Yeah, call the damn cops! Both of them need to learn a lesson!""

Sebastian stared at me with pure hatred burning in his eyes.

""Julia, since you won't own up to what you did, you and this kid can rot in jail together!""

The door suddenly exploded open ""Over my dead body!""

my journey started a few years ago when i weighed 120+kg (264lbs) and through calorie deficit and regular walking (1hr, 3-4 times a week) i dropped down to about 87kg (192lbs). unfortunately i had a bit or a rough time and went back up to 108kg (238lbs) and in January i decided to try again through calorie deficit which brung me down to 97kg (214lbs) and then i hit a wall and my weight stayed the same so i incorporated some walking same as before and went down to 95kg (210lbs). 

heres where im stuck. i cant get much below 95kg, ive even stopped drinking coffee and soda then upped my walking to 90mins a session, 6 times a week and even so i cant get below that weight, its worth noting im still in calorie deficit. am i doing too much? i think i may have more muscle but i dont think enough to make that much of a difference. im open to any and all criticism and feedback",2,1749069351.0,loseit,6,1.0,False

VERY GOOD)

\- Another baby fic. [With a Crown of Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12335052/chapters/28049991) This is a season one AU. I will never have enough season one aus.

\- [emungere](https://archiveofourown.org/users/emungere/pseuds/emungere) is also very popular and prolific. I've read [Consenting to Dream](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1295044/chapters/2686558) (Wow I don't even know what to say. A sugar daddy au with a plethora of praise kink.) and the [Ladders](https://archiveofourown.org/series/88470) series is 20 parts and wowowowowow.

\- Bedelia is Will's psychiatrist in this one and is definitely au as a result. [Falls the Shadow](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23577121/chapters/56566660) is definitely a top five for me.

\- [How To Save A Life (The Cannibal-Friendly Handbook)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/860965) Will goes to a bridge to attempt suicide and bumps into Hannibal dumping body parts. Fics like this always draw me in.

\- [Pattern Break](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1780099/chapters/3812458) My favourite fic where Will doesn't go back to work for the FBI.

\- Short and sweet [haarlem](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24427978) is a telepath!Will AU.

\- [We Killed a Dragon Last Night](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9210245/chapters/20888957) is a post fall time travel fic where only Will remembers and is a Killer Will fic. This fic has many translations.

TASTING NOTES
The fragrance is about medium intensity, nice and fruity right off the bat. Once brewed, the aroma goes to high intensity, very fruity and berry. I get the dark berries in the roaster notes, really nice stuff.
Flavor-wise, very fruity plus I get a little bit of citrus fruit on the finish. The aftertaste intensity is medium to medium-high and it lingers nicely.
Acidity is well integrated at medium intensity, sweet acidity that doesn't overpower. Sweetness sits at medium as well. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. 
I might try grinding finer next time and get the TBT up to two minutes or two minutes thirty seconds.

1l3g8xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3g8xp/he_was_standing_between_the_trees/,He Was Standing Between the Trees,"We arrived at camp one day before the kids.

It was one of those forgotten summer camps somewhere in the northern states ‚Äî too far out for cell reception, too quiet for anyone to just wander by. On the map, it was barely a dot near a lake, surrounded by thick pine forest.

But at first‚Ä¶ it felt kind of magical.

The pines cracked softly in the wind. The lake shimmered under the evening sun. The old wooden cabins smelled like damp wood and something close to freedom. It was my first time working as a counselor, and for the first few days, I felt like a kid again ‚Äî like this was a place where nothing bad could ever happen.

The kids arrived the next day.
We spent the first few days learning names, making dumb team flags, singing by the fire, playing games that didn‚Äôt make sense but made everyone laugh.

It was all good.

Until one of the other counselors said something strange.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you ever feel like someone‚Äôs watching us?‚Äù

It was the fourth day. I thought they were joking and laughed ‚Äî but they didn‚Äôt. They were standing by the edge of the trees, staring into the woods like they were trying to make out a shape in the dark.

‚ÄúI saw someone yesterday. And again today. Right there ‚Äî near the old footbridge. Just‚Ä¶ standing.‚Äù

I looked. Nothing but trees and shadow.

‚ÄúMaybe a hunter?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúMaybe not,‚Äù they said.

We moved on, but after that, I started glancing back at the woods a lot more often.
And at night, walking back to my cabin, I started listening for footsteps that shouldn‚Äôt be there.


In a few days, one of the kids said something strange.

He was maybe eight years old. Quiet. The kind of kid who speaks in a whisper even when everything‚Äôs fine.

He came up to me during free time. The other boys were throwing pinecones at each other, but he wasn‚Äôt playing. He was just standing there, hands in his hoodie pockets, looking pale.

‚ÄúThere was a man outside our window last night,‚Äù he said.

I crouched down, half-expecting a joke. ‚ÄúWhat kind of man?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúHe was tall. Just‚Ä¶ standing. I think he was smelling.‚Äù

‚ÄúSmelling?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike, breathing on the glass. I saw the fog.‚Äù

I stared at him for a moment.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell anyone?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did. I told the other counselor. He said not to make stuff up. So I went back to sleep.‚Äù

I asked which cabin.

He pointed to the farthest one ‚Äî the one closest to the trees.

That night, I sat on the porch outside that cabin until after midnight. Nothing moved. Nothing stirred.

But the next morning, one of the kitchen staff found a muddy footprint just outside the cabin window.
A big one.

I told the camp director what the kid had said.

The director was hard to surprise. One of those clipboard-and-coffee types who looked like he‚Äôd seen a hundred summers and could handle a hundred more.

He listened carefully, then sighed.
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs call the sheriff. Just to be safe.‚Äù

The sheriff showed up sometime after lunch. Tanned face, mustache, slow voice. His eyes were always slightly squinted, like he was either deep in thought or just didn‚Äôt really buy what we were saying.

We stood with him by the mess hall.

‚ÄúYou really think someone‚Äôs walking around out here?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nearly forty miles to the nearest town. Nothing out here but trees and mountains.‚Äù

I told him about the footprint. About the boy who saw a face in the window.

The sheriff shrugged.

‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ as long as this camp‚Äôs been running, there‚Äôs never been a single report. No disappearances. No assaults. No bodies.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt being dismissive ‚Äî more like someone trying to calm things down.

‚ÄúIf only one kid saw something ‚Äî it might‚Äôve just been a prank. Maybe one of the older campers thought it‚Äôd be funny to scare the little ones.‚Äù

But after a pause, he added:
‚ÄúStill, don‚Äôt let the kids wander off on their own. Not even inside camp. Especially the younger ones. And make sure the cabins are locked from the inside at night.‚Äù

Then he looked at me more seriously.
‚ÄúStay calm. But don‚Äôt ignore safety protocols.‚Äù

And then he left.

That evening, we talked it over with the other counselors over coffee. Someone said it was probably just a prank. Some older kid trying to spook the little ones. Someone else said maybe the boy just made it up.

But later, when I stepped outside and looked toward the woods‚Ä¶

I thought I saw something.

Just for a second.

Maybe I was tired.

But I swear ‚Äî it looked like someone was standing there.

Watching me.

I woke up to screaming.

Not the kind you hear in games or movies ‚Äî real, panicked, human screaming.

There were footsteps pounding in the hallway. Someone was banging on doors. I jumped out of bed just as one of the younger counselors burst into the building. She was barefoot, in pajamas, eyes full of tears.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúThe back door‚Äôs broken!‚Äù

We ran to the cabin where the youngest girls slept. The back door ‚Äî the one that led straight into the woods ‚Äî was cracked open and hanging off one hinge. Splinters on the floor. And an empty bed by the window.

‚ÄúShe was sleeping right there,‚Äù the counselor whispered. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs five‚Ä¶‚Äù

I sprinted to the main office. Didn‚Äôt even have to knock ‚Äî the director was already up, already dressed, flashlight in hand.

‚ÄúGet the others,‚Äù he said. Calm. Direct.

Five minutes later, we were gathered outside the mess hall. A handful of us. Flashlights. Backpacks.

The girls stayed behind with the kids. One of them was already on the phone with the sheriff. But the director didn‚Äôt wait.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not sitting around,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going now.‚Äù

He took the lead. We moved fast, fanning out through the woods in a staggered line. Ten feet apart. Careful, quiet.

Three minutes in, the director stopped.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

Hanging from a branch was a torn piece of red fabric.

It was hers.

Further down ‚Äî a faint trail, like something had been dragged.

And then ‚Äî a single pink slipper.

No one spoke. No one made jokes.

We kept going. The trail curved through the trees, across a dip in the ground. And then ‚Äî

The director raised his hand.

‚ÄúThere.‚Äù

Between the trees, half-covered in branches, stood an old white trailer.

The kind that looks like it‚Äôs been abandoned for years.

Except the light inside‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶was on.

The door creaked when we pushed it open.

It wasn‚Äôt locked.
Inside, it smelled like plastic, dust, and something else ‚Äî something faint and rotten.

There were dolls.
Everywhere.
On the shelves, on the floor, on the tiny couch against the wall.
Their eyes were glassy, unfocused. Some were missing limbs. One sat in the sink, staring up at the ceiling like it had been waiting.

And then we saw her.
The little girl.
Curled up on a thin mattress in the back corner.

Her wrists and ankles were tied with what looked like shoelaces and cable ties.
A strip of duct tape covered her mouth.

She didn‚Äôt move when we came in.
Just stared at us ‚Äî wide-eyed, frozen.

The director dropped to his knees and gently ripped the tape from her face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay now.‚Äù

But she didn‚Äôt say a word.

The trailer was empty.
No sign of anyone else.

Two of the counselors carried the girl back to camp.
The director gave them a whistle and strict instructions not to stop for anything until they reached the others.

The rest of us stayed.

He led us to a small rise just off the side of the trailer. Between two pines, we had a clear line of sight to the door. But we stayed hidden in the dark.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll come back,‚Äù the director whispered. ‚ÄúTrust me. People like that‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt just walk away from their nest.‚Äù

We waited in silence. The grass was damp. One of us kept tapping a flashlight with his fingers. Another was trembling ‚Äî not from the cold.

Maybe twenty minutes passed.

Then we saw him.

Just a shadow at first ‚Äî tall, hunched, moving carefully.
Over his shoulder, he carried two life-sized dolls.
One had white hair. The other was missing an eye.

He was whispering to them.

We couldn‚Äôt hear the words, but his head kept tilting ‚Äî first to one, then the other. Like a father calming two kids after a fight.

As he got closer, we saw that the dolls were wearing real children‚Äôs dresses.

He reached the trailer, opened the door, and gently set the dolls down on the threshold.

He smiled at them.

And that‚Äôs when the director whispered:
‚ÄúNow.‚Äù


He didn‚Äôt see us until the last second.

The director moved first. Fast. Without a word.

We swarmed him from all sides. Someone knocked him down, someone else struck him from behind with a branch.

He hit the ground face-first and groaned.

‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù he rasped. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

The director grabbed a metal pipe that was lying beside the trailer.

‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù the man gasped again. Blood was running from his mouth.

And then‚Ä¶ he smiled.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine now,‚Äù he whispered.
‚ÄúYou saved her, but she‚Äôll still think about me.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe looked into my eyes. She‚Äôll remember.‚Äù

One of us kicked him in the face. Hard.

He lay in the dirt, blood pouring from his nose and lips. He was breathing heavily, but still conscious.

The director said,
‚ÄúPick him up.‚Äù

Two of us grabbed him by the arms and pulled him to his feet. He wobbled but didn‚Äôt fall.

And then he started talking.

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt prove anything,‚Äù he said. His voice was hoarse, but calm.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything. Didn‚Äôt even touch her.‚Äù

He smiled, teeth red with blood.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the girl. Alive. You‚Äôve got the trailer. So what? No one‚Äôs missing. No one‚Äôs dead.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe police will come, take a look‚Ä¶ and let me go.‚Äù

None of us said a word.

‚ÄúYou just got scared,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd now you want to make me into a monster.‚Äù

And then he laughed.

Quiet. Tired. But real.

We walked through the forest in silence, dragging him between us.

But the laughter didn‚Äôt stop.

Then the director stopped walking.

He was staring at two tall young birch trees.

After a moment, he said:
‚ÄúHold him. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

He turned and walked back toward the trailer.

When he returned, he was carrying a coil of rope.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, freak,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúBut what if‚Ä¶ we never find you in this forest?‚Äù

We stood in silence.

No one argued.

No one said, ‚ÄúMaybe we should wait for the police,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the right.‚Äù

Everyone was looking at the director.

And he was looking at two young birch trees, swaying quietly beside the trail.

‚ÄúSomeone out there wants people like this to exist,‚Äù he said at last.
‚ÄúWants them to have lawyers, court dates, sentences.
So we can all pretend this is just another man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am a man!‚Äù the guy shouted. ‚ÄúI have rights!‚Äù

He thrashed, yanking at our grip. Screaming.

We just watched him.

One of the counselors pulled out a roll of duct tape.

A few seconds later, his mouth was sealed shut.

He was still shaking with rage ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt matter.

The director walked over to the birch trees and started bending them down.

We helped ‚Äî pressing them to the ground, tying them off.

Then came the ropes. Around his ankles.

He didn‚Äôt fight anymore. Just stared at us with wide, wet eyes no one wanted to look at.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a sentence,‚Äù the director said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an ending.‚Äù

He cut the rope holding the trees together.

Both trunks snapped upright ‚Äî in opposite directions.

Someone turned away.
Someone froze.

The sound was short.
Dull.
Like tearing wet canvas.

Something red flew through the leaves.

And no one said another word.

We set fire to the trailer from the inside.

The director went in first. He poured gasoline over everything ‚Äî the floor, the mattress, even the dolls.

One of the guys placed a kerosene lantern in the corner, like it had been left behind.

Then we struck a match.

At first, nothing happened.
Then ‚Äî a rasping whoosh, like something old and greasy exhaling its last breath.

We didn‚Äôt watch it burn.
We walked away.

As for the body ‚Äî the big parts, we buried.
The rest‚Ä¶ the forest would take care of. Predators. Raccoons. Owls.
In a few days, even a dog wouldn‚Äôt find anything.

The police arrived in the morning.

We told them we‚Äôd been watching the trailer.
That it was empty.
That we‚Äôd found the girl in the bushes a few yards away.
And then‚Ä¶ the fire started.

‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been an old lantern,‚Äù someone said. ‚ÄúPlastic, dust, bad wiring.‚Äù

The sheriff looked at us for a long time.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see anyone go inside?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the director. ‚ÄúWe never left it alone.‚Äù

The sheriff nodded.

They found nothing.

The girl didn‚Äôt remember anything.
She just asked for tea. And a quiet song before bed.

Three days later, the camp was shut down.
Everyone left. Some went back to college. Some just wanted to forget.

Me‚Ä¶
I still wonder ‚Äî did we do the right thing?

What if he was right?

What if we killed him‚Ä¶ just because we could?

Weeks have passed.
I sleep at home now. It‚Äôs supposed to be over.

But last night‚Ä¶

I woke up in the dark.

And I swear ‚Äî someone was standing outside my window.

Not moving.
Just watching.

Like before.

I‚Äôve been dating Noah for almost a year. He‚Äôs sweet, incredibly smart, and just the right amount of introverted. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who reads obscure philosophy books, makes amazing coffee, and doesn‚Äôt mind when I ramble about my weird dreams.

We met at a mutual friend‚Äôs housewarming party. He stood in the corner, petting the host‚Äôs cat like he was in love with it. I joked about him being the human version of a cryptid‚Äîcute, elusive, and probably hiding some deep, dark secret. He just smiled.

Turns out I wasn‚Äôt too far off.

We moved in together three months ago. His house‚Äîyeah, his, not a rental‚Äîwas this old Victorian-style place his grandmother left him. It had creaky floorboards, leaded glass windows, and an actual cellar with a heavy iron door. The first time I saw it, I joked that he was definitely hiding bodies down there.

He didn‚Äôt laugh.

At the time, I thought he just didn‚Äôt like murder jokes.

He told me the basement was ‚Äúoff-limits.‚Äù Said it was unsafe, that the floorboards were rotting and there were exposed pipes or something. I didn‚Äôt press it. Everyone‚Äôs got their boundaries, right? I had no reason to be suspicious. Until last Thursday.

Noah left for a last-minute ‚Äúwork trip.‚Äù He‚Äôs a freelance archivist‚Äîgoes through historical records, organizes weird old libraries for rich eccentrics. I never really understood the specifics, but it sounded cool enough to brag about to my friends.

I was home alone, and a storm hit‚Äîmassive thunder, the whole clich√©. The power flickered, then went out entirely. I grabbed a flashlight and went looking for the fuse box, and realized I‚Äôd never actually seen it before. I figured it must be in the basement.

At first I just stood in front of the door. It was so damn cold near it‚Äîlike, the temperature dropped a full ten degrees. That could‚Äôve been my imagination, but I swear I could hear‚Ä¶ whispers. Not words. Just murmurs, like someone was talking underwater.

I tried the door. It was locked, of course. But here's the thing‚ÄîNoah always leaves his keys in the ceramic bowl by the front door. Including the one he told me was ‚Äúfor the shed.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not proud of this. I hesitated. I did. But I took the key.

It fit perfectly.

The door creaked open, releasing a smell that hit me like a brick‚Äîrotting wood, mildew‚Ä¶ and something metallic. The flashlight flickered. Classic horror movie stuff.

I stepped down carefully, one wooden step at a time, flashlight aimed ahead.

The basement was huge. Far bigger than I thought. It wasn‚Äôt just one room‚Äîit was a series of narrow corridors and shelves lined with boxes, books, old furniture. Nothing immediately weird‚Ä¶ until I saw the door at the back. It was newer than the rest‚Äîsteel, bolted shut, and had a keypad next to it.

Why would an old Victorian house have a modern steel door hidden in the basement?

That‚Äôs when I noticed it. A notebook sitting on a stool nearby. The pages were old, but the handwriting was unmistakably Noah‚Äôs. I flipped through it, heart pounding.

He wasn‚Äôt just cataloguing books or family history.

He was documenting people. Names, dates, sketches. Some of them looked like anatomical drawings. Some were just... eyes. Pages and pages of human eyes. With notes like:

‚ÄúSubject 4: Reacts poorly to sunlight. Duration: 6 days.‚Äù

I ran.

I locked the door behind me. Put the key back. I‚Äôve been pretending everything‚Äôs normal since he got back two nights ago. He asked if the storm bothered me, if I was ‚Äúscared of the dark.‚Äù

I said no.

But last night, I heard him in the basement. Not walking.

Talking.

And something‚Äîsomething‚Äîwas talking back.

He offers me the plate, and I turn it down with a wave of my hand.
 ‚ÄúYou need to eat,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou have a big day today.‚Äù He looks at me with a smile.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry,‚Äù I reply, rolling my eyes. He gives me a stern look and sets the plate on the dash.
I wake from a deep sleep to the sound of footsteps in the hallway, moving downstairs. I roll over and shut my eyes, hoping for more sleep‚Äîuntil my alarm blares on the bedside table. I groan and roll onto my back, reaching across the bed to silence it. I lay there a moment, remembering how my mom used to wake me up every morning. 
‚ÄúPut your feet on the floor.‚Äù she would always say. 
I keep having dreams about my parents‚Äîmemories of how it was before the government tightened its grip on the population. Before the ‚Äúcar accident‚Äù that took the only two people I was sure I loved.
I drag myself out of bed, through the hall, and down the stairs, where I find Kristi in the kitchen making coffee. She‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs sister, and she became my guardian after my parents died. I can barely look her in the eye‚Äîevery time I do, I see my mother‚Äôs kind gaze looking back at me.
 ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she says with a smile.
 ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I mumble, pulling on my coat and heading for the door.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna eat anything?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNot hungry,‚Äù I mutter, avoiding her eyes. I step outside and follow the path that leads to the road. For a second, I think I see my father standing there, breakfast in hand, with that same morning smile. I blink, and he‚Äôs gone. I slide into the car and remember the food on the dash, the way he would drive me to school every morning.
I put the key in the ignition and turn it‚Äînothing. Again‚Äîa sputter.
 ‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù I whisper. I can‚Äôt be late for class again, or, in Mr. Michaels‚Äô words, ‚Äúthere will be consequences.‚Äù One more turn, and the engine coughs to life, black smoke belching from the exhaust. I bought this car myself after the crash‚Äîthe last thing I had of my parents was totaled. It‚Äôs not the nicest thing on the planet, but it‚Äôs what $500 and some denial will get you.
I pull into a parking space, the car lurching with a sound that makes me wince. I step into the crisp fall air and take a deep breath. Jogging toward the school, I check my watch‚Äîthirty seconds to get across campus to Mr. Michaels‚Äô class.
I barge into the room as the bell rings. He shoots me a look of disapproval. I take the only empty seat at the back, next to the quiet ones‚Äîthe ones who never say a word. I rest my head on the desk and stare out the window, tuning out the lecture on the ancient Egyptians.
I open my eyes to fluorescent lights, rustling papers, and shuffling feet. Everyone‚Äôs packing up. I do the same, but before I can reach the door, Mr. Michaels stops me.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asked to escort you to the principal‚Äôs office,‚Äù he says in that same monotone voice that could put a bullet train to sleep.
We walk in silence until we reach the office. Mr. Michaels turns and walks away. I stare at Principal Hayes and swallow hard.
He‚Äôs tall and clean-cut, broad-shouldered, square-jawed. His hair is always neatly parted and just slick enough. He looks like he walked straight out of a poster that says This Is What a Man Looks Like.
‚ÄúHarper,‚Äù he begins. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been called here because your aunt contacted me directly. You are to return home immediately. No questions asked.‚Äù He looks up from his desk, eyes dark and sharp, and for a second, I feel like he could swallow me whole. 
	I walk out of the office, the echo of Principal Hayes‚Äô voice still bouncing around in my head. Return home immediately. No questions asked. The halls are empty‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs in class‚Äîbut somehow the silence feels crowded, like the walls are watching.
Kristi‚Äôs car isn‚Äôt out front. Instead, there‚Äôs a black sedan idling at the curb. Windows tinted, engine running low and smooth like it‚Äôs been waiting for me. I slow down. My gut tells me to run, but a boy steps out from the driver‚Äôs side before I can even think.
He looks about my age‚Äîseventeen or eighteen‚Äîwith a lean build, dark hair falling into his eyes, and a serious expression that somehow feels familiar. Like I‚Äôve seen him before. Somewhere.
‚ÄúHarper,‚Äù he says, calm, steady. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt move.
 ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúA friend. You just don‚Äôt remember me yet.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere unless you tell me what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time to explain here. But you will want to hear this.‚Äù
He pulls something from his jacket pocket. A photo. My parents‚Äîmy real ones‚Äîsmiling in front of our old house. And between them, barely older than a toddler, I. Standing next to him. He looks younger in the photo, too‚Äîhis hair is longer and he appears less guarded. But it‚Äôs him.

Read the official 8-K release [here](https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000036/a20250604-brianannouncemen.htm).

Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) announced a significant organizational overhaul aimed at accelerating its performance recovery, ensuring operational efficiency, and reinforcing accountability throughout its leadership ranks. According to CEO Brian's statement to all partners, recent performance metrics have not yet met expectations, prompting swift action across the enterprise.

**Key Takeaways and Leadership Changes:**
- **Mike Grams** appointed as Chief Operating Officer with expanded responsibilities; he now leads North American coffeehouses, global development, and the global supply chain. This centralizes operational oversight and supply chain management, strengthening Starbucks‚Äô platform for growth.
- **Meredith Sandland** (Chief Development Officer) and **Sanjay Shah** (Chief Supply Chain Officer) now report directly to Grams. The unification of these roles is expected to drive greater efficiency and clarity across Starbucks‚Äô design, build, and operational domains.
- The merger of the **Global Coffee and Sustainability Team** with the **Global Brand Team** ensures coffee remains at the core of product innovation while deeply embedding sustainability practices. **Michelle Burns** (EVP, Coffee and Sustainability) now reports to **Tressie Lieberman** (EVP, Global Chief Brand Officer).
- **Deb Hall Lefevre** (Chief Technology Officer) will now report to **Cathy Smith** (Chief Financial Officer), further aligning technology investments with Starbucks‚Äô broader financial strategy to maximize returns on digital infrastructure and partner productivity.
- **Brad Lerman** (Chief Legal Officer) will depart in the coming months; succession planning is underway, strengthening long-term legal and compliance oversight.

**Strategic Implications:**
- The centralization and cross-functional integration at the executive level aim to eliminate silos, sharpen leadership focus, and infuse greater urgency into operational execution‚Äîcritical strategic shifts given intensifying competition, macroeconomic headwinds, and the imperative to maintain Starbucks‚Äô reputation for experience consistency.
- The blending of brand, sustainability, and product leadership positions Starbucks to capitalize more effectively on global demand for differentiated, eco-conscious products‚Äîmirroring consumer and regulatory trends.
- The realignment of technology under the CFO‚Äôs purview signals more disciplined capital allocation‚Äîparticularly around digital ordering, supply chain traceability, and customer engagement platforms‚Äîpotentially impacting Starbucks‚Äô margin profile and cash flow.

**Industry Context & Data Points:**
- Starbucks‚Äô last reported earnings saw comparable store sales growth below consensus forecasts, with North America experiencing flat transaction volumes and ongoing pressures from labor costs and inflation (see Q1 2025 earnings call transcript for quantitative details).
- The competitive coffee and quick service landscape is rapidly evolving, with Dunkin', Costa, and boutique chains investing in AI, supply chain agility, and digital engagement, amplifying the urgency of Starbucks‚Äô transformation.
- According to research, organizational restructuring combined with centralized accountability can improve execution speeds by up to 30% and reduce operational drag by 10%‚Äîmetrics relevant as Starbucks enters a period of aggressive change ([McKinsey, 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog)).

**Next Steps & Looking Ahead:**
- Starbucks will continue its pilot programs and pursue rapid testing of new operational models, aiming for measurable improvements in customer experience and margin expansion. Tracking changes in employee engagement, supply chain KPIs, and digital order volume will be crucial.
- Investors should monitor upcoming 10-Qs for quantitative evidence of productivity gains, supply chain efficiencies, and improved store-level profitability as these changes are implemented.

Her had a decent amount of profiles, but a lot of people just seemed inactive. I messaged a few, got one reply, then radio silence.

So I just DIY my entire life.

Need to learn a new tool at work? I‚Äôll binge three YouTube tutorials, dig through 15-year-old forum threads written in Comic Sans, and watch a webinar at 1.5x speed before I even think about asking a colleague.

Even at home, I‚Äôm out here learning how to unclog a sink via WikiHow because the idea of inconveniencing a plumber and making small talk? Absolutely not. Look at me, I‚Äôm the plumber now.

The real MVP? YouTube University starring wise Indian uncles, pixelated screen recordings, the iconic Hypercam watermark, and solutions that actually work. No matter what you‚Äôre stuck on, there‚Äôs a tutorial out there ready to save your entire career.

Is it hyper-independence? Maybe. Is it sustainable? Probably not. But at least I can say ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù and slap it on my r√©sum√©, and slowly become a jack of all trades‚Ä¶ just a very tired master of none.

Is he a narcissist?,"I (33F) know ‚ÄúDave‚Äù (40M) through mutual friends. We have spent a lot of time around each other. I would consider us acquaintances. We had a weird dynamic where he would flirt with me, ask me out, get nervous, cancel, tell me he wasn‚Äôt ready for ‚Äúa serious relationship,‚Äù get jealous, repeat. We had a lot of chemistry, and I will admit that I did have feelings for him. He was always so kind, polite, and humble with me. So I was surprised to learn he has a reputation as a womanizer. He hooks up with different women every week, dates multiple people and refuses to dtr- all this even when living with a woman he dated. Despite his reputation, many women in our circle have crushes on him because he is handsome and comes off as a genuine and shy guy. He was always a perfect gentleman around me (maybe too perfect), but this was all confirmed by multiple people. I felt and told him it was unfair of him to get jealous of me talking to other guys since he was sleeping with a lot of other people. It was a red flag. He invited me over to hook up a couple times but I didn‚Äôt feel right bc of his reputation and said no, not without better communication/not if I felt like a chaser. But our cycle of flirting/anxiety/rejection/jealousy continued.

A few months ago, I basically told him to shit or get off the pot. He made overtures, but started getting very critical and very jealous at the same time. For example, once I answered a text message (from my sister) while ‚ÄúDave‚Äù and I were having a conversation. He was livid. He accused me of texting another guy and stormed away. He made a big show of texting on his phone and looking over at me. Turns out, he was inviting other women to the function we were at and started flirting with them in front of me, looking over to make sure I was watching the entire time. He kept asking if I was sleeping with my male friends/personal trainer/boss. He was visibly hurt the few times when I didn‚Äôt flirt back with him. He would do me a little favors, like buying me coffee and drinks, but when I told him I liked it he accused me of only wanting him for his money and using him. I tried to figure out why he was acting so strange but came up blank. I started getting a cold feeling in my stomach when he would lash out at me and anxiety when he was around.

I decided it didn‚Äôt bode well. I calmly told him that things were too unclear so I was not interested but wanted to stay on good terms. I stopped flirting with ‚ÄúDave‚Äù and just treated him nicely. He was pissed. Then he blocked me on Facebook. I would often catch him glaring or sneering at me. The escalation made me nervous. I didn‚Äôt want to give him any big reactions. So I avoided him. He started blocking and unblocking me. Then I started running into him at group events with various friends and acquaintances of mine, having conversations with them in side rooms or hidden corners. These friends all started acting nervous around me, while he just seemed amped up when I was around. All this made me more uneasy so I stopped hanging out with the group. I blocked him everywhere and purposefully dropped off his radar. This was three months ago.

I found out a few weeks ago from a mutual friend that not only is ‚ÄúDave‚Äù sleeping with all of my friends who I conveniently caught him with, but he is taking them on dates and showering them with gifts and attention. These friends are all commenting on his social media posts with hearts, etc and competing for his attention. Two of them unadded me on social media. One of them confronted me and accused me of stalking ‚ÄúDave,‚Äù even though I haven‚Äôt been around them for months. And it‚Äôs still happening. Every once in a while I will lose an Instagram follower, and when I go to their page he has been liking and commenting little flirts on all their posts.

I am at a loss. It seems like he is doing this on purpose; he never expressed interest in these friends before. Maybe he was interested, he just didn‚Äôt want to lose his chance with me? But why did he block me? And why are my former friends cutting me out of their lives and making these wild accusations? He and I never dated, so I don‚Äôt know why my friends would cut me off if they are involved with him. He has to be telling them bad things about me‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense. But I don‚Äôt know why he would do that. I don‚Äôt understand why he kept getting nervous and jealous with me, but not with them. I don‚Äôt understand his extreme jealousy and reactions before I backed off our relationship. I don‚Äôt understand why he blocked me. 

I am hurt by all of this. I used to be genuinely interested in him and valued him in my life, despite his red flags. It was a hard decision for me to back off from him romantically. It was really painful when he blocked me. It was really painful to find out that he was sleeping with my friends. It‚Äôs been really painful to lose these friendships. I don‚Äôt want to believe he‚Äôs a bad guy, but he couldn‚Äôt be hurting me worse if he tried. 

Logically, I know I dodged a massive bullet, but I can‚Äôt stop trying to make sense of this. It‚Äôs a head fuck! What is going on? Is he really doing this on purpose? Did he actually have deep feelings for me? Or is he actually disordered? :(",4,1749068336.0,relationship_advice,16,0.71,False

A few friends from Boston and brooklyn mentioned that I should start there, since the coffee scene in both cities is always competitive and thriving. Any other cities?**

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. I scraped Google reviews and Reddit posts about DC coffee shops in the past 12 months, then built a text analysis model that score how ""hipster"" each place is based on what people actually say about them. Covered 33+ shops as of now, but will be adding more soon!

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Shaw or Georgetown. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:

I‚Äôve mostly used no-annual-fee cards up until now, but I started commuting more and spending a lot on groceries lately, so I figured the bonus categories might make sense.

Used it at my local supermarket a few times already and saw the 3x points come through pretty fast. The 50% bonus for 30+ transactions a month seemed like a gimmick at first, but I‚Äôm already halfway there just from daily stuff like coffee, gas, and small purchases. I do wish Apple Pay earned more than 1x, but I guess that‚Äôs the tradeoff.

I‚Äôm planning a trip later this year and looking into stacking points with the travel partners. Just wondering, anyone here using this card regularly in 2025? Still happy with it, or are there better point-earning cards out there now?",1,1749067901.0,credit_cards,0,1.0,False

I've been taking zopisign for 2 weeks for insomnia and anxiety they work great for sleep and anxiety but the taste makes me sad I can only drink coffee and tea with sugar. I was wondering if there's anything else anyone taking this medication would know about how to counter this taste. mouthwash works for about 40 minutes so I've been literally gurgling mouthwash the minute I wake up ,3,1749067892.0,insomnia,5,1.0,False
