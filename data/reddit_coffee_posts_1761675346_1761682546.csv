I don't know how dates work.,"For some background: I'm 25f and I've been crushing hard on a guy at my gym for months, and I have an inkling of hope that he *may* reciprocate my feelings. My gym schedule is gonna change in two weeks, so I wanna hurry up and make a move before that happens.

I'm really nervous about asking him out. I've never done this before. I'm fully prepared for potential rejection. I feel like my schedule change is convenient for this, that way he won't feel so awkward if he does reject me. If anything, I'm even more scared of the possibility of him saying ""yes"" because this will be entirely new territory for me.

I want to ask if he'd be down for getting some coffee with me to see if we click, and maybe we could wander downtown afterward if it goes well. Or I could ask if he'd want to go to the arcade and challenge me to Mario Kart (the arcade has a quiet cozy retro lounge with a SNES).

Also, if he does say yes, would it be weird to tell him that dating is new to me? I feel like that would make him more understanding if I mess up/act awkward etc etc etc

If any of you have advice, I'd really appreciate it.

1oik3ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1oik3ei/a_bad_job_a_tired_lifeschlechte_arbeit_müdes_leben/,"A Bad Job, A Tired Life|Schlechte Arbeit, müdes Leben","Since September this year, I’ve been doing an FSJ volunteer year in a nursing home in Germany. My main work is in the kitchen. At first, because I was new, the supervisors didn’t give me too much responsibility. But since mid-October, another FSJ volunteer and I have been taking care of everything. She works in the upstairs kitchen; I’m in the downstairs one.

Every day I prepare breakfast, make coffee, serve food, wash dishes, get lunch ready, serve again, wash again, make afternoon tea, clean the machines, keep the kitchen tidy. Work starts at 6:30 a.m. There’s a 15-minute break at 10, a 30-minute break at 2 p.m., and the rest of the time I just keep working.

Last week, the supervisors had a “talk” with us. Two women sat us down and said two things:

1. They think we’re not working hard enough and should find extra tasks on our own.
2. I should smile more while working.

To be honest, the job is boring and exhausting. After that talk, it somehow got worse. If it were just about the work, I could accept it. But I’m also preparing for the Goethe B2 German exam. After work, my legs hurt so badly, yet I still study for about one and a half to two hours every night. After more than a month of this routine, I’m both mentally and physically drained.

Is this a bad job? Maybe. But why do I keep doing it? Because they provide free housing, meals, and some pocket money. The truth is, I came to Germany with nothing. Back home I was just a university graduate working in an office. I chose this rough path myself, so I bite my teeth and go on.

I still have many things I want to achieve. I love reading and writing. One day, I’ll become an unhones person — someone who works in an office but secretly writes novels, not letting reality take away the only thing I have left: my thoughts.  
But right now, I’m just a broke dishwasher with dreams too big for my life.

  
Seit September dieses Jahres arbeite ich als FSJ-Freiwilliger in einem Altenheim. Hauptsächlich bin ich in der Küche tätig. Am Anfang, weil ich mit der Arbeit noch nicht vertraut war, hat die Leitung mir nicht gleich alles überlassen. Seit Mitte dieses Monats erledige ich zusammen mit einer anderen FSJlerin alle Küchenarbeiten: Sie ist in der oberen Küche, ich in der unteren. Jeden Tag bereite ich das Frühstück vor, koche Kaffee, verteile das Essen, spüle das Geschirr, bereite das Mittagessen zu, teile es aus, spüle wieder, mache den Nachmittagstee, räume die Spülmaschine aus und halte die Küche sauber. Der Arbeitstag beginnt um halb sieben, um zehn Uhr gibt es eine Viertelstunde Pause, um zwei Uhr eine halbe Stunde – sonst arbeite ich durchgehend.

Letzte Woche führten zwei Leiterinnen des Hauses ein Gespräch mit uns. Sie sagten im Wesentlichen zwei Dinge:

1. Sie finden, unsere Arbeit sei nicht ausgelastet, ich solle selbständig nach Aufgaben suchen.
2. Ich solle bei der Arbeit öfter lächeln.

Ehrlich gesagt, die Arbeit ist langweilig und anstrengend. Nach diesem Gespräch wurde eine ohnehin schlechte Arbeit noch schlechter. Wenn es nur um die Arbeit ginge, würde ich mich damit abfinden. Aber ich bereite mich gleichzeitig auf die Goethe-B2-Prüfung vor. Nach der Schicht tun mir die Beine weh, und dann lerne ich trotzdem noch jeden Abend anderthalb bis zwei Stunden Deutsch. Nach mehr als einem Monat dieser Vorbereitung bin ich nun körperlich und geistig erschöpft.

Ist das eine schlechte Arbeit? Vielleicht. Warum mache ich trotzdem weiter? Weil sie mir freie Unterkunft und Verpflegung bieten und mir jeden Monat ein Taschengeld zahlen. Im Grunde habe ich in Deutschland nichts – und auch in meinem Heimatland war ich nur ein Büroangestellter mit einem Uniabschluss. Ich habe einen schwierigen Weg gewählt. Ich habe ihn mir selbst ausgesucht, also beiße ich die Zähne zusammen und mache weiter.

Ich habe noch viele Dinge, die ich verwirklichen will. Ich liebe das Lesen, das Schreiben. Eines Tages werde ich ein unehrlicher Mensch sein – jemand, der im Büro arbeitet, aber heimlich an Romanen bastelt, um sich vom Alltag nicht das Denken nehmen zu lassen. Doch im Moment bin ich nur ein mittelloser Tellerwäscher mit großen Träumen.

原文：糟糕的工作，困顿的人生

从今年9月份开始，我在一家养老院做FSJ志愿者。主要在厨房工作，刚开始由于不熟悉工作内容，所以机构的领导没有把活全都丢给我，这个月中旬开始，我和另外一位FSJ志愿者开始包揽厨房的所有工作，她在楼上的厨房，我在楼下的厨房。每天我要准备早餐，煮咖啡，分发早餐，洗盘子，准备午饭，分发午饭，洗盘子，准备下午茶，洗洗碗机，保持厨房干净。每天的工作从六点半开始，10点有15分钟休息时间，下午2点有半小时休息时间，除此之外，一直干活。上周机构的领导和我们进行谈话，两位女士主要说了两点：1.他们觉得我们的工作不够饱和，我应该有自觉，自己找活干。2.我在工作中应该多笑笑。

老实说，这份工作很无聊，压力很大，这次谈话后，让本就糟糕的工作更加糟糕。如果只是工作，那我就认栽了，但是我最近在备考德语B2，下班后我的腿已经痛得不行，于是我就开始学德语，每天晚上1.5小时到2小时。一个多月的备考后，也就是此刻，身心俱疲。

这是一份糟糕的工作吗？也许是。但我为什么要继续下去？因为他们提供免费住宿，承包伙食，每月还提供零花钱。说到底，我来到德国一无所有，在母国我也只是个坐在办公室上班的大学毕业生，我选了一条崎岖的路，认栽了，我咬咬牙继续。

我还有很多未实现的事情，我爱看书，爱写作，总有一天，我要成为一个不诚实的人，在办公室工作中混水摸鱼，构思我的小说，不让现实剥夺我仅有的思想。但现在，我只是一个身无一物，空有梦想的洗碗工。",1,1761682418.0,expats,0,1.0,False

Of course it only makes sense to release the final version before 11.11.2025 when all sorts of sales pop up all around the places, trying to steer our attention from team orange.

I would however get more bold and say that if couple of coffee places in Prenzlauer Berg stay open 24/7 for a few days - we mights very well see the big drop by this Friday.

Now if all the devs and team Bitwig rather prioritize healthy habbits (a good idea for sure, but not really “the Berlin way of doing things”) - the final would be dropped by next Friday (Nov 7th), with Thursday and number 6 making a great safe candidate.

1oijq77,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oijq77/confused_about_very_real_emotional_interaction/,Confused about very real  emotional interaction that I (38 M) had with former  coworker (29 F),"Ok so this is long one. Maybe I’m venting more than just asking for advice. To preface my situation, I’m out of a 7 year relationship and let’s just say it’s been a minute since I have done this stuff. 

Basically, I’m not sure if I am just out of touch or if there is a cultural thing going on here but I’m left feeling confused. I want to note that I have a lot of relationship experience, and just experience with women in general. Therefore, I don’t feel like I am completely out to lunch when it comes to interacting with women.

With that all said, about a month ago, a girl who was on my kitchen team was moving back to Japan after living in Canada for a year. We had a great work relationship during this time, even had our own little inside jokes and shared love for Reese chocolate. Unfortunately the language barrier made communication difficult, especially in a high pace kitchen setting, resulting in not being able to get deep with her. I was also her manager, so it wasn’t necessarily appropriate for me to chat all the time. Regardless, I grew very fond of her over that time and I feel like it was reciprocal, although I never really felt any romantic feelings towards her necessarily.

Anyways, on her last day, I came in on my day off, decided to buy her a card and a bag of her favourite Reese chocolate and we had quite an emotional moment together. 
We had a very deep, intimate hug, locked eyes, held hands, my heart was throbbing, we both couldn’t say anything but hold back tears, this went on for at least five-ten minutes. All we could say to each other is “I’m going to miss you so much”. So, I kissed her on the hand, which was very well received, and I wished her the best. I really wasn’t expecting it to be this intense.

To be clear, I have sent people off before and have had many coworkers leave, yes including women, but this was different. I was left quite shook for the entire day and didn’t even know what to do with myself, but did my best to try and write it off as just being over emotional because she’s leaving. Because it didn’t go away by the next day, I decided to see if she wanted to meet up for coffee since she was gonna be in town for another few weeks. Obviously, she was busy getting things together and we didn’t get to meet up, but she came by the restaurant one last time a week later to drop off chocolates for everyone. 

Of course, the same moment happened again, but this time it was even more intense with longer hugs, staring into each other’s eyes longer, holding hands talking about how I would love to keep in touch with her, how I could help her with her web design homework and she seemed very into that. I even asked if it’s weird that I’m hugging so much and if it’s a thing in Japan and she said “no I love this culture”. She left, I felt emotionally raw, so I decided to send a text to her thanking her for the chocolates, and reminder that she had some tip money left over. 

She responded, which led to us texting each other over the last 2 weeks, not every single day but every other day or two. Because of this whole experience, I decided that I want to learn Japanese, not only for myself and a trip I want to take next year, but because I want to get the know her more on a deep level.

In the last interaction we had I told her that I’m learning Japanese, to which she responded VERY positively to, even seemed kind of excited. She even said. “I’m very curious to know why you’re learning Japanese 😌”. To which I confessed a big reason was because of her. 

Now, the confusing part here is when I told her this I don’t feel like I was over the top. I’m not gonna say my whole message, but this is the summary.

“ I’ve always wanted to learn Japanese and I want to travel there someday, but a big reason is actually you :). Pardon the long sappy message, but the day you left, when I looked at that beautiful, sweet, and kind face of yours one last time, I thought to myself “damn I wish I got to know her more while she was still here”. I have had coworkers leave before, but this one hit me different. I was unfortunately too distracted by everything going on at work to really pay attention to the Little moments. This is why I said I want to keep in touch with you, not just to help with web design work, but because I want to get to know you more. I thought it would be cool to get to know you not just through text but also by learning your language 🙂. I know you’re super busy and in a different time zone getting your life back together, but I would love to video call you sometime and talk in Japanese once I get to a basic conversation level if you’re into it, although you might laugh at my pronunciation the whole time.😅” 

……I have been left on read for almost five days now….

This is where I am very confused and I’m wondering if this is a cultural thing because I have heard that ghosting is very common in Japan if people get emotionally overwhelmed or if they’re just not interested to avoid conflict. But I wonder was this overly endearing.? it’s not like I confessed my love to her and that I’m only learning Japanese so that she’ll be with me, so I don’t really know what to think.

I’m not really sure what to do , but if she doesn’t respond in a couple days, I’m just gonna say a “hey hope you’re well. I guess they got carried away in that last message. No pressure or expectations here, talk to you later”. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk and roast me if I’m just a sappy dork.

I knew what I was getting into with Toyota generally having subpar quality compared to other vehicles since my husband has a Rav 4, but going from a 2021 Forester (which was a fantastic car with great safety features) to this was still a big jump. I also got some cup holder inserts because I am 2 for 2 on taking my coffee cup inside with the holder still attached. There isn't much space on the console for phones, sunglasses etc but the additional holder will definitely help with that. 

Anyway, yall have helped me a ton already and I'm THRILLED to get to join this sub. My parents had a 1997 3G that I loved for years until they sold it to a friend of mine (who appropriately babies in the wilds of West Virginia and lets me drive when I come to visit). I finally saved enough to buy my own and plan on keeping this until one of us kicks it!",2,1761681252.0,4Runner,1,1.0,False

**Some background on the robot dog:** I have a Unitree Go2 EDU. It was purchased for the non-profit I work for by a community partner. I primarily use it to educate underserved teenagers on the south side of Chicago. I teach robotics concepts, with a main focus on coding. New learners can create basic sequences for the robot with block coding, while more advanced students can utilize the Python coding language to operate and design programs for the robot. We also get invited to bring the robot to various events at schools, museums, start-ups, parties etc. 

I’m part of a Discord group with the other owners of this robot dog model. I am aware of security issues with previous models. I am fully up to note on the current model's capabilities and potential dangers. I have seen all news (and other media) about this robot dog and others.

**Event details:** It’s a drag comedy competition at a local theatre, and 80% of my drag family has participated in one or more of the 5 seasons. My step (drag) son was competing in the current season. There are no hard and fast rules on content, and the core group of attendees/participants is accepting of comedy of all kinds, edgy or otherwise, with common sense boundaries. This specific night was celebrating the host’s birthday. She loves pups, so it was dog-themed.

**Now let's break down the DMs:**

1-4: We only see each other weekly in passing at this event, and I wasn’t trying to or especially interested in talking to her this evening. The only time we interacted directly that night was when I asked her to grab the robot dog from the dressing room (where I kept it during the performances, powered off), and she attempted to, but said it was too heavy and let me go get it myself. (For context, I wasn’t involved in any of the performances that night, so I didn’t want to go into the private dressing room without asking.)

4-7: This is a common pattern for her. She antagonizes people online, in public or private, has long private conversations with them, and proceeds to share all the details with anyone who will listen, or even post about it.

8-16: I have so much but so little to say about this. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about. I don’t even feel like defending myself on this one. It triggers her because she perceives it as being related to the police?? That’s what this is about??? Tell me you think it’s creepy, that you’re afraid China is watching us with it, maybe you’re scared of AI.. but.. police? (And yes I have seen and read all related media. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.) 

17-22: She’s lying. I had already cleared it with the venue ownership. The host of the show interacted with the robot dog. The only two staff members working that night told me they thought it was cool. The one time I powered it on for 10 minutes, it was before the show started, in a side area of the lobby. People who were interested were able to come over and talk to me and interact with the dog. No one even had to look at it if they didn’t want to. There was a path from the outside door, thru the lobby, and into the theatre without even passing by the robot. There was also another clear path to the bar/bathroom/dressing room area. I normally use the robot dog around children, so I’m always actively aware of safety and boundaries, not just physical.

23-25: Of all the things that have been seen, done, and pushed at this event, my robot dog is what makes her think of the police? One of the previous contestant’s parent is a retired detective and has attended the shows. Fake guns on stage and sounds of guns have been used in multiple numbers throughout all seasons. There have been people acting as literal police in more than one performance. Let’s get real - the police use any and every object that has ever been featured in any performance more than they use robot dogs.. cars, coffee, uniforms, paper & pens, flashlights, cameras, boots, sunglasses, real dogs, oxygen……………………….(sorry, I’m getting annoyed all over again)!

26-34: Why would I bring it to other nights? It’s a dog night.. so I brought my dog. I so badly wish she would get a clue.

35-38: No thanks, I’m good.

9-46: I’ve talked to this person maybe twice before this, only at the event. I’m not a fan or a friend.

I didn't see the messages for \~2 months, as I don't get Instagram notifications. A following week, at the same event, this person performed with 3 guns in their number with no warning. They also frequently chastise community members who do not require N95 masks at events, but will happily spit in your face for an hour while they gossip about their roommate or whatever issue they are posting about that week.

1oijh76,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1oijh76/mia/,Mia,"Four years ago, under a canopy of spring blossoms and the weight of promises whispered in candlelight, I stood at the altar and pledged my life to the woman who had become my world. Our marriage was a tapestry woven from shared dreams—late-night talks about the home we’d build, the laughter that echoed through our first apartment, and the quiet joy of discovering we were expecting our first child. Within those early months, our family grew, a second little miracle arriving not long after, filling our days with the chaos and wonder of parenthood. We were young, ambitious, and utterly convinced that love like ours was impervious to storms. But as the calendar turned, marking the end of our first year together as husband and wife, a shadow began to creep in—one born not of malice, but of unspoken voids and fleeting distractions.
It started innocently enough, as these things often do. She entered my life through a mutual friend, a single mother whose resilience I admired from afar. With one child tugging at her sleeve and a smile that seemed to carry the weight of unspoken battles, she embodied a quiet strength that drew me in. We met at a casual gathering, exchanging stories over coffee that stretched into hours. She spoke of the exhaustion of solo parenting, the ache of dreams deferred, and I found myself nodding, sharing fragments of my own fatigue—the relentless grind of work, the sleepless nights with our newborns, the subtle erosion of intimacy in a marriage stretched thin by routine. What began as friendship, a safe harbor for confessions too raw for the ones closest to us, soon blurred into something deeper. Texts turned flirtatious, lunches became alibis, and before I knew it, the lines I swore I’d never cross had dissolved like mist in the morning sun.
Over the next three years—the final, treacherous stretch of our four-year union—this affair bloomed into a parallel life, a secret garden thriving in the cracks of my crumbling fidelity. She was not just a diversion; she became my confidante, my escape, the one who saw the man I longed to be again. We stole moments in hidden cafes and whispered plans in the dim glow of late-night drives, our connection deepening with every shared vulnerability. I knew her burdens intimately: the child she raised with fierce determination, the ex who had vanished like smoke, leaving her to navigate the world alone. And yet, armed with that knowledge, I did not pull away. Instead, I leaned in, rationalizing our bond as a necessary exhale in a marriage that had grown stale. Words were exchanged in the heat of passion—promises of forever, vows that echoed the ones I’d made at my wedding, now tainted by hypocrisy. “This is real,” we’d say, as if repetition could summon truth from thin air.
But love, illicit or otherwise, is rarely a straight path. Altercations fractured our fragile idyll, storms of jealousy and guilt that left us both bruised. Arguments erupted over my divided loyalties, her fear of being the “other” woman, my futile attempts to compartmentalize a heart pulling in two directions. There were nights of silence, days of desperate reconciliation, and tears shed in the anonymity of hotel rooms. She accused me of using her as a bandage for wounds I wouldn’t heal at home; I countered with defenses built on half-truths, insisting our time together was pure, untainted by the life I returned to each evening. Our child—hers, the bright-eyed boy who called me “Uncle” in innocent play—became a poignant reminder",1,1761681040.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

How to more gracefully handle when the question of past relationships or dating experience comes up when dating?,"Hi everyone. As the title mentions, I'm in my 30s and I've never been in a relationship. For the past year, I have been using the apps and trying to meet new people and go on dates. I've been on several first dates now and most of these experiences have been good. But I wasn't into anyone I've met so far to pursue things further, and I still haven't met up with anyone for more than 2 dates (and then some texting after the first date, which mostly faded into nothing or ended up ghosting). Most of the first dates have been coffee dates with lighthearted conversations and seeing if I'm into him with no stakes.

But I recently had a handful of poor experiences where I went on a first date with some men who were a bit more ""serious"" right away. They asked direct questions about my dating history, if I'm a virgin, and one man even said he could tell that I don't have much experience dating. These direct questions caught me off guard, and I felt like I was instantly put on the spot and a bit ashamed by my lack of experience. It got awkward, and they could tell I was uncomfortable with the question. I never talked to or saw these guys again. I try to understand that these men probably do not want to waste any time, so they ask right away, but...I really wish they wouldn't.

I expect questions like this to come up, but I'm still so new to dating that I did not handle it very well. I don't want questions about my dating experiences to come up on the first date because they're a new person, and I'm not going to be fully comfortable with a man I just met. Also, it's not only dating history that I don't wish to reveal right way, but I also withhold some information like what I do for a living because I work in a very niche field and it would be easily discoverable (generally, I give an adjacent but vague industry and that usually will satisfy them enough to not prode further on the first date). Anyway, I do think that I would be more comfortable with sharing how I don't have any experience during a third or fourth date, but I haven't gotten to that point yet with anyone yet. But I want to learn and grow from this so that I can handle it better next time with a bit more grace, or maybe try to deflect the question off a bit, kind of like I do when I'm asked about work so things don't get awkward and I don't feel uncomfortable right away.

When I was diagnosed it was a moment of relief and answered so many questions. 

The clinician started me on Elvanse, I went right up to the max 108mg and at the time I didn't think the meds were doing anything other than replacing the 4 cups of coffee i used to have. My prescription was changed to Concerta; again, I went right up to the legal dosage in the UK. I told my clinician the same thing. ""I don't think they're working"". I was put on non-stimulants and after 2 weeks told my clinician they weren't working... Should the clinician have been more ""assertive"" towards me and at least told me to give them a chance? At the time I didn't really know what the medication was going to do. I hoped that I was going to turn into Bradley Coopers in ""Limitless"".

The clinician  threathened me with ""we will discharge you from the service"" as there is nothing more they could do. It's only now that I realise that this ""threat"" was unaceptable considering I paid for a year's service with the company. 

All this went from June 2024 to about November 2024 and because I was scared of being discharged I asked the clinician to let me try Elvanse again. The second time around I could tell the difference in myself off and on the meds and they seemed to be having a positive effect, but in Feb 2025 the side effects became unbearable (Dry mouth, Sleep problems) so I asked to try Concerta again. I had to titrate again and I'm currently on 72mg.  

Looking back on the last 15 months I have had ups and downs with my mental health, made impulsive decisions that have changed my life, fell out with my family members, had many emotional outbursts, and most recently started a masters which i am now thinking of quitting. All this time I have been on the meds. 

If there are any professionals on here, it would be great to get some advice. I know the medication does something but it's not doing what i need it to do. My brain is constantly going at 100 mph, my attention is still poor and I am still impulsive...

I personally think I have Autism as well as ADHD, as it is in my family and I do experience all the symptons. 

To sum up, I don't know what to do anymore. I have just paid £450 for another year of shared care but afraid that I am going to have to titrate again and pay £130 per month for medication that I can't even tell if it's working or not anymore. 

I have never been prescribed Amfexa by any of my clinicians so maybe that's what I need to ask for. 

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated and I appreciate you reading and getting to the end of my post.

It effortlessly combines style and function, carrying your essentials while elevating your look. From sleek office outfits to casual weekend wear, the right bag can pull your entire ensemble together. Alongside sling bags for women, a shoulder bag is a wardrobe essential that adapts to your lifestyle, mood, and occasion.

[Here's]() how to style your shoulder bag with different outfits, ensuring you always step out in confidence and style.

**1. Office Elegance Made Easy**

In a professional setting, a structured shoulder bag exudes sophistication. Pair it with tailored blazers, fitted trousers, or pencil skirts, and finish the look with polished shoes. A classic neutral shade—think black, beige, or tan—ensures your bag complements your attire without overpowering it.

For a modern twist, sling bags for women with clean lines and subtle detailing can be just as chic. They keep your hands free, perfect for juggling a laptop, notebooks, and your daily essentials while maintaining a professional vibe.

**2. Casual Weekend Comfort**

Weekends are made for comfort, but that [doesn't]() mean sacrificing style. Imagine soft denim jeans, a relaxed tee, and sneakers—simple, effortless, and timeless. A leather or canvas [shoulder bag](https://stevemadden.me/collections/handbags-shoulder-bags) instantly upgrades this casual outfit, adding a touch of polish without looking overdone.

For a lighter, more playful look, consider sling bags for women in pastel shades or minimal prints. [They're]() easy to carry while running errands, meeting friends for coffee, or exploring your city. Compact, practical, and stylish, these bags fit seamlessly into a relaxed weekend wardrobe.

**3. Evening Glamour**

Evening events are your chance to shine, and your bag can make all the difference. A small or medium-sized shoulder bag with subtle metallic accents or sleek textures pairs beautifully with cocktail dresses, gowns, or tailored evening outfits. It adds refinement without drawing attention away from your ensemble.

For a more daring or playful touch, sling bags for women with chain straps or embellished details create that perfect balance of glamour and practicality. They allow you to carry essentials while keeping your hands free to enjoy the night.

**4. Street Style Statements**

Street style is all about experimenting and embracing individuality. Oversized jackets, hoodies, and ripped jeans look effortlessly chic when paired with a bold shoulder bag. Whether you choose vibrant colours, unusual shapes, or interesting textures, the bag becomes a focal point that elevates your urban aesthetic.

Wearing sling bags for women across your chest adds an edgy vibe, perfect for a modern street style look. Practical and stylish, [they're]() ideal for those who like to combine comfort with a sense of fashion adventure.

**5. Boho-Chic Vibes**

For those drawn to a bohemian aesthetic, a shoulder bag with fringe, embroidery, or slouchy textures is a natural choice. Flowy maxi dresses, off-shoulder tops, or wide-legged trousers paired with earthy-toned bags create a relaxed, free-spirited look.

Sling bags for women crafted from woven or macramé materials enhance the boho feel. Their textures and natural tones complement loose, flowing fabrics, perfect for outdoor events, festivals, or casual summer strolls.

**6. Travel-Ready Looks**

When travelling, comfort and functionality are key, but style need not be compromised. A roomy shoulder bag can carry your essentials while keeping you looking chic. Pair it with jumpsuits, casual trousers, or relaxed dresses for an effortless travel ensemble.

If you prefer a lighter, more hands-free option, sling bags for women are ideal. Adjustable straps and multiple compartments make them perfect for exploring a new city or navigating airport terminals while keeping everything organised.

**7. Date Night Charm**

A shoulder bag can set the tone for a date night. Pair a compact bag with a midi dress, skirt, or jumpsuit to add elegance to your look. Subtle textures or neutral tones ensure your bag complements your outfit rather than competing with it.

For more casual dates, sling bags for women in soft, playful shades create a charming and approachable look. [They're]() perfect for coffee dates, evening strolls, or casual dinners, adding a touch of personality to your outfit.

**8. Monochrome Magic**

Monochrome outfits are modern, sleek, and effortlessly chic. A shoulder bag in a slightly contrasting shade adds depth and interest. For example, a cream bag with an all-white outfit or a deep brown bag with beige tones creates a subtle yet stylish contrast.

Sling bags for women in jewel tones or metallic finishes can also make monochrome looks pop. These small bursts of colour or texture can transform a simple outfit into something remarkable without overwhelming it.

**9. Seasonal Styling**

Every season offers new opportunities to refresh your bag game. Spring and summer are perfect for pastel shoulder bags and light fabrics, paired with airy dresses, skirts, or linen trousers. These choices give your look a fresh, effortless appeal.

Autumn and winter call for deeper tones like burgundy, navy, or olive. Textured sling bags for women, such as those with suede or quilted finishes, add warmth and depth to layered outfits, making them seasonally appropriate while keeping style intact.

**10. Minimalist Everyday Wear**

Minimalist fashion is all about simplicity and refinement. A neutral shoulder bag in shades like beige, grey, or soft brown pairs perfectly with understated outfits, offering a polished, sophisticated touch.

For those who prefer clean lines and subtle elegance, [sling bags for women](https://stevemadden.me/collections/womens-crossbody-bags) with minimal detailing are a perfect complement. They are practical, stylish, and seamlessly integrate into everyday looks, from running errands to casual office days.

# Conclusion

A shoulder bag is more than just a functional accessory—[it's]() a versatile style statement. From office meetings to evening events, casual weekends to street style adventures, the right bag can complete any outfit.

Sling bags for women offer a lighter, more playful option without compromising on style, making them ideal for hands-free convenience. Whether you prefer classic, structured designs or bold, expressive styles, these bags are essential for any modern wardrobe.

The secret to styling is simple: choose a bag that complements your outfit, suits the occasion, and reflects your personal style. Once you master this, your shoulder bag or sling bag becomes a defining part of your look—functional, fashionable, and undeniably chic.

Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."".

I’d like some advice on how to handle a sensitive situation at my workplace professionally.

There’s a lady (let’s call her A) who works in our office and is responsible for making tea, coffee, and helping with small errands for employees. Recently, one of my coworkers (B) told me that A has been making unnecessary and negative remarks about me to others.

I was honestly surprised because I’ve always been polite and respectful toward her. Here’s what’s been happening:

1. The bus situation:
A once went somewhere by bus to bring something, and she told B that my manager hadn’t given her any money for transportation. I felt bad for her and just suggested to my manager that next time we could go by bike instead, so she wouldn’t have to take the bus again. My intention was to reduce her work, not to criticize her. But apparently, she told others that I was talking unnecessarily about her.


2. The lunch day:
One day, when we were planning to go out for lunch, she told everyone that I had gone and said something inappropriate to another person (C) in front of the Telugu group — which isn’t true. I was simply involved in planning the lunch and replied casually with “haha” while we were discussing it.


3. The coffee incident:
I once told her that if I came late, she didn’t need to make coffee again just for me — I’d have it after lunch. I said that to make things easier for her, but she apparently told others that I was showing attitude.


4. The flowers:
When we bought flowers once, she commented that they were “cheap” and said if we had spent more, we would’ve gotten better quality ones. Again, small things — but it feels unnecessarily negative.



She has done similar things with others too. Earlier, she scolded another person (D) in front of everyone for something minor, and recently she also spoke badly about B. Now it’s me.

I’m planning to talk to her tomorrow because this has started to bother me. But I want to do it calmly and respectfully — I just want her to understand that it’s not appropriate to talk behind someone’s back or spread negativity in the workplace.

How can I bring this up politely but firmly so she understands it’s not okay, without sounding rude or creating more drama?",1,1761680613.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

A few months ago, I was drowning in spreadsheets, ad dashboards, and endless optimization tasks for my Google and Meta campaigns. Every day felt like I was just spinning my wheels, tweaking bids, testing creatives, adjusting audiences, and honestly, my results weren’t moving the needle as much as I hoped.

That’s when I stumbled upon Get-Ryze.аi. It’s an AI-powered platform that automatically manages and optimizes your ads. I was skeptical at first “Can an AI really do better than me?” but I decided to give it a shot.

The setup was surprisingly smooth. I connected my ad accounts, defined my goals, and let the platform analyze my campaigns. Within days, I noticed that it wasn’t just adjusting bids or budgets, it was making intelligent, real-time changes to targeting and creative testing that I hadn’t even thought of.

The best part? I started seeing measurable improvements without having to micromanage every detail. My CTR went up, CPC went down, and I finally had time to focus on strategy instead of getting stuck in the weeds.

It’s not magic, it still needs proper goals and guidance, but for anyone who’s tired of spending hours on ad management, Get-Ryze.аi is worth checking out. It feels like having a full-time ad expert working 24/7, except it doesn’t ask for coffee breaks.

You’ve probably seen alert whistles and info cards around the city in cafés, schools, libraries, or book boxes. They’re part of a community effort to help people stay alert when ICE activity or detainments happen nearby—and to normalize the signal for long-term, general community protection.

This week, Wicker Park is hosting a neighborhood event where we’ll pack whistle kits with the protocol, Know Your Rights cards, and bilingual resource guides.

📍 The Wormhole Coffee
📅 Tuesday, November 5th
⏰ 7:30–9:30 PM

A small group of us has 3D-printed and shared around 30,000 whistles, and more are on the way to Wicker Park/West Town. Some neighbors have even opened their own printers to help keep production going. Dm if you want to contribute.

One design started here in Chicago, and we want the sound—and the awareness—to keep spreading beyond the city, protecting communities across the U.S.

People can help by sharing the QR and purchasing whistles (at the lowest cost possible without losing sound power).

Those purchase proceeds, along with donations, fuel the cycle: funding filament, materials, and new printers to keep free whistles flowing to schools, businesses, and community spaces.

We’re also collecting non-perishable food items on-site to support neighbors facing recent SNAP cuts.

If you’re nearby, come by, bring a friend, or scan to support the effort.

A Long Ago Fallen Russia

Prologue — The Last White

    The fire cracked weakly in the iron belly of the stove, its warmth scarcely reaching the frost that silvered the rafters. Outside, the forest pressed in — black trunks, blacker shadows, and the hush of snow falling without end. Somewhere in that stillness, a wolf called, its voice thin and far away, like a memory.
    
    Sergei Antonovich Volkov sat at the table, his greatcoat draped over his shoulders, the faded Imperial cockade still pinned to the collar — a relic from a world that no longer existed. His beard was white at the edges now, the years having stolen more from him than any bullet could. On the rough boards before him lay a German map, its folds greasy from handling, dotted with his pencil marks — villages burned, patrols avoided, men lost.
    
    A young partisan entered, stamping snow from his boots.
    
    “Tovarishch komandir,” (Comrade commander,) he said, hesitating at the old word. “Nemtsy blizko. Dva kilometra ot reki.” (The Germans are close. Two kilometres from the river.)
    
    Sergei did not look up. “My ne tovarishchi. My russkiye.” (We are not comrades. We are Russians.) He folded the map carefully, as though it were something sacred.
    
    The boy shifted, embarrassed. “Da, gospodin polkovnik...” (Yes, Colonel...)
    
    “Net, ne nazyvay menya tak. Eto imya mertvogo mira.” (No, don’t call me that. That name belongs to a dead world.)

A harsh voice from the doorway cut through the quiet — German, brisk and metallic.

    “Herr Wolkow!” (Mr. Volkov!)

Sergei turned slowly. The Wehrmacht liaison, Hauptmann Müller, stood there in his grey coat, snow melting on the brim of his cap. Behind him loomed a translator — a thin Baltic man with tired eyes.

    “Der Oberst bittet Sie, sofort zu kommen.” (The Colonel requests you come at once.)
    
    The translator murmured in Russian, “Polkovnik vyzyvayet vas, ser.” (The Colonel summons you, sir.)
    
    Sergei rose, the chair groaning under his weight. “Skazhi yemu, chto ya ne soldat. Ya prikhodzhu tol’ko kogda khochu.” (Tell him I am no soldier. I come only when I wish.)
    
    Müller’s jaw tightened as the translator relayed the words. The German stared for a long moment, then simply nodded once — the way one acknowledges a storm that cannot be reasoned with.
    
    When the door shut, Sergei poured a measure of vodka into a tin cup. The liquid shimmered in the firelight like molten glass.
    
    “Za Rossiyu, kotoroy bol’she net.” (To the Russia that no longer exists.)
    
    He drank alone, while outside, the snow kept falling, soft and relentless — covering the past, the dead, and the dreams of men who refused to let them go.

Chapter I — The Encounter

    The village had been dead for months — roofs caved in, doors hanging like broken ribs, windows blinded by frost. Only the church still stood, its onion dome scorched black by artillery, the cross at its peak twisted but unfallen. It was there, beneath that cross, that Sergei Volkov waited.
    
    He stood beside the shattered altar, his breath turning to mist. The icons had long since been stripped away, yet the faint scent of incense still clung to the stones — a ghost of prayers that no one dared utter now.
    
    Outside, the crunch of boots in the snow. Three figures approached through the pale fog — cautious, rifles slung low. When they entered, Sergei saw at once that they were soldiers by bearing, not by uniform. Torn coats, mixed insignia, but eyes that knew the discipline of command.
    
    The first man saluted out of habit. “Vy Sergei Volkov?” (You are Sergei Volkov?)
    
    Sergei nodded. “Zavisit ot togo, kto sprashivayet.” (Depends on who is asking.)
    
    The man smiled faintly. “Kapitan Grigori Yelchin, byvshiy ofitser artillerii. My ishchem Russkuyu armiya.” (Captain Grigori Yelchin, former artillery officer. We’re looking for the Russian Army.)
    
    Sergei’s eyes hardened. “Russkoy armii bol’she net. Ostalis’ tol’ko my.” (The Russian Army no longer exists. Only we remain.)
    
    He gestured toward the ruined pews, and they sat, their breath mingling like smoke in the cold air.
    
    Sergei unfolded a tattered map, its edges burnt. “The Germans will not help us forever,” he said in English, as if testing them. “They see us as tools — we must become a blade of our own making.”
    
    Yelchin leaned forward. “My sobiraem lyudey. Byvshikh ofitserov. Te, kto ne khotyat ni Gitlera, ni Stalina.” (We are gathering men. Former officers. Those who want neither Hitler nor Stalin.)
    
    “I kak vy ikh nakhodite?” (And how do you find them?) Sergei asked.
    
    Yelchin smiled again — tired, almost proud. “My khodim po selam. Govorim tol’ko odnu frazu: ‘Za Rossiyu, kotoroy bol’she net.’ Esli chelovek otvetyet: ‘I nikogda ne budet,’ — znachit, on s nami.”

(We go from village to village. We speak one phrase: ‘For the Russia that no longer exists.’ If a man answers: ‘And never shall again,’ then he is one of us.)

    Sergei’s expression did not change, but his hand trembled slightly as he touched the map. “Eto khorosho. Eto nash znak.” (That is good. That will be our sign.)
    
    A silence settled over them — a pact made not by oath, but by memory. Outside, the wind howled through the empty bell tower, carrying with it the sound of something older than faith — the echo of an empire buried beneath the snow.

Chapter II — The Double Tongue

    They moved through the barracks like ghosts, the winter light pooling on the floorboards and the smell of wet wool thick in the air. Sergei watched them from the shadow of a broken window as the men he and Yelchin had recruited — not by oath but by memory — learned to bend themselves into other shapes. They wore Red Army tunics now, patched and flayed, their collars turned from the wind and from attention. The uniform was a costume; the posture, the glance, the little private pity for subordinates were the true disguises.
    
    Inside a cramped hut, a lieutenant of the 102nd Rifle Regiment sat with his back to the stove, eyes hollow as if from too many nights without sleep. He had been young enough to fight for a dream and old enough to know it had been stolen. He spoke first without preamble.
    
    “Vy kazhetsya nam nuzhen, starik.” (You seem like someone we need, old man.)
    
    Sergei’s smile was a thin, practiced thing. “My vse nuzhny drug drugu. Rossiia nuzhdaetsya.” (We all need each other. Russia needs us.)
    
    Recruitment, in their method, avoided drama. It was a careful choreography of recognition: a phrase uttered at the right time, an offer of bread and a warm place, a quiet question about the old officer’s regiment or the name of a village now empty. Those who answered with laughter or denial were left alone; those who answered with that particular ache — the tiny concession that the past still mattered — were given a different look, and a different invitation.
    
    They did not hand out manifestos. They did not draw up lists. They spoke in memories and small proofs: a salute executed wrong, the exact way a certain song ended, the name of a colonel no one else mentioned. It was not skill at deceit that bound them to one another but the mutual refusal to let the old world be effaced without a fight.
    
    When the lieutenant finally asked, almost as if asking himself, “Kak my dolzhny zhdat’ ukazaniya?” (How are we to receive instructions?) Yelchin answered softly, “Pokhoronnyye stikhi. Pis’ma bez otkrytykh podpisey. Slova, kotorye ne stoyat nichego dlya drugikh.” (Funeral verses. Letters without signatures. Words that mean nothing to others.)
    
    Sergei caught the edge in the boy’s voice and tempered it. “Not codes,” he said in English, as if to fold a dangerous thing away. “Not maps with arrows. We pass heads, not hands. We pass knowledge: where the pontoon waits a week later, who will be sent to pull the wounded from the road. Names. Times. Little things that make a man look elsewhere when duty demands him.”
    
    They practised their faces until they were fluent in other sorrows. A supply clerk who once wept at the sight of a church bell now laughed at the commissar’s jokes. A young sergeant, recruited after a night drinking with Yelchin, learned to whistle the marches the battalion liked and to scold his platoon for slovenliness. He carried with him a slip of paper folded small — a name, an hour, a direction. The paper meant nothing except to those who knew to look.
    
    It was the lieutenant who had the courage to ask the question no man liked to voice: “A my peredayom etu informatsiyu nemtsam?” (And we pass this information to the Germans?) The word hung in the room like smoke.
    
    Sergei met his eyes. “My ispol’zuem ikh.” (We use them.) He did not say the name Hitler. There are limits a man keeps even when he has abandoned nations. “They hold the maps and the permits. They are the enemy of the Soviets this season. We trade them what we must to buy space to breathe. It is not love, only necessity.”
    
    Yelchin folded his hands on the table. “Kazhdaya informatsiya — eto veroyatnost’. My otnosimsya k ney kak k zhelezku, ne kak k dukhovnomu dukhu.” (Every piece of information is probability. We treat it like iron, not as a soul.)
    
    Their first meeting with the German liaison was held at dusk, under the ruined bell tower where they had once swore to one another. The Hauptmann arrived with the translator, a man of the Baltic coast whose Russian was soft and precise. The German spoke in clipped tones, the words falling like measured stones into the snow.
    
    “Herr Wolkow, wir haben Bedarf an lokalen Nachrichten. Bewegungen, Versorgungswege, Namen.” (Mr. Volkov, we require local intelligence. Movements, supply routes, names.)
    
    The translator repeated, in Russian, “On prosit lokalkuyu informatsiyu: peredvizheniya, marshruty snabzheniya, imena.” (He asks for local information: movements, supply routes, names.) His face was unreadable; he was an instrument, an intermediary who carried speech like a coin.
    
    Sergei answered in Russian, not translating, the words calibrated for both mercy and cruelty. “My ne rabotaem po rasporyazheniyam. My predlagayem to, chto pozvolit nam sushchestvovat’. Vy platite—i my daem to, chto nuzhno. No my ne vashye lyudi. Nikogda.” (We do not work to orders. We offer what will allow us to exist. You pay—and we give what you need. But we are never your people. Never.)
    
    The Hauptmann inclined his head. “Das genügt. Wir wissen den Preis.” (That will do. We know the price.) The translator mirrored the German into Russian, and in that echo the bargain took shape: information for tacit tolerance, action traded not for allegiance but for room to manoeuvre.
    
    They learned, quickly and bitterly, the cost of such trades. The Germans would take what the cell gave and use it in ways the Whites could not control; sometimes they would turn a report into a slaughter the volunteers had not wished for. At other times, the Germans would leave pockets of the front weak, and the Whites would use those gaps to ferry families away, to hide caches of relics, to move men who refused both ideologies toward the east. Each decision was a tally in a ledger only Sergei could see: advantage scored against conscience, survival balanced against betrayal.
    
    Late one night, after a small victory where a supply convoy was diverted and a company slipped past an outpost, the lieutenant came to Sergei and placed both hands on his shoulders. He whispered, “Ty ne boishsya, chto my stanem predateliami?” (Aren’t you afraid we shall become traitors?)
    
    Sergei looked at the face of the boy who had once saluted the wrong way and answered, not with doctrine but with the kind of honesty that smells of foxfire and frost. “Ya bojus’. Kazhdyi iz nas dolzhen ponesti etu tyazheluyu ves’. No esli my ne sdelayem etogo, to chto ostanetsya? Dva tyrana i odna pochti umeravshaya strana?” (I am afraid. Each of us must bear this heavy weight. But if we do not do this, what remains? Two tyrants and a country nearly dead?)
    
    Outside, the snow closed in on the tracks of men and machines. Inside, they marked time with maps and whispers, with folded paper and the small ritual of language—Russian to Russian, German through a translator. They passed secrets like contraband, not trusting the taste of them, but knowing each was a coin to buy another day of existence for a Russia that had already, in its own heart, fallen long ago.

Chapter III — The White Silence

    The winter of 1944 came down like a sentence.
    
    It did not fall — it descended, heavy and patient, grinding colour and sound into the same dim palette of white and steel. In the border forests between Karelia and the frozen lakes, Sergei Volkov and his men moved like smoke between the lines — neither German nor Soviet, ghosts with old loyalties and new debts.
    
    The wind had teeth. Frost bloomed on their rifles. Even the breath from their horses turned to glass in the air. They travelled with reindeer-hide skis, scavenged coats, and a flag they dared not raise — the tricolour of a Russia that no longer ruled anything but memory.
    
    Yelchin checked the compass, a German issue piece he’d taken from a dead officer near Smolensk.
    
    “My blizko k Linii Mannergeima. Finny zhdut nas.” (We are close to the Mannerheim Line. The Finns are waiting for us.)
    
    Sergei nodded. His lips cracked when he spoke.
    
    “Finny znayut tol’ko odno — sovety ikh vragi. Etogo dostatochno.” (The Finns know only one thing — the Soviets are their enemy. That is enough.)
    
    They reached the Finnish lines after two days of silence, marked only by distant gunfire and the faint green glow of aurora over the treetops.
    
    A sentry’s voice broke the dark.
    
    “Pysähtyä! Kuka siellä?” (Halt! Who goes there?)
    
    A second voice followed, softer, in broken Russian:
    
    “Kto vy? Druzi ili vragi?” (Who are you? Friends or enemies?)
    
    Sergei stepped forward, slow and deliberate.
    
    “My vragi ikh vragov. Etogo dolzhno byt’ dostatochno.” (We are enemies of your enemies. That should be enough.)
    
    After a long pause, the Finns let them through. The men of the frontier were cautious, their faces masked by snow hoods and mistrust. They offered black bread, hot tar coffee, and silence. Around the campfire that night, Sergei studied their discipline — quiet, efficient, without slogans. It reminded him of the old Guard regiments before politics had devoured them.
    
    A Finnish captain approached, his Russian fluent but cold as the night.
    
    “Vy khotite pomoch’ Finlyandii? Ili prosto ubivat’ sovetov?” (You wish to help Finland? Or simply to kill Soviets?)
    
    Sergei smiled faintly. “Ya khotel by pomoch’ Rossii, no yeye uzhe net.” (I would like to help Russia, but she is gone.)
    
    The captain studied him a long moment, then handed over a folded map.
    
    “Togda my imeyem odin i tot zhe tsely.” (Then we have the same purpose.)

They went to work the next night.

    The plan was simple — sabotage the Soviet fuel depot beyond the frozen ridge, delay the offensive, and vanish into the forest before dawn.
    
    They moved under the aurora, that green ghost-light of the north, their skis whispering across crusted snow. When the first guard appeared, Sergei motioned with two fingers; the man fell without a sound. Yelchin’s breath came out in slow clouds as he set the charges.
    
    “Skol’ko vremeni?” (How long?) Sergei whispered.
    
    “Desyat’ minut.” (Ten minutes.)
    
    The explosion was a muted bloom of orange in the distance, swallowed quickly by snow and night. The depot went up like a dying sun — barrels bursting, shadows running. For a heartbeat, the flame reflected in Sergei’s eyes, and he felt again that impossible ache of pride, as though the fire burned for something sacred.
    
    But then came the echo — distant Soviet voices, frantic, confused.
    
    “Tovarishchi! Pozhar! Vrag v týle!” (Comrades! Fire! The enemy is behind us!)
    
    Gunfire cracked across the ridge. The cell scattered into the trees, shadows among shadows. Two of their number did not return.
    
    By dawn, the forest was still again.
    
    The Finns were gone, their camp erased. Only Sergei and Yelchin remained at the meeting point, breathing frost.
    
    “My sdelali eto.” (We did it.) Yelchin said.
    
    Sergei nodded, looking east. “Da. No kazhdaya pobeda delaet nas vragami vsego mira.” (Yes. But every victory makes us enemies of the whole world.)
    
    He turned away as the sun rose — pale, indifferent, and cold as the empire he still carried in his heart.

Chapter IV — Encirclement of Nations

    The world had a way of making a thing intolerable by sheer repetition. Once a whisper crossed a border, it became a dispatch; once a dispatch reached a desk, it became an order. Sergei Volkov and his band existed, night after night, in the grey space between those desks — an unwanted footnote that every government found inconvenient and therefore urgent.
    
    They moved like the weather, drifting from one ruin to another, living off silence and old training. Yet the nets had multiplied; they were no longer merely chased by the NKVD’s cold intelligence. British officers asked for proof in neat hand — their memos courteous and grave. American liaisons, through a circuit of cables and interpreters, wanted confirmation before they would pull any strings. The Germans, who had once tolerated Sergei’s bargains, now treated his men as combustible liabilities. Even the Finns, who had accepted an uneasy camaraderie for the sake of a front, hedged their hospitality with diplomatic caution.
    
    On a bitter morning when the sky seemed scrubbed clean of pity, Sergei sat with Yelchin and three others in the cellar of an abandoned manor. A single lamp cast a pool of yellow that barely held back the dark. They had not slept properly in days; each snatch of rest was another entry in their ledger of fear.
    
    Yelchin rubbed his gloved hands and muttered, ""Vse nashi marshruty prosmotrely. ""(All our routes are watched. They have lists). His voice had the flatness of a man who had counted too many losses. A young courier, Misha, shuffled a packet of folded papers on the table as if its edges might bleed. ""Kto pervyy? Kto iz nas popadet v ruki?"" (Who will be first? Which one of us will fall into their hands?)
    
    Sergei looked at the boy and then at the faces mapped with cold and defiance. He thought of impossible things: the smell of incense in a ruined church, the cadence of an old march, his son’s small hands. All of that felt like contraband now. He answered quietly, ""My ne peredayom sebe. My ne bezhim. My rabotaem tol’ko tak, kak nuzhno"" (We do not hand ourselves over. We do not run. We work only as we must).
    
    They still had one advantage: ambiguity. To one embassy they were insurgents; to another, bandits; to a third, useful auxiliaries. It was a precarious coin. The British wanted evidence they were not mere collaborators; the Soviets wanted their heads; the Germans wanted them quiet; the Americans wanted alliances untroubled. Each ambition tugged at the men differently, and each tug narrowed the cellar’s air.
    
    When the British arrived, they brought the weight of tidy paperwork. Two officers in plain greatcoats stepped down the creaking stairs — one carrying a leather satchel, the other a tin of tea as if politeness could soften betrayal.
    
    The senior one addressed him with practiced calm. “Colonel Wolkov, we are looking for assurances — not loyalty, assurances. That your actions will not imperil broader operations.” He tapped the papers. “If you cannot provide these, we must, regrettably, inform our allies that you are a rogue element.”
    
    Sergei’s reply was in Russian, low and deliberate. ""Vy khotite uverennost’. No tol’ko my znaem, kak ee dat’. Uverennost’ ne prodayotsya. Ona zdes’, v nashikh glazakh"" (You want assurance. Only we know how to give it. Assurance is not for sale. It sits here, in our eyes). The British officer’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing more. The air between them froze into understanding: they were enemies by necessity, not conviction.
    
    Word reached them later through a dozen uncertain channels. American intercepts mentioned their names in cautious tones. Berlin demanded arrests “to restore order.” Helsinki turned its back, mumbling about neutrality. Everywhere the same message: irregulars were useful only until they became inconvenient.
    
    Betrayal did not come as a dagger, but as frost. A merchant bartered names for food; a translator whispered rumours for safety; a German clerk tired of ambiguity filed a report with too much detail. When those papers reached Moscow, they landed on the desk of a commissar who preferred simplicity. His orders were as cold as the season.
    
    At dusk, the trap closed. Radio chatter, cross-border patrols, coded flares — three armies moving as if the same hand guided them. When the first of them fell, the forest swallowed the sound. Yelchin’s breath came ragged. ""My ne smozhem uderzhat’sya. U nas ostalos’ malenkoye okno"" (We cannot hold. We have a small window left). They slipped into the trees, snow rising to their knees, each step erasing the last.
    
    Behind them came the babel of a world united only in pursuit: German orders, Soviet shouts, Finnish whistles, English radio static. The planet itself had decided that men like them could not exist.
    
    At a river crossing, Sergei stopped. On the opposite bank stood a man in a coat without insignia, face unreadable. His Russian carried an accent that hinted at foreign schools. ""Vy ne pytaetes’ spasti Rossiyu, gospodin Volkov. Vy pytaetes’ vernut’ sebya v mirovoe pokrovenie"" (You are not trying to save Russia, Mr. Volkov. You are trying to return yourself to the world’s patronage).
    
    Sergei met his eyes and answered softly, ""Mozhet byt’. No ya delayu eto dlya lyudey, kotorye ne mogut bol’she govorit’ za sebya"" (Perhaps. But I do it for those who can no longer speak for themselves).
    
    Then he crossed the ice, each step a quiet defiance. The man did not follow. Behind him the flares burned out, leaving only the colour of smoke. Ahead lay exile, and a map of nations where no flag would ever again claim him.
    
    That night Sergei sat alone beneath a ruined birch and unfolded his small, private map. On it he pencilled crosses for the dead, each with a name. It was not for strategy, but remembrance. He pressed his thumb over one and whispered into the cold, ""Pomni, Rossiya. My vse yeshche pomnim"" (Remember, Russia. We still remember).
    
    And in the silence that followed, even the wind seemed to pause — as though the world itself, however briefly, remembered too.

Chapter V — The Price of Exile

    They were taken in the grey hours before dawn, when the thaw had turned the snow to a grey skin and the world smelled of wet iron. It was not a battle — there had been none of the roar or clarity of combat — but an operation as quiet and deliberate as a state debt being called in. The men had been moving along a secondary road, dragging a cart of salvaged wood and tins, when the trap closed: a handful of figures who looked like foresters and two who did not look like anyone at all.
    
    One of the strangers had the air of a man who had learned to live in other peoples’ faces. He spoke Russian with a careful, slightly accented consonant, as if he had practised the sound in rooms with maps on the walls. ""My tol’ko kupim derevo i proydem dal’she"" (We only buy wood and move on), the courier protested, his hands up in a mute plea against rifles. The stranger smiled as if pity were a tool. ""Pomogite nam, i my pomozhem vam."" (Help us, and we will help you.) By the time the sun bled a pale through the trees, Sergei understood how the bargain had been arranged: a whisper in a tavern; a small sack of money; a promise of safe passage that had been sold twice over.
    
    They moved like a convoy of prisoners through a landscape that remembered them. The men in plain coats carried no badges that anyone could swear to; one wore a suit too fine for the place and an English collar faint under his scarf. He spoke English later, in measured sentences, the kind of measured sentences that take the shape of policy papers. He never raised his voice. When he addressed Sergei in Russian, a translator — a Baltic émigré whose loyalty had been bought with promises and fear — made the words even and soft. ""Vi byli zamedleny, gospoda. Eto ne kakoy-to sredi net iz kukhni"" (You were observed, gentlemen. This is not some kitchen quarrel).
    
    They were exfiltrated along a route that read like a map of concessions: across the river at night where the patrols were thinnest, into a Finnish outpost that took a fee and pretended not to look, then into Sweden, where for a week they sat in a pension by a harbour and watched gulls take the winter’s last scraps from the water. Rumours of their capture moved like oil on the surface of a continent; by the time they were taken to the ship bound for Scotland, the world had already assigned them a shape — collaborators, rogues, potential tools.
    
    On the passage, the Englishman explained, in English, why they had been taken. The words were precise, as if cut from legal paper: the Allies needed men who understood the Soviet rear, men who could direct sabotage, who could speak to displaced units and to men with loyalties that were older and stranger than current maps allowed. In return, they offered a form of mercy: service under British colors; shelter, if they complied; and the protection of a state that could be as ruthless in policy as any commissar.
    
    When Sergei asked what would happen if they refused, the Englishman’s face did not harden but the sentence did, like winter into ice. ""You will be handed across the line."" The translator rendered it: ""Vas peredayut tem, kto imeet na vas protivopolozhnye zakony."" (You will be handed to those whose laws go against you.) The implication was clear without being crude: to be turned back would be to accept the court of the enemy, and in that court their crimes — sabotage, collaboration, the murder of men in uniform — were likely to lead to swift and fatal judgment.
    
    They were in England before they had time to learn the smell of the sea at sunrise. Britain received them with the brisk courtesy of a power practised in making bargains. Men in khaki measured them with eyes that had seen too many theatres; officers in dress uniforms took notes; an intelligence committee — a small room with a long table and longer silences — asked why they had not simply fled east, why they had made alliances they could not keep, why they had chosen to be ghosts.
    
    The offer, when it came, was made as if it were the most natural of things. Serve as strategic officers and sabotage specialists. Use your knowledge of the Soviet rear to direct operations that the Allies could not admit to with any public decency. Train saboteurs, run false units, advise on collapses to manufacture — all the bitter crafts of modern warfare. In exchange: identity papers, a place in the Army, ranks commensurate with usefulness, perhaps even a future in which they would not be dragged back to a tribunal.
    
    There was an additional, almost ceremonial element in Sergei’s case. The men with the sharp coats had found in him a certain authority: a way of looking at maps as if they contained prayers, a steadiness under questioning that passed as command. He had never asked for rank; he had always carried a dead one in memory. One evening, after a long debriefing, an officer said plainly, ""We can give you the means to act on what you believe in. But to do so effectively you will need authority here. You will be accepted into our service, and with it a rank — temporary, but real"". The offer hung in the lamplight like an omen.
    
    He thought then of the men he had lost, of the cart left by the roadside, of the two who had been sacrificed to buy time. He thought of the tricolour he had kept next to his chest like a fossil. When he finally responded, his Russian was a thin thing. ""Ya prinyal by lubuyu formu pomoshchi dlya togo, chtoby ne zabyvat’ ikh"" (I would accept any form of help to ensure they are not forgotten). The translator repeated the words into English and the men at the table moved as if closing an account.
    
    The commissions were planned with the bureaucratic care of a marriage contract: a ceremonial roll of papers, the stamping of seals, the careful wording that made an enemy a tool of the same alphabet. Sergei was given the highest rank among them not as flattery but as function: brigadier — a title heavy with command and with an expectation that he could bend men to action. The rank was temporary, local to the units he would advise; it came with a uniform cut at a tailor’s in London and with a list of responsibilities that smelled faintly of explosives and maps.
    
    There was no rejoicing. The promotion did not make the past lighter. In the mirror that evening, the dark circles under his eyes looked like medals. Yelchin and the others were given lesser ranks, appropriate to the tasks they would perform: intelligence officers, liaison captains, instructors for sabotage. Each appointment carried with it the same unspoken clause: serve, and you live in a world of service that will never be public; refuse, and the world will hand you back to the one that had always made its punishments simple.
    
    They trained in the chalky camps of Britain, in barns that smelled of straw and coal and British rain. They learned the Allied methods of demolition, of setting charges that would collapse a supply bridge rather than burn a village. They argued long into the night about targets, about honour, about whom they might save by making ruin elsewhere. Sergei taught them, too, how to read the weary soldier’s face — how to press a question and let a man confess what he might not have admitted even to himself.
    
    There were nights when the weight of the bargain pressed like iron across his chest. He’d walk in rain, the collar of his coat turned up against a sky that never quite matched the maps in his hands, and wonder whether the men he had been — imperial officers who had once marched under banners that promised a different order — had simply changed the theatre of their exile. He had not forgiven himself for the things he had done to keep men alive; now he was being asked to commit other kinds of violence for other causes, wearing the colours of another patron.
    
    And yet there was a grim logic to it. The world that had hunted them with such unanimity had offered them one narrow door. Behind that door was a strange kind of agency: to direct sabotage that might shorten a front, to help families slip away, to mark for rescue those whose names had been erased. Sergei accepted the brigadier’s epaulettes not as a triumph but as a ledger item — a new line in the account that had been opened the day the first man fell at the ford.
    
    When his name was written in official hand and the ink dried, he found himself worrying about small things once more. How would his men speak of him when the radios went silent? Would history call him traitor or saviour? The Englishmen with their clipped vowels did not care for such distinctions; they offered effectiveness, paper, and routes. They offered survival on terms that were nakedly pragmatic.
    
    The night before he was formally sworn in, Sergei unrolled his private map. He placed a pencil cross where each name lay and, for the first time since the capture, allowed himself to think of a future that might include movement rather than only hiding. He put his thumb to the tricolour sewn into the inside of his greatcoat and whispered, ""Pomni"" (Remember). Then he folded the map small and slept in a room that smelled faintly of coal and sea-spray, the brigadier’s uniform hanging like a shadow in the corner.

Chapter VI — The Last Command

    They came for him before dawn.
    
    The cell door opened with the quiet precision of men who had already rehearsed his end. Two guards stepped in, NKVD insignia dull under the lamp light. The officer followed — the same one who had offered him the deal days before. He carried no papers this time, only the weary air of someone confirming an outcome.
    
    Sergei rose slowly. His uniform, though British-cut, hung loose from days of fever and neglect. The wound at his shoulder ached, a cold pulse that had long since replaced pain with numbness.

""Vy ponimayete svoyu situatsiyu, brigadir."" (You understand your situation, Brigadier.)

    Sergei nodded once.
    
    ""Ponimayu."" (I understand.)
    
    The officer’s gaze lingered. “You could still serve. No one would know. You would live, perhaps even be repatriated after the war.”
    
    Sergei almost smiled — a thin, weary curve of the mouth.

""Zhit’ bez vernosti — eto uzhe ne zhizn’."" (To live without loyalty — that is no life.)

    The officer’s expression flickered; not pity, not respect, but a faint recognition that some men could not be moved.
    
    “So be it,” he said simply.
    
    The morning was colourless. A thin mist hung over the yard of the makeshift prison outside Arkhangelsk, where half-collapsed wooden sheds served as both barracks and gallows. The snow had turned grey with soot from the fires. Sergei was led across the yard without ceremony, boots crunching on frost-hardened ground.
    
    Yelchin’s grave — or what passed for one — lay somewhere under that same earth. Sergei thought of it without sentiment. Men died; what mattered was how they did it.
    
    They bound his hands loosely, as though even the guards knew there was no need for struggle. A priest approached, his breath white in the air, holding a small wooden cross. Sergei shook his head.
    
    ""Ya uzhe ispovedovalsya, otets. Mnogie razy."" (I have already confessed, Father. Many times.)
    
    The man bowed and stepped aside.
    
    The NKVD officer read from a small notebook, voice steady and bureaucratic. The charges sounded almost absurd in their litany — espionage, sabotage, collaboration, treason — words that had already lost meaning in a world where loyalty was merely a question of who held the rope.
    
    When the list ended, Sergei spoke, his voice rough but clear.
    
    ""Rossiya ne propala iz-za nas, a iz-za tekh, kto zabyl yeye dushu."" (Russia did not fall because of us, but because of those who forgot her soul.)
    
    No one translated it. No one needed to.
    
    They placed the rope around his neck. The cold hemp bit into the skin just above his collar. For a moment, Sergei’s eyes drifted upward to the pale morning sky — neither grey nor blue, just the colour of endings. He thought of Petrograd before the banners, of his mother’s silver icons, of the frozen forests where men like him still waited for a country that would never return.
    
    Then he straightened his back. The brigadier once more.
    
    ""Vypolnyaite prikaz."" (Carry out the order.)
    
    The trap gave way.
    
    There was no sound but the creak of rope and the slow sigh of the northern wind through the yard. The guards stood still. The officer closed his notebook and turned away, murmuring to no one in particular:
    
    “Even the dead can be loyal.”
    
    By noon, Sergei Volkov was officially erased — another nameless enemy, recorded and forgotten in a war that devoured its own children.
    
    But among a handful of captured British files in Moscow, one document remained unburned:
    
    “Brigadier Sergei Volkov — attached to Special Operations, deceased in the field.”
    
    The line was signed, stamped, and filed under Personnel: Missing, presumed heroic.

I’m wondering how many of you struggle with tremor or hyperhidrosis, especially those working as oral surgeons, since I would like to go that path in the future? 
Tremor occurs mostly when I drink to much coffee or have complicated extraction etc. 
Sweatiness appears when I’m excited, stressed, over caffeinated or in a room without adequate climatization (that’s a big one)
I use an iontophoresis device, but my hands still aren’t dry enough, so I often apply baby powder before putting on gloves.

It is really embarrassing condition when I meet other colleagues and dental professionals, for example at congresses or courses when I need to shake someones hand.

I kept thinking about it, so I brought it back up. He said he’s just not someone who likes to kiss. Period. And he’s met plenty of others who also don’t kiss or like to. 

Im very pro-kissing but thinking back, yes, I too have met people who didn’t want to do this often. I’ve dated both men an women— the no-kissers I’ve met have been men, but I’m sure there are women who share this preference too.

1oij1kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ergonomics/comments/1oij1kn/help_me_decide_between_keyboards/,Help me decide between keyboards!,"Hey all! I posted a bit back but now after some research I think I’ve narrowed my options down. I am new to ergonomics and am not looking to relearn typing right now, so I’d like to stick to QWERTY, and I’d like to keep my overall learning curve low. I think a full split would be too much for me but I am willing to try out a split that’s still on one keyboard. A little tenting but nothing extreme seems good too.

I do have a Mac and a PC (I was on a Mac that quit, got it repaired, in the meantime my brother sent me his old PC laptop) but am willing to start fully making the switch. I mostly just use my A-Z keyboard as I’m a writer not a programmer but the field I’m in can have me doing a decent amount of output.

I do like the idea of a bit higher profile keys than my current Mac, but full profile seems like it might cause finger fatigue. I do like the idea of a bit of noise and I do work from home but if I transition to an office I don’t want to be obnoxious.

Portability would be cool but if I’m being realistic I’m not traveling with my keyboard very often and if I’m at a coffee shop I’m probably not whipping out a keyboard anyway.

Trying to stay 200 and below, and I’d like the keyboard to be reliable—the idea of missed strokes, etc. is pretty irritating lol.

I did a lot of youtubing, redditing, amazon reviewing. I think like everyone I am mourning the MS Sculpt, which I never had but sounds pretty perfect.

These are the options I’m now between. I’d especially love input from anyone who has actual experience with these keyboards but I’d also love researched folks to weigh in on maybe some key differences I’m not seeing? I’m not too into the weeds on keyboards and I’d like to make a decisions soon.

So I graduated BTech in 2019 and I think I have accidentally observed a full evolutionary cycle of Instagram content from the same set of girls

2019: Club pics and “look my boyfriend got me balloons” content… basically the Display Phase… showing social value and mate acquisition

2021: Aesthetic coffee dates and milkshakes… the Stabilization Phase… soft launching relationships like a beta app

2023: “How to treat a lady” and “5 rules for a healthy relationship”… the Consultancy Phase… after surviving many breakups they become TEDx speakers of romance

October 2025: Chhath Puja reels and spiritual captions… the Cultural and Rebranding Phase… marriage market pressure meets ethnic wear photoshoot

I am 60 years old and work in a toxic environment, they tread lightly around me because I have a reputation for knowing my rights as an employee and holding management when they violate them.

Anyway I’ve been using my age and health issues as an excuse to slack off and get special treatment.

Nothing serious, I’m just looking to make to retirement without going insane.

So as far as they know, I’m deaf, blind, and on death’s doorstep. 

Well I inadvertently discovered another instrument for my repertoire… 

Over the weekend, I messed up my regular DIY crew cut and ended up shaving my head clean.

Not what I wanted but not terrible but I never considered what people would infer from me showing up on Monday as a total skinhead.

On the clock doing my humdrum reports I overheard my boss saying to her assistant “no wonder he’s been seeing the doctors so often” 

“He’s got cancer and doesn’t want anyone to know!” 

I choked on my coffee when I heard that and they realized that I had overheard them. I had to to go to the bathroom before I lost my composure, I went in, closed the door and turned on the faucet and had to muffled my hysterical laughter with paper towels.

They must have thought I was upset and crying because there was an awkward silence after I came out. Neither would look me in the eye.

After a while my boss asked if I would like to go home, I said yes because I I was feeling a little under the weather.

Now I know if I lie and try to say that I have cancer, I am committing fraud, but if I let them believe that I’m being stoic and not asking for time off, they can’t ask about it. 

But I can let them believe it and accept their largess when offered. They cannot ask about it so if it gets discovered that I don’t actually have cancer. I can honestly say that I never claimed to have cancer. They couldn’t say anything to me.

I posted a bit back but now after some research I think I’ve narrowed my options down. I am new to ergonomics and am not looking to relearn typing right now, so I’d like to stick to QWERTY, and I’d like to keep my overall learning curve low. I think a full split would be too much for me but I am willing to try out a split that’s still on one keyboard. A little tenting but nothing extreme seems good too.

I do have a Mac and a PC (I was on a Mac that quit, got it repaired, in the meantime my brother sent me his old PC laptop) but am willing to start fully making the switch. I mostly just use my A-Z keyboard as I’m a writer not a programmer but the field I’m in can have me doing a decent amount of output.

I do like the idea of a bit higher profile keys than my current Mac, but full profile seems like it might cause finger fatigue. I do like the idea of a bit of noise and I do work from home but if I transition to an office I don’t want to be obnoxious.

Portability would be cool but if I’m being realistic I’m not traveling with my keyboard very often and if I’m at a coffee shop I’m probably not whipping out a keyboard anyway.

Trying to stay 200 and below, and I’d like the keyboard to be reliable—the idea of missed strokes, etc. is pretty irritating lol.

I did a lot of youtubing, redditing, amazon reviewing. I think like everyone I am mourning the MS Sculpt, which I never had but sounds pretty perfect.

These are the options I’m now between. I’d especially love input from anyone who has actual experience with these keyboards but I’d also love researched folks to weigh in on maybe some key differences I’m not seeing? I’m not too into the weeds on keyboards and I’d like to make a decisions soon.

Usually it’s not some conspiracy  just mechanics. Low overnight liquidity means wide spreads. If there’s no new catalyst to support the move, momentum fades fast. Add red futures or sector rotation, and scalpers cash out early, killing follow-through.

The key lesson: a strong close is a *condition*, not a *guarantee*. Momentum only survives if volume, liquidity, and story all line up the next morning. Otherwise, you’re holding vibes, not setup.

He really hated me, and his friends told me how hard it was for him. After my new relationship ended, we became friends again. This time I was happier with him than I was before, but I still didn't want to date him again. There was too much complication for me to even consider dating him again. We became best friends again, and for several months we would hang out, I could call him at night if something was scaring me (I lived alone) and he would check, we could talk about anything and I can just be myself around him. Recently, he explained to me that he can't be friends anymore because he has such strong feelings and is still in love. I understood and thought I would be okay, because if I wanted to date someone new in the future I wouldn't be able to maintain this relationship. Now, I found out he likes someone new, which he said didn't have to do with not being able to be friends. I am honestly happy for him, because I haven't been the best to him in terms of staying friends, staying friends was a selfish decision on my part because I needed him more than he needed me. But suddenly he hates me, he told me he thinks I was a horrible person the whole time we were dating, and that I was never a good friend. I don't understand why he despises me so much. He told me I lied to him the whole time we were dating and that I liked other people during it as well, which neither are true. I tried to text him and tell him none of that was true, but he told me to leave him alone and move on. I find myself missing him so much, I'll be eating breakfast or about to fall asleep and just start crying because of how much I miss him. He has been in my life for 4 years, and I honestly don't know how to move on. It's not like I'll never see him, we have the same hometown, go to colleges near by, and have the same friend group from home, but he hates me now, and I don't know how to deal with that. I feel so guilty for everything I've ever done that has hurt him, even if he has also hurt me to. I really just don't know how to go forward right now. Advice?",1,1761679761.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I am 60 years old and work in a toxic environment, they tread lightly around me because I have a reputation for knowing my rights as an employee and holding management when they violate them.

Anyway I’ve been using my age and health issues as an excuse to slack off and get special treatment.

Nothing serious, I’m just looking to make to retirement without going insane.

So as far as they know, I’m deaf, blind, and on death’s doorstep. 

Well I inadvertently discovered another instrument for my repertoire… 

Over the weekend, I messed up my regular DIY crew cut and ended up shaving my head clean.

Not what I wanted but not terrible but I never considered what people would infer from me showing up on Monday as a total skinhead.

On the clock doing my humdrum reports I overheard my boss saying to her assistant “no wonder he’s been seeing the doctors so often” 

“He’s got cancer and doesn’t want anyone to know!” 

I choked on my coffee when I heard that and they realized that I had overheard them. I had to to go to the bathroom before I lost my composure, I went in, closed the door and turned on the faucet and muffled my hysterical laughter with paper towels for a good five minutes.

They must have thought I was upset and crying because there was an awkward silence after I came out. Neither would look me in the eye.

After a while my boss asked if I would like to go home, I said yes because I I was feeling a little under the weather.

Now I know if I lie and try to say that I have cancer, I am committing fraud, but if I let them believe that I’m being stoic and not asking for time off, they can’t ask about it. 

But I can let them believe it and accept their largess when offered. They cannot ask about it so if it gets discovered that I don’t actually have cancer. I can honestly say that I never claimed to have cancer. They couldn’t say anything to me.

I’m Ant, also known as Theantgamer95 — a streamer, gamer, and professional ghost energy drink enthusiast lol (one day they'll sponser me) 🎮

Anyways, this subreddit is my little corner of the internet — a place for me, my community, and other creators to hang out, share their content, and just vibe together.

I stream because I genuinely love connecting with people — whether it’s through a chaotic retro game, a random coffee chat, or laughing at my own technical fails (which happen way too often).

My main goal isn’t to chase fame — it’s to build a small but genuine community.
If I ever “make it big,” awesome. But honestly?
If a handful of people tune in, laugh, and feel a little better after watching… that’s a win in my book. 💜 I do tend to talk about personal things in my stream but its mostly cause I find it therapeutic. 

But as far as for my streams I usually stream Thursday and friday. 
 Thursday Mornings: “Coffee & Chill” streams — gaming news, random conversations, and way too much caffeine.

Fridays: Retro gaming chaos — from classic adventures to chat-sabotaged runs that never go as planned.

So please use this space to post your streams, memes, and whatever relates to gaming. I want this and the discord to be about everyone not just me.

He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married in a few months

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. And we were fighting one evening because he spankd our toddler. He was having a meeting with his subordinates and our son kept pulling his arm to give him milk from the fridge. Husband kept pushing him away and told him he is busy. My kid started crying, husband had to mute his mic and his image for him is everything and he said that because of this, he looked bad. And he spankd him. However he says he did not push him to the floor. It was a tantrum

And we had an argument one night and he wanted to become intimate with me after it to make up and I didnt want and he kinda forced himself on me. He did not go until the end, he let me go though when I started screaming. He said he was not aware I dont want.",0,1761679547.0,abusiverelationships,4,0.5,False

1oiisv5,https://i.redd.it/oyngg7xllwxf1.jpeg,I’m dying in real time,"I’m done. My fitness is in the gutter. I’ve been trying to run with uni cross country and like my entire stamina and stuff has just gone to shit probably bc of the hrt and i’m really struggling. I have no real friends - I’ve now gotta go out again and pretend to have fun at some bar with my “friends” who I have nothing in common with and don’t even like. I’ve lost my competitive edge. I just found out I was luckily awarded the most prestigious scholarship at my university because of my good academic performance and it’s only made my day worse. 

Why is it always down to me to be the best. Why does everyone depend on me to bring forward new ideas and innovations. Why is it always down to the manmoder tranny to be perfect. Why is it always me who has to do the tests. Why am I always having to fake laugh and fake smile and fake talk. How does everyone do it. Why does everyone do it. What are they living for?

Why is everything so blatantly uncertain and terrifying. Why do I flinch ten times more than everyone else does at the same stimuli. Why do I get no HRT changes. Why am I never hungry. Why do I never notice. Why do I get laughed at. Why do I get so scared. Why do I lie. Why am I a man. Why am I on hrt. Why all of it.

I don’t think I’ve ever felt good in my life. People at the start of highschool always used to tease me for being sad and asking why I looked so “depressed”. I don’t really get what people mean when they say that. I guess I just go and see people smiling and laughing and I have to assume they feel something and are getting a perpetual kick out of things and aren’t pretending every time. I often think “Is this it? Is this what people live for?” Do they just go out and love it and love the people around them and do the things they want to do?

For me I struggle to be around other people for extended periods because the visceralness of life is always so ambiently painful - like, really painful. It’s always too hot or cold or I need a piss or it’s too bright or dark or hungry or thirsty or tiring or I’m too lightheaded or sad or I can’t keep the conversation long enough pretending to be a completely different person who definitely isn’t addicted to hrt and definitely isn’t a total freak. And I just. Don’t know how to fix any of this stuff. 

My heart races over the most trivial things. I lie over the most stupid things. Every intonation and phrase and word I’ve ever spoken is just some combination in my head I’ve heard other people say - I could probably tell you exactly where I heard something being said whenever I talk because I just speak purely in direct reiterations. I talk without regard for the truth and instead just hoping I sound normal. I rehearse over and over the things I’ll say a thousand times in my head - even just for ordering coffee. 

It’s all just way too much. I wish every day I was a woman for some stupid reason but even more I just wish I could wake up and feel like a normal person. Even right now, I’m hungry because I haven’t eaten all day. I’m insanely hot bc the radiator is broken and I don’t want to tell the maintenance guy. I’m ALWAYS in pain and I NEVER go and fix it. Why??? I’ve achieved a lot in my life but I literally have no idea how. I go to bed every night, without fail, and hope I don’t wake up. I drink and laugh and run and talk like I'm in an endless rollercoaster. 

I want to take over the world and other times I want to kill myself. I believe I’m capable of anything and I can barely even string a coherent sentence together. I feel everything so much and so bad but I’m also incapable of knowing what any of it means. It all kills me. People ask me what I want out of life and I literally have no idea what they’re talking about. I’m just trying to survive it because every day feels like a fight. 

You know what I want? To hide in bed all day where no one can see me and nothing can hurt me. But really we all know we aren’t meant to do that. So I just go out and suffer in various ways hoping I can make things fuller and more purposeful. And in that regard I’ve succeeded it’s just that there is no real point in any of it, there’s certainly no passing and there is absolutely no happiness. I’m living someone else’s life. 

They put an alien at the helm. Everyone wanted an upstanding middle class bright young man and instead they got the spiteful alien with the secret hrt tranny agp mindvirus addiction. I guess they’re just gonna have to put up with that because that’s all the world has got and the alien is programmed to fight to the very end. I feel I owe it to myself but also to the world to come back every time harder and smarter and stronger. I’m struggling for nothing knowing there is no conceivable prize that could make me happy at the end. But it’s literally all I’ve ever done, so I guess I’ll just… keep fighting and keep dying.

1oiiqv1,https://i.redd.it/019dpon7lwxf1.jpeg,“Before the Coffee Gets Cold” made me stop wishing to go back in time,"I recently got back into reading after years. There was this phase back in 2017 when I was hooked on romantic novels, mostly Chetan Bhagat and Ravinder Singh. My vocab was terrible back then, and my reading speed wasn’t great either. I had just finished school and came from a small third-tier English medium private state-board school.

Then reading just stopped.

After that, I tried those self-help and non-fiction books everyone was talking about, but honestly, I couldn’t connect with them. Recently, I picked up fiction again, started with The Nameless God, and then moved to Before the Coffee Gets Cold and Tales from the Cafe by Toshikazu Kawaguchi.

I picked up Before the Coffee Gets Cold on a recommendation from one of my Master’s seniors, knowing nothing except that it involved time travel.

But once I read, it made me think of moments where I wished I could go back and change things. Like telling my 14-year-old self about my cancer earlier so I wouldn’t lose a chunk of my thigh muscle along with my femur. Or going back to January 2024 to stop myself from sending a message that ended a 7-year relationship.

But this book made me realize something. It’s not about fixing the past. It’s about how you carry it. Whether it’s your past self, someone you lost, or a memory that still aches, the best way to honour them is to live fully now and be happy in the present.

I just got the sequel ‘Tales from the Cafe’ today and finished  in about 4 to 5 hours. Both felt like quiet, emotional conversations about time, loss, and acceptance.

I’ve got Before Your Memory Fades, will get done with it by tomorrow, mostly XD. 

For those of you who’ve read these books, what were your takeaways? Did it make you reflect on your own past too?

If you haven’t read them yet, I genuinely recommend you do.

TL;DR:
Used to read a lot of Chetan Bhagat and Ravinder Singh during college days, stopped for years, and recently got back into fiction. Before the Coffee Gets Cold reminded me that it’s not about changing your past, it’s about making peace with it and living well in the present.

F18- i started working with my boyfriend of five years. We met in grade 7 and we’ve been dating ever since we just graduated high school and his mom recently just bought a coffee shop in working with two other people and usually every single day. 

It’s just me and my boyfriend and one other person then sometimes it’s me off and then it’s him with two other people whatever doesn’t matter we fight so much and it’s so bad and I can’t even say that it’s fully him because I do have an attitude but also he’s just like annoying and I hate to say that, but its so damn true. And before I started officially working there with him while we started like the same day but before it was like fully official, he told me if we broke up this is what his mom said if we broke up then he’d have to fire me because he’s the manager.

I’m a little nervous because we keep fighting and today he told me that he hates working with me and I was like well. I fucking hate working with you too and I know he’s not gonna fire me but I’m scared he’s gonna like tell his mom that he doesn’t like working with me because we Becker and his mom’s gonna like tell me like amber I don’t think you can work at the café anymore im lowkey very very scared and this is honestly ruining our relationship. 

Our relationship is like kind of steady. I’m not gonna lie. My boyfriend has horrible ADHD and he acts like a toddler. Sometimes he really gives off annoying hyper younger brother energy and when I was growing up, I grew up with an older sister who always put me in my place, so I kind of know my place and I know when to stop, but he doesn’t because his sister and him are so close in age, she never rocked his shit so he just kept on being annoying and I don’t know if that makes sense but I feel like that definitely has a factor. and I know this sounds so stupid but we always fight about who gets to do the dishes and I fucking hate doing the dishes.

 I’m fucking washing cottage cheese cups like it’s disgusting and I told him I wasn’t gonna wash the dishes without gloves and his mom got the gloves, but when he washes the dishes, he rips off the gloves and leaves them inside out out in the dirty ass water so the gloves, literally stink like shit and I’ve said that I’m like I’m not fucking putting my hands in these gloves bc u cant take them off properly.  and sometimes so basically he works in the kitchen, but it’s like very very small so it’s all connected so we can just like talk to each other when he’s in the kitchen and I am making coffee and when people order bagels, I talk very loud and I’m like sesame seed bagel cream cheese and then I’m like r u making it? 

And he’s like no he didn’t even tell me the damn bagel and I’m like you fully have a screen to show you the orders but you choose to have Spotify on there instead and then he gets pissed off and he’s like well. You should just tell me I’m like you know what honestly I don’t really have to because you have a screened right in front of your face but u PICK to have spotify instead? And I know that’s like easily avoidable but when he continues to ask me what’s the bagel? 

I’m obviously gonna be like what the fuck like like how about you read the screen I don’t need to tell you 50 times.? we’re honestly both the issue like it’s not fully him but then he’ll be washing the dishes and then he’ll see a dish that he doesn’t like and then he’ll be like oh can you please wash the dishes and I’m like didn’t you just say you were gonna do them like why don’t I have to do them because you don’t wanna wash a certain dish and then he’s like why can’t you just do it like blah blah blah? 

You don’t do anything around here and that’s fully bullshit because it was just me and him closing today and I swept the entire place and he was just wiping off the counters doing the dishes and I placed a little cappuccino cup and then he fully lost his shit and told me that he wasn’t gonna wash the dishes anymore and then you like basically screaming at me to do them like wtf. idk what to do. we do talk abt it but we cant settle ",2,1761679351.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

The train was busy and full so a random woman sat next to me and we started chatting about the delay. I mentioned I was worried I wouldn’t make my connection and then we started talking a bit more like about what we’d been doing in London, just general small talk, she was friendly and seemed like a kind person. 

We both realised I probably won’t make my connecting train. I still would have needed to get off at this station and thought I’d probably have to get a hotel, no one could come and get me as it was a 2 hour drive from home. When I did get to the train station where I needed to get off, I went to stand up and as I was about to get off the train she came through the doors and told me to come back and sit down so she can help me come up with another plan. She then offered for me to stay at her house that night, in my head I thought it would be strange for me to do that and I hadn’t expected that at all. I realised it might be the best option for me that night and I felt like I could definitely trust her. 

I went with her, and she even picked up takeaway for us. I got to meet her two daughters, and she made me feel completely welcome. The next morning, she drove me back to the station which was like a 30 minute drive, we got a coffee, and we chatted some more and then I said goodbye and got my train home. I was 22 at the time and she was probably in her late 50’s. Such a crazy story but her kindness that night has stuck with me. ",54,1761679319.0,randomactsofkindness,9,1.0,False

I'm someone on the spectrum and special needs. So my bully that I was cool with, now we are enemies again. I accidently spilled a UFC fighters coffee while getting autographs outside the hotel and I offered to buy him a new coffee and he said that's ok. Yesterday, the bully gave me crap and a hard time for it. He also gave me a hard time when I chased a UFC fighter for a autograph. He then called me out for stuffing my face outside hotel property when I wasn't. He then me delusional and said he would kick my ass in an illegal fight but he wouldn't because I need someone else to stand up for me since I call 911. He said I leave stuff on the ground, which is not a big deal. We went back and forth at it and I called him a hypocrite and he called me selfish when he's the selfish one. He says I have no manners when he's the one with no manners. He said that I can't admit fault and he can when it's the opposite way around. He said that if I'm in his neighborhood next time, he would call the cops on me. I live around there but he doesn't know that. He also said my life coach should teach me manners and teach me to be a better person when the bully is the one with the problems.
Today, I was minding my own business and he started problems with me. He said that go ahead call 911. I told him I have special needs and he said that you’re not so special and he kept insulting me. I called him out for hitting someone else before and he said that he deserved it because he called him a racial slur. It was so bad I had to get my life coach to send him a notice that if he talks to me again, we will go to the police on him. He said he knew I was going to get the life coach involved. He then said to someone else that he won’t talk to me because it’s not worth it. He said he’s not scared of me.

I'm even up late in private, so I have no problem working night shifts for the most part. But there were still instances in the past when I was close to dozing off, especially during extra shifts, when I came from a patrol in the cold to sit in a warm room for hours or when I had trouble sleeping during the day. So I had to change a few things!

I quit energy drinks and switched to tea, which works better and offers a broader variety for less money. I was never able to stomach coffee for some reason and cola is a double-edged sword due to the huge amount of sugar in it. I'm aware there are sugarfree variants, but I don't like the taste! 

I avoid using the internet on my phone, for various reasons actually. In this case, because it tempts to make you look down on your device. This restricts blood flow through the neck, which means that the brain is not supplied with enough oxygen and you tire more quickly. Plus: Your peripheral view suffers when you look down!

For the same reason I chose to wear a tie to my uniform, although it's not mandatory at our site. It tightens the collar and I automatically look straighter than I would without it. The tie also compliments my overall appearance and resonates positively with the client. 

It also helps to stand up and walk around for a bit, to rub some cold water in my face or to order something really hot to eat. My secret weapon though is watching something that makes me laugh hard, like clips from Craig Ferguson's Late Late Show. To play some music I can sing along. Or - when it gets really tough - to watch something that makes me cry. I'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I usually pick one of the dramatic speeches or a regeneration scene. Works like a charm, but comes with the prize of a headache!

Ghee, or clarified butter, is an ancient superfood gaining modern popularity. If you've been asking [how do you cook with ghee](https://www.lazizgold.com/), you're in for a treat! This golden elixir offers a host of health benefits and unparalleled flavor, making it a must-have in your pantry and daily diet.

# The Culinary Advantages: Why Choose Ghee?

Ghee boasts a significantly **higher smoke point** than regular butter, making it ideal for high-heat cooking methods like **sautéing, stir-frying, and deep-frying** without generating harmful free radicals. Its rich, nutty aroma beautifully enhances virtually any dish.

# Ways to Utilize Ghee in Cooking and Daily Diet

* **Substitute for Oils/Butter:** Use it in place of butter or vegetable oils for frying eggs, making pancakes, or greasing baking tins.
* **Flavor Booster:** Drizzle a teaspoon over steamed vegetables, popcorn, or lentils (**dal**) for a depth of flavor.
* **Bulletproof Coffee:** Stir a spoonful into your morning coffee for a boost of healthy fats.
* **Baking:** Incorporate it into cookies, cakes, or crusts for a wonderful richness.
* **Simple Spread:** Enjoy it spread on toast, rotis, or chapatis.

Incorporating ghee into your routine is simple and rewarding. How do you cook with ghee effectively? The key is to start by replacing less healthy fats in your current recipes.

From boosting metabolism to aiding digestion, the benefits of using ghee are profound. It's a versatile, wholesome fat that elevates both your health and your meals. To ensure you're getting the purest and highest quality product, remember to rely on a trusted ghee brand like **La-ziz Gold** for that authentic, golden goodness.",1,1761678909.0,u_IndividualFormal128,0,1.0,False

1oiif54,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1oiif54/teapot/,Teapot,"Hey ya'll looking for some feedback on a story I'm gonna post up on Youtube/ various other platforms. Its a Psychological Horror story. Here's what I got so far...

   As the dark clouds rolled in, I headed indoors to rest. I closed the door and dropped my wet jacket on the ground. I grabbed the tea pot, put some water in, and placed it on the stove. I turned on the stove, and the flame sparked for a bit before it ignited. 



I sat down on my sofa and placed my phone down. Not even seconds after putting it down, I received a text message. I picked up the phone and saw that it was from somebody that I couldn't care less about, so I placed it back down. 



Then it happened again. 



I grabbed my phone with a sigh, thinking that it was the same damn person, but it wasn't. I looked at the text, puzzled for a second. It was from an unknown number. The thought of that scared me halfway to death. 



""You know what you have to do,"" the text read. 



The words felt familiar somehow, like an echo from a conversation I'd tried to forget. I looked back at the stove to see if the tea was finished, but nothing. The water sat still, refusing to bubble. I looked back at my phone and laughed it off as I leaned my head against the sofa and drifted off.



\---



My phone went off again. I looked at the text, and it said, ""Time's ticking, pal."" 



I got up from the sofa and started to walk around, from the kitchen to the living room, passing around the sofa. Something felt off about the apartment, like the angles were slightly wrong. I checked on the tea again and realized that it was still not boiling yet. Strange—it had been on for what felt like twenty minutes.



I started thinking to myself, wondering where the hell these texts were coming from. I went over to the window inside my apartment and moved the blinds over to get a better look outside. I saw nothing but more dark clouds rolling in. 



Then it began. The rain started to pour in. I could hear the raindrops smacking against my roof. 



I closed the blinds, and right as I was going to sit down on my sofa, my phone went off again. The same text appeared: ""Time's ticking, pal."" 



The text made me angry. I started gritting my teeth and breathing heavily. The words felt like an accusation, like someone knew what I'd done. What I'd failed to do. I threw the phone back on the table and began angrily walking around my sofa. The thoughts started to get to me: Who the hell is this person? What do they want? Do they know about her?



I tried to lay down and calm myself. I started to get cozy and began to slowly drift off again.



\---



As I was beginning to drift off, my phone went off again. I hesitantly reached over and grabbed it. I went to the messages and saw that it was from the person I had ignored in the first place. 



The message read, ""Are you okay?""



I smirked at the message and put my phone back down on the table. If only they knew how far from okay I was. I got up from the sofa to check on the tea, and it still had not come to a boil. The water remained eerily still despite the flame licking the bottom of the pot. I sighed and then headed into the restroom.



I looked into the mirror and saw a reflection of all my friends. I laughed to myself and said, ""What friends?"" 



As I turned on the water to my sink and began washing my face, I heard a cracking sound. I looked back up at the mirror. I saw that it was beginning to shatter, and I became puzzled at the sight of my mirror cracking. Fine lines spread across the surface like a web. I thought nothing of it and continued washing my face, wondering why the mirror was cracking. 



The more I had the water on, the more I kept hearing this cracking sound. I turned the water off and looked back at the mirror—it seemed to be perfectly fine. No cracks. No lines. Perfect.



I laughed at the sight of the seemingly perfect mirror, shut off the light in the bathroom, and headed out to the living room, closing the bathroom door behind me. 



I looked into the kitchen and saw that the tea had still not boiled. I walked over to the sofa but noticed that my wet jacket was on it. I glared at the jacket and said to myself, ""How did you get there?"" 



I thought nothing of it—my mind had been playing tricks lately—and grabbed the jacket to hang it back up. When I turned around, I saw my sofa turned completely to the opposite side from where I had it. The coffee table had shifted too, ninety degrees from its original position.



I became baffled at the sight of my couch but ended up laughing it off as I lay back down on it. The laugh came out wrong, hollow.



\---



As I began to slowly fall asleep, I felt a vibration sensation on the lower part of my body and woke up to realize that my phone was on my pants, vibrating. How had it gotten there? I picked it up and saw that I was being called by an unknown number. 



I thought to myself, ""Now they're calling?"" 



I answered the phone hesitantly and said, ""Who are you?""



I got no answer at all for almost a minute. Just breathing. Then—



""You know what you have to do,"" a mysterious voice said.



The voice sounded like mine. Like an echo of my own thoughts.



Before I could even reply, the phone cut off, and I knew the person had hung up on me. I sat up and got off my sofa with my phone in my hand, clinging to it as I began to walk around my apartment. 



I traveled into my bathroom again and saw that there was a crack in the mirror, just like before. This time I was certain. The crack ran right through where my face would be. I shook my head and closed the door again.



I went back over to the stove and saw that the flame was still on, but the water was still not boiling. Hours now, and nothing. I became frustrated and opened my fridge to see what I had to eat. Not much, so I closed the fridge and turned around.



The teapot was on the counter next to the kitchen sink.



I stared at the teapot, confused, and put it back on the stove, laughing. The laugh sounded manic even to me. I went over to my living room and saw that the sofa had turned a complete one hundred eighty degrees, and so had the table. 



I laughed it off and sat back down on my sofa with my phone still in my hand. I looked at it with a bit of anger and confusion before putting it on the table. I lay back down, looking at my phone, wondering if someone was trying to kill me. Or if I was trying to kill myself. I laughed that idea off and began to drift off again.



\---



I awakened to droppings hitting my face. My first thought was that it could be leaking from my ceiling because of the rain. I decided to go up into the attic to check it out. 



With my flashlight in hand, I looked around and saw nothing. No leakage at all, and it baffled me. I turned off my flashlight and went back downstairs to investigate.



There was a puddle of what looked like water, but it was dark, almost like ink. I went over to the sofa and examined the liquid substance. As I went to touch it, I felt a burning sensation and pulled away. I was shocked beyond belief. 



I went to the bathroom again to look in the mirror and saw that most of my face had burn marks. I was petrified at my own reflection, my eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. This time I couldn't laugh it off. Every time I went to touch the marks, they would disappear without a trace and then come right back as if they were never gone.



I turned away from the mirror, exited the bathroom, and headed toward the sofa. When I came back, I froze. The bizarre dark liquid had disappeared, left no trace. I started grabbing and poking at the area where the pool of dark liquid had been, and yet it felt bone dry. 



I went over to the left side of my sofa where the dripping began and pushed against it to move the sofa from the center to the right side of my living room. Once I felt secure, I laid back down on the sofa and closed my eyes.

1oiidsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenAdvice/comments/1oiidsw/should_i_ghost_this_guy/,should i ghost this guy?,"so basically this summer i (18F) got into dating apps and met a few people. this one guy (20M, 19 back then) i thought was kinda cute, so i met with him irl a few hours after we matched. i was with my friend, and he was with some guy who bought us beer and then left, so there were only the three of us. he paid for my beer, and we shared one more can.

i can’t say he was weird or anything, but the way he carries himself is soooo odd. he speaks in a normal voice, but really quietly, to the point where i can barely hear him. he barely made eye contact, like he was looking everywhere but at me. he mostly talked about himself, and my friend and i would ask him questions, but he didn’t really ask much back. he seemed very emotionless, like he was trying sooo hard to be nonchalant. also, he looked fine in the pictures, but in person, he wasn’t what i expected overall😭

so we hung out for a few hours. after my friend left, we shared a cigarette, and he walked me to my bus stop. then he just followed up with a text that said, “both of you should follow my insta,” and i was like alrrrrr… after that, he texted me for a few days asking to hang out, but i didn’t really want to. we ended up going for coffee, and i said i didn’t have money, so he paid. again, he just talked about himself, and it felt like i was mostly interviewing him. the only time i could talk was just adding to what he said.

he invited me to hang out for like a week straight, and i kept saying i was busy, so eventually, he stopped texting. what i found weird is how he never tried to make plans, just asked in the middle of the day, “so are you free today?” likeeeee that’s just so low effort

fast forward to now, he replies to my instagram note, asks how i am, and we text for a bit, but again, it’s mostly him talking. he invites me to hang out, and i decline a couple of times. then i decided to go one day. we met when it was really cold, so we went to a café again. he asked what i wanted, and when i told him, he just ordered for himself. 😭

it went the same as before; we hung out for a few hours, and he mostly talked or we both stayed quiet when i wasn’t asking questions. now he’s still texting me, and i feel bad because he probably has bad social skills, but i feel soooo uninterested in this whole situation. i can’t even tell if he’s trying to be friends or if he likes me since he never compliments me. i just don’t see the point in talking to him. idk what to do, maybe i’m the problem, or should i just ghost him?

1oiia77,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oiia77/1228_if_youre_listening/,[1228] If You're Listening,"It's so familiar, yet remains a curiosity. It happens as a little flash, a mild stomach drop, and a little tightening of my chest. It's like my body ""realizes something"" and the ""panic"" or ""fight or flight"" carries out its marching orders. I'm just sitting drinking my coffee and watching the end of a movie. I've only been up and awake about 2 hours. I'm thinking about how I might occupy my day. But somewhere in that ambiguity resides a perpetual invitation to panic. It got me thinking about intentionality.  
  
Last night I made a light trek out to the 24-hour grocery store for junk food. I spent almost the entire day watching movies and arguing with AI about scripts for fixing my show shortcut links and cleaning up my music tags. I'm a night person, so tired of idling inside, I set out. I watched a movie across the drive there and back. Every movie, bad or award-winning, employs mind-boggling amounts of intentionality. That fact alone originally cracked open my curiosity and willingness to be opinionated about all media.  
  
At bottom, I feel like a person who is ""trying to connect."" I remember a friend in college who mentioned a pretty boring and basic anime, Scrapped Princess, she said she liked and the next day I binged it. The idea was that maybe I would discover what she liked about it and have something to talk about. We already hung out and talked about plenty, but she made a point about speaking to _that anime_ in _that way_ so it seemed like a different kind of opportunity or level. I didn't connect with it. She also mentioned once that she'd be down to film me and my ex having sex, which I suppose was it's own kind of missed opportunity to connect as well.  
  
I find it hard to believe you can not only have an idea, formalize it with a script, share it with people, find money, hire people, buy equipment, travel to locations, navigate setbacks, promote, and ride the consequences of success or failure without the highest forms of intentional being that we have. What manifests from that is fundamentally magic regardless of how bizarre, boring, or distasteful you might find it. I think even that which is cynically syndicated has an interesting story as to why buried within.  
  
Between this paragraph and the last one I had to get up and shit. I didn't intend on that. It was a call from nature independent of my intention to write a blog. Underneath that call, I intend to keep a clean ass and refraining from shitting myself. Surely you can discern the difference between an aspect of my nature and the product of my choices.  
  
I also watched recently a Frontline episode tracking the lives of people who grew up poor. There's a scene where an already hungry and insecure in their living arrangements family are talking about a new baby on the way. The dad matter-of-factly said how he doesn't believe in abortion. The string of hammy excuses and negotiations they were going to have to make followed. It's in our nature to propagate our genes. I think it's also in our nature to downplay the suffering and consequences of doing so indiscriminately. If you didn't plan to have a baby, and do so anyway, what should we take away from that story were we to package it as a desperately low-budget movie?  
  
When I'm intentional, the anxiety disappears almost instantly. That is, I have something to do. The ""magic"" happens without me noticing. I'm not sitting and ruminating about all I can't, and can never, know. The plan never has to be that precise or coherent, it just has to be a plan. Go to the store. Finish the movie. Write the blog. I'm debating currently how messy and tired I want to get assembling more of my fence. I need concrete with money I don't feel comfortable spending. My intentionality often aggressively bumps up against my practical reality.  
  
Here I may have arrived at a new way of articulating where the anxiety comes from. I intend on _so much_. I intend to build many things. I intend to learn many more. I intend to travel and buy T-shirts and invest in equally frivolous if not status-indicating things. Often, that intention feels like mockery. It feels like a pipe-dream not situated in the reality of what it costs in both time and money. It feels dependent on too many variables, often derailed by the feelings, opinions, and negligence of the broader body politic. I remember getting routinely, violently, punished as a child for things I never meant to do.  
  
I'm now thinking about religious types, in particular those who profess to care for the unborn like our impoverished Frontline father. Do you forgive him because ""he didn't mean to?"" In a deep sense, it's not his fault another nearly-starving, mentally challenged child is on the rolls. Or does it feel like you're supposed to levy blame? You don't blame a child who has been indoctrinated. You don't blame a child for being born, unless you're my mother. You do blame a cynic manipulator who recognizes the power of espousing an idea independent of its truth.  
  
I can reasonably gather from your words and behavior how little you really intend. You don't mean to come across so superficial. You don't mean to sound helpless and ignorant. You don't mean to suggest there's only one or two ways in which the subject on hand can be understood.

Do I mean to become the enemy? Almost never. But what I intend, a lesson learned every day, is rendered mute to anyone but me. If I didn't feel better understood, more motivated, and a sense of order and accomplishment from writing, I'd be at the mercy of the negative reviews. Those contain no mercy. Those are not concerned with the ""why"" or the ""how"" I arrive at my ideas. That's a realm of complicated reactionary feelings towards the obligation I'm imposing by trying to connect.

*Cedar Run, Mississippi, October of 1892*

Late today a stir ran up the trace road. 

Iron beat iron; spurs bit. A long cry gathered the place into one creature. Women called from their porch rails. Hounds raised a racket. Wheels rattled, harness struck buckle, and I knew the whole of Cedar Run was drawing itself toward the old sycamore.

I latched the graveyard gate and climbed the nearby hill past the split stones. The sky had a boiled cast. Smoke hung low over the cotton gins. At the fence by the road a pair of mules stood hitched to a cart, ears set like knives. Men bunched along the boards, a jug running hand to hand.

“Who are they taking to the tree?” I asked.

“A hand from the south farms,” said Cal Blithe, the cooper. “Says he ain’t guilty.”

“World’s full of fellas claiming that now-a-days,” said Clay Turner, his brother-in-law. He hocked between his boots. “And since words ain’t proof, I reckon them sayings mean nothing to me.”

“What’s he meant to’ve done?”

“They say a girl’s body was found laid under brush,” Clay said, tugging his hat brim down. “Dress tore down one side. Her beau’s the one found her. Bless his heart. I have no doubt they’ll hoist that farmhand high and slow. I mean to watch him swing.”

I allowed myself a sigh.

Cal passed me the jug. “Don’t act like you never seen a hanging, Merrow. You write half of ’em down anyhow.”

I took the jug and gave a short sip. “Writing a record and liking it are two different trades,” I said. “Ain’t much pleasure in keeping count of ghosts.”

That earned a grunt, the kind men use when they agree but won’t say it.

Across the ditch more wagons stood nose to tail, lanterns bumping on their rails. It might’ve passed for a fair but for the set of the faces climbing down. Even the children looked older in that light.

“Never seen so many come out on a Tuesday,” said Widow Nash from her porch. “Ought to be hoeing or washing, not gawking at a killing.”

Her sister called back, “You’d gawk same as them if you was fifteen years younger.”

She turned her chin to me. “Merrow, you’d think folks’d keep to their Bibles, wouldn't you?”

“I reckon they do,” I said. “They just prefer the red parts today.”

The crowd thickened, all the known faces of Cedar Run.

There was Mr. Siles from the dry goods, the preacher’s boy holding his mama’s shawl, the sawyer twins who never parted company, and old Captain Hurd on his stick. Boys in feed caps, fathers with Sunday coats thrown over work shirts, church folk stiff as fence posts, all pressing through broom grass toward the sycamore. 

The tree stood proud as a gallows made by nature herself, its biggest limb worn white where rope had burned it year on year.

“Lord keep us,” someone muttered.

I moved closer. Down under that tree they had the man trussed and tied, wrists pulled in front and ankles bound like a mule’s hobble. He looked plain as any soul you’d pass on Main Street. Dust streaked one cheek. Hair clotted dark where something hard had struck him. Blood made a black coin under one eye. His mouth kept working. Pleading words no one was hearing.

Old Deke Horton leaned on the rail beside me. “That one’s name’s Enoch Price,” he said, tapping his pipe stem against his boot heel. “Came down from Yazoo last spring lookin’ for day work. Never sat right with me. Walked too quiet. Can't trust someone with light feet.”

“Quiet men usually got a reason to be quiet,” I said.

“Quiet men got secrets,” Deke muttered. “And secrets rot faster than meat in August out here.”

The murdered girl’s beau stepped up, hair sweated flat, face rubbed raw from hollering. “You know what you done,” he cried. “You put your hands on her, then you put her under the hedge like a dog. I found her. I seen the dress. I seen the dirt in her mouth. You sick bastard.”

The accused tugged at the bonds around his ankles and near stumbled. “I ain’t done no such thing,” he said, throat raked raw. “I was at the mill. I never laid a hold on her.”

“That so?” a man behind me called out. “Listen here, he ain’t one of us. He drifted in a month back for field pay. Don’t trust a thing that comes out of them lips. You can’t trust drifters.”

Across the crowd, Widow Nash’s boy whispered, “Jacob said he bit like a fish when they took him. Said he’ll dance proper for that too.”

“Mind your talk,” the widow hissed. “Death’s close enough without you feedin’ it extra pain.”

The sheriff raised his hand and brought the noise down to a simmer. “We got testimony,” he said, pointing to the sweetheart. “This man seen young Sarah laid out by the hedge. He says he trailed prints that fit the boots of the accused all the way back to the mill and found her scarf in his coat.”

Cal Blithe ran a jaw of tobacco along his lip. “If that don’t close it, I don’t know what will.”

“Then let us be done with it,” a man near me barked, and there was a low bray of agreement.

“I never touched her,” the man shouted. “Hear me. I kept away from that place. I don’t even know a Sarah. I keep myself clean. I got a wife in Jackson to tend to. Look at my papers!”

“Papers don’t wash away the truth of sin,” Cal said. “Not once it’s baked in.”

“He took her,” said the sweetheart. “Took her and broke her like a stick. You should’ve seen the smirk on his face when I found him... My dear Sarah, what have you done to her?”

The accused turned his head searching faces as if a friend might be found in that pack. He found the preacher. The reverend studied his own clasped hands, letting the plea fall like a leaf.

Old Deke spoke hushed to me. “He ain't getting a blessing from that man. Preacher’s been buryin’ the guilty since before your time, Merrow. Never once heard him offer a mob an argument against it.”

They threw the noose over and let the knot drop and sway. The accused broke and wept. Two boys shimmied up the lower forks of the next tree over for a better view. Their mother tugged at their boots and cursed under her teeth.

The sweetheart claimed the bitter right of the deed. He settled the rope against the man’s neck.

“Last words?” the sheriff asked.

“I never touched her. Lord hear me. I never touched that girl!”

“Pull him,” said the lover.

They pulled. The man kicked, legs knocking together, mouth open like he meant to spill his heart on the ground. The rope groaned. The limb bowed to his weight. His feet went wild, and his gaze swept every soul there, asking a question none would answer.

A woman near me let out the rasp of a june-bug, and her child began to cry. Deke took his hat off. “God forgive this town,” he said.

Wind came through the leaves and shook them like paper over a furnace grate. The sound of it covered the hush when the kicking stopped. His tongue turned dark. The stillness came, the kind that visits all flesh, and that was that.

The sheriff swabbed his brow. “He’ll hang till morning,” he said. “Let the sun see what’s been done here.”

The lover stood bowed, but there was no rest in him.

At the sheriff’s word the men eased back from the swinging shape. The press thinned into little knots of talk. One called for prayer. Another said there’d be no sermon for a killer. A third passed a pipe around, and they smoked under the creak of the limb.

I cannot say what held me there. The rest peeled off at a crawl, as folks do when a wrong sits sweet in the chest.

Deke turned to me. “You’ll dig him come morning, won’t you?”

“I’ll dig whoever needs it.”

He nodded, hitching up his coat. “Then you better dig deep, Merrow. Some sins don’t stop till they’re smothered proper.”

He walked off into the tall weeds, leaving me with the smell of rope and tobacco and the sound of the creaking branch. The lover lingered last, fixed to that dead face until some change in it seemed to meet him. Then he turned for town with his boots dragging.

I stood in the weeds. Light thinned; the sky took the color of old rust. The man swung in a slow sway as the wind played him. His eyes were half open, just the whites showing. Then a deep grovel came, like laughter catching fire.

It climbed, croaking through that torn throat until it stood plain as a man’s speech. The hanged one let his lips part, and a smile split there.

“Well now,” he said. “How wrong your judgement was.”

I cannot say how those words were made, nor what piece of him pushed them out. It was joy without mercy. It was gossip given air. The night pulled tight around that tree, as if bidding the county to listen.

He laughed again, wheezing.

That night I learned a body can hang dead and still have something left to say.

I ran for the sheriff with my cap crushed in my grip and iron on my tongue. Gravel cut my soles through old leather. Folks had strung themselves along the trace road like beads. I shoved through and shouldered into the office where he sat with his boots on a cracker barrel.

I hollered till my throat burned. “Back to the sycamore,” I said. “He pulls air yet. He spoke. I heard it.”

“Hell he did,” a deputy said from the stove, lifting a lid and letting the ring clack. “Merrow, you been drinking at Cal’s again?”

The sheriff raised his gaze by inches, turtle-like off a log. “I think you owe my deputy an answer. You been at the jug, keeper? What foolishness is coming out of your mouth?”

“He’s talking. Spoke and laughed. I heard it sure as the Lord hears prayer. Walk with me and name me a liar to my face if I’m wrong.”

The sheriff sighed and pulled his hat from the peg. “If you’re rousing me over wind in a tree, I’ll have you sweeping out this office till Judgment.”

“I’d rather sweep Hell than lie on a hanging.”

We took the trace back with the sheriff’s lantern blown flat by the wind, tin guard rattling like teeth. The night had a damp weight to it. Somewhere a whippoorwill called and got no answer. Word ran ahead that the corpse had found new life, and a second tide of men gathered before we even reached the tree.

At the sycamore the rope sang in the breeze, and the dead man swung in a slow arc, heels tapping bark. Lantern light jittered across the field stones near the fence line where my dead slept proper. I remember thinking I ought to be tending them instead of this spectacle.

“Speak,” I called, hating the shake that ran through me.

The skull cocked. The lips drew back. A chuckle came up like a pump catching water.

Old Jeb Siles, the undertaker’s brother, crossed himself. “That’s wind through the throat, gotta be.”

“Wind don’t make words,” I told him.

The sheriff’s hand went to his belt. “What trick is this?”

“Welcome, folks,” it said, the same rasp as before, now louder, like a saw on green wood. “You left me lonely, so now we can all hang together.”

Someone near the back shouted, “God help us,” and someone else answered, “God won’t come near this field with that thing here.”

The sheriff pulled his pistol though there was nothing to draw a bead on. “Heard ventriloquists once,” he said, near to himself. “Carnival men. Had a puppet that told fortunes.” He lifted the lantern close. The dead man’s face drank the light like tallow. The sockets held no wish, only a shine that was not life. “This must be a parlor trick.”

“Then find the parlor,” I said. “Maybe it’s under your boots.”

The thing aloft let out a choked laugh. “Hold the rope, hold your tongue, hold your wife, hold your young. See what breaks first. See what breaks worst. I’m here to dine on your sins and there’s plenty to feast.”

The sheriff raised the pistol. “Who are you really?”

“Only what you made,” the voice said. “A fine ripe story with a knot for a neck. A little bell to ring for the wicked. A little bell to ring for the pure. Which are you, lawman? Which is your bride? I have seen her with her veil off.”

The lawman froze. I saw his hand flex against the grip of the gun. “Don’t speak of wickedness and purity to me,” he said.

A boy near the fence whimpered, and his father said, “Hush. You wanted to see a hanging, now you’re seeing it twice.”

Men eased back a step, then another. Snatches of talk cut through:

“Get the women in. Bar them doors.”

“Devil work. I told you this country ain’t safe.”

“It laughed, Papa. It laughed.”

“Hush that. No telling this to your mama.”

The sheriff barked, “Hold! All of you shut your mouths. I’ll ask the questions.” He turned to the tree. “What is your bargain, thing?”

The head lolled, then lifted, the sockets shining like wet coal. “Bargain is easy. Bring your hearts to be salted. Bring your loves to be measured. Ask of any man or woman here, and I will set the facts to plumb. I will name the lock. I will name the thief. Only ask.” It paused, then sang a crooked tune, bright as a schoolyard rhyme gone rotten: “Bring me your questions and I will sow grain. I will raise wheat. I will mill pain.”

A murmur ran through the crowd like ground giving. The lover let out a kennel sound, the kind a cur makes when another noses its bowl. Folks pressed back toward the fence where the old graves humped the dirt.

“Lord help us,” Jeb said again, but he said it more to me than to Heaven. “You ought to put that thing in the ground right now, Merrow.”

“I would if I thought the ground would keep it.”

The sheriff gathered himself. “I will not have a crowd here all night,” he said. “You, keeper. This is damn near your fence line. You stay with it. If any fool comes to taunt it, you send them home. If they will not go, you mark them down. I will be back at dawn.”

“I am no keeper of haints.”

“You are tonight.” He looked up once more. “And you, if you are a ghost or a devil or some foul air passing through a dead man, hold your tongue.”

The hanged thing laughed again, easy and sure of itself. “I will hold nothing.”

“Then see that you burn in your own language,” the sheriff muttered. Then, louder: “Listen, all of you, go home! There’ll be no chat with a dead man in my county. Off the field!”

The crowd broke apart in clusters, murmuring. Jeb lingered beside me a moment longer, his pipe gone out. “You stayin’, Merrow?”

“I reckon I have to.”

He nodded toward the graves behind me. “Your folk ever talk back?”

“Not till tonight.”

“Best of luck, then,” and left me to the sycamore and the scratching of rope in the wind.

I dragged a chair from the sexton shed and set it by the fence. The sky took on dishwater color and the clouds lay like bruises. Crickets sawed. The rope creaked. I kept the sheriff’s order by keeping my regard on the road.

At full dark the lamps in town died two by two. Smoke carried a sweet note from a sorghum boil. The dead thing turned slow and bumped the trunk, and each time it struck the bark there came a little sob, not from the corpse but from the limbs themselves.

Near midnight wheels grated on gravel. A mule snorted and stamped. I rose.

“Turn back,” I said. “Sheriff’s word.”

A man answered in a hush, the sort of voice used behind a curtain. “I am only passing through.”

“You’ll pass on from here, then,” I said. “Leave.”

The mule did not pass. The rider dropped down and came up the ditch. He stopped short of the fence. The lantern light caught a collar and a book under his arm.

“It’s Reverend Cotter,” he said. “I aim to say a prayer for the dead man. I should’ve spoken one earlier.”

“There’s no prayer worth the saying at that tree.”

“I know,” he said, breath shaking. “Still, I must try. I always pray after the judged are gone. It’s coward’s timing, I reckon, but it’s all I manage.”

Above us the body answered like a church bell rung by a drunk. “Let the pious kneel. I’ll count his sins. So many have hung here that you thought were innocent, isn't that right, Reverend?""

The reverend flinched. “Mercy,” he said. “You can’t know that.”

“I know the hour you kneel,” the hanging thing said. “I know the corner pew where you sit and cry. I know the prayers you save for the safe hour, when no one sees your shame.”

The reverend staggered back. “Lord forgive me,” he said, nearly dropping his book.

“Forgive yourself first,” the corpse crooned. “You wear God’s cloth but not His courage. I’ve seen more Godly men in damnation.”

The fellow fled then. The mule balked once, then followed, leaving me with the sound of hooves fading and that tree grinning in the dark like it had won something.

And so it began. Not with a herd, but by twos and singles, like stray wolves nosing a herd. They came in silence or with whispers stitched between them. I turned some away with words alone. Others I marked for the sheriff to see come sunrise.

This one, I must mark in my ledger.

Near one o’clock, a horse came down the trace, hooves soft in the clay. The rider’s coat flapped over his nightclothes. He tied off below the fence and stood, hat pressed against his chest. I knew that frame even in the dark.

Jonathan Thomas.

He ran the general store by the square. He had once bought me coffee when my pay ran short. A decent man, but one given to pride and long grudges.

“You won’t mind me,” he said.

“I do mind you. Sheriff’s word holds till daylight.”

“Won’t be long. I only got one question for it.”

“Then keep it for the Lord,” I told him. “He’s open all night.”

The hanging thing stirred above, slow and knowing.

“Ask,” it crowed. “Ask and be unwell.”

Jonathan winced, but pride carried him through. “I’ll have truth from it, keeper. I can’t sleep without it.”

“You ought to try. Some answers cost more than rest.”

He pushed through the weeds and stopped where the dead man’s shadow washed over him. The moon caught his face, pale as soapstone.

“Tell me,” he said to the corpse, “if my wife keeps to our vows.”

The thing made a sound like a sow rooting in mud. It drew air through its throat, thick and wet. “Vows are tight shoes. Feet swell. Blisters burst. They lead to a hard dance.”

“Speak honest to me.”

“Truth, then,” it crooned, cheerful as a miller opening a sack. “The tailor from the lane fetched mending last Tuesday. Your wife set a plate. She poured strong tea from the little tin. She set her hand on the tailor’s waist and called it strong as a board. They laughed. 

“When the clock struck four, the clock arm was not the only thing that struck hard. Shall I tell the color of the quilt? Shall I tell the song that was sung in the dark? I can promise it was not a hymn.”

I felt the road rise through my boots the way thunder climbs before it breaks.

Jonathan staggered, caught himself, and pointed at the corpse. “Liar.”

“Truth is a sow,” the corpse said. “She rolls where the mud is best.”

He wrung the brim of his hat like it was a throat. “Say the tailor’s name.”

The thing chuckled, a thin wheeze through the torn windpipe. “He is called Matthew. He has three freckles under his collar where no one should count… but the one you share a bed with has counted them often.”

Jonathan let out a sound between a sob and a curse. He turned from the tree, caught sight of me, and barked, “You keep your mouth shut about this, Merrow.”

“I didn’t ask to be keeper of this madness.”

“Too late,” said the tree, voice slick with glee. “What's heard is heard. You keep a ledger, sexton. Keep this too. Write it neat. Write it straight. I’ll spell it for you if you like. M-A-T-T-H—”

“Shut your mouth!” Jonathan screamed.

The sycamore shivered as if it shared the laughter. The rope creaked and the corpse trembled like it could feel joy. “Want to hear the tune she hummed when the bedframe came loose?”

Jonathan froze, then turned on his heel. He walked to his horse like a man walking to his own axe.

“I’ll kill her.”

“No,” I told him. “You’ll sleep, and wake with a level head.”

He stopped halfway to the road and looked back, face hollowed by the lantern glow. “You didn’t see me here.”

Then he rode off, not to town, not to the lane, but down past the gin where the black water takes a bend. I lost him in the willows.

The hanging thing swung with a slow wag of the skull. “First grain,” it said. “See how it mills. It will make the sweetest bread.”

I sat again, though my legs knocked. 

Night did its old work. Owls called. Somewhere a hog shifted in a sty, dreamed a pig dream, and gave a pleased grunt.

I kept the sheriff’s order and turned three more away. Two with words and one with a look.

The corpse spoke once more with no one to hear but me.

“The lawman’s bride keeps a lover like the merchants. Shall I tell that at breakfast?”

I wanted to clap my palms to my ears. I did not. I set them on my knees and pressed till bone hurt. The eastern sky turned bloodless, and the branches showed claws against it, every twig like a crooked finger bidding someone draw near.

By three o’clock the hanged man’s flesh had cinched, the way river fish pull thin when left to the sun. The face shrank to its bones. The skin stretched like leather worked too long on a tanner’s hook. His grin had split at both corners, frozen in some mad humor the night had given him. Each lazy turn of that weight made the rope fuss and hum like a hive half awake.

Hooves trotted up and checked short. A wagon chain sang once before settling. A woman climbed down, shawl tied tight beneath her chin. Her boots sank to the ankle in the soft clay. 

She spotted me at the fence and lifted her chin, pride giving her height she did not own.

“Mornin’, Miss Marlow,” I said. “Don’t tell me you come to see this show again.”

“I’ll have a spell with it.” Her voice was thin but fixed.

“Lady,” I told her, “go on home. This hill will salt your bones. You know that.”

She set her feet wide as if to anchor herself. “I’m a widow now, Charles Henry Merrow. I’ve got no man to keep bread in the bin. Money went missing from my house two weeks back. I’ve prayed and hunted and near tore the place apart. Now I mean to hear the truth from one who can’t be bribed by pity nor pocket.”

“That thing don’t know truth from its own stink,” I said. “You go asking, it’ll give you an answer worth less than the dirt it swings over.”

Above us the hanged man stirred as if woken by his own mention. “Widow, widow,” it drawled, almost kind. “Come pinch the fig and see if it bleeds.”

Her hand went to the cross at her throat. “I’ll speak my piece and be done. Tell me where my money went.”

“Three dollars and a quarter,” it said. “Folded in the rag with your dead man’s cuff button. Gone. Gone indeed.”

Her mouth quivered once, then found shape again. “Say the name. Say who took it.”

“The boy with your husband’s ears,” it answered. “He pried the coffee tin with a table fork and tucked what he took under the chicken box. Called it a loan. 

“Gave a dollar to the gambler by the stock pond. Bought cheap whiskey at the river road. Bought a pewter ring at the stall to ask a girl to make him honest. She said no. She kept the ring. He kept the shame. The quarter went to cards. 

“He lost the lot and learned nothing.”

Her chin trembled. “You damned liar.”

“Want to know where he’ll be?” it asked, playful as a cat with a vole. “Want the name of the girl with the ring?”

“Give me both,” she said, keen as a whip’s crack.

“Miriam Mayfield,” it sang. “The boy will be home by dawn. He’ll lie once. Twice. Thrice. He’ll swear he meant to pay you back on Sunday. He’ll tell you he bought medicine for a sick man. He’ll hate you for hearing this and never forgive you for believing it. He’ll carry that spite with him for the rest of your days.”

She turned from the tree and put a hand on the wagon rail as if to steady the earth. I stepped to her and she waved me off like smoke.

“Go on,” I said, mild as I could make it. “Don’t make a scene of it now. Keep your mind.”

She turned enough to catch my face. “I will not make a show of this. I’ll tend to my own.” She climbed into the wagon. The wheels turned, creaked, and rolled off through the grass.

The dead thing crooned to itself like a nurse with a changeling. “Second grain. The mill keeps good hours... I can smell the dough rising already.”

“Then choke on it.”

I sat for a beat until I heard the next set of feet approach. Before I could rise, a lantern bobbed in the ditch. The light wobbled like it had a mind of its own.

A young woman crossed over, skirt caught up in one fist, lantern in the other. Dew clung to her hem. Her mouth was set in a brave line, the kind that comes from practice, not strength. She stopped at the fence and dipped her crown.

“I’ll be quick,” she said. “I teach at the chapel school. I’m not here for gossip. I’m here for a fact.”

I stood, the chair giving a tired groan behind me. “No good facts grow from that limb.”

“Then a weed will do.” She climbed the fence before I could take a step to stop her. Her boots slid a bit in the clay but she caught herself.

She stood beneath the rope and looked up into that face like it was the face of a judge.

The corpse swayed toward her, that smile cutting wide as though carved. The skin had gone chalk-white around the sockets.

When it spoke, the words came warm and sweet, like apples gone soft in a cellar.

“Come closer, little book woman. Come hear a lesson.”

“Tell me if my father is the man he claims.”

“What man is that?” it asked, almost teasing.

“A saved one. A sober one. A clean one. Tell me my father’s sins if he has any.” Her words shook at the edges though she tried to keep them sharp.

I knew her father, of course. We all did. He ran the bell choir at the chapel, prayed loud, smiled soft, kept a Bible in the crook of his arm and whiskey under the pew.

The thing above us gave a laugh that cracked like an old hinge. “Which measure,” it asked, cheerful as a preacher at revival, “the small lies tied with string or the large ones dragged with oxen?”

“All,” she said. “I want the whole of him.”

“Whole is a heavy word,” it said, voice turning deep. “He is clean where a body can see and foul where a body cannot. 

“He swears off whiskey by day and marries it at night. He goes where lamps hang low and girls call him uncle though he ain’t their kin. He lays a paw on them and calls it fatherly care. He wears a knife mark on his hip he claims came from a fence nail. But it came from a whore he tried to take without consent. 

“He tells himself he is lonesome and God will forgive his actions. Yet he owes money to the brothel man at the ferry and plans to leave you that debt as dowry. 

“And that’s just the start of it.”

“Tell the rest,” she said, voice trembling. “Say their names. I want to know who I must ask forgiveness from.”

The corpse began to speak again, and I will not write all it said. A page ought not hold such things.

It named the girls by the trim on their stockings, by the hats their mothers wore, by nicknames no father should speak. It told the brothel man’s fee, the taste of his liquor, the line her father used about sorrow to press a heart. Every word made the tree creak with ecstasy, like a millstone finding rhythm.

“Stop,” she cried, but her voice cracked apart in the dark. She covered her ears, palms dragging down her face till they left streaks of dirt. “Stop, please.”

“Do you want the place where he keeps the garments?” it asked, sing-song and cruel, the sound almost merry.

She made a sound like a broom breaking and turned, nearly stumbling. “No more,” she said, to no one and everyone. “No more.”

She fled the way she came, lamp swinging wild, skirt wet with morning mist.

“Third grain,” said the corpse. The sycamore shuddered as though pleased by the meal. “There will be bread enough for all come morning.”

I sat again, sick in my gut.

Somewhere beyond the hill a rooster called. Then came running feet in the lane, like rain finding the low places. A boy hollered and was cut short. Women began to wail. Then the one gun I knew by its slow iron report spoke once. Then twice. Much later, a third.

By full dawn the news came in handfuls, each worse than the last. Folks came up the hill in twos, their faces drawn long, whispering what they’d heard before the sun burned the fog off.

The merchant did not ride home at first light. He forced the tailor’s door, shot the tailor and his wife in their bed. Then he went to his own house and shot his own wife where she knelt begging him to forgive her. He dragged her body onto the porch for the whole street to see.

At the widow’s place, her boy was seen bleeding from cheek and lip running from his home. He ran into the river reeds. His mother chased him and cursed him, her lamp swinging wild. She went after the boy barefoot, shouting his name. Neither came back. The sheriff later found their tracks by the water. One large, one small. The current took them both.

The schoolteacher broke every dish in her house, then went to her father’s and brought a shovel down on his skull while he slept. He lived long enough to spit a tooth in her face and call her wicked. She didn’t stop until the neighbors pulled her off and tied her down with sheets.

Word of it carried through the crowd like fire through cotton. Every tongue had a version, each blacker than the last. 

Old Will Strather said, “Ain’t no justice for anyone now, only bad seeds being planted.” 

Another man grunted, “Maybe we been the bad seeds all along.” 

I said nothing.

The tree seemed to listen, wearing a content face for the morning. I saw then that the cracks at the hanging thing’s mouth had widened in the night, gums gone black, teeth shining like wet corn kernels in a husk too dry for mercy.

I felt a new fear rise in me. Not a fear of ghosts. A fear of neighbors. A fear of my own name spoken with a certain turn. I am not a sinless man.

The sheriff came up with two deputies who already looked whipped before they’d started. Their collars hung open, eyes hollow from a night without rest. “I’ll have order,” he said. “Ya'll won’t mob this hill again.”

Someone called from the back where I couldn’t see the face. “We’re already a mob. You’re too late, same as you were too late for Sarah.”

The sheriff raised a finger. “Enough."" He turned to me. “Keeper, tell it to speak as it did in the night.”

“I don't command it. I reckon it commands itself.”

The dead thing spared me the effort. The body turned on the rope, slow as a clock’s hand. “Good morning, lawman,” it said, voice raw as split glass. “You’ve come to market. Would you like some bread?”

A ripple went through them. The sheriff cleared his throat. “You talk too much, deadman. Just say why you came. Say what you want, so we can put this behind us.”

“Why,” it said, savoring the word. “This man only came to work the mill. I came because I want what you bring. Your whispers. Your grief. Your shame. I am a gleaner in a fat field, and you are late to cut.”

A man near me shouted. “Name what brought you, if you’re anything but lies we’ll know the devil is with us.”

“Your works. Your rope. Your joy in the count.” Then it began to sing, low and ugly, each note dragging like a plow through mud: “Ring the bell and reap the wheat. Hang a man and salt the meat.”

The air split. No one breathed.

Then talk burst out like a kettle breaking boil.

“Ask it!” a woman cried. “Ask the question that matters.”

“What question?” someone hissed.

“The girl,” a boy said. “Ask who killed her.”

That name, Sarah, slid through them like a trout through a net, slipping grasps, nicking fingers, leaving everyone bleeding pride. The crowd swayed and clenched in on itself.

The sheriff swung his arm for silence. “Thing,” he said, “you know more than you should. If you know this, say it. Who murdered Sarah, if not you?”

The skull turned the way a bird tests the wind. The lines at its eyes stretched at its corners, as though the skin had learned a new trick.

“At last,” it said. “At last a clean bite.” The words came plain, with no rhyme to soften them. “The one who called the crowd. The one who tied the knot. The one who set the rope on my neck. The sweetheart murdered his darling.”

The air left the hill. You could feel it pour out of the bodies around me, like wind pulled through a chimney.

The lover stood near the front, still as a headstone, looking like a man who’d already read his own verdict. He tried to speak, but no sound found him. His mouth sagged open, his fists opening and closing like a frog thrumming on a bank.

The dead thing savored it. “He killed her in the hedge when she told him she would not have his hand in marriage. He pressed her down with his want and his weight. He filled her mouth with dirt when she tried to cry out. He fixed her dress and told God he’d wash his guilt clean with another man’s blood. He found this hanging man by luck and called it providence.

""There is no providence here. Only the price of sin.”

“No,” the lover managed at last, voice cracking like old timber. “No. That’s a lie straight from Hell.”

A man behind him barked, “You led us.”

A woman said, “You took my boys to see the dying.”

Another shouted, “You made my son clap.”

I could feel it turning, the way a field fire turns when the wind changes. The sheriff’s hand hovered above his belt, unsure which devil to aim at. “Hold. Think before you move forward with these charges.”

They did not heed the sheriff. 

Rage and shame run on quick legs. Arms flung. One fellow swung a blow at the lover and cursed he had not struck his temple harder. The press rolled like a hogshead tipped, and they shoved the man to the trunk until his back met the old bark with a wet thud. 

He cut me a look once; there was nothing to take from it but a fear come too late. They set the rope on him and he cried like a rabbit in a snare.

“Wait,” the sheriff shouted, though his shout had the tired ring of a man who’d given up on being heard. “We will have a court.”

“We had one,” someone answered, bitter and bright. “You called it justice yesterday.”

A woman near the fence spat, “You talk of courts while her blood’s on the ground. Where were your courts when she needed them?”

I had no word that would live past my lips. I kept to the scene with the rest and hated myself among them.

They threw the end of a rope over the limb, and worked a quick knot. But a knot made in haste is still a knot.

They threw the noose over the sweetheart's neck. The crowd hauled.

The lover bucked once and twice and forced out a sound that was far from a prayer.

The dead thing set its teeth on him and spoke in a kinder tone than before, which made it crueler.

“Neighbor. Fix on me. There were two on a hill once and a man in the middle. He promised a kingdom to a thief who spoke sweet. I promise a pit to a liar who refuses his charge. Sarah would've said yes if you had given her a week to ask her father. Now keep your regard on me while you fall. I will show you the gate that opens down below your feet.”

“Stop that noise,” a woman cried.

The corpse laughed, pleased with its sermon. “Hear him kick,” it said. “Hear him pray to the same God he used for a weapon. Count for me. Count like you counted yesterday. How long until the breaths cease?”

""What's going on, Pop?” A boy near the front asked his father. The father clamped a palm over his mouth and would not meet his eyes.

The lover’s feet kicked bark the way a blind man taps a curb. His face ran from red to ash-gray. His tongue showed. His reach found the rope and fell away. The first body rocked into him as if to welcome him home.

“Cut him down!” someone shouted. “For God’s sake, cut him down!”

“No. This needs to happen,” said a woman close by, and her words held a small, bitter truth.

Both figures moved before me.

One struggled for life. One rejoiced in death.

The dead man's face shone like a white seed in a split gourd and froze still. His eyes fixed on the lover until both were still.

By mid morning the hill had spent itself. The new man’s legs quieted. The old one swung easy as ever. The town did not speak. They made no plan for cutting either down.

Folks left with their mouths crooked and their regard fixed on the road. Children were hushed like dogs. The sheriff stood a long while and then looked at me. 

“Keeper,” he said as he passed near enough to touch my sleeve, “you’ll see to the burying?”

“I’ll see to it.” 

""Thank you.""

He walked away without another word.

I waited till the sun dropped behind the gin and the fields turned to paper. I wanted to make sure no second voice spilled out from any dead man's lip.

No voice came.

Nor did anyone else's.

No one wanted to do the work that belongs to a gravedigger.

I fetched the ladder from the sexton’s shed and took a saw for the knots.

I cut the first rope and lowered the weight into my arms like a sack of wet meal.

“May God forgive us.” The gravel crunched under my boots as I leaned and felt the whole town’s judgment in my shoulders.

I cut the second and did the same. I did not cross myself. I set them on the ground and went for the spade.

At the sycamore’s foot the soil dug like bread dough. Roots lay thick and ran blue-green in the light, slick as veins under skin. I set the spade and cut between them. They bled sap that smelled sweet and wrong.

I laid the first man down and then the other. I did not mark which was which. I closed the earth on them with no stone, only weight of dirt and the flat of my shovel to tamp it clean.

As I sealed the second scoop I heard a sound under the soil like laughter in a mouth full of rags. It moved through roots into trunk and up the limb where the bark was worn bloodless. It was not loud. It had no need. I felt it in the spade’s handle and in my wrists.

I set the shovel against the fence, set my weight on the post, and regarded that tree. I have written many burials. I have written storms and births and poor men saved by small mercies. This is the last I will set down of the hanging place.

The thing we made was no spirit of balance. It was not vengeance that wants a scale to settle. It was the sin that sits at a table and smiles while men feed it. It was gossip with blood in it. It ate what we handed it and asked for more. It will keep asking.

The town will learn to keep its talk reserved, or it will not learn a thing, and if that happens then there will be more branches for more hangings.

I will keep my ledger shut on this. I will say no more. I will not give that tree another word to drink. Let this be the last time gossip lives in this town.",7,1761678259.0,creepcast,3,1.0,False

I got home about half an hour before Mary. I pulled the defrosted pork chops from the fridge, greased a pan, and slid them into the oven at 400 degrees. They'd be ready in about twenty minutes, right when I expected her to walk in.

On the stove, I boiled a pot of water and dumped in a bag of frozen string beans. With the seeded Italian bread I'd grabbed from the bakery on the way home, it'd make a solid meal. 

Not Mom's legendary feasts, but it kept us fed. I flipped on WNEW, letting pure rock and roll fill the apartment while I waited.

The key turned in the door just as I pulled the pork chops out. The string beans were already cooked and plated.

""Dinner's served,"" I said, grinning as I set the table.
Mary stood in the foyer, her lips trembling, eyes welling up.

""What's wrong?"" I asked, worry creeping in.

""Does something have to be wrong?"" she said softly. ""Everything's perfect. I just love you so much.""

""That's a relief,"" I said. ""Thought you were crying over my cooking.""

""You're the best cook ever,"" she said, pulling me into a passionate kiss that set my pulse racing.

Before I knew it, she was tugging me toward the bedroom.

""The food's gonna get cold,"" I protested.

""That's why we got a microwave,"" she said.

Twenty minutes later, I realized I wasn't wearing protection and pulled out just in time.

""Why'd you do that?"" Mary cried, disappointment sharp in her voice. ""I wanted to feel you inside me. That was the whole point.""

""Mary, you're not on birth control,"" I said. ""It happened so fast, I forgot a condom.""

""Condoms are so unromantic,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""It was perfect until you pulled out.""

""Hold on,"" I said, half-confused. ""We agreed to wait until we're married before trying for kids. That's why we're saving for the wedding. What's going on?""

""Nothing's going on,"" she said, standing. ""Let me shower.""

""I'll join you.""

""Great,"" she said, her tone biting. ""Gonna put a condom on for an encore in there?""

""Who are you?"" I asked, feeling like I'd stumbled into a psychological thriller.

""I don't know,"" she said, her eyes welling up. ""I'm sorry. I saw a woman with a baby on the train and got carried away, I guess. My hormones were all over the place. Come on, let's shower and heat up dinner.""

""No need to apologize,"" I said, softening. ""You were just being you. That's a good thing. But we're on the same page, right?""

""Absolutely,"" she said, her face glowing with the warmth that always pulled me in.

After dinner, Mary washed the dishes since I'd cooked. I dried and put them away, our usual teamwork.

""I was supposed to meet Jeff and Danny at Art's Bar,"" I said. ""But if you want, I can stay, and we'll rent a movie.""

""No, I'm fine,"" Mary said. ""Really, I'm over it. Go—they're expecting you.""

She walked me to the door, wrapping me in a long hug, her head resting on my shoulder.

""We're doing it right, Mare,"" I said. ""Wedding, marriage, then kids. We've got our whole lives ahead.""

She smiled and nodded. ""Just be careful. You've got a girl at home.""

""I never forget that,"" I said.

I headed downstairs and drove to Art's, Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a Prayer"" blasting from the radio, still not fully grasping what had just gone down.

I walked into Art's and spotted Danny and Steinberg at the far end of the bar. A pile of seventeen bucks sat in front of them. I tossed my ten on top and ordered a Bud Light.
Their grim faces told me something was up.

""What's going on?"" I asked. ""You two look like you lost your last dollar.""

""Since you asked,"" Danny said, his tone dripping sarcasm, ""you and Stein are putting a lot of pressure on me with Diane. She was fine before you two whipped clowns moved in with your girls.""

""Excuse us for living, Dan,"" I shot back. ""We're twenty-five, not fifteen. Maybe you should try it. Best move I ever made.""

""Oh, yeah?"" Danny said. ""You walked in here with a face so long your chin's scraping the floor. Don't bullshit me—I've known you too long. What happened, lovers' spat?""

""Damndest thing,"" I said. ""I'm getting dinner ready—pork chops, string beans, fresh Italian bread. Mary walks in, pulls me straight to the bedroom. Then it gets weird. She wants me to finish unprotected.""

""What'd you do?"" Stein asked, hanging on every word.

""Pulled out. Babies before marriage? That's not what I signed up for.""

""Good call,"" Danny said. ""You did the right thing.""

""I know. She was pissed at first, but she calmed down. Said she saw a woman with a baby on the train, and her hormones kicked in.""

""How'd you leave it?"" Danny asked, smirking. ""Sleeping at your mom's in your old bed tonight?""

""Nah, she apologized,"" I said. ""We showered together, ate dinner, and everything's back to normal.""

""Yeah, right,"" Danny said. ""If she's got her mind set on a kid, she won't stop. That was just her first shot.""

""I can't even think about kids right now,"" Stein chimed in. ""I didn't want Angie moving in at first, but now I'd die if she left. Still adjusting, though.""

""Well, I'm not you two,"" Danny said. ""I'm Danny, the General. I've got no plans to move in with Diane, and if she thinks we are, she's got another thing coming.""

""Hope you don't lose her, Dan,"" I said. ""You're great together, and I love you both. At some point, you gotta settle down.""

""Not me,"" he said. ""You can grow up if you want. I'm staying a kid forever. I want my freedom and as many girls as I can get. Diane can deal with it or hit the door.""

""What are you, Peter Pan?"" I laughed. ""Little boy who never grows up?""

""Yeah, but he had a cool knife in his belt and could fly,"" Danny said. ""That's my guy.""

I glanced at the clock—10:30 on a work night. Our money pile was down to eight bucks, and we'd said all there was to say.

""I'm out,"" I said, tossing a five for the tip. ""See you guys.""

""Gerry, drop me off,"" Stein said. ""Angie's got a stomach bug. Don't wanna leave her alone too long.""

""Just think,"" Danny called out, ""while you two are sleeping for your ungodly early alarms, I'll be in a Manhattan club, dancing with some city hotties. That's the difference.""

""Good night, Dan,"" I said, pulling him in for a hug and kissing his cheek.

""Give Mary my love,"" he said. ""Angie, too.""

Stein and I headed out. I couldn't shake the feeling that Danny pitied me as much as I did him.

Chapter 10- Hump Day Hustle 

Wednesday—hump day—and I was already eyeing the weekend. I wasn't scheduled to work one yet, but it was coming. At the Broadway CSO, when your turn came for a weekend shift, you got an NS—non-scheduled—day off the week before Saturday and the week after Sunday. AT&T let us work those days for overtime, and with the ten percent weekend differential, you could rake in serious cash.

I settled at my desk, finishing my deli coffee, when Steve and Pete strolled in. They both rode the IRT line and often linked up on the commute.
Gary, our supervisor, slid in behind us, pulling Steve, Pete, and me into a huddle by his desk.

""Got an idea for you three,"" he said. ""There's an empty office on the eighteenth floor, back of the node. How about we use it for afternoon breaks—do push-ups, sit-ups, and chins on a bar I hung in the doorway? I'm thinking of adding a set of weights, too. You guys keep fit, so this feels like a no-brainer.""

We exchanged grins and nodded in unison. I'd been doing push-ups and sit-ups at night since moving in with Mary, but working out at the office with the guys? Total game-changer.

""Alright,"" Gary said, flashing that wide grin of his. ""We start today. Three p.m., half an hour.""

Gary was a ruggedly handsome guy, about forty, in great shape—not quite a bodybuilder, but impressively fit for his age. Married with two teenage kids, he seemed solid. I'd spoken to his wife a few times when I answered his desk phone—sweet lady, real warm.

But the worst-kept secret in the office was Gary's affair with Lorraine, a supervisor from Pre-Service. Pete once called her ""kinda hot,"" and she was—married too, judging by the rock on her finger, though she never mentioned kids. Gary had once told me they had a ""frequent flyer deal"" at a Jersey motel.
Things were getting intense between them, more than either planned, he said. None of my business, but I appreciated that Gary trusted me enough to share.

At 8:30, I plugged in my phone, and one of my extensions flashed red immediately. I picked it up—a Bell South tech from Dallas, dealing with a downed voice circuit. As a long-distance office, we handled the haul between cities. Local carriers like Bell South took it the last mile, from our co-location central offices to the customer's premises.

Across the aisle, Steve was asking Dr. Johnson for help troubleshooting a data circuit for Paine Webber on Wall Street. Doc could be moody—his patience depended on the day—but he was usually cool. He reminded me of a gruffer Garry Shandling, like a stand-up comic with an edge.

The in-charge tech for the month was James Brennan, promoted about six months before us. The gig meant answering the main line, fielding calls from field techs, putting them on hold, and shouting for someone free to take over.
He also managed the ticket lists—New for fresh issues, Pending for ongoing troubles, and Hold for customer callbacks. If needed, he'd escalate to the LECs—local exchange carriers. Not tough or thrilling, but the extra ten bucks a week covered your coffee.

Another tech in the office was Elaine—a little older than us, but with a killer body. She had that shorter Raquel Welch look, a touch of Farrah Fawcett in her hair, and a confidence that made heads turn. Definitely my type—if I didn't already have Mary.

She was cool, too. Big into rock and roll, loved to party. She had an eighteen-year-old son who played guitar and had been twice divorced. That morning, I saw her stroll past me toward Big Kenny. She was a head-turner at first, but after a while, you got used to it.

""Kenny, I heard you're a bouncer at Studio 54—how exciting,"" she said, voice smooth and teasing.

""Yeah,"" Kenny said, leaning back with that easy grin.

""My friend and I would love to get in one night, but we can't stand waiting on those long lines.""

""No worries,"" he said. ""I'm there every Saturday night. Just let me know when and you're in.""

Elaine lit up. ""Thank you so much, dear. I'll talk to her and let you know.""

She brushed his shoulder lightly before heading back to her desk.
Kenny turned back to his trouble ticket, still grinning. The wheels were clearly turning.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little envious—but after the Audrey debacle at 32 A.O.A., I was glad to have Mary and be done with office romances.

The day flew by. Yolanda from Merrill Lynch called, frantic about a loud echo on her massive hoot-and-holler circuit. I sent a quick hot tone to try knocking it out—no luck. This one wasn't going to be easy.

With hundreds of drops on the circuit, I started isolating backbone segments, trying to pin down the bad endpoint fast. After about an hour, I found it: a Seattle office's CPE—customer premise equipment—was outputting hot levels, making the whole system whistle. I blocked its transmit so they could still hear nationwide and dispatched a Pacific Bell tech to sort it out with their vendor.

I called Yolanda to fill her in, and she sounded relieved, promising to get her vendor on it.

Glancing at the clock—2:45.

""Don't get tied up on anything you can't drop,"" Gary called out. ""Gym starts in fifteen.""

I stretched out my ticket log update so I'd be ready right at three.

Gary, Steve, Pete, and I marched to the elevator like a pack of junkyard dogs. On the eighteenth floor, Gary unlocked the door to the empty office. It looked perfect. He'd laid out four workout mats from Herman's Sporting Goods up the block and cleared a corner for a weight set he planned to bring in later.

For now, calisthenics would do. Pete, Steve, and I lined up facing the door, with Gary out front like he was leading Sweatin' to the Oldies. We dropped for fifty push-ups, rested a minute, then another fifty—four sets total. By the end, my arms were jelly.

Next came sit-ups: two sets of a hundred, then two of fifty. Good thing we'd been training at home—starting cold would've crippled us tomorrow.

Finally, chin-ups in the doorway. We managed about ten each, then spotted each other by the ankles for three more sets.

We were drenched in sweat, no spare shirts, and didn't care. The camaraderie made it worth every drop. We toweled off with paper towels in the bathroom, laughing like kids.

The half-hour flew by. I'd thought this job couldn't get any better—but our new gym routine just proved me wrong.

Chapter 11- Past Promises New Possibilities 

I rode the train into Manhattan that Friday morning, buzzing about the dinner the ladies from my old 32 A.O.A. office had planned for me.

I'd told Mary about it, explaining they were throwing it because they never gave me a proper send-off. From how I described them—just friends and coworkers—she had no reason to feel uneasy.

If I'd mentioned Audrey, my unrequited crush, it might've been different. But Audrey had called out my last day, so she likely wouldn't show. No need to bring her up, I figured.

Meanwhile, Angie stood on the 18th Avenue platform, waiting for the N train. She gripped her purse with both hands, knuckles white, unaware of the tension in her grip.

Morning sickness still hit her, though not always in the morning. It was Friday, and still no period. Today, she'd head to CVS for a pregnancy test to find out if she and Jeff were about to become parents.

It sounded simpler than it was. Jeff hadn't wanted to be labeled a couple at first, and he'd dug in his heels against moving in together. Angie felt differently, coaxing him—sometimes gently, sometimes not—until he came around to her way of thinking.

Now, Jeff admitted living with Angie was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was head over heels, and seeing her struggle with what she called a stomach virus shook him. The mere thought of losing her was unbearable.

But Angie was tough, her will like iron. Whatever came next, she'd handle it. And she had Mary, her best friend and surrogate sister, to lean on. When Mary said she and Gerry were there for them, day or night, Angie knew she meant every word.

My train rolled into City Hall station. I grabbed the Daily News and headed east toward 33 Thomas Street.

I was a bit annoyed with Steve. His dentist appointment excuse wasn't adding up—more likely, he didn't want to spend a Friday night with a bunch of ladies who reminded him of his aunts.

Upstairs, I had a good twenty-five minutes to skim the paper. It was Friday, and Angelo owed Mary and me $140 from our weekend bets. We'd probably put some of it on Florida State and Notre Dame tomorrow with Danny.

When Steve walked in, he was griping about how his chest and abs ached from yesterday's workout. He was fit, lean from jogging a couple times a week, but push-ups and lifting weren't his thing, and he was paying for it now.

""Ready for your big dinner date tonight, buddy?"" he said. ""Too bad I can't make it—gotta help my dad move some furniture.""

""Jeez, get your fake excuses straight,"" I said. ""Monday, you said dentist appointment, remember?""

""Oh, right,"" he said, smirking. ""Well, I'm going to my dad's after the dentist. That works.""

""Whatever,"" I said. ""I'll be the only guy there, soaking up all that sisterly affection.""

""Yeah, count me out for that,"" he laughed.

Angie paced the women's products aisle at the CVS on Hudson Street, her nerves on edge as she bought a Clearblue home pregnancy test.
When she stepped off the elevator at her office, Mary was waiting, pacing around Angie's desk.

""Ready, sister?"" Mary said, squeezing Angie's hand.

""As ready as I'll ever be,"" Angie replied.

In a bathroom stall, Angie followed the test instructions. She brought the tray, with a drop of her urine, back to her desk, and they waited the agonizing half-hour to see if it turned blue for positive.

The tension was unbearable. They headed to the cafeteria for coffee, barely speaking, their minds locked on one thing. Staring out the window at a cargo ship gliding into port, they tried to distract themselves.
They gulped down their coffee and hurried back to Angie's desk, where she'd locked the test tray in her drawer.

""This is it, sister,"" Mary said.

Angie unlocked the drawer and pulled out the tray. Mary saw it instantly in Angie's face—the swab was as blue as Angie's eyes. Angie and Jeff were having a baby.

At 5:15 that evening, I stood outside Enzo's Italian Ristorante, halfway between my old building and the new one, waiting for the ladies from 32 A.O.A.

I was the first to arrive. The fall evening was crisp, about sixty-five degrees, perfect for my blue long-sleeve thermal layered over a T-shirt. I scanned the block for any sign of them.

They appeared like a posse from a Western, strolling up the street toward me—Dina, Valerie, Gladys, Maria, and Marta. They were dressed to impress, like they were headed to a catered affair, faces made up flawlessly. It hit me how much I meant to them.

Then, trailing at the back, I saw Audrey in a pink sweater and jeans, looking as stunning as ever.

One by one, they pulled me in for hugs and kisses. Six months had passed since I'd been this close to them, but it felt like yesterday. When it was Audrey's turn, I extended a hand to shake. She brushed it aside, threw her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss on my lips—not like any we'd shared before. This one felt like it meant something.

At the table, Audrey made a point to sit next to me, nudging Maria out of the way. Valerie ordered a bottle of wine for the table, and the waiter returned minutes later with a bread basket and poured our glasses. 

We raised them in a toast to old friends and success.
Audrey leaned in close, picking her entrée off my menu. To anyone watching, we'd have looked like a couple. I tried to act normal, ignoring it as best I could. She looked and smelled amazing, and if I didn't have Mary, I'd have been all over it. But I did have Mary, and that changed everything.

I ordered chicken Francese; I didn't even catch what Audrey got. It hit me how much I'd grown in six months—I'd really moved on.

Two waiters served our food, and we swapped work stories, laughing over old times. Gladys bragged about her ""world's best"" muffins, Dina teased about keeping me in line, and Valerie praised my work ethic. Audrey brought up our date to a Billy Joel concert, raving about what a great time we'd had. I kept wondering who this woman was. Then she started brushing my knee with her fingernails.

The night was a blast. They'd outdone themselves, refusing to let me chip in for the check. Valerie collected the cash and handed it to the waiter in the leather folder.

Outside, we hugged and promised to do it again, the ladies insisting they wanted to meet Mary next time. We said goodnight on the corner.

As they walked away, Audrey looped her arm through mine. ""We're going the same way. Have a drink with me at Tropics Bar for old times' sake.""

I agreed, though reluctantly. It'd been a long day, and I was feeling good but ready to call it a night. It was like winning a game and heading into overtime.

As we walked, she told me she was up for a promotion, replacing Barbara as the word processing department supervisor. I was genuinely happy for her—she'd always been a stellar worker, and the promotion was well-earned.

At Tropics, I held the door, and we slid into a booth. She sat close, and we each ordered a beer.

""You've really changed, you know,"" Audrey said. ""You're not the muscle-bound delivery guy I met anymore. You've come a long way.""

""Come on, Audrey,"" I said. ""I'm still that guy. Maybe it's just the way you see me now.""

""Is there something wrong with that?"" she said. ""Maybe you were always my type, I just didn't see it back then.""

""Audrey, I don't even know what you're talking about,"" I said, half-laughing. ""But I get it. Maybe I wasn't ready to be just friends then, but I am now.""

She locked eyes with me, then slid to the other side of the booth, facing me. ""You really love her, don't you? I could tell the Monday after you took her to see Phil's band in Brooklyn.""

""I've been living with her for six months,"" I said. ""That's a pretty solid commitment.""

""It is,"" she said, her voice softening. ""I think this is the booth where you made out with Helen in front of me that night. Never said it, but I was jealous as hell.""

""I was aching for it to be you,"" I admitted, ""but figured I didn't have a shot.""

""You probably didn't,"" she said, and we both laughed.

""It's funny,"" I said. ""Inside 32 A.O.A., we got along great. Outside those walls? World War III.""

""You're right,"" she sighed. ""At least until now.""

I tossed a ten on the table. ""It's late. I gotta go.""

""I'll have another beer,"" she said. 

""It was really good seeing you, Gerry.""

""You too, Audrey. Goodnight.""

""Hey, Gerry,"" she called as I reached the door. ""I hate you, but I love you. Never forget that.""

""You better love me,"" I said, grinning, and walked out.

Chapter 12- Breaking The News

Angie got home, tossed her jacket over a kitchen chair, and poured a glass of water.
She sank onto the couch, and Lucy leapt into her lap, tail wagging furiously, licking Angie's face as if she sensed a new baby sister on the way. Angie stroked her muzzle, kissed the bridge of her nose, and whispered, ""We're gonna have a baby.""

She skipped cooking dinner, deciding to order pizza once Jeff got home. She wondered if he'd even have an appetite after she shared the news—or if she should call his sister for backup. But no, this was too personal. She'd tell him herself. Jeff had grown so much these past six months. It would be okay.

At 6:35, a key turned in the lock. Jeff walked in, all smiles, pulling her off the couch for a big hug and kiss.

""No cooking tonight?"" he said. ""That's fine—you've worked hard all week. I'm good with takeout.""

Angie took his hand and guided him to the couch. ""Sit with me,"" she said. ""I've got something to tell you.""

Jeff's first instinct was always panic.
""What's wrong?"" he said, face flushing red.

""Nothing's wrong, babe,"" Angie said with a soft laugh. ""Calm down. Jeez, your face looks like a ripe tomato.""

""Well, the way you said 'sit down,'"" he replied, ""you usually do that when you're about to drop something heavy.""

Angie straddled him, settling onto his lap, eyes locked on his.

""Now this I like,"" Jeff said, grinning. ""Gotta stop jumping to conclusions, always thinking the worst.""

She leaned in, kissed him long and slow, knowing once it ended, she'd just say it. With him pinned like this, he wasn't going anywhere if he fainted.

She pulled back gently and blurted it out.
""The morning vomiting? It's not a stomach virus. It's morning sickness, Jeff. We're having a baby. Isn't that wonderful?""

""Wonderful? A baby? I'm gonna be a father?"" Jeff's voice cracked, eyes wide. ""I can barely handle walking Lucy at night, let alone a baby!""

""Relax, will you?"" Angie said, pushing his shoulders against the couch. ""I'll be taking care of the baby. Don't sell yourself short, babe—you're gonna be a great dad and an amazing husband.""

""Husband?"" Jeff nearly choked. ""First I'm a dad, now a husband? What are you trying to do, kill me?""

""Stop being so dramatic,"" Angie said, her tone sharpening. ""Our baby's gonna have a real family, not just a mom and dad shacking up.""

""That's what I signed up for, Angie—shacking up!"" he said. ""You never said dad and husband were part of the bargain.""

""Steinberg, you're starting to piss me off,"" she snapped. ""I tell you we're having a baby—the most miraculous, wonderful thing two people in love can share—and you should be down on one knee proposing, not making me drag you there!""

""Drag me where?"" Jeff said, his voice rising. ""What's next, a sack over my head and a hostage situation?""

""Jeff, we've been living together six months,"" Angie said, her tone steady but firm. ""You fought me tooth and nail at first, but now you lose it at the thought of me being sick. It'll be the same with marriage and the baby. We'll take it slow—City Hall, a week or two, just Mary and Gerry standing up for us. When we get home, it'll feel like nothing's changed. And trust me, Jeff, if you think you love me now, wait till you see our baby. He or she will be our universe, our precious miracle.""

She felt Jeff's tension ease beneath her. He leaned back against the couch, taking a deep, steady breath. Angie gently took his hand and placed it on her stomach.

""A piece of you is in here, babe,"" she said softly. ""A piece of you and me. It's gonna be alright—wonderful, even. I've never steered you wrong. Trust me. I'm so happy to be having your baby.""

""What if I'm a lousy father?"" Jeff asked, quieter now.

""I worry about being a bad mother,"" Angie admitted. ""It's scary, a huge responsibility. But I know I'll love this baby more than anything. Let's start there.""

Jeff kissed the top of her head, then lifted her chin with both hands and kissed her lips softly.

""Okay,"" he said. ""We'll start there. Baby steps.""",1,1761678211.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

1oii7bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1oii7bb/aita_for_thinking_my_husband_is_taking_the/,AITA for thinking my husband is taking the divorce too far after I told him I should have married his brother instead?,"My husband waited until I was at work to pack everything, leave divorce papers on the kitchen counter, and mail proof of my affair to every single person in his family.

I came home to an empty house. Not just empty like he took his stuff. Empty like he took the couch we bought together, the TV, half the dishes, even the coffee maker. The divorce papers were sitting on the counter with a sticky note that just said ""read page 4.""

Page 4 was a list of dates. Dates I met up with his brother. Dates I lied about working late. Dates I said I was at book club. He had screenshots of texts. He had photos of his brother's car parked outside the hotel we used. He even had a receipt from the lingerie I bought that he never saw me wear.

I threw up in the sink.

But here's the thing. I wouldn't have done any of this if my husband had just been more like his brother. His brother listens when I talk. His brother makes me laugh. His brother doesn't spend every weekend playing video games while I sit there feeling invisible.

I told my husband this six months ago. We were fighting about something stupid, I don't even remember what, and I just said it. ""Sometimes I think I should have married your brother instead.""

He got quiet. Like scary quiet. Then he said, ""okay,"" and walked out of the room.

I thought we moved past it. We had sex that week. We went to his parents' house for Sunday dinner. Everything seemed normal.

Turns out he spent those six months collecting evidence. His brother confessed everything after my husband confronted him with photos. His brother told him dates, places, everything. They haven't spoken since.

Now my mother-in-law won't answer my calls. My sister-in-law posted a vague Facebook status about ""snakes in the family"" and I know it's about me. My father-in-law sent me a text that just said ""you destroyed my boys.""

My own family thinks I'm getting what I deserve. My mom said, ""well, what did you expect?"" My dad won't even look at me.

I tried calling my husband. Blocked. I tried emailing. Bounces back. I drove to his new apartment and he threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave.

His brother won't talk to me either. He sent one text: ""it was fun but I'm not losing my whole family over this.""

I'm sitting in this half-empty house with divorce papers that are going to ruin me financially. He documented everything. The affair. The times I used our joint account to pay for hotel rooms. The fact that I'm the one who initiated everything with his brother.

His lawyer already sent a letter. He wants the house. He wants me to pay him alimony because I make more. He's going to get it too because I'm the one who cheated.

I just wanted to feel wanted. Is that so wrong? His brother made me feel beautiful. His brother actually paid attention to me. And yeah, maybe I went about it the wrong way, but my husband pushed me to this.

If he had just tried harder, none of this would have happened.

My friends are split. Half think I'm a monster. Half think my husband is vindictive for airing everything out to his family. But none of them understand what it's like to be married to someone who treats you like a roommate.

I texted my husband one more time from a different number: ""we can fix this.""

He replied: ""there's nothing left to fix. Sign the papers.""

So am I wrong for thinking he's taking this too far?

I got home about half an hour before Mary. I pulled the defrosted pork chops from the fridge, greased a pan, and slid them into the oven at 400 degrees. They'd be ready in about twenty minutes, right when I expected her to walk in.

On the stove, I boiled a pot of water and dumped in a bag of frozen string beans. With the seeded Italian bread I'd grabbed from the bakery on the way home, it'd make a solid meal. 

Not Mom's legendary feasts, but it kept us fed. I flipped on WNEW, letting pure rock and roll fill the apartment while I waited.

The key turned in the door just as I pulled the pork chops out. The string beans were already cooked and plated.

""Dinner's served,"" I said, grinning as I set the table.
Mary stood in the foyer, her lips trembling, eyes welling up.

""What's wrong?"" I asked, worry creeping in.

""Does something have to be wrong?"" she said softly. ""Everything's perfect. I just love you so much.""

""That's a relief,"" I said. ""Thought you were crying over my cooking.""

""You're the best cook ever,"" she said, pulling me into a passionate kiss that set my pulse racing.

Before I knew it, she was tugging me toward the bedroom.

""The food's gonna get cold,"" I protested.

""That's why we got a microwave,"" she said.

Twenty minutes later, I realized I wasn't wearing protection and pulled out just in time.

""Why'd you do that?"" Mary cried, disappointment sharp in her voice. ""I wanted to feel you inside me. That was the whole point.""

""Mary, you're not on birth control,"" I said. ""It happened so fast, I forgot a condom.""

""Condoms are so unromantic,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""It was perfect until you pulled out.""

""Hold on,"" I said, half-confused. ""We agreed to wait until we're married before trying for kids. That's why we're saving for the wedding. What's going on?""

""Nothing's going on,"" she said, standing. ""Let me shower.""

""I'll join you.""

""Great,"" she said, her tone biting. ""Gonna put a condom on for an encore in there?""

""Who are you?"" I asked, feeling like I'd stumbled into a psychological thriller.

""I don't know,"" she said, her eyes welling up. ""I'm sorry. I saw a woman with a baby on the train and got carried away, I guess. My hormones were all over the place. Come on, let's shower and heat up dinner.""

""No need to apologize,"" I said, softening. ""You were just being you. That's a good thing. But we're on the same page, right?""

""Absolutely,"" she said, her face glowing with the warmth that always pulled me in.

After dinner, Mary washed the dishes since I'd cooked. I dried and put them away, our usual teamwork.

""I was supposed to meet Jeff and Danny at Art's Bar,"" I said. ""But if you want, I can stay, and we'll rent a movie.""

""No, I'm fine,"" Mary said. ""Really, I'm over it. Go—they're expecting you.""

She walked me to the door, wrapping me in a long hug, her head resting on my shoulder.

""We're doing it right, Mare,"" I said. ""Wedding, marriage, then kids. We've got our whole lives ahead.""

She smiled and nodded. ""Just be careful. You've got a girl at home.""

""I never forget that,"" I said.

I headed downstairs and drove to Art's, Bon Jovi's ""Livin' on a Prayer"" blasting from the radio, still not fully grasping what had just gone down.

I walked into Art's and spotted Danny and Steinberg at the far end of the bar. A pile of seventeen bucks sat in front of them. I tossed my ten on top and ordered a Bud Light.
Their grim faces told me something was up.

""What's going on?"" I asked. ""You two look like you lost your last dollar.""

""Since you asked,"" Danny said, his tone dripping sarcasm, ""you and Stein are putting a lot of pressure on me with Diane. She was fine before you two whipped clowns moved in with your girls.""

""Excuse us for living, Dan,"" I shot back. ""We're twenty-five, not fifteen. Maybe you should try it. Best move I ever made.""

""Oh, yeah?"" Danny said. ""You walked in here with a face so long your chin's scraping the floor. Don't bullshit me—I've known you too long. What happened, lovers' spat?""

""Damndest thing,"" I said. ""I'm getting dinner ready—pork chops, string beans, fresh Italian bread. Mary walks in, pulls me straight to the bedroom. Then it gets weird. She wants me to finish unprotected.""

""What'd you do?"" Stein asked, hanging on every word.

""Pulled out. Babies before marriage? That's not what I signed up for.""

""Good call,"" Danny said. ""You did the right thing.""

""I know. She was pissed at first, but she calmed down. Said she saw a woman with a baby on the train, and her hormones kicked in.""

""How'd you leave it?"" Danny asked, smirking. ""Sleeping at your mom's in your old bed tonight?""

""Nah, she apologized,"" I said. ""We showered together, ate dinner, and everything's back to normal.""

""Yeah, right,"" Danny said. ""If she's got her mind set on a kid, she won't stop. That was just her first shot.""

""I can't even think about kids right now,"" Stein chimed in. ""I didn't want Angie moving in at first, but now I'd die if she left. Still adjusting, though.""

""Well, I'm not you two,"" Danny said. ""I'm Danny, the General. I've got no plans to move in with Diane, and if she thinks we are, she's got another thing coming.""

""Hope you don't lose her, Dan,"" I said. ""You're great together, and I love you both. At some point, you gotta settle down.""

""Not me,"" he said. ""You can grow up if you want. I'm staying a kid forever. I want my freedom and as many girls as I can get. Diane can deal with it or hit the door.""

""What are you, Peter Pan?"" I laughed. ""Little boy who never grows up?""

""Yeah, but he had a cool knife in his belt and could fly,"" Danny said. ""That's my guy.""

I glanced at the clock—10:30 on a work night. Our money pile was down to eight bucks, and we'd said all there was to say.

""I'm out,"" I said, tossing a five for the tip. ""See you guys.""

""Gerry, drop me off,"" Stein said. ""Angie's got a stomach bug. Don't wanna leave her alone too long.""

""Just think,"" Danny called out, ""while you two are sleeping for your ungodly early alarms, I'll be in a Manhattan club, dancing with some city hotties. That's the difference.""

""Good night, Dan,"" I said, pulling him in for a hug and kissing his cheek.

""Give Mary my love,"" he said. ""Angie, too.""

Stein and I headed out. I couldn't shake the feeling that Danny pitied me as much as I did him.

Chapter 10- Hump Day Hustle 

Wednesday—hump day—and I was already eyeing the weekend. I wasn't scheduled to work one yet, but it was coming. At the Broadway CSO, when your turn came for a weekend shift, you got an NS—non-scheduled—day off the week before Saturday and the week after Sunday. AT&T let us work those days for overtime, and with the ten percent weekend differential, you could rake in serious cash.

I settled at my desk, finishing my deli coffee, when Steve and Pete strolled in. They both rode the IRT line and often linked up on the commute.
Gary, our supervisor, slid in behind us, pulling Steve, Pete, and me into a huddle by his desk.

""Got an idea for you three,"" he said. ""There's an empty office on the eighteenth floor, back of the node. How about we use it for afternoon breaks—do push-ups, sit-ups, and chins on a bar I hung in the doorway? I'm thinking of adding a set of weights, too. You guys keep fit, so this feels like a no-brainer.""

We exchanged grins and nodded in unison. I'd been doing push-ups and sit-ups at night since moving in with Mary, but working out at the office with the guys? Total game-changer.

""Alright,"" Gary said, flashing that wide grin of his. ""We start today. Three p.m., half an hour.""

Gary was a ruggedly handsome guy, about forty, in great shape—not quite a bodybuilder, but impressively fit for his age. Married with two teenage kids, he seemed solid. I'd spoken to his wife a few times when I answered his desk phone—sweet lady, real warm.

But the worst-kept secret in the office was Gary's affair with Lorraine, a supervisor from Pre-Service. Pete once called her ""kinda hot,"" and she was—married too, judging by the rock on her finger, though she never mentioned kids. Gary had once told me they had a ""frequent flyer deal"" at a Jersey motel.
Things were getting intense between them, more than either planned, he said. None of my business, but I appreciated that Gary trusted me enough to share.

At 8:30, I plugged in my phone, and one of my extensions flashed red immediately. I picked it up—a Bell South tech from Dallas, dealing with a downed voice circuit. As a long-distance office, we handled the haul between cities. Local carriers like Bell South took it the last mile, from our co-location central offices to the customer's premises.

Across the aisle, Steve was asking Dr. Johnson for help troubleshooting a data circuit for Paine Webber on Wall Street. Doc could be moody—his patience depended on the day—but he was usually cool. He reminded me of a gruffer Garry Shandling, like a stand-up comic with an edge.

The in-charge tech for the month was James Brennan, promoted about six months before us. The gig meant answering the main line, fielding calls from field techs, putting them on hold, and shouting for someone free to take over.
He also managed the ticket lists—New for fresh issues, Pending for ongoing troubles, and Hold for customer callbacks. If needed, he'd escalate to the LECs—local exchange carriers. Not tough or thrilling, but the extra ten bucks a week covered your coffee.

Another tech in the office was Elaine—a little older than us, but with a killer body. She had that shorter Raquel Welch look, a touch of Farrah Fawcett in her hair, and a confidence that made heads turn. Definitely my type—if I didn't already have Mary.

She was cool, too. Big into rock and roll, loved to party. She had an eighteen-year-old son who played guitar and had been twice divorced. That morning, I saw her stroll past me toward Big Kenny. She was a head-turner at first, but after a while, you got used to it.

""Kenny, I heard you're a bouncer at Studio 54—how exciting,"" she said, voice smooth and teasing.

""Yeah,"" Kenny said, leaning back with that easy grin.

""My friend and I would love to get in one night, but we can't stand waiting on those long lines.""

""No worries,"" he said. ""I'm there every Saturday night. Just let me know when and you're in.""

Elaine lit up. ""Thank you so much, dear. I'll talk to her and let you know.""

She brushed his shoulder lightly before heading back to her desk.
Kenny turned back to his trouble ticket, still grinning. The wheels were clearly turning.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little envious—but after the Audrey debacle at 32 A.O.A., I was glad to have Mary and be done with office romances.

The day flew by. Yolanda from Merrill Lynch called, frantic about a loud echo on her massive hoot-and-holler circuit. I sent a quick hot tone to try knocking it out—no luck. This one wasn't going to be easy.

With hundreds of drops on the circuit, I started isolating backbone segments, trying to pin down the bad endpoint fast. After about an hour, I found it: a Seattle office's CPE—customer premise equipment—was outputting hot levels, making the whole system whistle. I blocked its transmit so they could still hear nationwide and dispatched a Pacific Bell tech to sort it out with their vendor.

I called Yolanda to fill her in, and she sounded relieved, promising to get her vendor on it.

Glancing at the clock—2:45.

""Don't get tied up on anything you can't drop,"" Gary called out. ""Gym starts in fifteen.""

I stretched out my ticket log update so I'd be ready right at three.

Gary, Steve, Pete, and I marched to the elevator like a pack of junkyard dogs. On the eighteenth floor, Gary unlocked the door to the empty office. It looked perfect. He'd laid out four workout mats from Herman's Sporting Goods up the block and cleared a corner for a weight set he planned to bring in later.

For now, calisthenics would do. Pete, Steve, and I lined up facing the door, with Gary out front like he was leading Sweatin' to the Oldies. We dropped for fifty push-ups, rested a minute, then another fifty—four sets total. By the end, my arms were jelly.

Next came sit-ups: two sets of a hundred, then two of fifty. Good thing we'd been training at home—starting cold would've crippled us tomorrow.

Finally, chin-ups in the doorway. We managed about ten each, then spotted each other by the ankles for three more sets.

We were drenched in sweat, no spare shirts, and didn't care. The camaraderie made it worth every drop. We toweled off with paper towels in the bathroom, laughing like kids.

The half-hour flew by. I'd thought this job couldn't get any better—but our new gym routine just proved me wrong.

Chapter 11- Past Promises New Possibilities 

I rode the train into Manhattan that Friday morning, buzzing about the dinner the ladies from my old 32 A.O.A. office had planned for me.

I'd told Mary about it, explaining they were throwing it because they never gave me a proper send-off. From how I described them—just friends and coworkers—she had no reason to feel uneasy.

If I'd mentioned Audrey, my unrequited crush, it might've been different. But Audrey had called out my last day, so she likely wouldn't show. No need to bring her up, I figured.

Meanwhile, Angie stood on the 18th Avenue platform, waiting for the N train. She gripped her purse with both hands, knuckles white, unaware of the tension in her grip.

Morning sickness still hit her, though not always in the morning. It was Friday, and still no period. Today, she'd head to CVS for a pregnancy test to find out if she and Jeff were about to become parents.

It sounded simpler than it was. Jeff hadn't wanted to be labeled a couple at first, and he'd dug in his heels against moving in together. Angie felt differently, coaxing him—sometimes gently, sometimes not—until he came around to her way of thinking.

Now, Jeff admitted living with Angie was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was head over heels, and seeing her struggle with what she called a stomach virus shook him. The mere thought of losing her was unbearable.

But Angie was tough, her will like iron. Whatever came next, she'd handle it. And she had Mary, her best friend and surrogate sister, to lean on. When Mary said she and Gerry were there for them, day or night, Angie knew she meant every word.

My train rolled into City Hall station. I grabbed the Daily News and headed east toward 33 Thomas Street.

I was a bit annoyed with Steve. His dentist appointment excuse wasn't adding up—more likely, he didn't want to spend a Friday night with a bunch of ladies who reminded him of his aunts.

Upstairs, I had a good twenty-five minutes to skim the paper. It was Friday, and Angelo owed Mary and me $140 from our weekend bets. We'd probably put some of it on Florida State and Notre Dame tomorrow with Danny.

When Steve walked in, he was griping about how his chest and abs ached from yesterday's workout. He was fit, lean from jogging a couple times a week, but push-ups and lifting weren't his thing, and he was paying for it now.

""Ready for your big dinner date tonight, buddy?"" he said. ""Too bad I can't make it—gotta help my dad move some furniture.""

""Jeez, get your fake excuses straight,"" I said. ""Monday, you said dentist appointment, remember?""

""Oh, right,"" he said, smirking. ""Well, I'm going to my dad's after the dentist. That works.""

""Whatever,"" I said. ""I'll be the only guy there, soaking up all that sisterly affection.""

""Yeah, count me out for that,"" he laughed.

Angie paced the women's products aisle at the CVS on Hudson Street, her nerves on edge as she bought a Clearblue home pregnancy test.
When she stepped off the elevator at her office, Mary was waiting, pacing around Angie's desk.

""Ready, sister?"" Mary said, squeezing Angie's hand.

""As ready as I'll ever be,"" Angie replied.

In a bathroom stall, Angie followed the test instructions. She brought the tray, with a drop of her urine, back to her desk, and they waited the agonizing half-hour to see if it turned blue for positive.

The tension was unbearable. They headed to the cafeteria for coffee, barely speaking, their minds locked on one thing. Staring out the window at a cargo ship gliding into port, they tried to distract themselves.
They gulped down their coffee and hurried back to Angie's desk, where she'd locked the test tray in her drawer.

""This is it, sister,"" Mary said.

Angie unlocked the drawer and pulled out the tray. Mary saw it instantly in Angie's face—the swab was as blue as Angie's eyes. Angie and Jeff were having a baby.

At 5:15 that evening, I stood outside Enzo's Italian Ristorante, halfway between my old building and the new one, waiting for the ladies from 32 A.O.A.

I was the first to arrive. The fall evening was crisp, about sixty-five degrees, perfect for my blue long-sleeve thermal layered over a T-shirt. I scanned the block for any sign of them.

They appeared like a posse from a Western, strolling up the street toward me—Dina, Valerie, Gladys, Maria, and Marta. They were dressed to impress, like they were headed to a catered affair, faces made up flawlessly. It hit me how much I meant to them.

Then, trailing at the back, I saw Audrey in a pink sweater and jeans, looking as stunning as ever.

One by one, they pulled me in for hugs and kisses. Six months had passed since I'd been this close to them, but it felt like yesterday. When it was Audrey's turn, I extended a hand to shake. She brushed it aside, threw her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss on my lips—not like any we'd shared before. This one felt like it meant something.

At the table, Audrey made a point to sit next to me, nudging Maria out of the way. Valerie ordered a bottle of wine for the table, and the waiter returned minutes later with a bread basket and poured our glasses. 

We raised them in a toast to old friends and success.
Audrey leaned in close, picking her entrée off my menu. To anyone watching, we'd have looked like a couple. I tried to act normal, ignoring it as best I could. She looked and smelled amazing, and if I didn't have Mary, I'd have been all over it. But I did have Mary, and that changed everything.

I ordered chicken Francese; I didn't even catch what Audrey got. It hit me how much I'd grown in six months—I'd really moved on.

Two waiters served our food, and we swapped work stories, laughing over old times. Gladys bragged about her ""world's best"" muffins, Dina teased about keeping me in line, and Valerie praised my work ethic. Audrey brought up our date to a Billy Joel concert, raving about what a great time we'd had. I kept wondering who this woman was. Then she started brushing my knee with her fingernails.

The night was a blast. They'd outdone themselves, refusing to let me chip in for the check. Valerie collected the cash and handed it to the waiter in the leather folder.

Outside, we hugged and promised to do it again, the ladies insisting they wanted to meet Mary next time. We said goodnight on the corner.

As they walked away, Audrey looped her arm through mine. ""We're going the same way. Have a drink with me at Tropics Bar for old times' sake.""

I agreed, though reluctantly. It'd been a long day, and I was feeling good but ready to call it a night. It was like winning a game and heading into overtime.

As we walked, she told me she was up for a promotion, replacing Barbara as the word processing department supervisor. I was genuinely happy for her—she'd always been a stellar worker, and the promotion was well-earned.

""You've really changed, you know,"" Audrey said. ""You're not the muscle-bound delivery guy I met anymore. You've come a long way.""

""Come on, Audrey,"" I said. ""I'm still that guy. Maybe it's just the way you see me now.""

""Is there something wrong with that?"" she said. ""Maybe you were always my type, I just didn't see it back then.""

""Audrey, I don't even know what you're talking about,"" I said, half-laughing. ""But I get it. Maybe I wasn't ready to be just friends then, but I am now.""

She locked eyes with me, then slid to the other side of the booth, facing me. ""You really love her, don't you? I could tell the Monday after you took her to see Phil's band in Brooklyn.""

""I've been living with her for six months,"" I said. ""That's a pretty solid commitment.""

""It is,"" she said, her voice softening. ""I think this is the booth where you made out with Helen in front of me that night. Never said it, but I was jealous as hell.""

""I was aching for it to be you,"" I admitted, ""but figured I didn't have a shot.""

""You probably didn't,"" she said, and we both laughed.

""It's funny,"" I said. ""Inside 32 A.O.A., we got along great. Outside those walls? World War III.""

""You're right,"" she sighed. ""At least until now.""

I tossed a ten on the table. ""It's late. I gotta go.""

""I'll have another beer,"" she said. 

""It was really good seeing you, Gerry.""

""You too, Audrey. Goodnight.""

""Hey, Gerry,"" she called as I reached the door. ""I hate you, but I love you. Never forget that.""

""You better love me,"" I said, grinning, and walked out.

Chapter 12- Breaking The News

Angie got home, tossed her jacket over a kitchen chair, and poured a glass of water.
She sank onto the couch, and Lucy leapt into her lap, tail wagging furiously, licking Angie's face as if she sensed a new baby sister on the way. Angie stroked her muzzle, kissed the bridge of her nose, and whispered, ""We're gonna have a baby.""

She skipped cooking dinner, deciding to order pizza once Jeff got home. She wondered if he'd even have an appetite after she shared the news—or if she should call his sister for backup. But no, this was too personal. She'd tell him herself. Jeff had grown so much these past six months. It would be okay.

At 6:35, a key turned in the lock. Jeff walked in, all smiles, pulling her off the couch for a big hug and kiss.

""No cooking tonight?"" he said. ""That's fine—you've worked hard all week. I'm good with takeout.""

Angie took his hand and guided him to the couch. ""Sit with me,"" she said. ""I've got something to tell you.""

Jeff's first instinct was always panic.
""What's wrong?"" he said, face flushing red.

""Nothing's wrong, babe,"" Angie said with a soft laugh. ""Calm down. Jeez, your face looks like a ripe tomato.""

""Well, the way you said 'sit down,'"" he replied, ""you usually do that when you're about to drop something heavy.""

Angie straddled him, settling onto his lap, eyes locked on his.

""Now this I like,"" Jeff said, grinning. ""Gotta stop jumping to conclusions, always thinking the worst.""

She leaned in, kissed him long and slow, knowing once it ended, she'd just say it. With him pinned like this, he wasn't going anywhere if he fainted.

She pulled back gently and blurted it out.
""The morning vomiting? It's not a stomach virus. It's morning sickness, Jeff. We're having a baby. Isn't that wonderful?""

""Wonderful? A baby? I'm gonna be a father?"" Jeff's voice cracked, eyes wide. ""I can barely handle walking Lucy at night, let alone a baby!""

""Relax, will you?"" Angie said, pushing his shoulders against the couch. ""I'll be taking care of the baby. Don't sell yourself short, babe—you're gonna be a great dad and an amazing husband.""

""Husband?"" Jeff nearly choked. ""First I'm a dad, now a husband? What are you trying to do, kill me?""

""Stop being so dramatic,"" Angie said, her tone sharpening. ""Our baby's gonna have a real family, not just a mom and dad shacking up.""

""That's what I signed up for, Angie—shacking up!"" he said. ""You never said dad and husband were part of the bargain.""

""Steinberg, you're starting to piss me off,"" she snapped. ""I tell you we're having a baby—the most miraculous, wonderful thing two people in love can share—and you should be down on one knee proposing, not making me drag you there!""

""Drag me where?"" Jeff said, his voice rising. ""What's next, a sack over my head and a hostage situation?""

""Jeff, we've been living together six months,"" Angie said, her tone steady but firm. ""You fought me tooth and nail at first, but now you lose it at the thought of me being sick. It'll be the same with marriage and the baby. We'll take it slow—City Hall, a week or two, just Mary and Gerry standing up for us. When we get home, it'll feel like nothing's changed. And trust me, Jeff, if you think you love me now, wait till you see our baby. He or she will be our universe, our precious miracle.""

She felt Jeff's tension ease beneath her. He leaned back against the couch, taking a deep, steady breath. Angie gently took his hand and placed it on her stomach.

""A piece of you is in here, babe,"" she said softly. ""A piece of you and me. It's gonna be alright—wonderful, even. I've never steered you wrong. Trust me. I'm so happy to be having your baby.""

""What if I'm a lousy father?"" Jeff asked, quieter now.

""I worry about being a bad mother,"" Angie admitted. ""It's scary, a huge responsibility. But I know I'll love this baby more than anything. Let's start there.""

Jeff kissed the top of her head, then lifted her chin with both hands and kissed her lips softly.

""Okay,"" he said. ""We'll start there. Baby steps.""",1,1761678013.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

I’m on **day 29 (week 4) of 50mg Sertraline (after 3 years on 25mg)** and wanted to see if anyone’s had a similar experience. The med’s definitely helped with anxiety — I’m not ruminating, I’m sleeping fine, and I don’t get those spiral thoughts anymore. Overall, I feel calmer and more emotionally stable.

That said, I still feel **pretty flat and low on energy**. Not sad or hopeless, just kind of emotionally quiet and unmotivated. Coffee also barely affects me lately. I also feel a subtle tension in my body, like I can’t fully relax or enjoy things yet.

A bit of context:

* I stopped Gabapentin about 9–10 weeks ago (was taking it for anxiety/insomnia starting in 2022, but quit cold turkey from a 300mg dose).
* Mild gut issues early on (bloating, softer stools) but they’re improving.
* No major side effects now — no insomnia, agitation, or dark thoughts.

I’m an American living in France, so I can only see a general doctor (médecin généraliste) for now and won’t be able to see a psychiatrist until early January. My GP can adjust medication if needed though.

For now I plan to **give 50mg another 3 weeks** to see if the motivation and energy naturally come back as the med fully stabilizes. But if things still feel this flat, I’m thinking about asking to go up to **75mg** — ideally without feeling more blunted, since I’m a Master’s student and really need that extra drive and focus to kick back in.

For those who went from 50 → 75mg, did you notice better energy and engagement, or did it make you feel duller? Just trying to gather real experiences before talking to my doctor.

1oii2iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miele/comments/1oii2iu/cva6405_coffee_station_not_grinding_beans/,CVA-6405 Coffee station not grinding beans,"Hello, 

Hoping that someone else has had this problem with their Miele built-in coffee station - ours is practically a family member and I can't imagine living without it :-( 

I have a 5 year old Miele CVA-6405 and it has suddenly stopped grinding beans. To date, I have not had a single issue with this machine - and it is well used with 8100 total drinks to date. 

1. The sound the grinder makes is different, as if its running dry/no beans
   1. It has made this sound prior - less than a half dozen times over the past five years - but has always been resolved with a quick shake of the bean container to free-up any jammed beans
   2. It's slightly higher-pitched, and sounds like it's spinning faster than when it works - with a very brief change in tone indicating a bean made it through every once in a while
   3. On several attempts, the waste bin would have about a bean or two worth of very wet grounds and the ""coffee"" coming out was slightly brown
2. There are no error codes being shown
3. I have been using the same brand/variety of beans for about 3 years - Lavazza Espresso Barista Gran Crema. The current bag appears no more or less oily than previous bags (which is not very oily)
4. The grinder setting under the bean container has been set to the middle since I installed the machine 5 years ago.
5. Just prior to this happening, I performed a degreasing and descaling - using Miele products
   1. I then removed the brew unit and thoroughly rinsed it in the sink - as I do each time I degrease
   2. I thoroughly lubed the brew unit with silicone grease after cleaning
6. I am able to use the ground coffee chute without issue, with fully formed pucks in the waste bin after brewing

**What I've tried so far:**

1. Inspected and tested the latch on the bottom of the bean container
2. Shop-vac'd/removed all of the beans at the top of the grinder
   1. I used a very powerful shop vac with a nozzle the same size as the grinder opening - attempting to remove any possible clogged foreign material
   2. I tried using a very small screwdriver to gently try and see if the grinding mechanism freely moved -  it didn't but I don't know that it should or shouldn't 
3. Adjusted the grind settings from fine to coarse and back to fine multiple times
4. Removed and tested the brew unit for proper movement, verified lubrication and rinsed-off any grounds. There were no issues with the fit of the brew unit

I think my next step is to remove the grinding module and inspect for any jams - *after I secure a backup coffee machine.* There's a great YouTube that walks thru the steps.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Thanks in advance for your replies!

1oii2e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiforhospitality/comments/1oii2e6/partnering_with_local_businesses_increased_my/,Partnering with local businesses increased my bookings by 47% - here's the strategy,"I've been hosting for a few years now, and the game-changer for me wasn't another smart lock or fancy coffee maker. It was collaborating with businesses in my neighborhood.

# The numbers are real

Properties that bundle local experiences are seeing 20-47% more bookings compared to similar listings. And get this - you can charge 15-20% higher nightly rates when you offer these packages.

# What actually works

**1. Create simple packages** I partnered with a local taco shop, a walking tour guide, and a bookstore. Guests get $10 off lunch, a 2-hour tour ($40 value), and $10 shop credit. I charge $59 as an add-on. Guests save $11, and I either split revenue 60/40 with partners or keep the margin if they comp the perks.

**2. Co-market on social** Tag your partners in posts, share their content, repost guest photos. Some hosts report 2x engagement increases from this alone.

**3. Make a ""local passport""** I use Canva to design a simple guide with QR codes. It's in the welcome folder and highlights WHY I recommend each spot and who runs them. Guests love it.

**4. Automate the intro** I send an email 48 hours before check-in with my top 3 local picks, what makes them special, and directions. Set it up once in Mailchimp or your PMS.

# Real example that inspired me

There's a vacation rental company in northern Wisconsin (Bark Point Ventures) that partnered with local farmers. Guests pre-order fresh produce, meat, and handmade goods that get delivered before check-in. They've generated over $25k annually for local farmers. One farmer said it helped her pay off her mortgage.

# Why this matters beyond revenue

Look, STRs get criticized for being disconnected from communities. But when we actually invest in our neighborhoods and help guests discover local businesses, we become part of the solution. Plus, guests WANT this - over 70% of modern travelers actively seek out locally-owned spots.

# Getting started

Start with ONE business you actually go to. Authenticity beats perfection. Ask if they'd be interested in a simple partnership - maybe a discount for your guests in exchange for promotion.

**Quick AI tip**: If you need help drafting packages or social captions, try this prompt in ChatGPT:

""I run a \[vacation rental\] in \[location\]. Here are 3 local partners: \[list\]. Generate three 'Stay + Experience' packages with names and descriptions, plus one social caption per package. Tone: community-rooted, warm, not corporate.""

# What I've learned

Community IS the new amenity. Collaboration isn't just good citizenship - it's legitimately good business.

Anyways, I have a new Rapt Pill and wanted to share what I am seeing in real time with all you geek mead makers out there.  I am doing a sack high abv blueberry mead and will be step feeding it- I started at about 1.12 gravity on Saturday, and my plan is to, once it gets to about 1.010 or 1.005, to feed it about half a pound of honey to get it to \~1.020, and then repeat.  If it stalls out, I'll be under 1.020 which is my sweet spot for a fruit mead.  Once I get to the 9% abv, I'll stop the DAP/Fermaid-K and just use Fermaid-O.

I'm writing this from my office- I can access the Pill's data online via a browser and logging into my profile on app.rapt.io.  The pill is locked into my home wifi.  This makes it really convenient for when I'm lazy and want to dream of mead and not work.    

One goal is to see if I can measure the impact of how nutrients impact the fermentation- the Pill informs me of the velocity (how much sugar the yeasts consume per day) and I can see the impact of the nutrients on this velocity.  If I add nutrients and see a downward trend, maybe I can predict the yeast's vitality and know adding sugar will not help/be detrimental to the yeast, etc.  I want to get a best practice of where the velocity should be in relation to everything else going on.  

Note: The pill only records every hour to save battery (I can do more frequently if I wanted).  

Below is the reaction of the yeast to my feeding (first dose of two I plan to give) on day 3 (72 hours post-pitch) of DAP and Fermaid-K.  

I pitched the yeast the afternoon of Saturday, 10/25.  I left it alone for about 48 hours, and then on 10/27, yesterday, at about 9 pm, before degassing or disturbing the bucket, I had the following data points:

* I was at 1.07 gravity, 
* I had about 6% abv in the must, and 
* I had a current velocity (how fast the yeast was eating sugar) of about 13 to 14 points a day.  The velocity is interesting because the day before it was at about 20 points/day, it had a downward trend between 13/14 and was hovering there.

So I degassed the must on the night of 10/27, added the DAP and the Ferm-K and this is the outcome about 8 hours later (ie 9:30 am on 10/28) \[Note: I have two confounding factors here- the impact of degassing and nutrient feeding- both are potentially at play here and I can't rule out degassing from below but my assumption is degassing was minimal):

* the velocity
   *  immediately dropped from 13.2 to 11.4 points velocity for a few hours after degassing and feeding; I think this was because they were partying with the recreational drugs I introduced and stopped feeding a little or the degassing kind of interfered with the velocity (?- I should have degassed earlier and measured the impact without a feeding dammit!).  After a few hours there was a very slight upward trend for about 4 hours, and then at the 6 am mark, about 6 hours after adding the DAP/F-K, it jumps up to a velocity of 15.5 points/day.
   * with the 9 am reading, it's still trending up at a good pace- it is now at 16.9 points/day.  
* interestingly, the gravity WENT UP slightly when I degassed even though I didn't add any sugar (from 1.074 to 1.08-  I think it was due to the stirring released sugar from the bag of blueberries in the must... ?).  

I had a meeting and a made a cup of coffee, and now I still refuse to work, so at 11:30 am, I have two more data points to reflect on: 

* Velocity is at a quick 18.25 points/day!  That's about a 6.5 point increase in about 5 hours.  
* abv is at 7.8% already (DAP tonight might be out and I'll use F-O going forward)
* Gravity is at 1.0613

Tonight (10/28) I need to decide when to add the second dose of DAP/F-K- if I'm at 8% abv, that will force me to add it tonight.  

I am currently at a gravity of 1.0613.  At a velocity of 15 points/day, I'll reach 1.005 in about 4 days and that will be my first honey feed.  If velocity is still high I might do the first feeding on day 3.  

**Question for the group**\- what is the ideal gravity for when to step feed to minimize yeast stress? I've read 1.010, and I've read someone waits to 1.000, but that I think is risky because the yeast might be closing up shop at that point and too late to feed.  So I'm shooting for 1.005 unless anyone has any suggestions as it's a simple half pound of honey to add to keep it at about 1.020 range.  ",2,1761677588.0,mead,5,1.0,False

I’ve used other Philadelphia roasters dark roasts with no issues (Elixir, Rivals Bros, Vibrant) but am wondering if these will be much different.

The last image is the Vietnamese Blend on the top and Vibrant “Old School Espresso” blend on the bottom. They do look noticeably more oily for what it’s worth.",2,1761677572.0,BrevilleCoffee,3,1.0,False

1oihv51,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1oihv51/cant_treat_my_adhd_thanks_to_pots/,Can't treat my ADHD thanks to POTS,"TLDR: My POTS isn't horrible, except for my inability to handle stimulants. It prevents me from being able to fully treat my ADHD, even with my new heart meds, and I am just so frustrated and tired and sad.

I'm honestly really lucky that my POTS symptoms as a whole aren't awful. I've had for as long as I can remember, but I've never fainted, and I've overall been able to function. My blackout vision used to be worse when I was younger. It still happens, but I mostly get dizzy and bad headrests now, especially after sitting or laying down for a long time. I also have to be careful of over exerting myself, which tends to change on the day to day depending on how my other health conditions are doing.

One thing I didn't realize was a POTS symptom was my caffeine/stimulants sensitivity. I was always sensitive, but it started to get really bad around 20. I had to stop drinking coffee, even decaf. And eventually I had to stop drinking tea with caffeine, including decaf. It causes my heartrate to go through the roof, severe diarrhea and stomach cramps, and makes my body feel like it is having the worst anxiety attack ever for hours, sometimes days. I was also diagnosed with ADHD at 20, and began treatment when I was 21. I took Vyvanse, starting at 10 mg. It helped my ADHD, but I felt awful the entire time I was on it. I continued to take it until I got a cold, and stopped while I was trying to get over it, and realized I felt better while sick and off the meds then when I wasn't sick and on them. So I stopped taking them for a while.

I finally started up again a couple years ago, and boy was it so much worse now. I took 5 mg of Adderall, and it caused all the same things as before, but I decided to push through. After a week, I decided it wasn't so bad and thought maybe my body was adjusting, so I tried taking 10 mg. I felt great, my brain was clear, I was getting stuff done, it was amazing. I felt like a normal person. Until it started wearing off and everything went to hell. The next three days my body was in non-stop hyperdrive and I ended up going to the emergency room because I couldn't stop shaking, and my heart felt like it was going to explode, and I kept having to go to the bathroom. My blood pressure was through the roof. They gave me Ativan, and that helped, but only diagnosed me as having ""anxiety"" lol. I do have anxiety, but it definitely wasn't what caused my body to have a 3-day meltdown. I went back down to 5 mg and continued to try to take it slow, but things weren’t improving, even after a year. So we switched me to Focalin, which is supposed to be easier on the body. Same thing happened. It helps my ADHD, but absolutely wrecks my nervous system.

I finally got diagnosed with POTS this year, and my doctor prescribed me Ivabradine and Propanolol. I take the Ivabradine everyday and the Propanolol on the days I take Focalin. It really helps when I take the low dose of Focalin, but my ADHD is really bad and I need to be able to take more, but every time I try things just feel awful. My muscles, my digestive system, my anxiety levels. They just can't handle it.

I hate that POTS is preventing me from being able to treat my ADHD. I could be doing so much more with my life and time. I had all these dreams of what I wanted to do with my life, and I just physically can't do them. It's such a let down. Not to mention, it also prevents me from being able to have things I enjoy, like coffee and tea (I miss Green Tea and Chai), and tiramasu. I had tiramasu a couple months back for my wedding anniversary, the restaurant gave it to us for free. I thought I would be fine because I took the Propanolol. I was not. For the next two days I could barely stand and needed to be by a toilet at all times.

I'm really greatful that the other aspects of my POTS aren't so bad. I really am. But I'm just so done with not being able to treat my ADHD.",21,1761677329.0,POTS,14,0.92,False

I am currently a GC managing interior/exterior renovations for single family homes & multi family apartments in Denver Metro and the Mountains. I am seeing a need for a property management company that does their job. My current clients frequently ask for referrals for trades that can take care of property repairs as their property manager does not have a pool of contractors to call on or their current ones are lackluster to say the least. 

Every single one of my clients would say that I'm highly responsive, my communication is excellent and quality of work is great.

Quick Summary  (Link to my 1st Check-in Post Below):  
   
Diagnosis : keratoacanthoma-type cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (in other words, skin cancer on the temple area near left eye).

50 years old, male, switzerland Height 1m75, 105kg initially (BMI 32.7)

Attempt : 30 Days Hydric Fast

Post #1 - Day 4 Post : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1og195a/30\_days\_water\_fast\_to\_love\_my\_soul\_through\_cancer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1og195a/30_days_water_fast_to_love_my_soul_through_cancer/)  
  
**I am now at the end of DAY 7 (1 hour in from Full 7 days)**

Yesterday was intense, I was travelling and working from 5am to 9.30pm, full day teaching photography  & Creative mindset. Travelled by train (common in switzerland) it was super cold, and super interesting to find myself in train stations filled with bakeries, smell of croissants, chocolate buns, and in the evening sushis, poke bowls, and stuff i could really enjoy eating. Airports / Train stations are the Hell of Fasters 😂 yet was a great test and a good moment, and felt good after that day.

I am in a moment in my life where I wanted to move to the Canaries Islands (go back there to live), and my relation to work, to where I live these days, how my social life is taking place etc. as well as this cancer siding with me for now, So many emotions, reflections, thoughts going through my head.

**Mental vibe:** Today, felt more grounded, good clarity, letting the unknown unfold, open for me, and let myself be open to the magic of what comes along. Nice conversations with family & friends online, and more in a space of allowing and surrendering.   
  
**Fun Story:** i went to get some D3 Vitamin drops (i live in the mountains in switzerland, little sun, Vit D helps for skin cancer too), and my eye was drawn to a panel ""it's time to change jobs"" so I had to laugh about signs & synchronicities. 

**Actions taken:** Been suddenly struck with a need to sort out old clothes, Essential Oils, my home pharmacy, and going for some initial Clearout on the aspects of External reality... letting stuff go, making space for the new... more minimalist, more place to feel, live, move, touch, be present. 

**Good news:** Finally received my Potassium Citrate powder, so I'm adding this which i could not for the first 6 days of my Fast  
  
**Hunger vibe :** I can feel the hunger, now and then, not globally hungry, the body grumbles in the belly occasionally, I noticed the hunger feeling was when I was lacking sodium, so i just take some salt in ma palm and lick it off... i enjoy that better than drinking water with sodium.   
  
I tend to be a bit of a masochist it seems, as I do enjoy looking at recipes ideas, and suddenly was like... how do we make Keto Lemon Curd?  How complex is making a Vietnamese Pho? A cheese Fondue would be nice... So I feel there are not ""cravings"" but I do feel food in a positive way is in my life, even without accessing it... I can talk about the food, enjoy imagining it, feel like ohhh that's sooo good... and still feel love deeply inside for my process and the whole fasting i'm going for. 

How would I enjoy the refeeding and post-refeeding to look like in terms of my new way of feeding myself, based on what I like as type of food, cultural food, and also looking into it being more healthy too. 

**Emotional Process:** Been doing quite a bit of inner work (still not quite enough, yet i'm allowing my process to take part without spanking myself for it). Hypnosis sessions, energy healing sessions, and will be integrating EFT the next days (all tools i'm professionally trained in) and I feel it's really helping me on the process of connecting to my inner truth and the quest for connection i'm in too.

**Physical Vibe:**  The back is pulling a bit (happens to me sometimes) so I'm feeling it's releasing some stuff too, as it wasn't pulling 2 days ago, it comes and goes, and when I relax into it, feel it, surrender, breathe into it... the tension goes away. Mouth taste is a bit ""thick"". Stools still flushing a bit. Urines are still clear yellow...   
  
Overall feeling quite good and just amazed at my body and my mindset is till going strong. 

**Weight :** Not really looking into the weight, as it's not the factor for me, and depending on where i place the scales at home i don't get the same weight. However today I was thinking... i'd like to get back closer to my 80-82 kilos, So this brought the reflection on Refeeding above, and the future maybe Rolling Fasts with OMAD on break days for a few months after this ends.

**Hydratation & Electrolytes:** 

* Water + 1 coffee spoon of salt
* Roiboos, Chamomile tea, Green tea
* Vitamin D - 3000ug (drops) 
* Potassium Citrate (Finally arrived, started today) - 640mg
* Magnesium Glycinate : 480mg 

Am considering adding a Vitamin Complex (set of a-z vitamins) but unsure for now. 

**Final words:**   
  
I'll set aside the few haters, as when we do something good, we polarize and will make people angry, i'm not a pack of rice, and can move and give them love too, they also deeply need a hug. 

Thanks for reading, for the awesome and kind vibes on my previous post, the amazing support, the kind words, and the inspiration on ideas to explore... And looking forward to telling you more in another post for around Day 10.

YES very early I know. Its about gifts and I want to start getting stuff now due to the fact its easier for me to spread my money out. So him and I have a little... war over this. We both try to spoil each other and end up getting each other like 500 thoughtful things. This is also before I DIRECTLY go out shopping at stores. But I want some ideas too! I already got a few things and let me tell you a but about him! S

So first off I MAKE a lot of gifts because I do craft stuff and all of that! So gift crafting im good i have like 8 things... but for like real stuff I kinda struggle? 

So he doesnt like sports, he doesnt like legos, he doesnt really play video games he only plays on on a ipad, he doesnt like cars or bikes, he doesnt like cooking that much like as a passion, he doesnt like building anything like that so all of that stuff is off the table. 

Now he does like and some facts he does MAA and he does workout, he is into anime (I already got one thing), he does like to eat, he loves thoughtful stuff which is why i go out on making gifts but idk what to buy for thoughtful stuff.., he really loves to cuddle, he loves coffee, he does sorta like art stuff and im teaching him how to draw so I already got him a lot of stuff like notebooks which I designed and painted as characters he loves, pens, erasers, sharpers, and all of that stuff. Though I didnt get him markers I dont think he would use them that much so thats why I dont know if I should spend a lot of money on good ones. He loves a lot of characters like..  hes somehow almost into every type of show or whatever he knows everything I always get him something to tease him. LAst time I got stickers of a show which he doesnt like to talk about LMAO ummm but yeah kind of all I can think of currently for like stuff he likes. If im being honest he doesnt really do much- He just goes to college, trains, talks to me the rest of the day and may or may not play a game. Or he watches a show with or without me.   
  
I did get him a few more art things  
i got him a ipad holder   
i got him a coffee mug and im making a coaster along with things he likes for his coffee  
I got him some cool light of a anime character he likes  
Im thinking of getting him some shirts since he barely has any...   
I will get him snacks he likes

Need a quick **crochet coaster** pattern you can actually finish in one sitting?

I’ve got you covered.

This free pattern is seriously simple – no confusing stitches or complicated instructions.

Just grab your hook and some yarn, and you’ll have a cute coaster ready before your coffee gets cold.

Perfect if you’re just starting out or if you need a last-minute handmade gift.



**Materials :**

* Medium weight yarn (cotton works best for coasters), use acrylic if you are using it under porcelain or glass only.
* 4.0 mm crochet hook
* Scissors
* Yarn needle for weaving in ends
* stitch marker (optional)

# 

**Crochet Coaster Pattern Instructions**

**Round 1: Starting the Center**

Start with a **magic ring (MR)**.

Work **(dc, ch1)** \***12** in the MR.

You’ll end up with 12 double crochet stitches with chain spaces between them.

Pull your magic ring tight and slip stitch to join.



**Round 2: First Expansion**

**Ch3** (this counts as your first dc).

Work **another dc in the first ch1 space**.

Then repeat **(2dc, ch1)** in each ch1 space **11 more times** around.

**Slip stitch** to the top of your beginning ch3 to join.

**Stitch count:** You now have 24 double crochets plus 12 chain spaces.



**Round 3: Building diameter**

**Ch3** (counts as dc).

Work **2dc in the first ch1 space**.

Repeat **(3dc, ch1)** in each ch1 space **11 more times** around.

**Slip stitch** to the top of your ch3.

**What’s happening:** Your coaster is getting wider and flatter with each round.



**Round 4: Creating Corners**



**Ch3** (counts as dc), then work **1dc** in the same space.

**Ch1**, then work **2dc** in the same space.

Now in each ch1 space around, work **(2dc, ch1, 2dc, ch1)** – repeat **11 times**.

**Slip stitch** to join.

**Why this round matters:** The grouped double crochets create subtle corner points that give your coaster shape.



**Round 5: The Decorative Edge**



This round creates a pretty scalloped border.

In the **ch1 space that sits in the middle of the 4dc group**, work **8dc**.

Then work **1 sc** in the next ch1 space.

**Repeat** this pattern all the way around: 8dc in the middle space, sc in the side space.

**Slip stitch** to join and **fasten off**.

**Finishing:** Weave in all yarn ends with your needle.

# How to Customize Your Crochet Coaster

# Make It Bigger

* **Use treble crochet (tr)** instead of double crochet for a larger coaster
* Add extra rounds following the pattern logic (increasing stitches in each space)
* Use a larger hook (6mm or 6.5mm)

# Make It Smaller

* Skip round for a simpler, smaller coaster and add corners following the same logic.
* Use a smaller hook.
* Use fingering or sport weight yarn

# Change the Texture

* Use cotton yarn for absorbency
* Try wool or acrylic for decorative coasters
* Experiment with variegated yarn for color changes

# Adjust the Border

* Replace the 8dc scallops with 5dc for smaller shells
* Work (2dc, ch2, 2dc) in each space for a lacier edge
* Skip the decorative round entirely for a simple, modern look

# Tips for Perfect Crochet Coasters

**Blocking helps:** Steam block your finished coaster to keep it flat and even.

**Stiffness matters:** If you want a stiffer coaster, use 100% cotton and block with starch.

**Make a set:** This pattern works up quickly – make 4-6 for a matching set.

**Color coordination:** Use colors that match your home decor or make seasonal sets.

**Gift idea:** These crochet coasters make excellent handmade gifts!

# Fixing Common Issues

**Coaster is curling?**

* Your tension might be too tight – try relaxing your grip
* Block the finished coaster to flatten it

**Edges are wavy?**

* You may have too many stitches – double check your counts
* Try going down a hook size

**Pattern seems confusing?**

* Take it one round at a time
* Use stitch markers to mark your beginning of each round
* Count your stitches at the end of each round

Happy crocheting! This simple crochet coaster pattern is perfect for using up yarn scraps, practicing your stitches, and creating functional home decor.

Twenty-five minutes later, he hops on, clearly disoriented, hair all messy, sipping coffee like he just woke up.

He goes, “Wait, who are you again?”
I remind him. He checks his calendar and says, “Oh yeah, this was supposed to be last week.”

I show him the invite HE SENT. He literally goes, “Oh, weird. Anyway, let’s make this quick.”

He then spends the next ten minutes reading my resume silently while I awkwardly sit there on camera. No questions, just scrolling.

Finally, he says, “Okay, I think we’re good. HR will follow up.” Then he leaves the meeting.

I ended up going to a coffee shop the other day for work and to get out of the house for a bit, and I noticed that they roast and sell their own beans. I thought wow, that’s really cool to be able to pick up locally sourced beans! They had whole bean options, and pre-ground options. I asked them what grind level was the pre-ground, and they said it was for drip coffee. I figured that would be fine, but I asked if I bought the whole beans can they grind them for me, and they said yes. So I got the whole beans, asked them to grind them finer than drip brew, but not as fine as espresso (from my research, that seems to be the best?). Much to my disappointment when I got home and I opened up the bag the next day to make a cup, this is what I saw. Tried to make a cup using the Hoffman method, and it just tasted terrible. 

Any suggestions on how I can make a grind this coarse usable and taste good?",8,1761676591.0,AeroPress,19,0.9,False

1oih8ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oih8ee/rf_tell_me_what_you_eat/,[RF] Tell Me What You Eat,"It had been a week since the bear had left its den in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The sky in the east was flushed by rosy-colored dawn when the commanding animal let out a big yawn and began trotting downhill, towards Interstate 81. She knew she wasn’t supposed to be awake, but the winter had been mild, and pangs of hunger had interrupted her melancholy dreams. She knew all kinds of food were to be had down in the plain, close to where the sea of lights was just now beginning to ebb. She had made the trek twice before, once with her cubs, who had long since moved higher into the mountains. The hunting grounds she had in mind were unlike any others she used to prowl; when she finally reached their outskirts, it was beginning to snow. She held her nose into the wind and immediately picked up a scent.



Susan watched as the battered Corolla pulled into the sloping driveway. Rich, golden flakes drifted through the headlights, reminding her that it was still snowing. It would be much too dark for them to see her waving, but she did it anyway. ""A good hostess never misses an opportunity to oblige, even if some of her finer attempts at giving pleasure are bound to go unnoticed."" Now, where exactly had she read that? It must have been in one of those Southern magazines that sometimes absorbed her so completely that she could barely make any sense of them at all. Much later then, when she least expected it, some ominous passage would rise up in her mind, carrying in its wake some high-minded idea about how to be a better lover, mother, host, or a better woman altogether. The little lessons about motherhood felt particularly weird. After all, she and Win didn't even have kids.



As she traced the Corolla laboring against the incline, coughing up dirty bits of snow and rotten leaves, Susan remembered that moment from – was it three years ago? – when she had turned her husband into the creature from the swamp. At least that's how she phrased it whenever she permitted herself – often against her better judgment – to make a public performance of this, her favorite anecdote. Which, incidentally, happened quite often: at Sunday brunches; during coffee breaks in the lab; even, if only just once, at a bus stop, in the presence of strangers. “One night,” she would say, lowering her voice to a bare whisper, “I turned my husband into the creature from the swamp.” It had happened a few winters ago. She and Win had just come back from some university event – a reception for new faculty members, or something like that. The unpaved section of their little cul-de-sac had dissolved into mud, and before they knew it, they had found themselves stuck – ""stuck,"" as Win had magisterially pointed out, ""in your own fucking driveway."" He seemed to think that getting stuck in one's own driveway was even more humiliating than getting stuck anywhere else.



Maybe if he hadn't been so angry, she would have simply let it go. But she had been driving, and she felt vaguely guilty about the whole damn thing. That's why, when Win got out to get some cardboard to place under the wheels, she had decided that the situation called for one more try. She was convinced that, stepping on the accelerator, she had actually started screaming – out of frustration perhaps, or maybe to drown out the noise of the engine revving up. Incredibly, the car had started to move – in fits, at first, but as she kept at it, it had suddenly jolted free. She had been so triumphant. Lowering the window, she was about to give a little victory speech when she caught sight of Win, cardboard still in hand, covered in mud from head to toe, treating her to a perfect Mona Lisa smile. Apparently, he had come up behind the car just moments before her great escape. Later he would claim that he had actually been struck by the fender, but Susan didn't think that was possible. He had simply been splattered with all the mud that her desperate attempt at getting unstuck had brought up. And now he was standing there, dripping wet, just like the creature from the swamp. It had really been a sight for the gods.



Clearly, her plan wasn’t working.



Win had just served the first course, a sort of bean purée with orange and saffron, topped with caramelized Belgian endive. It was not a great dish – the combination of flavors felt arbitrary, and the whole concoction had “vegetarian” written all over it. Susan noticed that Win was looking over to Rachel – he called her “the animal lover” –, waiting for some kind of acknowledgment. But how on earth was Rachel to know that Win “didn’t do” vegetarian, that he hated the whole idea, that he would have never cooked for someone like her if Susan’s career hadn’t been on the line? When the small woman gave no sign that the food meant anything to her, Win’s face darkened, slowly settling into the sullen expression that Susan knew all too well. She had to look away.



Seated at her right-hand side, John kept a dull silence, his face as expressionless as ever. Wasn’t it astonishing that so many of her colleagues – even those who could argue with grace and hold their own in packed lecture halls – were so inept at talking about anything else than their research? What did that say about her, who prepared a list of possible conversation topics every time she had people over? Oh, damn them all. She would sit here, listlessly picking at her food like some sulky child, making herself at home in the deepening silence until it became all but intolerable. Just like them. They wouldn’t like that. They wouldn’t like that one bit.



Instead she said:



“So, John, Rachel tells me you have an entire room full of toy soldiers.”



He looked up, his eyes unalive.



“We actually prefer the term ‘model figure.’”



‘He must be retarded,’ Susan thought. ‘He must be autistic or something.’



“What do you do with them?”



“Bull Run, Wilderness. That kind of stuff.”



It took her a second to comprehend. “You reenact battles?”



Rachel chipped in, all mock indignation. “The whole Civil War campaign,” she said, prolonging the ‘o.’ “And not just soldiers. Horses, wagons, tents, and what have you. Livestock, too. And prostitutes. Did you know there were prostitutes in the Civil War?”



“No.” Susan tried to sound intrigued.



“Well, there were. And he paints them all, with the tiniest brush. Don’t you, darling?”



“The Civil War was not a campaign, my dear. Jackson’s Valley Campaign was a campaign. The Civil War was a war.”



“But you paint them, don’t you? With a tiny, tiny brush.”



John said nothing.



Susan was still wondering whether the situation needed defusing when Justin beat her to it. Justin was the fifth element – an unobtrusive neighbor, and also Win’s best friend.



“I once went to the Chancellorsville battlefield,” he said, “but couldn’t make any sense of it. I suppose it helps to have it all laid out in front of you.”



John nodded.



“What’s there to be made sense of?” Susan wanted to know. Justin gave her a smile.



“The troop movements. The deployment of the various corps and regiments. Artillery positions. Terrain features: hills, rivers, and the like. Earthworks and entrenchments. Battle lines. Whether the flanks of the defending army are anchored, or not. Vulnerabilities, such as salients. Paths of reinforcement. General headquarters: good decisions, bad decisions. Bayonet charges – not very common at that time, but still. Muskets versus rifles. The Spencer carbine. Gunboats, floating down the Mississippi. The Vicksburg campaign. Grant cutting loose from his supply train to envelop Vicksburg from the south. And then, of course, Gettysburg...”



He seemed to lose his thread. “You know, that kind of stuff.”



Susan looked at John, questioningly. John shrugged his shoulders.



“What he said,” he said.



Susan had to think of the monkeys in her laboratory.



She was still not convinced that she had done anything wrong. Maybe she had been sloppy labeling those videotapes, but she had simply been so tired. Months of teaching classes, writing grant proposals, conducting the experiment, and videoconferencing with her co-authors had left her in a state of near-insanity. When she finally got around to reviewing the videos, the article had already been written and submitted for publication. She had barely glanced at them, relying instead on her memory of the actual experiment. There was no doubt in her mind that her findings were accurate. And yet, it wasn’t long before two of her graduate students wrote her a letter stating that they saw “little to no connection” between the content of the videos and their labeling. They called the labeling “capricious” – those smug little rats. She couldn’t let that stand. Thus, the ugly scene in the graduate student lounge (of all places); the letter to the department head (John); the ridiculous claims of “coercion” and “intimidation”; and, finally, the threat of an internal investigation into her data collecting and documentation methods.



How could she not have seen this coming?



Suddenly, everything was at stake: her reputation as a scholar, the good name of her field of research (animal cognition) – even her tenure at this Southern university, bestowed upon her only recently, and only after the provost had intervened on her behalf. Even if found guilty only of sloppiness, her colleagues would lose confidence in her work, and everything she had ever done would be treated with suspicion. And then what? More investigations, stoic denials, frantic attempts at replication? Halting admissions, conciliatory mea culpas, paper retractions, and indefinite suspension? Impossible. Not after fighting an uphill battle for so long. She had to convince John that the investigation must never take place. But how to reason with a grown man who spent his spare time playing with toy soldiers?



“So John, do you ever … judge them? Your soldiers, I mean. Do you admire their courage, or blame them for their shortcomings? Or is it more like a game of chess, where every figure is expendable and can be sacrificed for the greater good?”



She smiled her most disarming smile.



John stared at her blankly, which only added to her sinking feeling.



“If he doesn’t bite at that…,” she thought.



Once again, it was Justin who kept the ball rolling.



“I don’t want to give offense,” he said, “but isn’t there something very human about it? War, I mean. About the way it transforms people? Take Grant, for example. Before the war broke out, Grant was a bum, pretty much. A failure. In his cups, more often than not. When he built a log cabin for his wife, she called it 'unattractive.' That would drive any man to drink now, wouldn’t it?” Justin laughed. “It was the war that redeemed him. The war was his element.”

Nobody knew what to say. Rachel's revulsion was particularly plain. She looked down into her lap and began folding her napkin.



Finally, Win got up and started collecting their plates.



""Bullshit,"" he said. Clearly, his mood hadn't improved. ""So you're... what? A fucking war hero? Great. Good for you. But it's not because you have this – this secret inner strength, this..."" He scooped up the butter dish, whose contents had turned yellow, glistening, and slightly runny. ""That nobody knows about. Because you don't. That's not who you are. What you are, is, you know, a fucking mess. A mess. You're always at war – with God, with yourself, with everything around you. That's why you succeed at war. Because you're always at war.""

And with that, he withdrew into the kitchen.



The kitchen was gorgeous – a wide-open U dotted by a massive island. Win was busy handling an artichoke, trimming the scales with a pair of kitchen shears.

“Artichokes,” he said. “I’ve always hated artichokes. I don’t know why. It’s like chewing on wood. Did you know that dentures used to be made of wood? It’s disgusting. I always imagine them rotten, somehow, like those rotten tree stumps you sometimes see out in the country. Saturated with saliva. Mushrooms growing on them. It’s like having a whole fucking decomposing forest in your mouth. It’s making me sick, is what it does.”



Justin, who had gone after his friend, was sniffing the bluish-black contents of an aluminum bowl. Win grabbed the bowl and set it back on the counter. ""Chile ancho,"" he said. ""I'm making Paella. With artichokes, god damn it. Of all things. Just because that lady yonder has no stomach for meat. Marriage really changes you, my friend, it really does.""

Justin lifted a small burlap sack and weighed it in his hand. On the label was a happy-looking man wearing a poncho. ""Arroz bomba,"" it said. This time, Win didn't intervene and kept on talking.



""Don't you give me that sympathetic kind of look, as if you knew what I'm talking about,” he said. “Because you don't. I'm not giving you some can't-live-with-them-can't-live-without-them bullshit here. This is serious. Let me give you an example. I've lived in big cities before. New York, New Orleans... That's where we met, Susan and I, did you know that? In New Orleans. We were both students at Tulane at the time. I had a car, and she didn't. I would drive her around town. I had no trouble finding my way around town back then, no trouble at all. Never had to think twice, back then, about that great American river and its serpentine course around the Garden District. That great river guided me well, my friend. But then we moved up here, and everything changed. All of a sudden, I couldn't even make it to the grocery store. Let's go shopping, she says. OK, I say, let's go shopping. The moment she gets into the passenger seat, my mind goes, boom. Blank. Slack. Sapped of all energy. I'm talking all-out, stage-four tabula rasa. I could just as easily sit there drooling. I have to take directions from her like some kind of mule. You see, I simply can't think straight when she is around. It's hard to explain. I know it's not her fault. Maybe it's because we moved here for her sake, when they offered her that great position in the animal lab. I know it was the right thing to do. She would have done the same thing for me. But I'm hurting out here, man, I really am. I keep wondering, where did I go wrong? Where the hell did I go wrong? – Would you pass me the rice?”



Justin gave it to him.



“I suppose I should just get over it. Move on, put it out of my mind. Whatever 'it' is. But here's the thing: I can't get over it. In fact – now, listen very carefully – I'm getting less and less over it.”



Win started pressing the artichokes into the rice, which was itself submerged in the dark-colored liquid that Justin had examined earlier.



“Wait here,” he said, “I have to take out the trash.”



The mixture inside the pan smelled rich and smoky and was slowly beginning to bubble.



When Susan looked up, she saw Win standing behind John’s chair, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. She recognized the old, oversized winter coat that he had worn that fateful night when she had splattered him with mud. Frequently relegated to the Salvation Army bin, the coat had just as frequently made it back into her husband’s closet, mud stains and all. (He had refused to have it cleaned.) Now he was wearing it, proudly it seemed, while the boyish expression on his face told her that he was burning to get something off his chest. But John, oblivious of the other man's presence, was for once engaged in a lively conversation with his wife. That was so Win, she thought – always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Never afraid of making a fool of himself.



The scene reminded her of something she had witnessed about a year ago, at a conference on animal altruism. The keynote speaker, an expert in primate social behavior, had been impressed with one of Susan’s graduate students, even inviting her to spend a year with him and his research team up north. At the end of the day, the student – one of those, incidentally, who would later accuse Susan of academic fraud – apparently felt she couldn’t take her leave without the blessings of her new benefactor. By that time, the conference had moved on into the faculty dining hall, a neo-Gothic nave whose stained glass windows depicted the Stations of the Cross. The student, one of those pretty yet awkward wallflowers that often blossom in all-male environments, was wearing an enormous raincoat that completely obscured her figure. She approached the keynote speaker’s seat from behind, waiting for him to turn so she could say her goodbyes. Unluckily for her, the jovial old man was busy telling an anecdote, flushed with excitement, celebrating his position as a grizzled patriarch in this pack of academics. He kept talking and talking, encouraged by a humble audience spellbound by his booming voice, his roaring laughter, his curious tick of tapping his chest whenever his story took yet another unexpected turn. The student kept waiting, hands behind her back, a dark, shapeless silhouette in a radiant room, a center of stillness in the constant ebb and flow of voices, shuffling feet and clinking wine glasses, trapped like a fly in amber, unable to leave quietly now that she had been spotted from the other end of the table, while the man who could mean so much for her, for her career, for her future life as she envisioned it slowly scaled the heights of his never-ending story, lazily approaching the climax –



Susan felt sorry for her. But what really stayed with her, afterwards, was the strangely portentous nature of the scene, the image of a somber, ominous figure entering the orbit of a man so fully, splendidly, dizzyingly in the midst of life. 'Death and the Maiden,' she thought, 'only in reverse.' And now, Win was acting the very same part behind John, John the Redeemer, John the Sphinx, the man who would decide her fate. How did that make her feel? Well, one thing was for sure: she refused to sacrifice herself simply because the men in her life decided to have themselves a little charade. If one of them were to fall, she wouldn’t intervene. She wouldn’t cover for them. And if she was to go, she wouldn’t beg. She was a darkness in her own right, simple, perfect, and serene. Maybe Win was right when he called her “little death.” Win, who now, finally, had found an opening to say what he had to say. There was a brief moment of silence when all eyes were on him, John having been made aware of the looming presence in his back. Even someone like Win couldn’t miss this opportunity. “There’s a bear on the front porch,” he said.



The bear had expertly removed the lid from the outdoor garbage can and was now gorging itself on a mush of meat and bones, in which Susan recognized the discarded solids of Win’s homemade chicken stock. Having claimed the veranda by marking one of the porch posts upon its arrival, it took little heed of the small group of spectators that had filed into the adjacent winter garden. Susan watched in silence as the bear momentarily raised its head, questioningly, perhaps waiting for its own heartbeat to slowly make its way through the intensive stillness of its thick-set body. When it went back to cracking bones, she felt closer to it than she had ever felt to any other living being. For a moment, she was seeing through the eyes of this great predator, who had roamed the American wild since the beginning of time. Turning towards John, she felt the urge to lick the wet patches that the melting snow had left in her thick, tangled fur. Tomorrow, she would go to him and, if necessary, offer her resignation. After tonight, there would be no harm in doing so. Because tonight, she had understood, once and for all, that she was a huntress stalking her prey.",0,1761675901.0,shortstories,1,0.5,False

1oih2uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Churchgrowth/comments/1oih2uu/grow_now/,Grow Now,"To grow your church you need to have people excited about what the church is doing for them. I can guarantee you that sin is ruining them, so if you teach them how to overcome sin they will be excited. If they are excited about their church, it will be easy to prompt them to invite others. Let's look at Adam and Eve and see what they should have done.

Adam and Eve did not handle temptations. Let's look at how Eve handled them, then let's look at how a fictional “Eva” would have handled them.

Eve assumed everything would be okay. Eva assumed she needed to pray consistently to prepare for temptations. All throughout the day, at least once every ten minutes, Eva prayed:

“Father, keep me from temptation.”

She made it one of her top three priorities in life to “Make doing that a habit.”

Second, satan came slithering over, and he heard nothing coming from Eve's mouth. Her mind was on auto drive. She was open to suggestions. He explained to her how great the apple would be. She ate it. Disaster, destruction, the end of the era.

Third, let's look at how Eva handled her situation.

Eva's habit is drinking. At the end of her work day she knew she had to go to a location right next to her old favorite club. As she drove closer and closer, she started praying her prayer over and over again.

Then, as the workday ended, the man she had her eye on came over to her.

“Do you want to go next door and get a drink,” he asked.

She prayed again, “Father, keep me from temptation,” continuing her habit.

“I would love to get a drink, but I need to stay clear of anything hard right now. I am open to coffee, or a soft drink. Can we go to the place down the street?”

“That would be great,” he said.

Fourth, we need to “know” when temptation is about to rise up. We need to pray our prayers fanatically in those times.

Fifth, fast forward to the next day. Eva's date did not go well. As she was driving home, she was frustrated and depressed. Thoughts of going to the club were swirling in her mind. She began to pray her prayer, but the thoughts continued. She then began quoting her to quitting verses. She quoted them over, and over, and over again. After ten minutes of quoting key scriptures, it was like the Holy Spirit was right there with her. She now knew... she had the option to slip up, and she definitely had the option to say no!!!! Well... she wanted to say no, so she said no. She did not go.

Sixth, we need to have key verses about our habit memorized. When temptation overwhelms, we need to stamp it out with scriptures. Consider searching, “Verses \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” Fill in the blank with your habit. In my searches, I look for Open Bible which often has the top 100 verses for our habits.

Seventh, when I get to heaven, I would love it if Eva would find me and say, “I searched “Verses drinking” so often on my phone, that it started auto filling the whole search even when I just put in the V.

Eighth, what if you were driving and were overwhelmed with temptation? What do you think God would think of you if you pulled your car into a parking lot to search for key scriptures when overwhelmed?

I think that God would send His Holy Spirit to give you a full option to say “No.”

Finally, consider working on these habits as often as possible. The more you work on them, the more you will think about “New habits” instead of the old one.

It is not your job to try to force anyone to quit anything. Tell people, “I am going to preach today on how to quit bad habits. If you want to quit a habit... listen.

I promise people joy when they quit sin habits and start to do God's will. You can promise them that as well, because it is true.

I’m working on a UX design project focused on **solo travelers and backpackers** — especially those who love staying in hostels.

Here’s the idea I’m exploring:  
What if your hostel booking app not only showed dorm options and prices but also **local experiences** offered by the hostel — like **stargazing nights, coracle rides, surfing lessons, or nature treks** — that you could **view and book directly through the app** before your trip?

For example — imagine you’re booking a stay at **Zostel Mysore**, and within the app you see an option to join a **sunflower farm visit in Gundlupet** or a **cycling trail through a coffee estate**. You can just tap to join, and it’s all arranged before you arrive 🌻🚴‍♀️

# The Shocking Truth About the Modern Work Grind

**66% of professionals** have experienced burnout in their current job \[1\], and for remote and hybrid workers, the lines between professional and personal life have blurred into non-existence.

If you’re reading this, you are likely one of the millions caught in the **Productivity Paradox**: the harder you push, the faster you burn out, and the less you actually accomplish.

This endless cycle is not a badge of honor; it’s a failure of your system.

But here is the good news: **Sustainable Productivity** is not a myth.

It is a deliberate, structured approach that replaces the outdated concept of “work-life balance” with a far more powerful framework: **Work-Life Harmony**.

This isn’t about perfectly dividing your time; it’s about integrating your work and life goals so they fuel, rather than fight, each other.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the exact 7-step system you need to implement right now to achieve true **Work-Life Harmony**, protect your mental health, and unlock a level of high performance you didn’t think was possible.

Stop chasing the next productivity hack. Start building a system that lasts.

# Step 1: Define Your Non-Negotiable Core, The Foundation of Work-Life Harmony

Before you can build a system for high performance, you must first define what high performance is *for you*.

For too long, you have let your work define your life.

To achieve **Sustainable Productivity**, you must reverse this.

You must define your non-negotiable core: the activities, relationships, and self-care practices that, if neglected, will lead to burnout.

This is where the concept of **Work-Life Harmony** truly begins.

Harmony is not a 50/50 split; it’s a flexible integration built on a solid, unmoving foundation.

# The Non-Negotiable Habit Audit

You need to identify the habits that directly support your mental and physical health. These are the habits that, no matter the deadline or client demand, you must protect.

* **Physical Health:** Is it 30 minutes of movement? Is it preparing a healthy dinner? Is it getting 7.5 hours of sleep?
* **Mental Health:** Is it 15 minutes of meditation? Is it journaling? Is it a complete, unplugged hour with your family?
* **Growth:** Is it 20 minutes of reading? Is it an hour dedicated to a side project?

These are not optional “nice-to-haves.” They are the fuel for your **Sustainable Productivity**.

If you skip them, you are not being productive; you are incurring debt.

**Actionable Tip:** To make this process concrete, you can use a structured tool like a **Non-Negotiable Habit Tracker**.

This template forces you to visually track the habits that keep your tank full.

By making these habits non-negotiable, you are prioritising the system that makes all your work possible.

You can find a free template and a detailed guide on how to implement this system on **The Sustainable Productivity** blog: [Free Template: Non-Negotiable Habit Tracker ](https://thesustainableproductivity.com/free-template-non-negotiable-habit-tracker-%f0%9f%8c%b1/).

# Step 2: Connect Work to Your Purpose, The Clarity Filter

One of the biggest drivers of burnout is a feeling of meaninglessness.

You can be busy all day, every day, but if you don’t know *why* you are doing it, your energy will drain instantly.

This is especially true for entrepreneurs and remote professionals who have to self-motivate constantly.

**Sustainable Productivity** is impossible without purpose.

When your daily tasks are disconnected from your long-term vision, they feel like a grind.

When they are directly aligned, they feel like progress.

# The Clarity Exercise: Aligning Goals and Tasks

You need to establish a clear line of sight from your daily to-do list to your life’s **Purpose and Goals**.

1. **Define Your North Star:** What is the ultimate impact you want to have? What does success look like in 5, 10, or 20 years? This is your purpose.
2. **Set Quarterly Goals:** Break that purpose down into concrete, measurable goals for the next 90 days. These goals must be challenging but achievable.
3. **Filter Daily Tasks:** Before you start any task, ask yourself: “Does this task directly contribute to my quarterly goals, which in turn serve my North Star?” If the answer is no, you must delegate, automate, or eliminate it.

This clarity acts as a powerful filter.

It allows you to say “no” to low-value distractions and focus your precious energy on high-impact work.

This is the essence of **Sustainable Productivity**.

If you struggle with defining your long-term vision, you need to read the comprehensive guide on finding your direction.

The **Donadaweb** blog offers an excellent resource on this topic: [Purpose and Goals: How to Find Direction and Live with Clarity](https://donadaweb.com/purpose-and-goals-how-to-find-direction-and-live-with-clarity/).

# Step 3: Implement Energy Management, Not Just Time Management

The world runs on the clock, but you run on energy.

Trying to force high-focus work into low-energy slots is the fastest way to feel inadequate and burn out.

**Sustainable Productivity** requires you to respect your own biological rhythm.

# The 4-Part Energy Audit

You have four types of energy, and you must manage all of them to achieve true **Work-Life Harmony**:

1. **Physical Energy:** Your sleep, nutrition, and fitness. This is non-negotiable (see Step 1).
2. **Emotional Energy:** Your ability to manage your feelings and maintain a positive outlook. High-conflict meetings or difficult clients drain this fast.
3. **Mental Energy:** Your capacity for deep focus, complex problem-solving, and creative work. This is a finite resource that depletes quickly.
4. **Spiritual Energy:** Your connection to your purpose and values (see Step 2).

**Actionable Tip:** Track your energy levels throughout the day for one week. Note when you feel most alert, focused, and creative (your “peak energy window”) and when you feel most drained.

* **Schedule Deep Work:** Reserve your peak energy window (usually 2-4 hours) exclusively for your most mentally demanding tasks (coding, strategic planning, writing).
* **Schedule Shallow Work:** Reserve your low-energy slots for administrative tasks, email, and routine meetings.

By matching the task’s demand to your available energy, you maximise output and minimise the feeling of exhaustion.

This is a core principle of **Sustainable Productivity**.

# Step 4: Master Asynchronous Communication and Boundary Setting

For remote and hybrid professionals, the “always-on” culture is the single greatest threat to **Work-Life Harmony**.

The constant pings, notifications, and expectation of instant replies fragment your focus and destroy your mental energy.

# The 3 Rules of Asynchronous Work for Harmony

You must deliberately engineer your work environment to be asynchronous by default.

1. **Batch and Block:** Turn off all notifications (email, Slack, Teams) for 90-minute blocks. Check them only at designated times (e.g., 10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m.). This protects your deep work and reduces context-switching, a massive drain on your productivity.
2. **Use Status and Documentation:** Never ask a question in a live chat that could be answered by documentation (e.g., share the link, automate the reply by creating the documentation or copy/paste a message). Use status messages (e.g., “In Deep Work until 11:30 AM – Urgent only via phone”) to manage expectations proactively.
3. **The 24-Hour Rule:** Institute a 24-hour response time for non-urgent communication. This resets the expectation of instant access and gives you and your team the necessary space for focused work.

**Remember:** You are in control of your notifications. Every time you allow a notification to interrupt your focus, you are giving away a piece of your **Work-Life Harmony**.

# Step 5: The Power of Strategic Under-Scheduling

The myth of productivity is that a full calendar equals a productive day.

The reality is that a full calendar is a recipe for stress, rushed work, and zero room for the unexpected.

**Sustainable Productivity** requires buffer time.

# The 20% Buffer Rule

You must treat your calendar like a freeway: if it’s at 100% capacity, one small accident (an urgent client email, a technical bug) causes total gridlock.

* **Schedule 80%:** Only schedule tasks and meetings that fill 80% of your available work time.
* **Leave 20% Unscheduled:** This 20% is your strategic buffer. Use it for:
   * **Recovery:** A short walk, a moment of silence, or a quick stretch.
   * **Contingency:** Handling unexpected issues without derailing your entire day.
   * **Creative Thinking:** Allowing your mind to wander and solve problems in the background.

This strategic under-scheduling is a powerful tool for maintaining **Work-Life Harmony**.

It reduces the background anxiety that comes from feeling constantly behind and ensures you have the mental space to be present in your personal life when the workday is done.

# Step 6: Create Clear Transition Rituals

One of the greatest challenges for remote workers is the lack of a physical commute to create a mental separation between work and home.

Without this separation, your work thoughts will constantly bleed into your personal time, destroying your **Work-Life Harmony** and mental health.

# The “On” and “Off” Switch Rituals

You need to create deliberate rituals that act as mental switches to transition your brain into “work mode” and “life mode.”

**The Work “On” Ritual (5-10 minutes):**

1. Review your Non-Negotiable Habits for the day (Step 1).
2. Review your top 3 high-impact tasks for the day (Step 2).
3. Open only the applications you need for the first task.
4. Play a specific piece of music or make a cup of coffee to signal the start of deep work.

**The Work “Off” Ritual (15-20 minutes):**

1. **The 5-Minute Brain Dump:** Write down everything you didn’t finish and everything you need to do tomorrow. Get it out of your head and onto a list.
2. **The Shutdown Complete:** Close all work-related applications, turn off your work monitor, and put your work phone (if separate) in a drawer.
3. **The Physical Transition:** Take a short, brisk walk around the block, change your clothes, or engage in a brief meditation. This physical act signals to your brain that the workday is officially over.

These rituals are essential for achieving **Sustainable Productivity** because they prevent mental fatigue from carrying over into your non-work hours, allowing for genuine rest and recovery.

# Step 7: Conduct Weekly and Monthly System Reviews

A system that is not reviewed is a system that is destined to fail.

**Sustainable Productivity** is not a destination; it’s a continuous process of refinement.

You must dedicate time to analyse what worked, what failed, and how to adjust your approach.

# The Harmony Review Schedule

* **Weekly Review (60 minutes):**
   * Did I hit my Non-Negotiable Habits (Step 1)? If not, why?
   * Did I complete my top 3 high-impact tasks each day?
   * Where did my energy leak this week (e.g., too many meetings, poor sleep)?
   * Adjust the schedule and priorities for the upcoming week.
* **Monthly Review (2-4 hours):**
   * Did I meet my monthly goal intentions (Step 2)?
   * Is my current work still aligned with my long-term purpose?
   * Do I need to eliminate any major commitments (clients, projects, or habits) that are no longer serving my **Work-Life Harmony**?
   * What is the single biggest change I can make next month to improve my **Sustainable Productivity**?

By dedicating time to these reviews, you ensure your system is constantly adapting to your evolving needs, making your high performance truly sustainable.

He asked where I was from and I said Northwest Indiana. He said that he felt like so many people he met were from Indiana. So, here we go, shameless promotion time!

On November 15, Good Luck, Bob Nanna (Braid), and The Grool Brothers are playing at my cafe in Highland Indiana. They're all Fest alums. Nectar from Champaign, IL will be there too. (edit: jokes on me, Nectar played Fest 20)

I don't know. Maybe come see some rad Fest bands in a tiny coffeeshop (Grindhouse Cafe). We've got advance tickets if anyone is interested.

Anyway, Fest rules. I've gone most years since 2009. I only missed a few for opening my coffee shop and then the birth of my daughter.

It was so good to see so many like minded people this weekend",18,1761675503.0,thefest,7,0.92,False

1oih1ac,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oih1ac,Help me stop my gf from getting a Nespresso Machine! [550-600],"Hey everyone, I’m looking to surprise my girlfriend with her first espresso setup. She’s in college, so I’m trying to keep it affordable but still good quality.

Here’s what I was thinking:
	•	Machine: Breville Bambino BES450BSS
	•	Grinder: 1Zpresso J Manual Coffee Grinder

Would this be a good combo for a beginner who’s just getting into espresso and lattes?

Are there better pairings or cheaper options that still pull great shots?

Total cost looks to be around $500–$550. Worth it or should I go another route?",44,1761675452.0,espresso,110,0.73,False

I'll start at the beginning:

About 8 years ago I was at a party and met there such a wonderful girl, we had a blast of a time together, danced, talked, laughed it was just great, I would say literally she turned my head. Before I had to go home I asked her about her phone number, so we could see again but she said no, she doesn't want this, which I respected like a gentleman, hugged goodbye and left.
Since we really had fun and everything I asked myself what the reason was, but like said, I respected her decision.
Time passed by and I talked to a friend about a tattoo I was planning to make. She said with this particular I should go to studio XY.
I googled and guess who's studio it was?!
Sooo somehow I never made an appointment with her. At the time I signed in for military service and later on I was in a very toxic relationship. (Wich is gladly over now)
And to be honest, yes I was in a relationship, but I thought every single day about this girl...
Now my old tattoo came in my mind again and I felt now is the time.
So i texted her on instagram about an appointment, and as soon she read my message she followed me and I mean yeah, we just texted about her business and I'm out of the game for too long, so maybe I make something up, but she texts things like ""hihihi"", tons of emojis and stuff and, well... I don't know.
Thats the story so far.
Now what I just want to ask her is:
Does she recognise me after all the years?!
Or am I completeley forgotten by her?
Also, the appointment is next year, there are months between... 
Should I ask her if we can get a coffee one day? Should I wait? Or should I just act like I don't know her? Should I mention anything?
Am I just a creep who's obsessed with a girl for so long for only spending one evening with her?! (I think this is the most important question)

I'm curious about your answers, and since english isn't my mother tongue I hope I didn't made up any misconseptions.

Oh and if you are the girl and somehow recognise me because of this post, please let me just act as if I'm dead.",1,1761675449.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I’ll text you good morning, send a meme five minutes later, and probably make you laugh before you’ve even had your coffee.

Not the “hey wyd” type — I’d rather ask how your day felt or what song you’d play if the world went quiet for a minute.

I like slow mornings, messy hair, and conversations that make time disappear — the kind where you forget your phone because the chemistry’s louder than the silence.

I’ll walk you home just to stretch the moment, compliment you like it’s second nature, and still leave you wondering what’s next.

I’m drawn to confidence, warmth, and people who laugh with their whole face. Bonus points if you can flirt without words — because tension is a language, and I’m fluent.

Coffee, chaos, or quiet nights — I’ll match your vibe.

Just don’t ghost me like my abs did. ☕👻
