I’m into deep convos, music, movies, video games, cooking, animals, and probably way too much weed (but hey, I’m chill about it – not a personality trait). I’ve got longish dark brown hair usually in a bun, glasses, a beard, some tattoos, and piercings if that paints a picture. 5’8”, 220 lbs, warm vibes.

I’d love to find someone local who wants to hang out often – hit up coffee shops, explore new spots around the city, have cozy nights with good food and music, maybe get lost in a record store or park. If we vibe and something romantic blooms, awesome – if we just become close friends, that’s just as good.

If you’re in or near Pittsburgh and any of this resonates with you, drop me a message. Let’s get to know each other and see where it goes.

1jt38tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1jt38tj/first_time_in_maui_trip_planning_help/,First Time in Maui - Trip Planning Help,"Aloha! My partner and I are visiting Maui on Thursday, May 1st and will be staying in Kihei for 4 full days. This is our first visit to Hawaii. I’ve been working on an itinerary and would really appreciate some local advice or tips from those who’ve been recently, especially regarding driving routes, traffic patterns (weekdays vs weekends), and timing.

Here’s what I’m hoping to fit into the trip:

⸻

Day 1 (Arrival Day, Thursday May 1st)
	•	Landing at OGG around 10 AM then pick up rental
	•	A relaxed lunch and then check in at 3 PM in Kihei 
	•	Drive to Halekala Summit for Sunset viewin and then dinner.

Question 1) Is this a good use of a partial first day?

⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻

The Main Days (Need help ordering these)

	2.	Road to Hana + Pipiwai Trail
	•	Plan is to start very early from Kihei, grabd breakfast and coffee on the way, grab banana bread from Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread, go all the way to Pipiwai Trail, hike, and stop at Waiʻānapanapa State Park on the way back for 3 PM reservation. 

	•	Since the back road (Piʻilani Hwy) is closed past ‘Ohe‘o Gulch, we’ll need to backtrack on Hana Hwy

	Question 2) which place would you recommend for a great coffee?

       Question 3) Best day of the week to minimize local commuter traffic and tourist congestion? I understand that locals use this hwy to get to their work and is part of their daily commute. So I would definitely like to avoid it on Friday. Am I thinking this correctly?

⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻

	3.	Kahekili Highway Clockwise (Kāʻanapali > Waihee-Waiehu)

	•	We’ve heard it’s narrow and partially one-lane, so we’ll drive clockwise to stay on the mountain side
	•	Planning to be cautious and respectful, not blocking driveways or getting out in tight areas

	Question 4) Any recent conditions we should be aware of? Is it okay to do this on Friday or Monday? I am asking from not disturbing the POV of local people's commute. I am not sure if this highway is used by locals on daily basis to get to their work, other needs etc.

⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻

	4.	Second Road to Hana Day (for missed stops)

	•	This would be a lighter day just to explore more stops we missed during the Pipiwai Trail trip
	•	Thinking of spots like Ke‘anae Peninsula, Garden of Eden, Twin Falls, etc.

Question 5) what other places to see on this Hwy?

⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻

	•	Both of us can’t swim, but we'd love to try a snorkeling or beginner-friendly scuba activity while on Maui.
	Question 6) What’s a safe, beginner-friendly beach or tour you’d recommend for non-swimmers?
Would prefer something guided or supervised — any beaches, companies, or tours that specialize in helping total beginners?

⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻

Other Questions:
	•	Any must-see spots I should combine or swap?


We’ll be driving a rental compact car (Civic or similar), and we’re comfortable with mountain roads — just want to be safe and courteous.

Mahalo in advance!

1jt38re,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jt38re/im_the_reason_a_creep_has_no_family_degree_or_job/,"I'm the reason a creep has no family, degree, or job, and it's satisfying (even though I  probably shouldn't be so gleeful about it).","Hi Charlotte (and all other redditors reading this), 

Your stories (especially all of the wedding drama and petty revenge tales) are the highlight of my day. I'm fully guilty of waking my roommate up at midnight a couple of times with my cackling. This is a slightly long one, so stay tuned. Also, please forgive my grammar. English is not my first language. 

I (26F) knew this dude in the freshman year of my undergraduate degree (I was 18 at the time; this was in 2017). He had approached me in class because he needed math tutoring and kinda stuck around. In return, he'd buy me coffee from the cheap, on-campus cafe (I did not have many standards at the time; I do know better now). In a few weeks, he was in my DMs, making corny jokes (including NFSW jokes). I made the mistake of paying him attention (aka opening his texts, though I never actively responded to anything that wasn't related to tutoring), and his ""jokes"" started getting worse. 

I was like, ""Meh, what a dumbass"" at first, and then his whole demeanor started raising alarm bells. He started boasting about how much he spent in a week as he bought me coffee (he came from a family that owned a transport and logistics business, and they were all loaded - while I was just a shrimp trying to stay afloat freelancing). 

He'd boast that he was just there for the degree certificate - his dad would hand him the family business as soon as he had a Bachelor's degree. He would blow up my phone if I did not respond to his texting and make comments like, ""I hope you're not texting other men"" (which included my dad - for reference, I lived halfway across the country from my parents at the time). He hated my friend group because most of them were guys (there were 8 guys and 1 girl, excluding me from an informal coding club - 100% green flags, all of them). He'd rant about how girls only wanted his money and how ""I was different"" or ""Not a gold digger"" or ""Not a hoe, if only I did not hang out with the guys"" (I was a nerd that was constantly in baggy sweats and giant af headphones blaring almost all the time - my friends and I mostly communicated by making faces or raising eyebrows and gesturing). 

He also tried to spread rumours about my friends (we were all nerds, so it wasn't like anybody actually ""knew"" us) - and tried to tell me stuff like, ""You know those tech bros you hang out with? They're just trying to get in your pants by acting like your besties."" He'd insist that he was ""a nice guy"" who ""wasn't trying to take advantage of a girl like me"" and that my friends weren't.

He'd already convinced the Head of our Department that he absolutely could not do without the tutoring, and the HoD would just plead in my general direction to ""Just help a guy out."" The contents of these ""tutoring sessions"" had long begun to diverge from actual math to his ranting (think, incel ranting, but irl instead of on the Internet). 

In another month, he was going around telling people he was my boyfriend. My friends took a look at me and called out his bs as soon as he tried to pull that on them. They warned me that he'd likely try to escalate into dangerous territory. And boy, did he escalate. 

He was texting me *all* the time - like, in class, outside class, at 3 in the morning - you get the picture: almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He'd go on long rants about how terrible his ""crazy exes"" were, ""how much he loved me,"" ""what he'd do to me in private,"" a whole uncomfortable lot about his kinks (very few of which included his partner's consent), et cetera. And if he did not get a response, he'd call me till I did (or write long texts cussing me and my friends out or threatening my or his own safety). He tried from a different number or social media account every time I blocked one. 

And if he wasn't texting me, he was trying to get me alone. He'd wait outside classes, in the parking lot, in front of the library, at the cafe, by the women's dorms (we were in a fully residential program with gender segregated dorms). He knew my schedule and tried to follow me around, badgering me and demanding my attention. At some point, he was trying to find my family on my socials and contact them because I wasn't responding to him (good thing none of us follow each other anywhere - we all have vastly different interests and can just call each other every time we want to talk). Good thing my friends were the biggest green flags ever. 

They'd accompany me everywhere - and I mean everywhere. I was *never* without at least one of them around me. The girl would walk me to the bathroom and back, and her roommate swapped rooms with me so that I could stay with my friend for a few days. The guys took over my phone and let me use one of theirs to call home and stuff. They'd take any phone calls or texts from him and head him off. They recorded him loitering outside places I was at (there were clips of me walking out of the location and him trying to follow me) and actively stopped him from actually following or talking to me. We even got screenshots of his ""jokes,"" threats, and ranting. 

It took us a while to gather foolproof evidence of his creepy behaviour, but we finally had enough for it to be irrefutable and sent it all in an email chain to the professors in our department, the HoD, and everyone in the chain of command above him. We even had copies in our personal inboxes. I was called in to testify more than once, but I had receipts, including my texts saying ""no, get lost,"" multiple times, so it wasn't like anyone could twist the situation sideways. Anywho, the dude got expelled and blacklisted. I changed phone numbers and social media handles, and now have an ironclad ""do not contact policy"" (aka I have software installed that blocks any unknown phone numbers from texting or calling me and an extensive block list on my socials). I did not have to see or hear from him ever again. 

Until now, that is. He found my new IG and texted me from his friend's handle last month. Apparently, he was disowned by his family after he got expelled, and now works as a sales rep for a small, dying startup. He tried to apologise profusely for his previous behaviour, told me a sob story about almost being laid off and asked me if I could refer him to where I work. For reference, I'm now a Data Scientist with a mid-sized investment firm and have sway with the top management here (i.e., my work directly influences top-level decisions and I get to sass CEOs for a living).  

Two days after his texts, HR tells me someone has applied to the company and provided my name as a reference and asks whether I know the guy (and lo and behold, I do). I showed her the receipts from all those years ago and went right back to work. I don't know what she told him, but he was back to cussing me out that very evening. The CEO of the company (i.e., the boss of my boss) saw what he was texting, quietly had me send him, HR, and legal screenshots of the current chat and the previous evidence, and forwarded it to his current employer. 

He's been blacklisted by a few companies he applied to the last I heard, and is having trouble with background checks almost everywhere else (given his college and previous employers refuse to defend him). I think the CEO had a few words with him, given I haven't heard back from him directly after that went down. So, yeah. I'm the reason someone has no family, no degree, and no job.

Went through academy 6 months ago and sometimes I make small mistakes. Like not remembering something in a compartment on the engine or command etc. I find myself working so much out of work because of the low pay. I’ve been on 4 calls in 6 months. All med calls, I understand that I should know where everything is by now and what not, I feel like if I made more money I could be more focused on my department. I feel like the days run together and when I slightly mess up I get ridiculed relentlessly. I’m ok with it but I’m starting to question leaving my job I had. Some of the guys here are awesome but the shift I’m on damn it feels like I live with a bunch of 13 year old girls. Putting others down when one leaves the room and the other comes back. I understand that’s part of life but damn it gets old quick. Today we raced to put on our gear and SCBA. I messed up then ran it back again and beat the time. Now I’m told to take my gear home and practice at home. What im trying to say is I’m just not loving it like I thought I would the negativity, complacency within the station is just starting to wear me out. I have three little girls and they are even noticing I’m tired and mentally beat down. Im in my thirty’s, and trying to not leave. I know the first year is hard but if I’m not doing something multiple times I loose it. I wish we trained more and ran more calls but that’s not gonna happen. I thought the fire station is brother hood and bringing someone up these guys just wait for you to mess up and bring you down in a second. Plus I’m getting tired of pouring there coffee and folding there laundry I’ll scrub the shitter but damn if we trained as much as we watched tv or cleaned I’d be better. When I ask to train they just say it’s yo to you I get that but I can’t pull the engine out to pull a pre connect without the drive and they don’t wanna get up. I probably sound like a bitch but damn I’m starting to get over it.

1jt36a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1jt36a2/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting?,"Hi Everyone,

Warning: this is a very long story. 

I recently got married to my husband in September, but we’ve been together for 7 years. I’ve seen his parents, now my mother and father in-law once a year for about 5 years. Every time they’d visit, they would stay for a week and we would have a really nice time. At the time, my now husband and I lived in a small apartment, so they would stay in a hotel down the road from us. During these trips, we would make it a point to request some time off of work, go on a little road trip, show them around town, it was really nice. I’ve made comments to my husband when they’d leave that I genuinely would miss them.

This all changed when my husband and I bought a house. On my husband and I’s 6th year of being together, we decided to finally buy a house and settle down. First came house in January, then came marriage in September. Everything was going so well. We were so happy in our new home, we were finally starting to get settled in, and then not even 4 months into owning, his parents decided to just come and stay with us for 2 weeks without asking us. While they did discuss it with us, it wasn’t a matter of “can we”, but rather “we will be”. My husband did have a talk with them about how he’d really appreciate this being talked about more next time and about how this is way too soon after we just moved in and are still settling into our new home. 

These two weeks were a nightmare. It was so last minute that my husband and I couldn’t request any time off, all we had was our scheduled 2 days off, we were both working 40-55 hour weeks, it was May in Arizona which is HOT, and I, being a chef, was expected to come home and cook every single night. Not by my husband per se, but just because I already make a little something for my husband and I already every night so that we can save some money and I can make us something a little healthier than takeout or what ever. Besides the point. For 2 weeks I worked, I cooked, I cleaned, I put on a fake smile, and I never received a thank you… all I received was a side of my in-laws that I had never met before. The ultra critical side of them. They nit picked everything my husband and I did, it got to the point where my husband cracked and told them they needed to go stay somewhere else at least for a night because we needed a break. So they did. We got one glorious Monday night off. 

Finally, we’re on the last week of their trip. And I’d like to mention that they’d been talking about how it would be nice to “one day snowbird in Arizona” for the entirety of this trip. My husband and I, being utterly irritated with their presence just stayed quiet, trying not to say anything we’d regret. Turns out, the entire time my husband and I were working, they had been working with a local realtor touring homes near us. We live in a relatively small town in Arizona. They could’ve looked anywhere else in this great big state. Flash forward to the end of the trip, they were putting in an offer on a house 15 minutes away from us. While it’s not up to my husband and I where they buy a house, this was still pretty shocking to us, considering they had been living in their state for many years. 

Flash forward another 2 months, it was time for them to close in their new winter vacation home and they have the audacity to invite themselves to stay with us again, telling us “this time it’s only for one week, so we’ll be out of your hair in no time!” Thank goodness, my husband said “sorry, no. You’ll need to stay at a hotel this time.” Call us rude, I don’t care. 

Here we are, an entire year later from them buying their house, and they are driving me absolutely insane. We see them once every other week which is my husband’s choice, not mine. They are constantly complaining about how that’s not enough time. My husband does not want to even see them once every other week. If it was up to him, he would visit them once a month. I had to kind of guilt him into seeing them a bit more. I just feel bad because I know they’re getting older and I know they’re retired and they want to see their son.

When they see us, it’s like they don’t want to see me at all. They say hi to me, but when I start talking, I see their eyes glaze over. They tell me they don’t really know anything about me, but they never ask me anything about me. When I try to share something about myself, I get cut off or ignored. My husband tries so hard to include me or talk about me but they might as well say “yeah yeah, anyways” and shoo me away. Sometimes they’ll ask if we can do something a certain weekend with them and Sean will say “oh no, she(me) has an event this weekend” and they’ll respond with “okay, so you can go though!” As though we’re not a married couple. His mom has also accidentally called me his girlfriend a couple of times after we got married. Oh well, that could just be a mistake. 

I’d like to make it a point that his mom has also NEVER complimented me before. Both his mom and dad regularly compliment my cooking and baking, but his mom has never once complimented anything else about me. In fact, she’ll make comments I.e one time, I wore earrings to dinner that were shaped like cherries and she said with a slight look of disgust “are those cherries?” And I said “yes, they are!” And she, with a frown still, said “hm..” she makes comments like that all. the. time. To me. I have to say that my father in law does compliment me regularly. He is a very intense guy, but does comment on me being a pretty young lady, nicely dressed, etc. Maybe this upsets her? 

I compliment her all the time. She is an amazingly talented woman and I think she was a really great mother who raised a fantastic son. I am nothing but nice to her, even when she takes her jabs at me. I always offer her coffee, tea, water, cookies, anything to make her comfortable. I make them nice meals when they visit, I clean the house, I buy nice bottles of wine and good beer for them. I bring back souvenirs for them. I tell them how much I love their son. 

So what the hell am I doing wrong?

1jt34u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jt34u2/i_thought_we_would_be_forver/,I thought we would be forver,"I don't know how to word this but I guess I just wanted to pour my heart out for strangers. Maybe it is a coping mechanism I rely on.

My boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me a week after our 1.5-year anniversary, back in October 2024. It was sudden. Abrupt. I didn’t see it coming.

  
At the time, I had just started medical school and was struggling to adjust, to find my people, to find balance. I leaned on him a lot. I needed support, advice, someone to hold space for me. (I am still so grateful for him). He was going through his own hard time too. We were both trying to be there for each other, but I think it became too much for him. One night, he said I needed to love myself more and just like that, it was over. I never got to see the cat we adopted together again.

The breakup wasn’t messy—it was quiet, almost confusingly so. I still don’t fully understand why it happened.

  
I’ve accepted that people come with their own challenges, and there’s rarely just one person to blame. Still, even now, I find myself wondering: *Why couldn’t we try to work through it together?*

We were in love, happy, and genuine. I dreamed of waking up, having coffee, and having deep conversation together. I dreamed of going home to him, cooking and having dinner together, and going to bed with him. I dreamed of good night and good morning kisses. I dreamed of forever us. Yet, butterflies and rainbows and unicorns didn’t cut it. We parted ways.

It’s been six months, and I’m still grieving—not just the loss of him, but the loss of what we shared, the life we imagined, and the person I was when I was with him.

  
I’m holding space for all of that now. The memories, the promises, the lessons. They mattered. He mattered. And maybe, someday, this too will feel a little lighter.",1,1743969933.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

1jt32nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1jt32nv/lowno_tyramine_diet_has_changed_multiple_aspects/,"Low/no tyramine diet has changed multiple aspects of my life, including migraines.","I've been trying this out for a month before I posted. I know it's been a month because I'm about to start my period and I'm still feeling good so I wanted to talk about it!

I've been getting migraines (I always thought bad headaches) all my life. Recently, now in my 30s, I've been getting them weekly at least and they were starting to last multiple days in a row. I couldn't find a trigger. I would scour this sub for answers. Until I saw a thread and someone suggested the ""Heal your Headache 1-2-3 Program"" by David Buchholz. In the book he talks about tyramine containing foods being a problem. 

I dove deeper and got a book called ""The Tyramine Intolerance Handbook"" by Christine Hartman. She goes a little further and at that point I decided to go all in. 

First of all, I haven't had a migraine put me down and out for about a month. I've have some try and rear their ugly head but they haven't reached the usual 6/10 pain. Maybe like a 2 or 3 at worst. Even now, before my period, I'd be on the couch, but maybe a 2 pain now?

Second, I am quite a smelly person. Like really bad BO at the end of the day no matter what I did. Also my feet tend to really get smelly quickly. I just went all weekend with out deodorant (just doing chores around my house I try not to be gross in public 😂). And stunk a normal amount of at all. My husband usually says I start smelling like a jersey mikes by Sunday afternoon. He can smell it from across the room. Not recently though.

Third; I used to wake up in the morning feeling so sick. Nauseous. To the point I would gag at the sight of breakfast despite me feeling so hungry. At best I would finally have an appetite at dinner. Now, I'm actually hungry again. It's mind blowing.

Fourth and really the one that makes me want to cry, my mood has been so steady. I guess you could say that the pain from the migraines was putting me into a depression which very well could be. But even when I didn't have head pain, I was sad, unmotivated, distant with coworkers and friends, on the verge of tears at all times, my libido was non-existent. I would come home and let it all go toward my husband and it was really getting in the way of my life. But I feel like a human again. I cleaned out my garage this morning and felt amazed that I would have never felt up to doing that last year. Amazing.

I'm someone who has a lot of food sensitivities so cutting out a little more and trying to figure out recipes didn't really intimate me but I would strongly encourage people who think it might be linked to food, to give a low or no tyramine diet a shot. What do you have to lose??    

The foods I love but haven't eaten all month (or very small amounts)
- aged cheeses (still have ricotta, cottage cheese, babybel cheese, milk)
- sausages, bacon, leftovers more than 1 day old
- chicken broth (still trying to figure out how to keep this in), soy sauce, red wine vinegar, etc
- nuts, peanut butter
- bananas and avocado 
- wine, beer, alcohol, coffee, and seltzer/soda 
- I think artificial sweeteners? 

TL;DR try a low tyramine diet. ",1,1743969779.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

The fluorescent lights are buzzing with the quiet rage of neglect, and I, a hospital wall, age 74, cracked in three places and suspiciously damp in one, am just minding my business, absorbing the emotional wreckage of another day in hell.  I haven’t been washed since 1986. There’s a faint outline of a “Hand Hygiene Saves Lives” poster that fell off in ‘09 and was never replaced. And in my top left corner? A particularly stubborn patch of dried c. diff that’s been clinging on like a bad residency match. 

The halls smell like burnt coffee, moth balls, crushed dreams, and the faint musk of someone who hasn’t slept since pre-rounds. A medical student stands quietly leaning against me. They’re nose deep in notes, muttering “infraspinatus... infraspinatus...” like it’s going to unlock some kind of clinical third eye. I can feel the anxiety radiating through their unwashed white coat, years of education, thousands of dollars, all coalescing into one fragile human sandwiching themselves between me and the slow death of their dreams.

Then I feel it. A shift in the air. The kind that only knows one antibiotic by the name of ancef.

Thump. Thump. THUMP. Each step louder than the last, echoing through my tiles like someone walking with a superiority complex and slightly too large shoes. He turns the corner at terminal velocity, 6’3”, 240 pounds of pure lumbar lordosis, Patagonia vest flapping through dim lit walls. 

IMPACT

The student drops like a loose pen during a pimping session. Their notes go flying, one sheet sticks to me (hello again, rotator cuff). Another floats down next to the C. diff corner. And then the weirdest part, the student starts apologizing. Like they’ve just slapped his mother. The attending looks down, all broad shouldered and mildly inconvenienced, and delivers a stare that causes even the asbestos in me to tremble. 

He mutters something about a misspelled “infraspinatus” like it’s a felony.  The student, still collecting their loose papers, slowly leans back against me again. I try to comfort them. I stay standing. Because I’m a hospital wall. Ive held up fuming surgeons, the tears of interns, and residents shattered dreams. And today, I held up one med student’s last ounce of dignity.  

Stay upright, kings. And if you lean on me, maybe bring a disinfectant wipe. ",4,1743969683.0,medicalschool,0,0.7,False

If I tell my mother I need her to respect me more in my home?,"I (38 f) and my mom (63 f), have a great relationship! We talk on the phone nearly every night and she recently has been helping me clean/reorganize my house. I really appreciate the help she (and my step-dad) have given me. I have been diagnosed with Chronic fatigue (2018) due to being anemic also with HIV (diagnosed in 2014) and because of my divorce I've had to go back to work to pay-off my ex-husband which forced me to file for bankruptcy and my monthly payment is $880. I get a medical retirement but with the bankruptcy payment it would be nearly impossible for me to live just basically without getting the part-time job. 

My average day is waking up having my 20 oz cup of coffee, resting, laying in bed/on the couch, taking a shower, going to work for up to 5 hours (as a waitress) and come home, eat dinner with my Dad (mom and my dad got divorced over 15 years ago) and go to bed to do it all over again.  So All this to say I don't have the ""energy bank"" to deep clean my house, I have just enough to keep up with my laundry, and dishes that I use and little things like this while trying to work. It takes me at least a day to get my energy back after working and it is a struggle to even go shopping (over an hour away, yes I live in the middle of no where and the local market is too expensive for basic things: over $5.00 for a 1/2 gal of milk, $9.00 for a carton of eggs, $5.00 for a loaf of bread.) 

So here's where I need the advice: My mom has been coming over to my house (they live an hour away and stay at the house they inherited from my grandmother passing) from Thursday-Sunday sometimes Monday. I am a cigarette smoker. I smoke in one room in my house with the windows open (I know the smoke doesn't stay in the one room, and I am nose blind to the smell of smoke in my house) but EVER TIME my mom comes over I hear a loud ""WHEWWW!!"" and hear the bottle of air-freshener going off to the point of being able to taste the air-freshener when I breathe in. She knows I smoke, it's not a secret. And she never did this or said anything like this when she goes over to other relatives houses that smoke. She does this EVERY TIME!

She has also made comments like, ""Well I just wish you would quit smoking."" (I understand and agree) ""Now that your Aunt has quit, it's your turn"" (I understand, but I'm not ready to quit).

 But lately the comments have turned to other things that have made me feel belittled and even mad. 

I have always has dental issues because of how I was born and have been told by dentists my whole life that because of being born with a cleft-pallet and being a small petite female I just have too many teeth and not enough room for them, so I went to a dentist who talked me into having the perfect smile by getting all the teeth pulled and getting dentures (I agreed with him because it seemed easier than spending $$$$$ on all the dental to get them straight/implants for the ones that have been pulled, but it was the worst mistake I've ever made) and the dentures don't fit right, so I only wear the top piece to work, and when I'm home it's just me and my dog and cats so why bother? But when she comes over it's the first thing she says, ""Oh you're not wearing your teeth."" A few weeks ago, I had to call the electric company because the strong winds, and also the age of the bracket that holds my electricity line from the pole to my house was falling off my roof and the man from the company was sent to my house because of the possibility of it falling and 1) starting a fire, 2) electrocuting someone/one of my dogs, and my mom was here and I went out to talk to the guy and her reaction was, ""You're not putting in your teeth? What if he's your future husband?""  (Sorry I'm more worried about my house burning down and or my dogs getting electrocuted than getting a husband)

I have my hair cut short mainly because of my chronic fatigue, but also because during the summer my job only has a swamp cooler and it never keeps the work space cooler than 75 degrees. It's easier to take care of, wash-towel dry, comb and done. She has made the comment, ""When you are done with the bankruptcy and you quit your job, it will be so nice for you to grow out your hair, but I know it's because of your condition that you keep it short, but it will be so nice to see it long.""

These comments are starting to get to me. WIBTAH if I ask her to start respecting me more in my house? I know she is my mother and cares about me but this seems like she is picking apart things about me that she has never done before. I really appreciate the help she has been giving me but how much ""disrespect"" do I have to take?",1,1743969675.0,ComfortLevelPod,1,1.0,False

1jt307b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jt307b/ms_the_pro_bono_lawyer/,[MS] The Pro Bono Lawyer,"**1. The Dead Girl**

Dick Berryman stood over the small, sheeted body of the girl who had been his client. Her brother had called him because there was no one else to call, and Dick was her pro bono lawyer.

He pulled back the sheet and winced. Amber Jax was eighteen years old, but barely looked sixteen. Even in death, she was a sad beauty with her high cheekbones and nose like a knife. A ragged ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" tank top barely covered her chest. It was her eyes he would never forget. Huge blue pools frozen wide open by death.

Dick's hand closed her eyes, a violation of hospital policy, but he didn't really give a shit. Amber's eyelids and face felt oily and waxen beneath his fingers, and despite being a recovering alcoholic Dick decided he needed a drink. But that was the thing about quitting drinking, it meant you could have one from time to time.

""See you, Apple Jax,"" he whispered Amber's nickname to her corpse and thought about her three-year old son, Jonah. Dick had been preparing with Amber for six months to defend her against the state and its action by the Department of Child and Family Services to terminate her parental rights and take Jonah. He looked down at her dead face and saw Jonah being led away by a social worker into the foster system's labyrinth.

""Life's a bitch and then you die,"" fired through his mind, or his own saying, ""Thanks for the cherry on top of my shit sundae.""

But she hadn't been using, at least he didn't think so. Heroin had killed her husband and all Amber had tried to do was be a single mom. Now she was dead. How? Dick would arrange for her funeral only after he saw to it that Bill Broom, the county coroner, did a thorough autopsy. For now, Amber's body would lie in the sallow light of St. Mary's ER.

Amber Jax was truly a victim of society, crucified by the church league for leaving Jonah inside a parked car with open windows outside the bar where she worked. After DCFS had filed, Dick convinced Judge Leonard to allow Jonah to remain with his mother before the hearing. The judge did so on the grounds that the boy would soon be a ward of the state.

Standing over the girl who'd gone by Apple Jax, Dick thought of Chicago. Before he torched his own career, he had been a city prosecutor fresh out of Northwestern. He had kicked sleeping dogs awake and opened cans of worms. He was a good lawyer, but he was a bad drunk. Most thought Dick drank for pleasure, but he drank because finding justice in Chicago had been a hopeless job.

He thought of Jonah again. Amber had named him after the bible story. Now, a boy named Jonah about to be swallowed up by institutional life seemed very sad to him. He thought of a drink again and turned to leave. Something stopped him, and he he turned, snatching the sheet away and looking one last time at Amber Jax's face. The thought of a drink vanished instantly, and he went to find her brother.

**2. The Dead Girl's Brother**

Dick stepped through the whooshing electric doors of St. Mary's hospital out into the white morning light. Jeremy Jax smoked and leaned against a red Ford with Jonah in the cab.

""We going to bury her, Mr. Berryman?"" Jeremy said. He coughed, sniffed thickly, and spit onto the pavement.

""Not yet, Jeremy. I want the coroner to do a good job. You told the ER doc she was taking pills?""

Jeremy's hand stuffed into his pocket and emerged with an orange prescription drug bottle.

""It's cotten-oxy-""

""Oxy-cotten,"" Dick corrected and read the script label, ""OXYCONTIN, 5MG/50 tablets/Q6 Hours PRN for pain."" He pocketed the bottle.

""It ain't right what happened.""

""No, it's not, but now I've got to go back to work and figure out how all this rolls down on Jonah,"" Dick said, quietly seething at the divine comedy of life.

""She got pills from that clinic,"" Jeremy said.

""What clinic?""

""The pain clinic, downtown, across from the Post Office.""

""What are you talking about?""

""Amber wadn't no junkie. She just wanted to be Jonah's mom. Then that nurse from the clinic, who lives at Sunshine with husband, started comin' round. Amber was depressed, havin' headaches...real bad ones. That nurse gave her pills. Two to start, then two was four, four was ten.""

Dick felt the same clarity he had felt looking at Amber's dead face.

""Go see the nurse, Mr. Berryman. She's a real hag. They call her the candy striper.""

Dick walked from St. Mary's Hospital into a block of streets marked by old red brick roads toward the house where he grew up.

He thought of two things. He was definitely going to have a drink with his breakfast, and he would have to call the coroner to earmark Amber's toxicology for Oxycontin levels.

**3. Home Sweet Home**

He stood in front of his family house. A huge Queen Anne once yellow and blue; now it looked like a cracking egg, its paint peeled and blown away. The foundation had shifted and the house slumped to the left like a sunken ship washed ashore.

Dick ran up the front steps. They creaked and groaned, and in the middle of the six steps, his right foot plunged through a rotted step and he was stuck for a moment. He cackled. That was how this whole fucking morning had been going. Then the front door opened and it was his father wearing only urine soaked tights-whiteys. His laugh died in his throat, and he found he wanted to cry, ""Hey Dad.""

His father's timpani belly hung on him like armor. His face was red and his nose bulbous from years of living inside a bottle. And now, John Berryman did not know his son anymore because of the Alzheimer's strip-mining his memories with its awful machinery.

Dick helped his father back to his bedroom. He tucked his father in, brushing the hair from the lost old man's forehead. 

As he walked out of his father's room, Dick caught himself in the three mirror his mother dressed in when she was alive. He saw himself, carved by the mirror into three reflections. Each seemed different, but they were all him. One was a good attorney, who loved the law like sex, but loved justice more. One was a drunk who'd peed in court and followed that up with a pretty sensational DUI in Chicago. And the last was him right now, a disgraced lawyer given a job at his father's old firm by the grace of the remaining partner, Steve Meyerson. For the last five years, Dick had sat in his father's office doing pro bono work. He'd even taken to wearing Dad's old suits, which fit him perfectly.

He was finally ready for that drink and clomped downstairs. As he poured himself a scotch, he stopped and looked down into the golden liquid and saw Amber Jax's tiny body floating like an ice cube. He left the drink untouched on the bar and went to the pain clinic.

**4. The Department of Pain**

Dick saw the candy striper the minute he stepped into the Pain Clinic and she was indeed a hag. She had been pretty once. Her aquiline nose was the last vestige of her beauty, while her eyes were sunken and cheeks hollow. She wore her dyed black hair in a tight bun and pink scrubs. Her flicking eyes fixed on Dick, like rodents peering from shadowy holes.

""May I help you sir,"" she asked.

""I was representing Amber Jax in a parental rights case, and I have reason to believe she was getting drugs from this clinic,"" and as Dick spoke he knew how far over the line he was.

""What happened to Amber?""

Dick searched her face in that moment, and could not tell if she knew or not.

""She's dead. Died this morning.""

""Oh my god,"" she said, and her sincerity enraged him.

""And you were giving her pills, nurse-"" Dick looked for her name tag, but she wore none. ""What's your name, Ma'am?"" The candy striper did not bristle like he expected.

""Excuse me sir, but Amber Jax was a patient here. She had chronic headaches and pain we were treating-""

""I'd like to see her scripts!"" As his voice rose, he noticed a red-haired nurse at the reception window behind the candy-striper. She watched him carefully from behind the old blue-hair working the phones.

""What's happening here? Who are you?"" a strangely musical voice came from behind him. Dick turned to see a six foot two red-faced bear of a man in a white coat. The gray coif of hair that maned the doctor's face made him look like the cowardly lion. Beneath his coat he wore tan slacks, braided loafers with tassels, and a pique shirt with a light blue tie. ""I'm Dr. Levi, this is my clinic.""

""Hello doctor, my name is Dick Berryman, I was Amber Jax's attorney. She died this morning. I know she was on oxycontin, and it may have been an overdose."" Dick produced the empty bottle.

""She died this morning and you already have her toxicology?""

Dick said nothing, and started again, ""I have information that tells me this nurse her engaged with then patient outside of work. They're neighbors at Sunshine Trailer park, and-""

""Jesus Christ, Ilene? Is that true?""

""Doctor...it's not-""

""Go home,"" Dr. Levi said. Dick saw she was stunned, but she left.

""Come on, back to my office. Bonnie!""

""Yes, doctor,"" and the red-haired Dick had noticed was there. He liked her immediately, mostly because she reminded him of his Mom with her red hair. She was fifty, but looked forty with her ivory skin and soft features. 

""Pull Amber Jax's scripts and bring them to my office, thank you.""

He followed Levi back past the old lady at the phones. She smiled at Dick and he thought she looked like a shar pei wearing a wig.

**5. Dr. Levi's Office**

Red came with the file and left. Dr. Levi explained Amber's script as entirely conventional, and showed him records to corroborate that. Amber had complained of migraines.

""You realize I don't have to talk to you at all, Dick. But it's a small town and I knew your father. Doctors and lawyers are like brothers you know,"" Dr. Levi smiled.

""This isn't the first time Ilene's gotten involved with patients if that's what's going on here. Most of the time, she brings in girls who are hurting. That's a fact. But as for Ilene giving her pills, it's impossible because I write all the scripts and fill them myself. I was a pharmacist in med school. We're dinosaurs here. Only reason we keep an in-house pharmacy is to make some money on generics for crissake. Try and keep some crumbs while getting raped by Medicaid. And yes, there are abuses, but I wouldn't say a thing without seeing Amber's tox. She may have taken the whole bottle finally. I see four deaths a year out of five thousand patients. This will be five. Most are suicides. But that's what pain does to people. I can tell you right now, because I've seen it. If I gave you a ten out of ten pain, or nine out of nine...even an eight...for a year. You'd swallow that whole bottle like skittles too.""

""Are you saying Amber killed herself?""

""No, I'm just saying this happens a lot in my world,"" Dr. Levi said, but not smugly. He looked like Dick felt, worn down by his particular circle of hell.

But something was off, because all of this had gone much better than Dick thought it would. And none of it as expected. It was time for a beer with the law.

**6. Pastor**

Dick nursed a water in a back booth at Deke's Tap. His friend Kurt Pastor, called Pastor by friends not for his last name but his priestly calm, sighed heavy when he saw Dick was not drinking.

Pastor slide into the back booth. He was shorter than Dick, but a coil of muscle. Pastor had been an Illinois police officer since he was twenty-two years old, after graduating from Streetor County Community College. Now Pastor was forty-five to Dick's thirty-seven and the assistant Sheriff in Streetor. He was laconic, but a great cop. A perfect shot, or as he liked to say, as long as my eyes can see, I will hit that target. He was smart, and most of all, he was cautious.

""What kind of shit you into, Dick?"" Pastor said, coming up from his beer with a sudsy mustache, which he sucked wetly with his lower lip.

""Client died this morning, young girl, leaves a three year old boy and a brother with nothing. I still have to save the kid from the state. But her death doesn't make sense, Pastor,"" Dick finally said aloud. He said it as a prosecutor to a cop. One hunter to another.

Pastor sighed even louder, ""How'd she die?""

""I don't know yet, but I think it's an oxy overdose. But this girl was never a drug user. Her brother, who I trust, said she got the pills from the pain clinic in downtown Streetor, and-""

""-and they're selling drugs down there like a candy store. I heard that, Dick. We all know that kind of stuff goes on, but you got to get more than that-""

""So I went down there-""

""-you went down there...are you out of your mind?""

Dick glared at his friend. ""I went down there to see the faces of the people who knew Amber before she died, and I didn't trust any of them. I just wanted to tell you-""

""Bullshit,"" Pastor spat back. ""You're tellin' me 'cause you're going to pull some shit just like you did with those Sneed sisters. Booze and justice, both of 'em make you blind drunk.""

Dick said nothing, because Pastor was half right. 

The Sneed sisters had been two old maids who for years had fostered children for the county. Lived in a big old gothic rambler. It seemed the boys stayed but the girls ran away, according to the sisters. Dick had been guardian ad litum to a boy who'd escaped and as a result he had soothed into the Sneed house and found dead girls dressed like dolls in the basement. He had almost been disbarred for that, but the sisters were on death row now.

""Why'd you become a cop, Pator?""

""Honest answer, it was a job. I was out of work and looking. I saw an ad in the River Ridge paper."" Dick laughed out loud, Pastor went on, ""I ain't shittin' you. I thought...that looks interesting, and there's benefits. Now all I think is, I cannot wait to retire.""

Dick shook his head disbelieving, ""You like what you do. I like what I do, sometimes. This one sucks, Pastor.""

""I'm sorry, Dick. But don't get so deep in this stuff. It'll kill you. Believe me.""

""I do, I do. Thanks,"" he said, and left Pastor in the booth.

Dick went out into the neon dusted night in front of Deke's Tap. He walked home and thought only of Amber Jax's open blue eyes. And in his mind, they hung in the sky like haunted moons and watched him.

**7. The Broom**

Bill Broom, the Streetor County coroner, was called the Broom partly because of his name, but mostly because of his meticulous nature and penchant for cleaning and clearing things up.

A week after he saw Pastor, Dick got a call from the Broom who said he'd sent his autopsy report to his son, Isaac, who like his father was a medical examiner. Isaac, however, worked for the FBI in Grundy County.

""Since you made a point of askin' me to be thorough, I thought I'd let a younger eye check my work. Just like Dirty Harry says, man's GOT to know his limitations,"" the Broom laughed through the cell phone, and Dick hung up.

His cell phone rang the minute he hung up with the Broom. It was Red.

**8. Red's House**

Turned out Bonnie Red lived right around the corner from Dick. They sat and had tea.

""Every summer there's been a girl like Amber Jax. I've worked at the clinic now five years and every summer it's always the same,"" Red said.

""Does Ilene sell drugs?""

""It doesn't work like that. She brings 'em in, like little lost birds. You gotta understand, our patients are between the ages of thirty-six and forty-six. People with real pain, but all the girls Ilene brings in are young. She gets 'em hooked.""

""Why?""

""I don't know. But I think Amber was the lucky one. 'Cause the rest just disappeared. Parents and relatives come looking, but those girls were gone. You look up girls who've gone missing around here over the years who were eighteen to twenty-one.""

""Does Levi know?""

""Doctor's on vacation with Bill White half the time, or drivin' his fancy black Mercedes. But he always comes home for the summers.""

""On vacation with Bill White?""

""Doc Levi is as gay as the day is long, and he's lovers with Bill White, who used to have orgies with young boys...like that movie...with the masks...eyes wide open?""

""Eyes wide shut,"" Dick said, remembering childhood gossip of Bill White's sexuality.

""The last thing I know is Ilene keeps two ledgers, and she fills the scripts. If you look in there, you'll see how she was doubling and tripling Amber's dosage. along with some of the girls over the past couple years.""

Red handed him a thin folder with photocopied scripts.

Nothing made sense. Yet.

**9. Digging in the Dirt**

Two weeks after Red invited Dick to tea, Amber's toxicology came back. It showed elevated levels of oxycontin and circulatory collapse and was ruled an overdose. He wondered when he might hear from Little Broom up in Grundy, and if his findings would be different. Dick asked Pastor to run a check for missing persons aged eighteen to twenty-one in Streetor and surrounding towns through the Law Enforcement Agency Data System. Thirty hit. Pastor had spent a week talking to almost fifty people in trailer parks and public housing.

Dick and Pastor met in the Country Cupboard on a Friday morning at seven am. Dick saw Digger Remy, sitting at the bar with his son, Digger Junior. Digger Senior's milky blind eyes stared straight ahead while he shoveled biscuits and gravy into his mouth, his son guiding his father's hand to his coffee when he reached for it. Digger Senior had mowed the lawn and fixed odds and ends around the house for Dick's parents long ago. Now, he and his son were caretakers at St. Stephen's cemetery, though it was Digger Junior who did all the work. As the old blind man sipped his coffee, Dick thought of his own Dad.

""You got some serious hunches, Dick. Over the last eleven years, ten girls have gone missing. One of 'em was Adrienne Kist...my cousin went to school with her. Heroin addict.""

""You think the candy striper's doing it?""

""I don't know buddy, but you'll need a hell of a lot more than this to do anything.""

""Something is really wrong here, Pastor, and you know it.""

""I don't know anything, Dick. How's your case with the kid?""

""I hear it tomorrow,"" Dick said, feeling doom hanging over him. What happened to those girls? Death? Maybe worse.

""Good luck, Dick. And for now, leave all parties involved alone, understood?""

""Yea,"" he said, and Pastor left him with the missing persons file.

Digger Junior lead his father by their table, saying hello as he did. Hearing him, Digger Senior spoke up, ""Give ya' Dad my best, and come on down and see me soon, counselor.""

Dick thought it was nice how Digger Senior couldn't see the world or anyone in it, and yet he hadn't lost his love for it.

**10. Jonah and the Judge**

""The state has presented me with evidence that demands I terminate her brother's parental rights, and remand this boy to the state,"" Judge Leonard said, cracking his gavel.

Jonah's guardian, a woman dressed in a knee-length skirt and jacket, swept the boy up into her arms, crooked him on her hip and disappeared through a door beyond the bench.

Dick felt hope dying inside him like it had died in Chicago, and went out to St. Stephen's Cemetery to clear his mind.

**11. Blind Men**

Dick knelt by his mother's headstone with the setting sun boiling red like a cauldron of blood.

To his surprise, he was not thinking of a drink. He thought of the haggish candy striper. She was the wolf in the community searching for lost girls. Then he thought of Dr. Levi who had lied to him. Finally, he thought of all the girls who were gone. Had they died like Amber, but in the dark somewhere? His mind did not answer.

""Mr. Berryman?"" Digger Junior said, standing over him with his father. ""Dad wanted to talk to you,"" he said, and left Dick and Digger Senior alone, fireflies winking around them.

""I'm glad you come to see me counselor,"" he said. And Dick realized Digger Senior had not simply spoken to him at the Cupboard to be neighborly. The old man had something to tell.

""I seen something before I was blind. But back then I was drunk most days from sun up to sun down, so no one paid me much mind.""

""What is it, Digger?""

""I seen a girl come out of the corn 'bout two years ago. First I thought I was seein' an honest to god ghost in the graveyard. I nearly shit my pants. Then I heard her crying, more like whimpering, for help and I knew she weren't no ghost. Then a car come and she waved her hands in its lights-""

Dick stood now, ""What kind of car was it Digger?""

Digger Senior smiled, flashing a mouth missing many teeth.

""Goddamned nazi-mobile. Black mer-zedes benz."" Dick remembered Red telling him how Dr. Levi drove his Mercedes with pride. ""It stopped a big man got out and stood in the lights with her. He touch her and she fell, just like that,"" he snapped his fingers. ""The big man set her in the car, and they went down Plumb's road.""

Dick knew Streetor well enough, but not like Digger Senior who was practically a town elder. ""Plumb's road? Where's that?""

""Just right there,"" Digger Senior pointed across his boneyard to the corn, even blind his finger fell true. ""It's a left hand turn through the corn, but it ain't Plumb's road no more. It's Bill White's now. Dandy farmer.""

Dick heard Red's voice, ""*Doc Levi is lovers with Bill White.*"" He stood against the dark tombstones as the sun died beneath the horizon. His mind groped for what Digger Senior had seen. What did Bill White, one of the richest men in Streetor County and the state of Illinois, have to do with all of this. Dick's phone rang. The area code was Grundy County.

**12. The Little Broom**

""She had MH!"" Isaac practically shouted into the phone. Isaac Broom had been cutting his teeth in the FBI field office in Grundy County, and was already legendary among the agents for his boundless energy.

""What's MH, Isaac?""

""Malignant Hyperthermia. It's genetic and it's rare but your girl had it. Elevated creatine and potassium levels. It's caused by drugs used for general anesthesia."" Dick felt the sound sucked out of his world, and then Isaac's voice came back. ""The most common drug that would do this is succinylcholine. Docs and nurses call it suxx. It's a paralytic. For someone with MH, it overwhelms breathing, CO2 plummets, body temp falls. Circulatory collapse. She had oxycontin in her blood, but that's not what killed her.""

Dick knew now that Dr. Levi was the big man on the road who had touched that girl and made her fall down right before Digger Senior's yet to be blind eyes. The good doctor had most likely injected her with the suxx, and then took her to his lover's farm.

His mind kept leaping, and he thought Amber had been some kind of mistake, and perhaps Dr. Levi had not meant to kill her at all.

He called Pastor, who read him the riot act, and told him not to go to Bill White's farm.

Dick hung up on him and waited for night to fall before driving down White's long country driveway. He did not notice the Mercedes following him like a big, black shark, its headlights off.

**13. White's Farm**

Bill White's farm, or rather compound, sat on a football field sized lawn. Its drives and paths lit by soft yellow lamps sunk into the ground. It was an immense white house with red trim, make to look like an old farm, but designed and landscaped by Chicago architects.

Dick's oxfords clicked on the poured concrete, shushing as he stepped off the driveway onto the grass. He made his way around to the back of the farmhouse.

**14. The Barn**

Dick crouched low and ran through the full dark. The corn whispered and the insects sang.

The barn stood in black relief against the ocean of corn. White's farmhouse sat on a lake of grass, bu they had let the corn grow close and high around the barn, as if to hide it. Out of the corn came huge black dogs with yellow eyes and white teeth, growling low. Dick stepped backward, and then a needle pierced the meat of his neck, and he was locked inside his body like so many girls had been before him.

**15. Inside the Barn**

He woke in a hot, white cone of light. All around him a wide dark. The concrete floor strewn with straw. He was not bound to a chair but he could not move. The suxx held him like a night terror.

""Hello, counselor,"" came a voice both warm and empty. As Bill White came out of the dark, Dick was struck by his enormity. He stood six feet and six inches. He wore Lee jeans that seemed painted on, loafers with no socks, and a red polo straining against his wide chest and arms. His head was a bald stone. His only hair was a handlebar mustache and eyebrows like white caterpillars.

Bill held a gleaming silver magnum .45. Dick thought of something.

""You sir, are definitely a top,"" he said in his slushy, drugged voice. Bill White laughed madly, and with his Rolex clad left hand, slapped Dick.

Dick saw white splotches and pain lit in his brain as his head snapped to the side. He saw Dr. Levi quivering in the shadows. ""What are you doing?"" Dr. Levi shouted, his strange musical voice warbling with fear.

""I'm cleaning up YOUR mess,"" White said.

""What did you do to the girls?"" Dick asked.

""You know what they say, one man's trash is another man's treasure,"" White said, grinning. ""We brought them here. Gave them more drugs, and then we sold them.""

""For money?""

Bill White laughed like the devil at the end of god. ""Of course, but that was never the point.""

""Why then?""

""Because I can, Dick.""

""You're a fucking p...p...piece of shit,"" Dick sputtered. It was all his hazy reeling mind could muster. White leaned into the light, sweat beading on the tanned dome of his head.

""And you're going to die,"" White said.

""Are you going to shoot him?"" Levi asked.

""No,"" then Dick watched Bill White calmly raise his gun and shot his lover in the leg. ""You are.""

Levi howled, his hands clamping on his bleeding thigh as he tumbled down.

""Mr. Berryman came over here drunk, and shot my dear, sweet companion.""

White crossed the room and knelt like a jackal. He put the gun in Levi's hand, and soothed his crying lover with shushing kisses on his cheek.

Behind them, came Pastor with his glock.

Dick saw his friend count himself into place, and as his lips hit seven Pastor's glock popped twice. The big farmer fell like a tree atop the doctor he had kept in strange shackles for sometime.

**16. Beneath the Barn**

Dr. Levi unlocked the square iron door in the floor of the barn. Pastor and Dick opened it. The black opening looked like a dug grave except for the flickering light.

Dick went down the ladder into the dim bold and Pastor followed. There in the dark, chained to a bed and looking like the survivor of a concentration camp, was a girl. An IV drip hung in the gloom above her, and on the flickering TV was *Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.* Both men recognized the girl as Adrienne Kist (who Pastor's cousin had known) barely breathing. Dick smiled at her ragged breaths, feeling her being alive was like a blade of grass pushed up through black spring soil.

They unchained Adrienne and carried her up into the light. 

**17. At the End**

Dick was suspended from practicing law for an unspecified term, and Pastor was reprimanded, but Streetor County was quietly grateful.

Dick welcomed the break. He visited Adrienne Kist in the hospital and read paperbacks by James M. Cain and Jim Thompson. He enjoyed the time and perspective. He knew the law would always be there for him, but for now, he was on the wagon.

1jt2ukv,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1jt2ukv/was_i_raised_by_a_sociopath/,Was I raised by a sociopath?,"Ever since I was little and my sister was born, I became the family's scapegoat. I remember my dad in particular was cruel to me but my mom was neglectful so she wasn't much better. I was hospitalized and my dad talked soberly about how now I couldn't get to go to Heaven (I was 6) because I'd had a blood transfusion and he said we cannot mix blood.. But hey, I'm okay until I die. I was horrified.


I returned from the hospital and my mom refused to let me out of my room for 3-4 months, only letting me out to use the restroom. Again, I was 6 and I tried to call the police and tell them what was going on and they brought a helicopter and a SWAT team because they thought I had been kidnapped due to what I said. But that was my mother and not my dad.


My dad for years talked about how poor we were. He said I might not be able to go to college and how I was gonna be left behind to work at Walmart instead to support my family. I was around 9. He bought me two shirts and two jeans and that was the only clothing I had because he said we were really struggling financially. It turns out we had millions since they had an affluent business, but I was too sheltered and young to know they were lying to me about it.



My dad would talk about war and said how we might have to cross the border to Mexico or Canada and be ready to leave at any moments notice and he said he was THINKING about letting me come along. When he was getting everyone passports, he didn't get me mine and said I was gonna be abandoned at home during the war. I cried.



Then he recently lied and said insurance didn't cover my repeated hospitalizations even though it did and he claimed to my mother I was 100k+ in debt and my credit was ruined but then he was pocketing that money to give to his mistress.



He also said cops and loan sharks were after me because of this debt and that ambulances would charge me 8k+ each time I went, and then he would take 8k+ from the safe and pretend he had used it on me. Again, it had to be for his mistress.



He also abandoned me recently and he started to pray to God that I'd die. He did this after I told him I was doing well. He told all my relatives that I had stolen money and had run away and gone to prison or something because no one in my family has spoken to me since. My mom passed away and he took my inheritance from me, throwing away all my things in the house and using my money to buy himself a coffee shop. 


I was in the worst situation of my life by getting assaulted and nearly murdered and my dad was prickly about it probably thinking I was lying or deserved it somehow.



He and my narcissist sister have been perpetuating this lie that I ran off with more than my share despite being the ones to take mine from me. 


They said I spent too much money and asked them for too much though I spent less than $100 a day (on food, groceries, clothing, school, gas, medication, etc). My mom gave me $700 a week but my dad flipped out and said I owed him despite him not working a day in his life. He was a stay at home parent who easily spent $300-500 a day. He would buy breakfast at a nice café ($40) go somewhere nice for lunch ($40), get some coffee or yogurt for maybe another $25, get dinner in LA or Beverly Hills ($50+), and ice cream as dessert ($8).




He then would go shopping for clothes, play golf at a beach resort and buy items for the house like $300 motion activated trash cans. 



He almost sent my mom to prison because he didn't file taxes properly and she had to give the IRS 1 million and was looking at a year in prison.




Despite doing all this, he claims the $100 I spent was unforgivable and prays that I die when he found out I was doing just fine and living in a nice place and had savings.



I think he is a sociopath. Or is he a narcissist?


If I were cremated and died and they gave him my ashes, he would smile in comforted glee.



Either he believes his own lies he's been perpetuating about me or he is insane or a sociopath.


I've never seen him cry or apologize. He can't keep a job. Food and golf and sex are the only things he enjoys. 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. Think my dad is one? I'm still confused because he is so evil it's pitiful.



Thank God Jesus took me in. He said in the Bible, your mother and father will forsake you, but your Heavenly Father will take you in.



I've survived because of God but my dad has actively been trying to put me in situations where I might get hurt or worse, like cutting off all contact when it was time for him to pay for my rent and living expenses, he gave me $360 a week from my mom to survive while I was in school and he said that was far too much for anyone and then began lying about how much I asked for. My mom said it was fine but she wanted to know how I ended up 100k in debt at 19 [hospitalizations that ended up being free in CA].




He's crazy. I told him I had been assaulted and he got happy. Then he cut off contact, and I think he admitted to God he was glad I was in a situation where I could get hurt.



He used to beat me severely and the screams disturbed my neighbors. He is bad.



Does he sound like a sociopath or a narcissist or both? I'm thinking sociopath??",1,1743969203.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I'm thinking about upgrading my grinder.

I've got Timemore Chestnut C2 and I'm pretty happy with it - for pour overs. The thing is that recently I bought an espresso machine and my grinder falls short for two reasons.

Firstly, I feel like there is too little control over the grind size for an espresso. And secondly, it takes so long to grind the coffee. But this also means that I want that new grinder **primarily for espresso, it doesn't need to be the better grinder for all styles overall**.

So the question is if I should rather buy the cheaper C3 ESP PRO (for a little under 100€) or is it better to spend more on the C40 MK4 Nitro Blade which is on sale (for just under 200€)?

However, it does not necessarily need to be one of those two if you know of a better one in this price range (ideally under 250€). I prefer hand grinders over electric ones for better price over value ratio and also because of portability reasons but I'm open to consider buying an electric grinder.

1jt2qv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jt2qv2/running_woes/,Running Woes,"4 months ago I signed up for a half marathon as motivation to run more regularly and as a good challenge. I started out with what felt like a manageable training plan, and did a bunch of research about injury prevention and proper training. 

It’s now three weeks before the race and I’ve done maybe 10% of the training I planned to. My longest run was 6 miles, which is the furthest I’ve ever run, but I’ve averaged less than one run a week and have only done strength training like 3 times. I’ve really struggled to work around difficult factors like rain, short daylight, planning ahead enough to have enough time to run AND shower, etc. When I do run, my knees have been hurting and my heart rate sits at about 195 for most of my runs, even when I run so slow it’s mentally painful and boring. 

Every time I think about running, I get so overwhelmed. I try to focus on just doing something, not doing it perfectly, and changing my expectations to a goal of only finishing the race but not any particular time. I’m telling myself that in the past, I’ve always felt better in races than I expected to based on my (lack of) training. Even with that, I feel so paralyzed by the shame of completely dropping the ball on training. I’ve even had friends comment to me that they’ve noticed on Strava my mileage doesn’t seem adequate for half marathon training (like…fuck off?!?!) I’m so paranoid about injury, and I just can’t get myself to take steps in the right direction. 

My husband and I were planning to run 8 miles today. I was mentally prepared to make it happen in the afternoon. But then we woke up and he told me it was supposed to rain starting at 12 for the rest of the day, and we needed to go right away. Now, any time I try to run in the morning, I have 40% of the capability of if I run in the afternoon. I don’t know what it is, but I’ve (mostly) learned to work around this. Add that together with everything I’ve already shared AND a last minute change of plans?! I bet you can all see where this is going. 

I tried to change my mindset. I drank a protein shake and some coffee. I put my running clothes on. I did some warmup exercises. I told myself it didn’t have to be fun, but I would be proud of myself afterwards. We started running and after a quarter mile, I was already losing my mind overthinking my strides, feeling all the liquid sloshing around in my stomach, and knew I didn’t have it in me to run at all let alone my longest run ever. I would rather run in the rain. I told my husband I needed to go home and he could keep going. 

Now I’m home and stuck in a shame spiral loop. I’m so anxious about this race and I feel like such a failure. I also didn’t take my meds and now it’s too late if I want to sleep at all tonight, and I feel like I can’t get myself to do anything else either. I want to feel strong and resilient, but I don’t know how to build those qualities when such seemingly little things completely derail me. 

Level with me - is it time to give up on this race? Am I just overthinking everything? I imagine I’m not the only one who had experienced this type of thing - how did y’all push through? I don’t know how to get unstuck.

At current day I don’t follow any proper procedures or protocols as soon as I woke up and get fresh and take a coffee and start to do work.. first thing I do at work is to listen and recite kala Bhairav astakam.. followed by 5 malas nama jaap..
I could do this as I am working from home.. 
please let me know what can I do to improvise this process. 
3. I think as a family there’s some kind of trauma passed on to me I say it because there’s a pattern of suffering from my grand father to my father and me.. note: we all 3 has same facial features.. we all three chased for material things.. whenever I tried to get away my thoughts from material things I felt very uncomfortable.. finally in my heart I asked baba give me solution to this chase and guide me. On the same day I was introduced to swarnakarshana Bhairav to fulfill the desires.. from the min I introduced to swarnakarshana Bhairav I felt very comfortable and I had a feeling that I got the solution..

I have plenty of friends who sleep around and it is not a concern for me normally, as long as everything is consensual and safe. 
I (19f) am a college freshman in a sorority and I met my bsf last semester when I rushed. My friend (let’s call her Beth) was 17 during last semester and just recently turned 18. When we met she was super sweet and supportive towards me and we did almost everything together. Every now and then we would go to parties as college freshman do. I noticed she liked male attention and would often make out with a lot of guys, which again, didn’t concern me bc that’s normal behavior in college. My issues began when she started lying about her age and telling guys she was either 18 or 19. I noticed she also began to take a lot of guys home with her and I didn’t always know if she was telling the truth abt her age. We began to drift apart at the end of the semester since I moved out of her building and into a different one, but before we drifted apart she told me she was seeing a guy (let’s call him Mark) 

Once I moved buildings my new roommate introduced me to her older sister’s boyfriend, and to my surprise, it was Mark (who Beth had told me she was seeing only a month prior.) When I mentioned it to my roommate we all found out that Beth had been sleeping with Mark knowing he had a gf and had lied to him about the fact that she was a minor (Mark is 22). Now ofc Mark is also to blame here but this resulted in them breaking up and the majority of my friends hating Beth and a good bit of my sorority resenting her too. But it gets worse. Only a couple weeks later I see her at a frat party with my roommates’s ex boyfriend. I go up to Beth and let her know who he is and she simply tells me “I don’t care I’m going to sleep with him anyways.” 
My roommate was devastated and told me to stop being friends with her, and I’m starting to feel the same way since she has been hurting so many people close to me and lying. But at the same time, I don’t want to see her go down a dark path. I asked Beth to get coffee with me tomorrow and I plan on confronting her about her behavior, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea? How should I go about it or should I just ignore the situation all together? I could really use some advice. ",1,1743968439.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Let me explain.

I’m 24, straight guy, grew up in a typical middle-class Indian setup. Law School, awkward teenage years, too many Maggi-fueled all-nighters, and now somewhere between trying to figure out how taxes work and what the hell is emotional intimacy, I’ve realized something that feels almost like a glitch in my code—I find myself drawn to older women.

Not in the “MILF-hunting, meme-level” way. But in a much more… human way.

It’s not just the age—it’s the sensibility. The calm in their voice. The way they ask how your day was and genuinely listen when you answer. It’s the warmth that isn’t performative. The kind that comes from someone who has seen a few storms and doesn’t flinch at a little rain.

Last year, I was taking a bus from Jaipur to Delhi—hot, dusty, classic Rajasthan summer. I had an aisle seat, headphones in, trying to drown out a screaming toddler and existential dread. And then, she sat down next to me. Maybe late 30s, wearing a simple kurta, book in hand—Murakami, if I remember right.

We got talking somewhere past Bandikui.

She spoke softly, like someone who didn’t need to prove anything. No unnecessary opinions thrown around like darts. She asked questions with curiosity, not judgement. And when she laughed—God—it wasn’t that filtered Instagram laugh people use to fish for compliments. It was messy and real and completely disarming.

By the time we hit Dhaula Kuan, I was in pieces.

Not because I was in love but because I felt seen. Understood in a way I didn’t know I craved.

Turns out she was a literature professor, divorced, with a kid. She spoke about life not like a lecture, but like a poem. The kind that sits with you for a few days.

We said goodbye at the metro station. No numbers exchanged. No weird tension. Just this warm, strange ache in my chest that followed me all the way home.

That wasn’t the first time this happened, though.

There was also the law firm partner I interned under in college—early 40s, coffee addict, dry wit like fine sandpaper. She once told me, “You think too much, but at least you think. Most people don’t.” I still have that written in my Notes app like it’s gospel.

It’s not about wanting someone to “mommy” me (I see you, Freud). It’s more that there’s something deeply attractive about a woman who knows who she is—who’s been humbled by life a little, who’s not trying to be anyone else.

With women my age, there’s often this performance happening (hell, maybe I do it too)—a need to appear chill, smart, progressive, or whatever the trending personality trait of the month is. But with older women, the pretenses peel off. They’ve already gone through the phase of proving themselves to the world—and maybe to themselves—and now they’re just being.

That energy? Underrated.

Sometimes I feel out of place about it. Friends roast me, but it’s deeper than attraction. It’s admiration. It’s comfort. It’s wanting to be around someone whose world doesn’t revolve around the latest trend or dopamine rush but around being kind, clear, and curious.

Maybe it’s just me.

Or maybe, some of us are just wired to find home in people who’ve already figured out where the furniture goes.

Anyway. That’s all.

Just wanted to say it out loud somewhere without it sounding creepy or like I’m trying to be edgy.

So if you’re reading this, and you’re an older woman who has made some young man feel safe, heard, or even just gently roasted him into becoming a better person—thank you. You probably didn’t even realize it.",2,1743968184.0,RelationshipIndia,3,1.0,False

# Best Leather Laptop Sleeves: Timeless Style & Protection

leather laptop sleeves are more than just protective carriers; they are statements of style and sophistication. In a world dominated by tech accessories made from synthetic materials, a leather laptop sleeve offers a touch of timeless elegance while providing essential protection for your valuable device. Whether you're a student, a business professional, or a creative freelancer, a well-crafted leather laptop sleeve can elevate your everyday carry, adding a touch of class and durability to your tech arsenal. These sleeves not only safeguard your laptop from scratches, bumps, and minor spills but also reflect a discerning taste and appreciation for quality craftsmanship.

## Key Features Analysis

The best leather laptop sleeves are characterized by a combination of high-quality materials, meticulous construction, and thoughtful design. These features ensure that the sleeve not only looks good but also provides reliable protection and long-lasting durability.

**Material Quality:** A premium leather laptop sleeve starts with exceptional leather. Full-grain leather, known for its durability and natural grain patterns, is often preferred for its ability to develop a beautiful patina over time.Top-grain leather,a close second,offers a balance of quality and affordability.The type of leather used substantially impacts the sleeve's appearance, feel, and longevity.

**Construction & Stitching:** The stitching quality is a critical indicator of a well-made leather laptop sleeve. Precise, reinforced stitching along the seams and edges ensures that the sleeve can withstand daily wear and tear. Look for sleeves with durable thread and even stitch spacing, which suggest careful craftsmanship and attention to detail. Reinforced corners and edges also offer enhanced protection against impacts.

**Interior Protection:** The interior lining is just as important as the exterior leather. A soft, scratch-resistant lining, such as microfiber or felt, protects your laptop from scratches and abrasions during transit. Some sleeves feature additional padding or cushioning to provide extra impact protection, notably for vulnerable areas like the corners and edges of the laptop.

**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism of a leather laptop sleeve significantly impacts its ease of use and security. Options range from magnetic closures and snap buttons to zippers and envelope-style flaps. Magnetic closures offer quick access and a streamlined look, while zippers provide a more secure closure, especially for travel. Snap buttons strike a balance between ease of use and security. The chosen closure mechanism should be reliable, durable, and easy to operate.

**Size & Fit:** A properly sized leather laptop sleeve should provide a snug and secure fit for your laptop without being too tight or too loose. Accurate measurements are essential to ensure compatibility. Consider the dimensions of your laptop, including its thickness, and compare them to the internal dimensions of the sleeve. A well-fitted sleeve minimizes movement and prevents the laptop from sliding around during transport, reducing the risk of damage.

**Design & Aesthetics:** Beyond functionality, the design and aesthetics of a leather laptop sleeve contribute to its overall appeal. Look for sleeves with clean lines, minimalist designs, and subtle branding. The colour and texture of the leather can also enhance its aesthetic appeal. A well-designed leather laptop sleeve complements your personal style and elevates your professional image.

investing in a high-quality leather laptop sleeve offers a multitude of benefits that extend beyond mere protection. These sleeves provide a unique combination of style, durability, and functionality, making them a worthwhile investment for anyone who values thier laptop and appreciates fine craftsmanship.

**Enhanced Protection:** A leather laptop sleeve safeguards your valuable device from everyday hazards such as scratches, bumps, and minor spills.

Whether you're attending a business meeting, working in a coffee shop, or traveling for work, a stylish leather sleeve projects an image of competence and attention to detail. It's a subtle yet effective way to elevate your professional image.

**Long-Lasting Durability:** Leather is renowned for its durability and longevity. A well-made leather laptop sleeve can withstand years of use without showing significant wear and tear. The natural aging process of leather, known as patina, adds character and uniqueness to the sleeve over time, making it a cherished accessory.

**Improved Organization:** Many leather laptop sleeves feature additional pockets or compartments for storing accessories such as chargers, cables, and pens. These organizational features help to keep your essentials neatly organized and easily accessible, eliminating the need to carry a separate bag or pouch.

**Comfort & Portability:** Leather laptop sleeves are typically lightweight and slim, making them easy to carry in a backpack, briefcase, or messenger bag. The smooth leather exterior provides a pleasant grip, while the slim profile minimizes bulk and weight. This makes it easy to transport your laptop without adding unnecessary strain or discomfort.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of leather laptop sleeves can raise several questions. Here are some answers to common inquiries to help you make an informed decision.

**What type of leather is best for a laptop sleeve?**
Full-grain leather is generally considered the best option due to its durability and natural beauty. It develops a rich patina over time, making it a long-lasting and attractive choice. Top-grain leather is also a good option, offering a balance of quality and affordability.

**How do I care for a leather laptop sleeve?**
Regular cleaning and conditioning are essential for maintaining the appearance and longevity of your leather laptop sleeve. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dust and dirt, and apply a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out.Avoid exposing the sleeve to excessive moisture or direct sunlight, as these can damage the leather.**Are leather laptop sleeves waterproof?**
Leather is naturally water-resistant,but not waterproof.While a leather laptop sleeve can provide some protection against minor spills, it's not designed to withstand heavy rain or submersion. Consider using a waterproof spray or cover for added protection in wet conditions.

**How do I choose the right size sleeve for my laptop?**
Measure your laptop's dimensions carefully, including its length, width, and thickness. Compare these measurements to the internal dimensions of the sleeve to ensure a snug and secure fit. It's generally better to err on the side of a slightly larger sleeve than one that's too small.

1jt2ffr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1jt2ffr/expanding_the_toolkit_strategies_for_easing/,Expanding the Toolkit: Strategies for Easing Anxiety & Depression,"Hello All,

I have suffered anxiety and depression my entire life. Along the way I have also discovered and learned techniques that have helped me to diminish my suffering. The method following that pertains to anxiety attacks describes a science based protocol that will prevent a panic attack from occurring in the first place (but not prevent GAD). I have spent much time writing this post as a labor of love for others who are suffering, understanding how terrible it can be.

Before diving in, I want to **set one boundary:** this post is **not about medication.** Decisions regarding psychotropic drugs should be made in consultation with a **psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, or medical doctor trained in psychopharmacology.**

 

The question of whether to take medication or not is **complex**—one that must be carefully considered on an individual basis.

 

Over **50 years ago**, during my first psychoanalysis (1970–1976), the rule was **absolute:** no medication, no matter how severe the symptoms. And, indeed, most of my **anxiety and depression resolved without it.**

Fast forward to **November 2024**, when I began my second analysis. This time, I was suffering from **incapacitating anxiety and depression.** I initially decided to **tough it out**, believing I should face it unaided—but my analyst, an **M.D., advised against this.**

 

Following that advice, I sought out a **competent psychiatrist** here in the **Dominican Republic**, who prescribed me the SSRI **sertraline**. It has made a **meaningful difference**—helping to ease my symptoms while still allowing me to **experience my emotions fully, observe my mood shifts, and explore their underlying causes.** Now, I have **the best of both worlds**: symptom relief from **both medication and analysis**, allowing me to work more deeply in my treatment while maintaining stability in my daily life.

 

# What This Post Is About

 

Since medication is **only one piece of the puzzle**, I want to explore **other** approaches that can help ease anxiety and depression—techniques that can be used **alongside analysis, therapy, or medication.**

 

In my experience, techniques for **reducing anxiety** tend to yield **quicker** results than those for **easing depression.** Depression, by nature, often requires **a longer and more sustained effort** to improve. Because of this, I’ll start with anxiety—breaking it down into three key areas:

 

**(1) Anxiety attacks**

**(2) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

**(3) Somatic anxiety**

 

I’ve personally experienced all of the above, applied the techniques I’ll be describing, and achieved **varied results.** Since every individual responds differently, the best way to approach any technique is to **test it, tweak it, and assess its impact for yourself.**

 

# 1. Managing Anxiety Attacks: The Role of Breathing in Biochemistry

 

Anxiety attacks follow a distinct **biochemical progression**, beginning with **hyperventilation**, which causes **respiratory alkalosis**—a state where too much CO₂ is exhaled, increasing blood pH. This triggers:

 

· **Cerebral vasoconstriction** → dizziness, lightheadedness, and depersonalization.

· **Reduced ionized calcium** → muscle twitching, numbness, tingling.

· **Activation of the sympathetic nervous system** → adrenaline surge, rapid heart rate, and heightened panic.

· **Oxygen-hemoglobin shift (Bohr effect)** → less oxygen to tissues, worsening breathlessness.

# Reversing an Impending Attack: Pursed-Lip Breathing

A proven method to stop an anxiety attack is **pursed-lip breathing**:

 

**(1) Inhale slowly through the nose.**

**(2) Exhale through pursed lips (as if blowing out a candle), prolonging the exhale.**

 

This technique **restores CO₂ levels**, **corrects blood pH**, **improves brain oxygenation**, and **shifts the body into a parasympathetic (calm) state**—reversing the attack.

 

!! **Pro tip:** Practice when calm so it becomes second nature in anxious moments.

 

**2. Managing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Engaging the Body’s Relaxation Response**

 

# The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and Its Two Branches

 

The **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** regulates involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, respiration, and digestion. It has two primary branches:

 

**(1) Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) – “Fight or Flight”**

· Activated by stress and anxiety, increasing heart rate, breathing, and alertness.

 

**(2) Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) – “Rest and Digest”**

· Counteracts stress, slowing heart rate, promoting digestion, and inducing relaxation.

 

A key player in activating the **parasympathetic response** is the **vagus nerve**, which extends from the brainstem and influences the heart, lungs, and digestive system. **Stimulating the vagus nerve** signals the body to switch from a stress state to a relaxed state.



# Diaphragmatic Breathing: Activating the “Rest and Digest” Response

 

**Diaphragmatic breathing** (also called belly breathing) **directly engages the parasympathetic nervous system**, overriding the stress-induced fight-or-flight response. By slowing and deepening your breath, you stimulate the **vagus nerve**, which lowers heart rate, reduces muscle tension, and promotes a sense of calm.

 

**How to Practice (Lying Down Position):**

 

**(1) Lie on your back** in a comfortable position.

**(2) Hand placement:**

· Place **one hand on your chest**.

· Slide the **other hand below the sternum** and rest it palm-down on your upper abdomen (**diaphragm**).

 

**(3) Breathing mechanics:**

 

· Inhale **slowly through the nose**, filling your belly with air.

· Keep the **chest hand still**—only the **diaphragm hand should move up and down**.

· Imagine your belly button **gently pressing toward your spine** as you inhale. **Exhale slowly** through the nose or pursed lips, letting the belly deflate.

· **Key points:**

\*\*The **chest hand must remain stationary**—movement should come from the belly.  
\*\***Practice when calm** to master the technique before using it in anxious moments.  
\*\*Once comfortable, you can use diaphragmatic breathing **while sitting, walking, or even jogging**.



# How Many Breaths?

Relief varies by person, but **15-20 deep cycles** often bring noticeable relaxation. Some may experience a **brief lag time** between finishing the exercise and feeling calm.

 

**3. Managing Somatic Anxiety: Engaging the Body to Regain Calm**

 

# What Is Somatic Anxiety? (vs. Cognitive Anxiety)

 

Anxiety manifests in **two primary ways**:

 

**(1) Cognitive Anxiety** – Characterized by **excessive worrying, racing thoughts, and mental distress.**

**(2) Somatic Anxiety** – Anxiety **felt in the body**, often presenting as **tightness in the chest, stomach discomfort, muscle tension, dizziness, or shortness of breath.**

 

While cognitive anxiety is more **thought-based**, **somatic anxiety** is rooted in **physical sensations** triggered by **autonomic nervous system activity**—particularly **sympathetic arousal (""fight or flight"").**

 

**Where is somatic anxiety usually felt?**

I**t is commonly experienced in the torso**, including the **chest, stomach, diaphragm, and sometimes the throat**—areas where the **autonomic nervous system** has strong physiological effects.



# Option 1: Diaphragmatic Breathing (First-Line Intervention)

 

**Since** **somatic anxiety is body-based**, **body-based interventions work best.**

  
**Diaphragmatic breathing**, as previously described, directly engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, signaling the body to shift from **""fight or flight"" to ""rest and digest.""**

 

· **Slows breathing and heart rate**

· **Reduces muscle tension**

· **Promotes a sense of physical relaxation**

 

For many people, **this is the fastest and most effective way to counteract somatic anxiety.**



# Option 2: Mindfulness and Its Neurological Basis

While diaphragmatic breathing directly **calms the nervous system**, **mindfulness** works differently—it **shifts how the brain processes anxiety.**

 

**The Neuroscience of Mindfulness:**

 

· **Activates the prefrontal cortex**, which regulates emotional responses.

· **Reduces amygdala reactivity**, lowering the intensity of fear and anxiety.

· **Enhances interoception** (awareness of bodily sensations), helping you observe rather than react to discomfort.

 

Mindfulness does not **engage the parasympathetic system** the way diaphragmatic breathing does, but it **can reduce the fear of losing control over one’s body and sense of self**, a major feature of GAD.



# Mindfulness Practice for Somatic Anxiety

**(1) Best position**: Sitting or lying down, but can be done anytime, anywhere.

**(2) Use your breathing as an anchor** – Focus on the sound and sensation of your breath.

**(3)Thoughts will arise—this is normal.**

**(4) Do not try to ""empty"" your mind.** Instead, gently return attention to the breath.

**(5) No self-criticism.** Wandering thoughts are part of the process.



# Summary: Choosing the Right Tool

 

✅ **Diaphragmatic Breathing** – Engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, providing **direct** relief from somatic anxiety.  
✅ **Mindfulness** – While **not as physiologically calming**, it **reduces fear of losing control** and enhances **a sense of self-boundary**, helping ease distressing GAD symptoms.

 

Both approaches can be valuable, depending on the situation. **Experiment, evaluate, and refine** to see what works best for you.



  **Depression**

 

 **Managing Depression: Strategies for Activation and Engagement**

 

Depression is harder to manage than anxiety because it is a **state of underactivation** rather than overactivation. While anxiety involves **excessive autonomic arousal** (which can be calmed with physiological techniques like breathing), depression is characterized by **low dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine**, leading to **fatigue, low motivation, and emotional blunting.** This makes non-medication relief more challenging because the very actions needed for improvement—movement, engagement, and stimulation—are the hardest to initiate.

 

# Interventions for Managing Depression

# 1. Behavioral Activation (Breaking the Cycle of Inertia)

 

**What it does:** Trains the brain to associate small actions with **reward and motivation**, counteracting the tendency to withdraw.

 

**How to do it:** Work! The activity could be intellectual or physical.

 

**2.** **Social Engagement (Counteracting Isolation and Emotional Blunting)**

 

**What it does:** Depression often **shuts down** the brain’s social reward system, making interactions feel **draining** rather than fulfilling. But **passive isolation worsens symptoms.**

 

**How to do it: Direct contact with a friend or family member. When you are not depressed, create a network of people you trust who would be willing to go “live” with you when you are in crisis.**

 

**3. Grounding Exercise: Engaging the Five Senses to Break Depressive Rumination**

 

I find that this helps for severe depression.

 

**What it does:** Depression often pulls attention **inward**, creating **rumination, detachment, and emotional numbness.** Grounding techniques **shift focus outward** by engaging the five senses, helping to **reconnect with the present moment.**

 

**How to do it (5-4-3-2-1 method):**

 

**Name 5 things you can see.**

· Look around and describe five objects in detail.

· Example: *“I see a red book with a torn corner, a coffee mug with steam rising, a blue lamp, a wooden chair, and a small crack in the wall.”*

 

**Name 4 things you can hear.**

· Tune in to background sounds, near or far.

· Example: *“I hear a clock ticking, birds outside, my own breathing, and distant traffic.”*

 

**Name 3 things you can feel.**

· Focus on physical sensations.

· Example: *“My feet pressing against the floor, the cool air on my skin, the warmth of my sweater.”*

 

**Name 2 things you can smell.**

· If you can’t smell anything, recall a favorite scent.

· Example: *“I smell fresh laundry and the faint scent of coffee.”*

 

**Name 1 thing you can taste.**

· Take a sip of water, chew gum, or simply recall a familiar taste.

· Example: *“I taste mint from my toothpaste.”*

 

**Key Tip:** Say each observation **slowly and deliberately** to fully engage your senses. If needed, repeat the process to deepen the grounding effect.

 

This exercise helps **redirect attention from depressive thoughts to the external world**, providing a **moment of presence and stability.**

 

**The way I describe it is that it “gets me out of my head.” When I am depressed the pain is in my head, not my body.**

 It is particularly important to me, and for the benefit of others as well, that you report back here your results with whichever method you have chosen. If you have success, that should be affirming for others. If there are problems, we can discuss.

1jt2fbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1jt2fbb/my_wonderful_albeit_slightly_chaotic_first_6/,My wonderful albeit slightly chaotic first 6 months nomading in Europe.,"Hey all,

Slightly tipsy post coming through, but feeling very grateful for the DN life right now and wanted to share my experience. Currently having some pints in Ohrid, Macedonia. FWIW i'm a technical writer and music software developer, and as much as i've moved around a lot, i've also worked plenty. 

I was part-time DNing for years, but commited fully in October. Left the UK with my car, starting with 85 days in Spain. Started with a month in Valencia, then a month in a coliving in Culla, where i had one of the most wholesome months of my life. Then, just less than a month in Barcelona, couple weeks in LA for work, and then drove to Italy. 

Only spent a couple days driving through Italy before i got a ferry to Durres, Albania. Anyone who has spent time in Albania knows how wonderful of a time i had there. Spent one month in a stunning penthouse in Serandë for €500 a month. Then, saw some friends in Don Bosko, tirana for a week, spent a week in Shkoder, another week in Kukës, then Peshkopi, Tirana, and then a few days in Pogradec.

Driving in Albania was a blast. Yes, it's fucking mental, but if you're a confident driver, it's really quite fun and the views are unmatched in Europe. I actually lost my car's logbook somewhere in Spain, so had a whole lot of nightmares convincing Albanian police to give me my car back and let me enter. More of that coming up.

At this point, i realize im overstaying my Albania visa-free period and need to leave ASAP, but have no documents to leave the region. Decided to try and blag it into Macedonia. At the border i get denied entry because of lack of documentation and get sent back to Albania. Worse case scenario happens; i'm now in no mans land and Albania wont let me back in either. Worse still, i then get taken into a warehouse where they drug search me (thankfully they didnt find my LSD lol). 

During this search, a Macedonian policeman finds a metal box in my car containing a €10 shaving kit. It looked fancy but really isnt. The policeman bizarrely becomes obsessed with it, he really wanted it. He told me that if i gifted it to him, along with €20, he'd escort me into Macedonia. I was in quite the pickle so that was a win-win for us both. 5 mins later, he escorts me across the border and i've bought myself 90 days of freedom in Macedonia.

I headed straight to Ohrid, where i have been for the last 2 weeks. What a lovely city! Very affordable yet much more developed than other spots in the Balkans. Steve's Coffee House is ideal for DNs and all the locals have been super friendly. WiFi has admittedly been shit, but i might be spoilt from the weirdly excellent coverage in even the most rural spota in Albania.

I'm now kinda stuck in Macedonia with no car paperwork, but i've ordered replacememt documents which should arrive in the UK soon. Previously ordered them to UK and got them sent to Ohrid, but think they got lost in the mail. My family are going on holiday to Cyprus in May, so i've booked tickets there from Sofia and as long as i can get there, my problem will be solved as they'll bring the docs. I do face the problem of getting into Bulgaria, but from what i've heard, another €20 slipped in my passport should do the trick. Worse case scenario i shall leave my car in Skopje and get the bus to Sofia. 

So thats my DN journey so far! Would highly recommend DNing with a car... i've got all the office and music equipment i need, as well as cooking kit, camping gear, and bedding. FWIW, I earn around €3500 a month as a freelance technical writer and music producer/plugin developer. so nowhere near as high earnings as most people on this sub, but still managed to save about €2,500 a month. I've experienced a lot of hate on this sub on an alt for promoting a budget DN lifestyle, but i cant emphasize enough that i have not only survived, but thrived in very nice apartments and even penthouses for €1000 a month. This was harder in spain but still very possible (my coliving was only €500 a month for a double bed and ensuite, for example. Check out RuralCo, it's lovely!!!). In the balkans, €1000 has been plenty for eating out most nights and nice accom. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading! Writing this helped me kill 30 mins whilst having a solo pint haha (one of 5 i must admit). I just think i read a lot of negativity on this sub, as well as people claiming you need to earn €5,000 a month to get by. I hope some aspiring DNs read this and give it a go, because i for one have had a blast. 

Much love!  ",5,1743968087.0,digitalnomad,5,1.0,False

1jt27tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jt27tq/expanding_the_toolkit_strategies_for_easing/,Expanding the Toolkit: Strategies for Easing Anxiety & Depression,"Hello All,

Being one who has suffered anxiety and depression my entire life, and knowing how terrible it can be, I have spent much work writing this post as a labor of love hoping that others may find some relief using known techniques which I have here gathered in one place. 

Before diving in, I want to **set one boundary:** this post is **not about medication.** Decisions regarding psychotropic drugs should be made in consultation with a **psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, or medical doctor trained in psychopharmacology.**

The question of whether to take medication or not is **complex**—one that must be carefully considered on an individual basis.

Over **50 years ago**, during my first psychoanalysis (1970–1976), the rule was **absolute:** no medication, no matter how severe the symptoms. And, indeed, most of my **anxiety and depression resolved without it.**

Fast forward to **November 2024**, when I began my second analysis. This time, I was suffering from **incapacitating anxiety and depression.** I initially decided to **tough it out**, believing I should face it unaided—but my analyst, an **M.D., advised against this.**

Following that advice, I sought out a **competent psychiatrist** here in the **Dominican Republic**, where I am retired, who prescribed the SSRI **sertraline**. It has made a **meaningful difference**—helping to ease my symptoms while still allowing me to **experience my emotions fully, observe my mood shifts, and explore their underlying causes.** Now, I have **the best of both worlds**: symptom relief from **both medication and analysis**, allowing me to work more deeply in my treatment while maintaining stability in my daily life.

# What This Post Is About\

Since medication is **only one piece of the puzzle**, I want to explore **other** approaches that can help ease anxiety and depression—techniques that can be used **alongside analysis, therapy, or medication.**

In my experience, techniques for **reducing anxiety** tend to yield **quicker** results than those for **easing depression.** Depression, by nature, often requires **a longer and more sustained effort** to improve. Because of this, I’ll start with anxiety—breaking it down into three key areas:

**(1) Anxiety attacks**

**(2) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

**(3) Somatic anxiety**

I’ve personally experienced all of the above, applied the techniques I’ll be describing, and achieved **varied results.** Since every individual responds differently, the best way to approach any technique is to **test it, tweak it, and assess its impact for yourself.**

# 1. Managing Anxiety Attacks: The Role of Breathing in Biochemistry

Anxiety attacks follow a distinct **biochemical progression**, beginning with **hyperventilation**, which causes **respiratory alkalosis**—a state where too much CO₂ is exhaled, increasing blood pH. This triggers:

· **Cerebral vasoconstriction** → dizziness, lightheadedness, and depersonalization.

· **Reduced ionized calcium** → muscle twitching, numbness, tingling.

· **Activation of the sympathetic nervous system** → adrenaline surge, rapid heart rate, and heightened panic.

· **Oxygen-hemoglobin shift (Bohr effect)** → less oxygen to tissues, worsening breathlessness.

# Reversing an Impending Attack: Pursed-Lip Breathing

A proven method to stop an anxiety attack is **pursed-lip breathing**:

**(1) Inhale slowly through the nose.**

**(2) Exhale through pursed lips (as if blowing out a candle), prolonging the exhale.**

This technique **restores CO₂ levels**, **corrects blood pH**, **improves brain oxygenation**, and **shifts the body into a parasympathetic (calm) state**—reversing the attack.

!! **Pro tip:** Practice when calm so it becomes second nature in anxious moments.

**2. Managing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Engaging the Body’s Relaxation Response**

# The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and Its Two Branches

The **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** regulates involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, respiration, and digestion. It has two primary branches:

**(1) Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) – “Fight or Flight”**

· Activated by stress and anxiety, increasing heart rate, breathing, and alertness.

**(2) Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) – “Rest and Digest”**

· Counteracts stress, slowing heart rate, promoting digestion, and inducing relaxation.

A key player in activating the **parasympathetic response** is the **vagus nerve**, which extends from the brainstem and influences the heart, lungs, and digestive system. **Stimulating the vagus nerve** signals the body to switch from a stress state to a relaxed state.

# Diaphragmatic Breathing: Activating the “Rest and Digest” Response

**Diaphragmatic breathing** (also called belly breathing) **directly engages the parasympathetic nervous system**, overriding the stress-induced fight-or-flight response. By slowing and deepening your breath, you stimulate the **vagus nerve**, which lowers heart rate, reduces muscle tension, and promotes a sense of calm.

**How to Practice (Lying Down Position):**

**(1) Lie on your back** in a comfortable position.

**(2) Hand placement:**

· Place **one hand on your chest**.

· Slide the **other hand below the sternum** and rest it palm-down on your upper abdomen (**diaphragm**).

**(3) Breathing mechanics:**

· Inhale **slowly through the nose**, filling your belly with air.

· Keep the **chest hand still**—only the **diaphragm hand should move up and down**.

· Imagine your belly button **gently pressing toward your spine** as you inhale. **Exhale slowly** through the nose or pursed lips, letting the belly deflate.

· **Key points:**

\*\*The **chest hand must remain stationary**—movement should come from the belly.  
\*\***Practice when calm** to master the technique before using it in anxious moments.  
\*\*Once comfortable, you can use diaphragmatic breathing **while sitting, walking, or even jogging**.

# How Many Breaths?

Relief varies by person, but **15-20 deep cycles** often bring noticeable relaxation. Some may experience a **brief lag time** between finishing the exercise and feeling calm.

**3. Managing Somatic Anxiety: Engaging the Body to Regain Calm**

# What Is Somatic Anxiety? (vs. Cognitive Anxiety)

Anxiety manifests in **two primary ways**:

**(1) Cognitive Anxiety** – Characterized by **excessive worrying, racing thoughts, and mental distress.**

**(2) Somatic Anxiety** – Anxiety **felt in the body**, often presenting as **tightness in the chest, stomach discomfort, muscle tension, dizziness, or shortness of breath.**

While cognitive anxiety is more **thought-based**, **somatic anxiety** is rooted in **physical sensations** triggered by **autonomic nervous system activity**—particularly **sympathetic arousal (""fight or flight"").**

**Where is somatic anxiety usually felt?**

I**t is commonly experienced in the torso**, including the **chest, stomach, diaphragm, and sometimes the throat**—areas where the **autonomic nervous system** has strong physiological effects.

# Option 1: Diaphragmatic Breathing (First-Line Intervention)

**Since** **somatic anxiety is body-based**, **body-based interventions work best.**

  
**Diaphragmatic breathing**, as previously described, directly engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, signaling the body to shift from **""fight or flight"" to ""rest and digest.""**

· **Slows breathing and heart rate**

· **Reduces muscle tension**

· **Promotes a sense of physical relaxation**

For many people, **this is the fastest and most effective way to counteract somatic anxiety.**

# Option 2: Mindfulness and Its Neurological Basis

While diaphragmatic breathing directly **calms the nervous system**, **mindfulness** works differently—it **shifts how the brain processes anxiety.**

**The Neuroscience of Mindfulness:**

· **Activates the prefrontal cortex**, which regulates emotional responses.

· **Reduces amygdala reactivity**, lowering the intensity of fear and anxiety.

· **Enhances interoception** (awareness of bodily sensations), helping you observe rather than react to discomfort. 

Mindfulness does not **engage the parasympathetic system** the way diaphragmatic breathing does, but it **can reduce the fear of losing control over one’s body and sense of self**, a major feature of GAD.

# Mindfulness Practice for Somatic Anxiety

**(1) Best position**: Sitting or lying down, but can be done anytime, anywhere.

**(2) Use your breathing as an anchor** – Focus on the sound and sensation of your breath.

**(3)Thoughts will arise—this is normal.**

**(4) Do not try to ""empty"" your mind.** Instead, gently return attention to the breath.

**(5) No self-criticism.** Wandering thoughts are part of the process.

# Summary: Choosing the Right Tool

✅ **Diaphragmatic Breathing** – Engages the **parasympathetic nervous system**, providing **direct** relief from somatic anxiety.  
✅ **Mindfulness** – While **not as physiologically calming**, it **reduces fear of losing control** and enhances **a sense of self-boundary**, helping ease distressing GAD symptoms.

Both approaches can be valuable, depending on the situation. **Experiment, evaluate, and refine** to see what works best for you.

  **Depression**

 **Managing Depression: Strategies for Activation and Engagement**

 

Depression is harder to manage than anxiety because it is a **state of underactivation** rather than overactivation. While anxiety involves **excessive autonomic arousal** (which can be calmed with physiological techniques like breathing), depression is characterized by **low dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine**, leading to **fatigue, low motivation, and emotional blunting.** This makes non-medication relief more challenging because the very actions needed for improvement—movement, engagement, and stimulation—are the hardest to initiate.

# Interventions for Managing Depression

# 1. Behavioral Activation (Breaking the Cycle of Inertia)

**What it does:** Trains the brain to associate small actions with **reward and motivation**, counteracting the tendency to withdraw.

**How to do it:** Work! The activity could be intellectual or physical.

**2.** **Social Engagement (Counteracting Isolation and Emotional Blunting)**

**What it does:** Depression often **shuts down** the brain’s social reward system, making interactions feel **draining** rather than fulfilling. But **passive isolation worsens symptoms.**

**How to do it: Direct contact with a friend or family member. When you are not depressed, create a network of people you trust who would be willing to go “live” with you when you are in crisis.**

**3. Grounding Exercise: Engaging the Five Senses to Break Depressive Rumination**

I find that this helps for severe depression.

**What it does:** Depression often pulls attention **inward**, creating **rumination, detachment, and emotional numbness.** Grounding techniques **shift focus outward** by engaging the five senses, helping to **reconnect with the present moment.**

**How to do it (5-4-3-2-1 method):**

**Name 5 things you can see.**

· Look around and describe five objects in detail.

· Example: *“I see a red book with a torn corner, a coffee mug with steam rising, a blue lamp, a wooden chair, and a small crack in the wall.”*

**Name 4 things you can hear.**

· Tune in to background sounds, near or far.

· Example: *“I hear a clock ticking, birds outside, my own breathing, and distant traffic.”*

**Name 3 things you can feel.**

· Focus on physical sensations.

· Example: *“My feet pressing against the floor, the cool air on my skin, the warmth of my sweater.”*

**Name 2 things you can smell.**

· If you can’t smell anything, recall a favorite scent.

· Example: *“I smell fresh laundry and the faint scent of coffee.”*

**Name 1 thing you can taste.**

· Take a sip of water, chew gum, or simply recall a familiar taste.

· Example: *“I taste mint from my toothpaste.”*

**Key Tip:** Say each observation **slowly and deliberately** to fully engage your senses. If needed, repeat the process to deepen the grounding effect.

This exercise helps **redirect attention from depressive thoughts to the external world**, providing a **moment of presence and stability.**

**The way I describe it is that it “gets me out of my head.” When I am depressed the pain is in my head, not my body.**

**I would be very gratified, and it would be helpful for others, if you would report your results here to note any problems or refinements.**

I still remember the day it happened to my daughter. We were out shopping, and suddenly, her breathing became labored. It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life! Thankfully, we managed to get her to her inhaler just in time. But that day sparked an unquenchable fire in me—what if there was a way to lessen these occurrences?

After countless brainstorming sessions (and maybe a few late nights fueled by coffee ☕), I discovered an article about a French inventor who was inspired by a similar experience with his daughter's asthma. He created a revolutionary air purifier designed to tackle allergens and pollutants head-on. 🌿 

Here’s a quick rundown of what I found inspiring about his journey:
- **Real Motivation:** Pushed by his daughter's health struggles, his invention became a long-term mission.
- **Innovative Solutions:** The air purifier focuses on reducing airborne irritants, which all of us can relate to in our daily battles.
- **Community Impact:** He’s not just stopping at personal gains; he’s looking to make a difference for families everywhere living with asthma and allergies.

This story got me thinking—what changes can we make in our environments to support our loved ones? I started making small changes around the house, like ensuring we have good ventilation, using hypoallergenic bedding, and incorporating plants that naturally purify the air. 🌱

I signed up quite early (admittedly in part due to all the gear giveaways for early signup) and got all of my stuff mailed to me.

This year I signed up last weekend, but only for the half, thinking it would be a good way to kick my running into gear for the summer. I did not realize that there is no race-day packet pickup. I was planning to drive in the morning of the race (did this last year) but that’s not a possibility now.

So…reaching out to see if anyone plans to pick their packet up on Friday and if I could potentially pay them (either money or via coffee / protein chews / etc :) ) to pick my stuff up and grab it Friday.

Note: I’m not the biggest fan of coffee shops that utilize counter culture coffee, nothing against them but in LA, coffee shops come and go and you need to be unique - using mass / commercially available beans really limits that.  

Got there at the wrong time- a yoga class just let out and there was a 15+ person line.  

Layout inside is stupid. The person taking your order basically has their back to the door the whole time. Seems weird. 

Got a seasonal ube ice latte, it was great. It’s clearly a drink that will hide almost any taste of coffee but very enjoyable.

 I usually have no problem going forty+ hours. This morning, I woke up dreaming about food I was very hungry last night when I went to bed. I actually gained 2.5lb since yesterday 🤣

Im wondering if my electrolytes were out of balance and I had a bit too much salt causing me to retain water???

This morning I have had 200mg magnesium glycinate a couple cups of coffee and 2 bottles of water. About 600mg potassium maybe 150mg sodium.  Hunger has subsided, feeling better. I didn't monitor electrolytes yesterday.  Not sure how long I'm going to let this fast run, but it's all good right now. 

I'm using Hydrate Electrolyte Formula with a little ''no-salt' added for extra potassium. I think i hit the electrolytes a little too hard yesterday, does that sound right? ",1,1743966735.0,fasting,2,0.67,False

It is my super power. I can survive off of nothing. Like the Japanese cockroaches circa 1945. I thrive in the flames, I thrive in the chaos, I thrive when others fail. I thrive in the face of indiscriminate pain from an unwavering force millions of miles away. 

My stomach has torn a hole through my belly. I am nothing but an empty hole, filled with cheap liquor and expensive drugs. Cheap drugs are my crutch. I drink coffee until my teeth rot out. I smoke until my gums rot out. I take horse tranquilizers until my brain rots out. I burn my retinas with the harshest light deep into the night until my face melts into my hands.  

I might be going insane. I might be tired but I might be more awake than I’ve ever been in my life. I’ve entered a flow state of being. I can slip between the shadows of the day to stay in my kingdom of darkness. I might be going insane.

Most of them are locally roasted (northern Europe) and, I can tell that its decaf, but it still tastes more or less the same. I've now tried 4 or 5 italian decafs, ranging from Neapolitan to northern Italian (so, pretty dark to medium or so). 3 of them have had an unexpected and really strong nutty / amaretto taste. Sometimes so strong that I thought the coffee was flavored. And in one case, completely unlike the other blemds produced by the brand , for the other two I haven't tasted their regular beans. The beans are from Passalacqua and Mokito, don't remember the third, but it was a sort of higher end Italian brand. I'm not fond of third wave and I have really enjoyed some higher end, fresh, but medium to dark Italian beans, just not so much these weird decafs.

I'm just wondering if I just got (un)lucky? Is this something that happens in Italy? Is it a result of a certain process? Again, it has not happened with the (more or less italian style) decafs that are roasted outside of Italy. I hope this makes sense!",2,1743966673.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1jt1via,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jt1via/i_need_to_know_if_what_ive_done_is_irredeemable/,I need to know if what I've done is irredeemable in the eyes of God.,"Let me start this question by telling you, I have been pregnant. I’ve blamed many things on so-called “pregnancy brain”, spilling drinks, sleeping in past church service, forgetting to pick my husband up from the airport. These are all completely understandable for a woman that’s going to pop in a few days. I need to assure you that the events unfolding in the past week cannot be explained away by blaming me for the thing formed in my belly. 

My husband works a good enough job, and we were in a good enough place for me to take the last trimester of my pregnancy off of work. I’m normally the youth pastor for the Community of Christ church young women’s groups, leading lessons at 9 AM every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. I didn’t want to take time off, but my husband insisted I wasn’t able to keep the house clean enough, and dinners were getting sloppy. I’ll admit he was right. Before the pregnancy, I was able to clean both upstairs and downstairs bedrooms, wash the dishes, dust, do laundry, vacuum, mop, clean the fireplace, shop for food, and make dinner. After the morning sickness started kicking in… It became just coming home, vacuuming, throwing together whatever we had in the fridge, and falling asleep. All that to say, I’ve been home for the past month. Hours had blurred into weeks and, for a while, time was only measured by the back pain and a gradually swelling stomach, days leading closer to my due date. That was the case, until only a few days ago. 

I didn’t sleep well last Sunday night. The grandfather clock in the corner of our bedroom moved so loudly, every tick brought about a new wave of nausea. The CPAP machine on my husband was like the buzzing of a thousand tiny insects crawling on my skin. Everytime I closed my eyes, it felt as though fingers were sticking their way through my closed mouth and laying limply inside my throat. My teeth closed tightly and ground themselves. My eyes burned from tears. I finally got up, fully unable to tempt sleep, and sat by the slowly dying fireplace, the only small light in a large, empty home. I felt miserable, and guilty for feeling so miserable. Pregnancy was meant to be a miracle from God, so why did it feel like a punishment? I choked on the tears burning my throat and looked to the only hope I could find when agony felt unending. The Word itself. I looked at the soot falling slowly by my feet, and tried to recall the verse in Isaiah that says “For those who grieve, give them a crown of beauty, not a crown of ashes.” I tried to pray, but instead quickly rushed to the sink to throw up. 

Needless to say, it was difficult to get up on Monday. The exhaustion was palpable, as my husband made known as soon as he saw me get up from bed.

“God, you look horrible, why are your eyes puffy?” The way he looked at me was reminiscent of the way one looks at a spot of mold on bread. He sipped his coffee dryly. 

“Maybe allergies, it is springtime soon after all.”

“Getting closer to the due date, it seems to be harder for you. Difficulty has become the new normal around here, probably more hormones.” This last part, he said in a muttering whisper.

I tidied up in the bathroom, putting a cold rag on my eyes to get rid of any residual evidence of my tears last night. When I came out, my husband was standing in the kitchen, dressed for work, pouring milk into his second cup of coffee. I came up to wish him a good day at work and a kiss, but froze when I saw his newly-filled cup. Inside was a dark, wiggling mass. Six legs pushed the cream into waves and antennae kissed the rim. In a split second, I hit his cup out of his hand and could only look as it shattered onto the linoleum floor.

“What the hell?! Oh, God damn it!” His voice stung at me, I hated when he cursed. 

“I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Ah, I saw a… bug or something in your cup.”

“There wasn’t anything in the cup, I just poured it! You must have… ah fuck, I need to go.”

“I’m sorry, I swear it was right there-” The door hurriedly closing cut my sentence off short, “I love you.” I said to the empty house. 

After the shards were placed in the trash and the coffee scrubbed from the floor, I got dressed and looked at my daily list of chores. Dishes were first. They were always first. I barely knew why I looked at the list anymore, I just did. As I gathered my washing gloves from a drawer, something caught my attention from the very corner of my eye. The soft morning glow normally painted the windows nicely, but today, right in the corner, there was a spider. A small black blotch on a lovely picture. When I turned to face it fully, it had already disappeared from sight. I wondered for a second if there was a web in our room, and if those venomous bites would grace my husband instead of me. My stomach flipped in anxiety as I pushed the thought away. Perhaps, for just today, dusting would be first. 

I was certain I’d cleaned every corner, I’d even checked some of them twice, but there was no trace of the spider. I was checking the last spot I’d cleaned when I saw it again, but this time, there were more. They were big, maybe wolf spiders or brown recluses. Little black pellets just far enough that I couldn’t reach them. I could almost feel their eyes following me, silently laughing at the pitiful housewife’s plight. My heart raced as I felt anger surge into me. The baby kicked. I rushed to the kitchen to grab a bucket and filled it with scalding water and bleach. If I couldn’t brush the creature away, I’d make its living space uninhabitable. I scrubbed the mixture onto the corners of the walls. I would see them skitter in every other room, so I scrubbed harder until I couldn’t see them anymore. It took the whole morning, but when it was finally done, I felt accomplished. I decided I had done so well, I could rest for the latter half of the day. I opened a window to feel the fresh breeze as I lay in bed. No CPAP rumbling made it easy to close my eyes. Rather than the clock’s ticks feeling painful, they lulled me into a soft sort of sleep. We could order out for dinner. 

“Hello? Anyone home?” I awoke to my husband’s tired candor echoing through the hall.

 “Are you okay?” 

My eyes fluttered open. I didn’t answer right away and took time to stretch and take note of how I was feeling. Despite the tenderness of my body, I did feel better. Perhaps sleep is all I really needed. 

“Yeah, I’m in here! Just getting up.” I sat up and saw stars for a moment, blinking my eyes to try and clear them. As my eyes refocused, I looked toward the corner of the room where my husband’s clothes’ hamper lay. Though I had cleaned them not five hours before, there were stains on them. I got up to look as the stains ran red, purple, then white. I felt confused, then quickly fearful. This was only one of the few things I’d done to maintain the house today, and they looked worse than before they were washed. I needed to hide them from my husband’s wandering eyes until I could fix this. He couldn’t know that I had done this. The baby kicked as I grabbed the hamper to place it in the laundry room.

After dinner, the sun had fully set into the earth, and darkness had crept in. My husband had shut the bedroom window when he came back from work, so I opened it after getting my nighttime clothes on. 

My husband poked his head from the bathroom, “Can you keep it closed? The bugs get in when it stays open all night.” 

“No, it’s warm after we had the fire going, I’d like the night air to cool me down. Besides, you said this morning there weren’t any bugs in here.”

“I didn’t say that, I just didn’t think there were any in my coffee. Just, please, keep it closed.”

“There were. There were tons of bugs in here today, they’ll get in whether the window is opened or closed.” My tone had gotten a bit louder than I anticipated.

“Baby… I’ll get a screen for us tomorrow, or we can not have a fire just-” I cut him off,

“No! I’m tired. I’m nauseous. I’m in pain! I’m fucking pregnant! Let me have one thing for me, one choice that I get to make!” I was screaming. The baby kicked and my voice turned into a gnarled groan as I moved. I had never spoken to my husband this way. I never even realized these were thoughts that could get turned into words. These weren’t my words. My body moved like a puppet without my brain actively telling it to do so. My hands were on the window.

“You want it closed? Fine!” With more strength than I had ever wielded, the window slammed shut, wood cracked. “It’s god-damn closed!” 

We were tentative with each other Tuesday morning. My heart pounded and my head felt cloudy as I went through the motions of making breakfast. I tried to keep Ephesians’ 4:31-32  in my thoughts, but it kept slipping away. *Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and… and…*

The baby moved and I lost my thoughts again. I had thrown up twice since five AM. 

“Where are my clothes? I found something that works for today, but I’ll need the rest of them for the week.” I thought I felt a tremor of submerged anger in his voice, my anxiety spiked instantly.

“I… I just didn’t get to drying them. They’re in the washer now.” I lied with a small smile, it felt easier than any other words would have.

“Alright, well, just be sure they’re done today, okay?” He hadn’t recognized I’d lied at all. I was always told by the church that lies were Satan’s words, and God’s true light would always show deceit as it was. I had never lied to my husband before, and he just accepted it as plain truth. My face grew warm with fear, and I turned so he wouldn’t see, blood rushing in my ears. Once I was calm again, I turned but the house was again, empty. 

I could do no more than slowly lower onto the kitchen floor, perplexed. I felt like a different person, out of body from who I was only one week prior. Something had gone wrong with me, not in my brain or body, but in my soul. I felt a deep darkness inside of me, one the pastor’s of my life had warned against again and again. I grabbed my bible from the shelf and immediately sat cross-legged before the fireplace to read. I checked the time, 7:45 AM. I thought that I could begin a routine where I read for an hour in the morning, and an hour at night. I was lost in thought as to how this would change my schedule, when I looked at the clock again, it was 1:13 PM. I blinked and turned to look at the kitchen clock. The same number, 1:13. Was this some kind of trick? Did I really just lose five hours of time sitting and thinking? How?



I looked at the bible and realized I was turned to the book of Psalm. I steeled myself to still read for the hour anyway, when I felt a tingling sensation up my back as though I was being watched. I tried to turn slowly when the fireplace tilted and slided slowly to the right of my vision. My vision melted into a cacophony of whites and yellows as I felt the bible slip from my fingers and my back press onto the floor. The child swam in rotating spirals inside of me as spiders crawled from both corners of my vision to devour me. I turned my head in fear of what I was seeing. My vision faded as I saw my leg and arm shaking viciously. Words were the only thing I could see now. “Behold, the wicked man conceives evil, and is pregnant with mischief.” I tried to speak, but couldn’t.

I awoke in a puddle, breathing heavily. The air felt thick and putrid, so that I couldn’t fill my lungs as I gasped. I knew that days had passed, and yet here I was still lying on the floor. I was able to bring myself up, knowing the Lord gave me a sign. A high-pitched chirping joined the ringing in my ears, as though the birds outside had been replaced by hateful simulacrums of God’s creations. Bugs covered every surface before I could look at them, the small black specks made my once beautiful home look unlivable. Insects make one unclean, make the home a sinful place. I had been happy once, even hopeful about this child, raising him as God tells us to raise all our children. But thinking back to the past week, every time I had a sinful thought, every second I felt angry or hateful, there the baby was. Vengefulness at the spiders, lying to my husband, screaming at him, in each moment the baby kicked and writhed. It gained pleasure from my sinful acts, gained power from my weakness. A good mother would never feel lonely in the presence of her own child, therefore, the creature living in me could not be a child of my making. This thing is the difference in my life that has changed me from pious to evil. So, as God would have me do, I decided to rid myself of all worldly things and turn to Him. 

The door opened and my husband stepped through, seeing me in my clarity. 

“Don’t be afraid!” I stood and walked to him, “I know you’ve forsaken me these last few days, but we can still be a whole family again.” My voice was quickening, unwavering. I knew what I needed to say but I couldn’t hear it over the noise.

He took my wrist and said something. I wrenched myself from his grasp as I felt a dawn of realization. The words I had read before my collapse. 

“You. You must be the wicked man I was warned of! You impregnated me with evil, and left me for days to give birth to a demon!” My hands groped for the knife block behind me near the kitchen sink. My husband was shouting, his words were only an addition to the loud ringing in my head, more noise I needed to block out to do what the Lord was leading me towards. 

My husband looked frightened as my hands touched steel, but as quickly as I brought the knife into view, I turned it on myself. Cold sharpness glided through my stomach easily, shredding through clothes. The point of my pelvis to the underneath of my breasts was open, and I could see the back of the creature through my wound. Blood flowed over its body and the agony was ceaseless as I tried to rip it out. The placenta fell to the ground, cut by the blade, and slapped wetly at my feet. I couldn’t grip the child, slipping into unconsciousness, my fingers grew numb. The demon’s head turned out of my open body, its eyes opening in the darkest red as blood ran from its open mouth. The maw gaped wide and the tongue danced like fire, speaking languages I knew all too well were chants to stop my doing of the Lord’s will. Knowing I had limited time, my hands trembled as I tried to find the point where I could stab the body to end it. Every pump of my heart made my sparks fly in front of me which grew into a haze of white light surrounding my body. Finally, all grew quiet in the heavenly glow, the ground rushed upwards and I heard a thud and felt myself lose all breath in a dulled whimper.

The doctors say it’s only a miracle that I’m alive, that some angel must have me in their wings. I still can’t speak clearly, that part of my brain may never heal, so I speak to most by typing on this computer and having it read aloud. My memory is fine, they seem to think I have some form of “dementia” but, as you can see, every memory I wrote has been recollected clearly. I think my husband has been in contact with them, and decided to blame my “pregnancy” for this. I hear them talking of brain damage, nerve damage, and of the chimney not being cleaned enough. I can’t keep listening to this. The police have come in, but most times I pretend to be unconscious, sometimes I really am. They speak in hushed tones to one another, almost as if they’re afraid of what I may do once I wake. A woman’s voice said that I didn’t look as though I was capable of committing such an evil deed. Evil. That stuck with me for hours afterwards. Family hasn’t visited since I found myself here. My husband is gone, I couldn’t tell you where. All I can think of is I John 1:7: “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.”

I need help. I can feel the Lord has left me since I’ve been here. Can his blood cleanse this? My head is still ringing with the awful sounds of the baby’s wails and my husband’s screams. I have to know, am I still saved? Is what I did sinful? I can’t ask these people, they don’t know anything of God, but to those out there who are truly saved, please tell me what I did was right. Tell me that God still loves me, and that this is only one of his many tests. Please. Anyone.",3,1743966644.0,nosleep,0,0.71,False

1jt1tki,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jt1tki/need_helpadvicethoughts_please/,Need help/advice/thoughts PLEASE,"How my GERD diagnosis started:

I married my wife in October and went on a honeymoon to an all inclusive in Mexico. Ever since then, I’ve had chest pain/tightness. I chalked it up to generally eating poorly (with a lot of drinking) during and after the honeymoon with the holidays coming right after that. Was being really healthy in January (eliminating bad foods and working out a lot which I did a lot in the summer and fall leading to my wedding, losing 10 pounds), but the chest tightness only got worse. In mid February, I was diagnosed with acid reflux and had any heart issues ruled out by a cardiologist. I was put on omeprazole, stopped working out, stopped smoking weed (still took edibles but I’ve since almost cut that out completely) and drastically changed my diet (eliminating all the big acid triggers, including taking out coffee 2 weeks in) for 4 weeks and it did NOTHING (if anything it worsened). I got an endoscopy after that and it revealed nothing of note in the initial review (when they called later to rule out cancer on the biopsies they threw in “chronic inflammation of the stomach”). I’m now on Pantaprozole and taking Digestive Advantage probiotics. Only been doing that a week, and I think the new medicine is maybe doing something… but I still feel like there’s something I’m not doing right or I’m being misdiagnosed.

My symptoms don’t even include burning in the threat or heartburn which I see referenced a lot in here. The middle of my chest (right below my pecs) is just very tight and painful, almost like I need to stretch and crack it (which doesn’t work). It does worsen after eating but REALLY worsened a lot after my workouts

Wondering if anyone has any thoughts, in terms of if definitely think it’s GERD or if they think I’m being misdiagnosed (I’ve recently learned of Costochondritis and this kinda seems accurate for me)

I want to return to my lifting/cardio without the symptoms flaring up, I want to resume edibles because it helps me sleep and it really reduces my stress/anxiety without the need for popping pills, and I’m fine with continuing my GERD friendly diet but I want to eat freely on special occasions.

Now that I'm not drinking, my caffeine intake has increased significantly. What used to be a mug in the morning has turned into around 4-6 coffees a day... While it's not affecting my productivity, blood pressure, sleep, anxiety, etc. (that I can tell), I'm wondering if this should raise some red flags for me? 

Of course I know caffeine is not healthy; however, it's a heck of a lot less dangerous than the litre of vodka I'd drink daily... Just looking for some advice! (& yes, I have also picked up healthy alternatives to drinking - exercising regularly, daily meditation and journalling, book clubs)..

Not for scenery. We were running. From the polite knocks of debt collectors that echoed wrong in our apartment stairwell, from the hollow resonance of the house where Chloe had spent eleven months watching cancer siphon the life from her mother. From grief that wasn't like mold—it was mold—a damp, pervasive chill clinging to our clothes, our lungs, the backs of our throats. A ""fresh start,"" we called it, the phrase tasting like ash as we steered the rented U-Haul towing my wheezing Civic. Hope felt like contraband.

It was deep night. Maybe 2 AM. The hour the world thins, when highway lines blur into hypnotic tracers pulling you toward an oblivion whispering invitations. Chloe slept beside me, head canted against the vibrating window, her breath a soft counterpoint to the engine's drone. A small mercy, her unconsciousness. My own eyes felt scoured with sandpaper, fueled by gas station coffee curdling in my gut.

That's when the radio soured.

It had been snagging classic rock through static for an hour, normal for the terrain. But Pink Floyd didn't just fade—it dissolved. Smothered by static that wasn't crisp; it was thick, wet, like listening through pond scum. Beneath it, almost subliminal, a rhythm asserted itself. Slow, deliberate.

Thump-thump... pause... thump-thump... pause...

Not a heartbeat. Something larger. Deeper. Beating in the earth beneath the asphalt.

I stabbed at buttons, twisted the dial. Nothing but that viscous hiss, the deep pulse resonating through the plastic dash, vibrating in my teeth. I killed the radio, craving silence.

The silence that rushed in felt wrong. Heavy. Pressurized. My ears popped violently, a sudden descent. Mirrors showed miles of moon-bleached emptiness behind us. Ahead, only darkness. Yet, the hairs on my arms lifted. The intimate chill of cold breath on my neck. The illogical, primal certainty of being observed.

Through the windshield, the stars burned with unnatural clarity, too numerous, constellations I didn't recognize but felt disturbingly familiar, like half-remembered symbols from a fever dream.

Then, the engine sighed. A soft exhalation of power. Dashboard lights didn't flicker; they pulsed, once, hard, in time with that hidden beat, then died. I cursed, stomped the useless gas pedal. The engine didn't seize. It simply... ceased. Like a switch thrown miles away. The U-Haul glided, momentum bleeding away with terrifying smoothness, rolling to a dead stop on the shoulder, swallowed by the wilderness.

""Liam? What—?"" Chloe startled awake, voice thick, face stark in the moonlight. The weight loss from mourning had sculpted her features into something fragile, almost translucent.

""I don't know,"" I managed, turning the key. Utterly dead. Not a click. ""Engine just... stopped.""

Panic bloomed, cold and metallic. Stranded. No cell service—confirmed an hour ago. Deep night. Nowhere.

""Okay,"" Chloe said, finding that brittle calm forged in hospital vigils. ""Okay. Someone will come. A trucker. Trooper. It's 78.""

We waited. Minutes stretched. An hour. Measured by my frantic pulse. Then another. The silence itself was the loudest thing. No crickets, no night birds, no rustling. Just the profound weight of the dark, pressing in. And beneath it all, felt more than heard, that rhythm from the radio—Thump-thump... pause...—vibrating up through the tires, humming in my fillings.

Chloe rubbed her temples, knuckles white. ""This isn't right, Liam,"" she whispered, eyes huge, scanning the void. ""Not one car? Not even distant lights? On 78?""

She was right. It was a major artery. Even now, semis should be thundering past. The emptiness felt deliberate. Curated.

Then I saw it. Not headlights. Faint, diffuse lights, shivering through dense trees maybe half a mile ahead, bleeding from a barely-there track peeling off the highway. A track I hadn't noticed, wasn't on any map. No sign.

""Look,"" I pointed, hope a weak, sputtering flare. ""Lights. Town? Gas?""

Anything felt better than this waiting dark. ""Stay here. Lock up,"" I said, grabbing the Maglite.

""No."" Chloe grabbed her jacket, hand finding mine, grip tight. Her mother had coded while they were grabbing regrettable cafeteria coffee. She hadn't willingly left my side since. ""Together.""

The track was rutted dirt, hemmed in by trees whose branches interlaced like gnarled fingers. The air grew instantly colder, thick with the damp, loamy smell of recently disturbed earth. Like a fresh grave, the thought surfaced, unwelcome. With each step, the pulsing rhythm grew stronger, no longer just sensed but physically felt—a vibration rising through our shoes, synchronized with that hidden beat.

The lights resolved into a small, impossibly isolated town cupped in a hollow.

But the town... it was fundamentally wrong.

Like a scale model, disturbingly pristine. Picket fences too white, houses too symmetrical, windows glowing warmly but revealing no movement. No cars, no litter, no barking dogs, no TV murmur. Preserved under glass. And the silence... not absence of sound, but sound suppressed. Held down. Digested. The air itself felt thick, resistant.

The feeling of being watched intensified tenfold. Behind every flawless window, unseen eyes. Waiting.

A single building stood centrally lit: 'GARAGE', the faded sign declared. Lamplight spilled.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded obscene, yet flat, absorbed by the dead air. No echo. ""Anyone? Our truck... broke down on the highway.""

The large garage door slid upwards with a pneumatic hiss eerily mirroring the radio static. A figure stood silhouetted. Tall, unnaturally thin, in greasy overalls.

He stepped into the light. His face was a roadmap of deep lines, eyes a pale, clouded blue, unfocused. He didn't look at us, but through us. A disturbing resonance to his features, a distorted familiarity, though I'd never seen him. His overalls seemed stained not just with grease, but with the darkness of the asphalt itself in places.

""Broke down?"" His voice was a dry rustle, like snakeskin over sand, carrying that same damp, subterranean undertone as the static. ""On the Route?""

""Yeah. Back on 78. Engine just... cut out.""

He nodded, slow, ponderous, disconnected. Like a marionette settling. ""Happens."" He gestured vaguely back towards the unseen highway with a heavy wrench. ""The Route... she gets peckish sometimes.""

A memory surfaced—my grandfather, trucker, refusing certain stretches after sunset. ""Some roads ain't just roads,"" he'd said, eyes distant. ""Some got appetites."" I'd dismissed it as road fatigue.

The mechanic's clouded eyes fixed on Chloe with uncomfortable intensity. His gaze lingered on the hollows beneath her cheekbones. ""Pulls 'em right off the asphalt, she does. The ones carrying weight.""

Chloe's fingers dug into my arm. ""Can you help? Tow truck?""

A sound scraped from his throat, a dry, rattling approximation of a chuckle. ""Tow truck won't help none. Not if the Route's taken a fancy."" He looked towards the highway again, a flicker of recognition in those clouded eyes. ""She's particular.""

Ice traced my veins. ""What are you talking about?""

""This stretch,"" he said, wiping grimy hands on an equally grimy rag, achieving nothing. ""They call it Echo Canyon. Not on your maps."" He tapped his ear lightly. ""Things get... thin here. The seam between what was and what is."" His gesture encompassed the surrounding town. ""Folks stop. Or they get... stopped. And they... settle.""

As he spoke, I became aware of others. Emerging silently from the perfect houses. Drifting onto porches, standing in doorways. Sharing that vacant stare, moving with disjointed grace. Some wore clothes fifty years out of date. One woman in a thin hospital gown shivered despite the still air. Another clutched a small teddy bear, tears streaming continuously down hollow cheeks. They weren't just standing; they were positioned, angled subtly toward the earth. As if listening. Waiting for instruction from below.

""The Route notices,"" the mechanic continued, gaze drifting. ""Especially folks carrying something heavy."" His eyes locked onto Chloe again. ""Grief's got a... resonance. Draws the attention.""

""This is insane,"" I whispered, but a cold dread recognized truth.

""Insanity's thinking highways are just concrete."" His lips stretched into something like a smile, revealing teeth stained an oily black. ""They're veins. Carrying things."" He seemed to listen for a moment. ""Some feed. Some... collect.""

Chloe stiffened. ""The rhythm,"" she whispered. ""I feel it inside my head now.""

The mechanic nodded, his movements suddenly smoother, synchronizing. ""The pulse. You feel it, don't you?"" He pressed a filthy hand against his chest. Thump-thump... pause... His eyes took on an unnatural shine. ""The Route's voice. Whispering.""

And I did hear it now. Not just felt. A low-frequency vibration from my own bones. As if it had always been there. Indistinct impressions formed in the pulse: Stay... Rest... Belong...

""What is this place?"" Chloe breathed, gaze fixed on a woman across the street. Gaunt, hollow-cheeked, eyes lost... Dear God, the resemblance to Chloe's mother in the final weeks was sickeningly real.

""Rest stop,"" the mechanic said, lips pulling back further. Learned, not felt. ""For the ones the Route holds onto. We keep things tidy. Wait.""

""Wait for what?"" My voice cracked.

""For... incorporation,"" he said, the word clinical, chilling. His face seemed to shimmer, like heat haze, something shifting beneath. The watchers rippled subtly in unison. ""Your thoughts, fears. Your grief. It all... contributes. Stabilizes things."" His voice dropped lower, ""She's ancient. Older than the road, older than the trails. Been gathering since before wheels."" He gestured at the townsfolk. ""Some are echoes. Some are... integrating.""

A woman with a jagged line across her throat stepped forward, movements fluid yet wrong. Her voice emerged not from her mouth but seemingly from the ground: ""It's peaceful. No bills. No pain. No memory of the skid..."" She tilted her head impossibly. ""The Route remembers.""

The mechanic turned back towards the garage's shadows. He glanced towards the highway, then specifically at where our U-Haul sat, unseen but known. He didn't speak, but his clouded eyes held a questioning look, a subtle inclination of his head towards the trailer carrying the Civic. The implication hung heavy in the dead air: Lighten the load, maybe?

Madness. But the alternative... staying here, becoming a vacant echo...

I felt a sudden, overwhelming compulsion. A desperate gamble. ""Okay,"" I stammered. ""The car. We'll leave the car."" Before I could second-guess, I was turning back.

As we turned, his hand shot out, clamping onto my wrist. Cold as deep earth, dry, papery. Where he touched, faint, dark lines pulsed beneath my skin like ink in water, tracing my veins in complex patterns that throbbed with the rhythm.

""The Route's got a taste now,"" he whispered, breath fetid—oil, metal, damp earth. ""Leaves a mark. Understand?""

I ripped my arm free, heart hammering. The lines receded, but a cold foreignness remained, circulating. ""Chloe, let's go.""

We practically ran back up the dirt track, the silence amplifying my frantic pulse, the unseen rhythm seeming to throb louder. Behind us, the town and its residents remained, motionless sentinels, outlines fraying slightly at the edges, blurring into the dark.

My hands shook unlocking the Civic. Tossed the keys onto the seat. As I slammed the door—the sound loud, yet instantly swallowed—I swore I saw a flicker inside, a deepening shadow in the passenger seat. Settling in. Wearing the faintest suggestion of a face—my father's. Gone when I blinked. A trick of moonlight and fear.

Back in the U-Haul, air thick with terror, I jammed the key in. Twisted.

The engine roared to life. Aggressively loud.

No hesitation. Slammed it into drive, floored it, tires spitting gravel onto the highway asphalt. I refused to look back, didn't dare check mirrors. But peripherally, a glimpse—the mechanic, standing in the middle of Route 78, watching us recede. He raised one hand slowly. Acknowledging. Marking.

""Did... did that happen?"" Chloe whispered, trembling, bleached white. ""Liam, his face... just before we got in... did you see it shift?""

I hadn't dared look. ""Drive,"" I gritted out. ""Focus. Drive.""

We pushed the complaining U-Haul. But the highway felt... elastic. We passed a uniquely twisted oak—then passed it again ten minutes later. Mile markers counted down, then jumped back up. The dashboard clock flickered: 2:17 AM... 2:17 AM... 2:17 AM. The feeling of being watched became invasive—a feeling of being digested.

The radio clicked on. Volume knob useless.

Static flooded the cab, thick, choking, smelling faintly of ozone and decay. And the pulse. Thump-thump… pause… THUMP-THUMP… pause… Pressure, vibrating the steering wheel, resonating in my sternum, shaking my teeth.

Whispers writhed within the static. Fragmented, sibilant. Not direct accusations, but echoes. Familiar voices, warped. ""...running from..."" like Chloe's mother's sigh, ""...so hungry..."" a dry rasp, like the mechanic's, ""...stay with us..."" a chorus, hollow, ""...the bills... fear..."" my own anxieties, twisted back, ""...mother's echo..."" a weeping sound, ""...taste lingers...""

Chloe whimpered, hands over ears. ""Make it stop, Liam! Please!""

Hammering the radio was futile. The whispers sharpened, weaving our rawest emotions into the static tapestry. The Route wasn't just listening; it was sampling. Archiving.

Beside me, Chloe went rigid. Her head turned, slowly, unnaturally smoothly, until she faced me. Her eyes seemed filmed over, reflecting dead dashboard lights like polished stones.

""It's inside now, Liam,"" she said, and the voice was a grotesque overlay—her pitch, the mechanic's rasp, the wet static hiss. ""The Route. It... likes this place."" Her gaze drifted downwards towards her own lap. ""It chose.""

Her face began to... waver. Less shifting, more like a faulty projection. Flashes of the mechanic's lines, the vacant townspeople's stare, a horrifying glimpse of her mother's final emaciation. Then, impossibly, a flash of my father's features—a man Chloe never met. The face from the Civic's shadow.

Ahead, the road shimmered, distorting like extreme heat haze. Asphalt seemed to liquefy, white lines writhing. The truck veered sharply, the wheel fighting me with intelligent force.

""It's pulling us back!"" I screamed, as Chloe's hand clamped onto mine—inhumanly strong, cold as the mechanic's touch.

Through the wavering mirage, shapes resolved. Tall, gaunt figures. Dozens. Standing stock-still, faces indistinct blurs of static, all oriented towards us. The townsfolk. The mechanic at their head. Waiting. Welcoming. Among them, my breath hitched—a woman with Chloe's mother's posture. A man with my father's slump. Collected echoes. And worse—a figure with my own stance, watching our approach with patient hunger.

The U-Haul surged, accelerating uncontrollably, drawn towards the assembly. Brake pedal solid, useless. The pulse from the radio reached a deafening crescendo, shaking the cab violently. THUMP-THUMP… THUMP-THUMP… THUMP-THUMP…

""It wants us!"" I yelled.

Beside me, Chloe's face contorted. ""We can rest here, Liam,"" grated that composite voice. ""All the pieces... gathered. Makes us whole again."" She gestured vaguely to her stomach. ""Makes space...""

Then, a flicker. Behind the cloudy film, Chloe's true eyes—terrified. Fighting.

Blind panic. Primal survival. I wrenched the wheel, aiming not for the road, but the ditch, the treeline, anywhere off the asphalt. The thing wearing Chloe's face shrieked—oscillating between human anguish and electronic feedback.

Metal screamed. The unseen trailer jackknifed. Steel groaned, glass imploded. We hit the soft shoulder, jarring every bone, then plowed headlong into the dark woods. Branches exploded like gunshots. A vortex of green and black. Then silence slammed down.

...

I woke hanging upside down, held by the seatbelt, cab crumpled. Acrid gasoline, crushed pine. Beside me, Chloe moaned—alive. Her eyes, fluttering open, were hers. Clear. Human. Terrified.

Distant sirens grew closer. Real sirens.

They found us near dawn, tangled twenty miles off Route 78, deep down an embankment. No tracks led from the highway. U-Haul totaled. The trailer and Civic? Vanished. Gone. Troopers exchanged baffled looks. One veteran, silvering hair, kept glancing back at the highway with an expression I recognized—unease. Like he knew something but wouldn't say it.

As they loaded Chloe into the ambulance, I noticed something. Each paramedic, each officer—their movements occasionally synced. Just for a beat. A collective pause. A rhythm. Thump-thump... pause...

We told them the lie. Swerved for a deer. Lost control. What else?

Chloe: fractured collarbone, concussion, shock. Me: cracked ribs, bruises, stitches.

In the hospital, a nurse changed Chloe's IV at 2:17 AM. The drip pulsed with her monitor. Thump-thump... pause... When I pointed, she smiled—eyes vacant for a second—and told me to rest. The intake forms had glitches in the timestamps, strange formatting errors around Route 78.

We made it to Ohio. Eventually. Cramped apartment, soul-crushing jobs. Assembling a ""fresh start"" from broken pieces. We never speak of that night. The town. The mechanic. The whispers. The price.

But the silence here is thin.

Late at night, city hum low, I feel it. Faint, rhythmic thrumming. Deep background noise. Thump-thump… pause… thump-thump… pause… Sometimes I feel it in my healed ribs, a phantom vibration.

Sometimes, fleeting movement at vision's edge—tall, gaunt, gone. Textures shimmer. Construction pile drivers sometimes sync perfectly for one beat too many. Ice floods my veins.

Maps. Satellite images of Route 78. Sometimes, a suggestion in the terrain—a vast shape, articulated, the highway a vein feeding something ancient, patient. Blink, it's gone.

Chloe feels it too. I see it. She freezes, head cocked, listening. Eyes glaze over, reflecting something unseen. Murmurs in sleep, voice raspy, low, not quite hers.

And my dreams: back in that pristine, dead town. Walking immaculate streets among silent watchers. Waiting. The mechanic leans against his workbench, wiping endless grease. That dead smile. ""Told you,"" he rasps, filling my sleeping mind. ""Nothing ever really leaves the Route clean."" I wake tasting engine oil and grave dirt.

We escaped. We left the offering. But the Route didn't just want the car. It got a taste. Sampled our static, fear, grief. Planted an echo. A seed.

Last week, Chloe confirmed it. Pregnant. Against odds, against doctors' predictions. There on the grainy ultrasound. A tiny flicker. Nascent heartbeat.

Thump-thump… pause…

Clear on the monitor. Perfectly in time with the rhythm in my bones.

The technician performing it—her eyes, just a moment, clouded. Her voice, briefly static-tinged, whispered: ""Strong rhythm for this stage. The... area... seems pleased."" She remembered nothing when I questioned her frantically. The printout of the scan seemed slightly blurry around the edges, almost vibrating.

Sometimes, I feel unseen eyes looking back. From shadows, maps, the ink itself. Listening. Waiting.

It remembers us. Thump-thump… pause… It knows where we are. Thump-thump… pause… And I feel it growing stronger. Nearer. Coming to collect.

Last night, I woke. Chloe stood at the window, staring towards the distant interstate, hand absently stroking her still-flat stomach. She turned, eyes catching the streetlight—clouded, milky, unfocused.

""It's calling us home, Liam,"" she whispered, voice layered with static. ""It misses us. It needs... what's growing.""

Her other hand, pressed against the glass, left a smear—not fingerprints. A map. The exact route from here back to that stretch of 78. Directions written in condensation on a warm night.

By morning, she remembered nothing. Just tired, she said.

I'm researching. Echo Canyon. Hungry roads. Thin places. Old forums: electrical failures, missing time, strange towns on PA highways. Obscure journals: Native warnings about paths where the land itself hungers. Where echoes gather.

I don't know what's growing inside Chloe. If it's ours anymore. But we can't stay still.

Yesterday, car keys rearranged on the counter. Outline of Pennsylvania. Today, GPS reroutes every destination through Route 78. Won't clear. Tonight, writing this, a truck idles outside. U-Haul. No driver visible.

I've looked at the bedroom doorway three times while writing this. Each time, Chloe stood there briefly, watching—except the third time, it wasn't quite Chloe. The silhouette was wrong. Too tall. The proportions stretched. In its hand, dangling, a set of keys. The idle truck outside revved once, in perfect time with the pulse in my wrist.

Thump-thump… pause…

I'm going to the window now. The U-Haul's back doors are open. I can see something inside—a shadow, person-shaped, beckoning. It's standing in front of what looks like our Civic. Impossible. The shadow has my father's posture. Behind it, more shadows. Waiting.

The keys on my desk just moved. By themselves. Pointing to the door.

It wants us back. Or rather, it wants what it started in us.

I hear Chloe in the bathroom. Running water. Humming something arrhythmic that periodically syncs with the pulse.

Thump-thump… pause…

I should run. But where? The Route is patient. It has mapped every artery of this country. And now, it's mapped us.

This will be my first time visiting Japan as a solo traveler in September and would love some feedback on my itinerary, as I feel like some of the days might be too jam packed (Days 5 and 7, for example). My goal here isn't to be planning my trip hour by hour, but instead to be able to take my time exploring and shopping certain areas as I pass through them. I don't want to rush too much just to see certain stores or shrines, especially in Kyoto where I'd want to take in the atmosphere.

Because I know somebody will ask, I'm splitting my stays in Tokyo so that the first bit can be used to explore the night life without having to worry about catching the last train in the night (especially while being slightly drunk). Also, I'm flying into Narita airport instead of Kansai International Airport because the cost was far cheaper to do so (and also its a non-refundable ticket, oops). 

For background information, general interests for this trip are to experience the night life in different cities, but also explore the nature and temples in nicer regions. I love plants, so that's why I have parks and greenhouses added. I'm also into gaming, anime, manga, etc. That's obviously why Akihabara is on the list, though as a grown ass adult, I doubt I'll find myself bringing home anime plush or figurines. But hey, maybe I'll find that one item that makes me go ""okay F it"". A lot of the shopping I'll be doing is souvenirs for friends/family, and clothing shopping for myself.

\- On day 4, is Nijo Castle a viable option to squeeze in-between a visit to Nishiki Market and Pontocho Alley? Would anyone recommend putting it in another day?

\- On day 5, is it possible to do this at all? I would like to walk the Philosopher's Path from Higashiyama Jisho-ji to Nanzen-ji in the evening, but I also see that these temples close at 5pm. Perhaps place Philosopher's Path before Kiyomizu-dera?

\- On day 6, I simply added Kinkaku-ji in the evening just because I didn't know what else to add. I would love input on what to replace it with (if anything).

\-Not sure if the afternoon in day 11 is viable with the travel time to Hakone alone plus the check-in time. Would love some input here.

\-Would love to know the best time to forward my luggage to Narita. Is the last day to do so on the Monday or Tuesday? I ask because Monday the 22nd will be my final shopping day.



That's about it. Would love some feedback on if this is possible, or recommendations for anything you would add in/remove. Thank you all in advance!",1,1743966377.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False
1jt1r1y,https://i.redd.it/y7cyt0v8j9te1.png,Should Meta Runner Continue as Comic Book?,"That's my Question and an updated version of a previous thread

I always thought would be cool to see what happens next however since there's a chance we might never get season 4 would be cool to continue the story in Comic form you know yeah Glitch made one-shot but it never went anywhere I like to see done by professionals that are fans of the Series or at least fans of Video games

My top 3 picks for publisher would be IDW, Dynamite Entertainment or Skybound/Image Comics

My idea is start with an issue #0 with Tari and Theo going into a server that has doors based on many titles from the publisher like if it's Skybound/Image Comics she would meet Invincible then the Cast from Walking Dead and Fire Power then meets Optimus Prime possibly(because of the Energon Universe) then goes to possibly world of other Image Comics titles then it ends setting up issue #1 and the first actual issue

if it's IDW It's mostly same thing basically the same thing she meets the Ninja Turtles, SONIC then cast of the main Star Terk comic and The Rocketeer

The opening arc would be set a year after the Series Finale and stuff happens Tari knows she has to warn her friends and the world and it's something and that is just the opening arc there's like an filler issue or issues in between that just few days with Tari and the Rest just chilling we see her getting coffee and a girls night out and reading a comic book and starting a duck collection like those relaxing issues between Arcs stuff they couldn't do in the show at least not much

And few spin-off comics one based on collage Runner spin-off Luke and Kevin had as comic book miniseries

My vision for a the creative team would be Ryan North(Dinosaur Comics, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Fantastic Four and STAR TREK: Lower Decks) with art by Rachel Stott(Super Girl, Fantastic Four, Supergirl) with guest artist drawing te video game Tari Warping into to make feel like it's own world with a backup story also written by Ryan North and art by Sarah Myer(Saturday Morning Ninja Turtles Adventure) which is comic sequel to Theo spin-off pilot it basically starts where it left off with Kevin and Luke acting as Consultants to who ever writing the comic

My ideal comic main Cover artist would be Phil Noto (STAR WARS, Daredevil, Avengers: The Origin)

The first Meta Runner comic Glitch release would be re released by Publisher as issue #0 with bonus story by creative team of Comic

Don't you think that would be cool? I do Specially with the right Writer and Artist on it also Cover Artist

Plus the potential for many spin-off comics just think about it cool right?

But me how you vision a Meta Runner continuation Comic? I also like idea of GLITCH doing comics based on there shows",13,1743966324.0,GlitchProductions,1,1.0,False
1jt1qzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jt1qzd/significant_increase_in_caffeine_consumption/,Significant increase in caffeine consumption...,"I'm aware that it's natural to replace one addiction with another, especially when trying to fill some sort of psychological void - which ultimately is why I drank to the extreme excess that I did. 

Now that I'm not drinking, my caffeine intake has increased significantly. What used to be a mug in the morning has turned into around 4-6 coffees a day... While it's not affecting my productivity, blood pressure, sleep, anxiety, etc. (that I can tell), I'm wondering if this should raise some red flags for me? 

Of course I know caffeine is not healthy; however, it's a heck of a lot less dangerous than the litre of vodka I'd drink daily... Just looking for some advice! (& yes, I have also picked up healthy alternatives to drinking - exercising regularly, daily meditation and journalling, book clubs)..

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Indiana Pacers versus the Denver Nuggets—a matchup as tantalizing as a lukewarm cup of decaf coffee. But hey, it's still basketball, and we've got some intriguing storylines to dissect.

First off, let's talk about the Pacers, who are on a hot streak, winning their last three games and averaging a scorching 122.9 points per game. They're like that friend who suddenly gets really into CrossFit and won't stop talking about their new personal bests. Obi Toppin is the guy to watch, as he's been showcasing the kind of versatility that makes you wonder if he moonlights as a Swiss Army knife. Meanwhile, Aaron Nesmith is back from injury and shooting threes like they're going out of style.

On the flip side, the Nuggets are dealing with some drama of their own. Jamal Murray's hamstring is more questionable than a politician's campaign promises, leaving the door open for Peyton Watson and Jalen Pickett to step up. And let's not forget Nikola Jokic, who will likely need to channel his inner triple-double machine if the Nuggets want to fend off the Pacers.

The odds are leaning towards the Nuggets, with a moneyline of 1.37 at FanDuel, but don't count the Pacers out just yet. They're the underdogs at 3.2, and with their recent form, they might just pull off an upset.

As for the spread, the Nuggets are favored by 6.5 points, which seems about as secure as a Jenga tower in an earthquake. The total points line is set at 241.0, which suggests a high-scoring affair—perfect for those who enjoy watching defense as much as they enjoy watching paint dry.

So, what's the best bet here? Given the Pacers' recent scoring spree and the Nuggets' home-court advantage, I'd lean towards taking the Over on 241.0 points. Both teams have a lot to play for, and with key players potentially sidelined, expect a shootout with all the defensive intensity of a pillow fight.

In conclusion, whether you're a die-hard fan or just here for the snacks, this game promises to be an entertaining showdown. Just don't forget to stretch—watching all those fast breaks can be exhausting!

  This is for y’all youngster who’re about to put yourselves in a massive amount of debt to raise your credit score, pay for school, or pay for a car. Before you burry yourself with debts that can put you in a bad way take these points into consideration.

• Gather up all of your bills and purchases you make often (ex grocery bill, subscriptions, coffee everyday) make a rough estimate of the grand total and compare to your monthly income.

•Now it’s time to Cut The Crap. Get rid of unneeded purchases (ex $6 coffee everyday, your donkeyhub subscription, and impulsive purchases) 

• After you’ve cut the crap out of your unneeded purchases compare a new grand total to your monthly income and see what your able to save each month (ex my monthly bills cost me $3300 each month, I have a monthly income of $6100. So I know I have to save 60% of my money for bills, 30% to reach goals, and 10% for impulsive purchases.)

•Now that you know what your working with, take some time to consider if doing the financing yourself (ex saving $100 each check to buy a $1000 car) is a better option than getting ran through by a bank. Also another good option is saving the full amount of your purchase then get a loan so if you were to break your leg and couldn’t work anymore you could still pay off your loan and not be in debt.

•Overall my best advice is save your damn money until you can make the purchase you want and be disciplined with your spending.",4,1743966242.0,povertyfinance,2,0.83,False

Every time I’ve been to Sfax I felt like I was slowly descending into an alternate universe where fun was banned by law and smiling is considered suspicious activity. The vibes in Sfax are so aggressively dead it’s almost impressive. It’s like someone challenged the whole city to a competition called “How Emotionally Grey Can You Be?” and they took it personally.

Let’s talk about the “scenery” If you can even call it that. Other Tunisian cities have beaches, mountains, medinas full of life, or at the very least something pretty to look at. Sfax? No. Sfax looks like SimCity if the player ran out of budget halfway through. It’s just factories, cement walls, dust, and this permanent depressing smell in the air that I swear is a mix between burnt tires and broken dreams. Every street looks like an unfinished parking lot. Every building looks like it was built exclusively to crush hope.

And don’t get me started on the people. Sfaxiens are proud of how cheap they are like it’s a personality trait. They act like spending 5 dinars on a coffee is a crime against their ancestors. You can feel them calculating your financial worth every time you order food. They treat restaurants like museums,, you can look, you can sit, but God forbid you actually spend money. Dating a Sfaxien is like being in a relationship with a suspicious accountant. Every romantic gesture probably comes with a receipt and a follow-up interrogation.

As for nightlife? What nightlife? The streets of Sfax after 8pm look like the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse except zombies wouldn’t be caught dead in Sfax because even they need vibes. There’s nothing, absolutely nothing, to do at night unless you enjoy long, silent walks surrounded by industrial silence and street cats that look like they’ve seen things humans shouldn’t.

Tourism? Bro, people don’t go to Sfax for tourism. People go there because their job forced them to, their family dragged them there, or they made a terrible mistake with Google Maps. The only ""souvenir"" you’re leaving Sfax with is vitamin D deficiency and trust issues.

""Top things to do in Sfax"": 1. Arrive. 2. Cry. 3. Leave.

And yet, somehow, Sfaxiens will defend this grey dystopia with their whole chest like it’s Monaco. They’ll hit you with that “fi Sfax naarefou nekhdmou” energy like yeah bro congratulations on turning your city into an Excel spreadsheet.

""It's definitely going to work this time!""

A group of tired engineers, scientists, and Awakened stared at a young woman wearing a  formal suit, a buttoned-up blouse, and a white lab coat with numb eχpressions. The woman looked just as tired — there were dark circles under her eyes, many strands of hair had escaped her messy bun, and her lab coat was charred in several places.

However, her scathing gaze was still full of vigor and energy.

""Chief Bethany... h—how about we call it a day?""

""Please...""

""Somebody find Master Quentin... only he can save us!""

Hearing the complaints, Beth frowned. ""What is this I'm hearing? A mutiny?""

The engineers, the scientists, and the Awakened paled.

""N—no...""

""Of course not, Chief!""

""We were just joking, Chief!""

She nodded in satisfaction, then turned to a complicated control board in front of her. Outside, Bastion was shrouded in darkness. A bright moon hung above the lake, bathing it in pale radiance, and although the streets weгe illuminated here and there by mundane or enchanted lanterns, most of the city was resting in the embrace of shadows.

The city was too large and populous to be entirely asleep, but most citizens were sleeping in their homes, waiting for dawn to come so that they could continue their work. After all, nobody could work in darkness.

Well... few people could.

Beth turned her head and looked at one of her Awakened subordinates — a stunning girl with pale skin and raven-black hair, barely out of her teenage years by the look of it. The girl was a recent addition to the team and worked as somewhat of an intern, assisting everyone who needed help with menial tasks while she was learning the ropes.

Unlike the rest of the sorry bunch, the youngest member of the team never complained.

""You there, Rani... you just returned from building the road across Godgrave, right?""

The girl nodded with a smile. ""Yes, Chief! I've worked on the Dark Road.""
 
The Dark Road stretched across the arms of the dead deity and the entire Collarbone Plain, connecting the human territories in the north. Some of its sections lay under the open sky, but most of it was shrouded by the eternal darkness that the Lord of Shadows had summoned before slaying the King of Swords and being slain by Changing Star in turn.

Needless to say, building a road across a Death Zone had not been an easy project. Beth looked sternly at the rest of her subordinates.

""You see, Rani spent months doing arduous manual labor in total darkness while terrifying Nightmare Creatures and carnivorous plants were trying to eat her. So, what are you, sorry lot, complaining about? When was the last time one of you was eaten?""

The team members looked at each other.

""Wasn't Russel eaten last week, though?""

""Yes, I was! I spent a whole minute in an abomination's stomach! Luckily, Master Quentin was there to kill the beast... thank the Immortal Flame...""

""The cable-laying crews are getting attacked all the time!""

Beth grimaced.

""Whatever! We are doing another run. You guys can sleep tomorrow!""

As groans resounded in the control room, Rani summoned a leather backpack and pulled something out of it. The team members looked at a tin can with burning eyes.

""Wait. I'm not seeing things, am I?""

""Is that... coffee?""

""It's coffee, guys! Real coffee!""

Rani smiled. ""Yeah. They are growing coffee trees in Ravenheart now, you know? I got a few cans as payment. How about I brew some for everyone while Chief Bethany does the calibrations?""

The team members exploded with cheers. Some even shed tears.

Beth, meanwhile, was studying the control board — half of it mechanical, half etched with runes and embedded with soul shards. ""I don't get it... everything should have worked.""

She remained silent for a minute, then called for an Awakened operating the communication Memories.
 
""Rivergate Hydro, it's Center. Are the turbines spinning? The generators are powered up, too? Okay... 1 see. Keep an eye on the readings and let me know if something seems out of the ordinary.”

""Honey... 1 mean, Master Quentin, you repaired the cable, right? Are you sure that there are no other burned sections? What? What do you mean, a Nightmare Creature chewed through the cable? Why would it... never mind. Just let me know when you finish mending it!""

""Fire crews, stand by. The delay was caused by a severed cable. We will make another attempt in ten minutes... no, it's not going to explode again! There is absolutely zero pоssibility that it will explode again. Nothing is going to explode! But just in case it does... you know what to do...""

Soon, the delicious aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the control room. The team members savored the invigorating drink while Beth was staring at the panels and discussing various details with her subordinates through the communication Memories. From time to time, she looked into the wide window to study the dark landscape of the city below.

High above, the graceful silhouette of the Ivory Tower was contoured against the pale disk of the moon.

Finally, Quentin sent a mеssage confirming that the cables laid from the dam built on the ruins of former Rivergate to Bastion were mended. The team members ran to their posts, and a tense silence settled in the control room.

Beth remained near the control panel, accompanied by the young assistant, Rani. ""..You re originally from NQSC, right, Rani?""

The girl nodded.

Beth took a last look at the readings, then inhaled deeply.

""I'm from the Southern Quadrant myself. Although I spent quite a few years in NQSC as a student. Oh, and I visited later as a refugee, to pass through the Dream Gate.’

She lingered for a while. ""The infrastructure there... ah, it's simply divine. A work of pure genius. But...""

Beth placed her hand on a large switch and suddenly smiled brightly.

""In a few decades, Bastion will not be inferior in any way. And every other city in the Dream Realm, too.’

With that, she pulled the switch.

A strange hum suddenly filled the control room, reverberating through the walls. And then...

The city outside the window suddenly lit up, just like her face had.
 

Countless streetlamps shone with the bright, steady electric light.

Like stars in the night sky.

The darkness was chased away, replaced with pure, soft radiance.

Beth exhaled slowly and smiled with satisfaction.

""Told you...""

I’ve been best friends with a group of girls (we’ll call them Jessica, Alana, and Britney) since high school (2010). We’re a group, but in the group we have our “pairs” and me and Alana have always been a pair and Jessica and Britney have been a pair. Best friends within the best friend group. 
I was so close with Alana - we did everything together. Even when I moved a few hours away from school.

Fast forward to 2020, and I break up with my long-term abusive boyfriend and so does Jessica. Jessica and I move in together, and the group is so happy to be back together. Alana and Britney are the only 2 left in relationships. 

After a group hangout one night, Britney and Alana head home. Jessica and I get a call shortly after, and it’s Alana crying and freaking out because she came home..grabbed her boyfriend’s phone and locked herself in the car(?) and went through it and found out he was cheating. We told her we were coming to get her and she could spend the night with us..she said ok. We get there around midnight despite having to work the next day, and Alana tells us to hang on they’re just talking. We wait. We wait until 2 am. Then she comes out the house and sits in the car and asks where we wanna go. We were confused and said home bc it’s 2 am and we’re here to grab you so you can come spend the night at our place to get away from this?

She said oh no never mind, I’m gonna spend the night here. So we were obviously a bit upset at this and I gave her a tough-love kind of conversation about what happened, how she’s worth more and needs to leave him etc etc. she was very quiet and things felt awkward and long story short, she got out and we went home.

The next day all three of us invite her over to mine and Jessica’s house and we have flowers and chocolate waiting for her. She acts oblivious about why we got her flowers and are being so weird. We said because we presumed she’d be upset about her boyfriend cheating on her. She said she’s fine and wants to move on. So we share a look but respect her wishes. 

Things have NEVER been the same with me and Alana. She told Jessica and Britney that she was more mad at ME for the conversation I had with her (I was trying to be a good friend! Of course I don’t want my best friend to be with a cheater! I would expect all my friends to do the same for me!) than she was at her boyfriend for cheating.

That really hurt me. I gave her some space, and we eventually drifted to only talking in the groupchat and at very sparse group hangouts. It’s been this way ever since. We both know things are not the same, but we don’t really acknowledge it. I don’t say anything because I just miss my friend and want things to go back to normal. I text her all the time and tell her I miss her, let’s hang out soon etc.

She says the same..but things never come to fruition. Even recently, she just broke up with said cheating boyfriend so Jessica and I wanted to bake her a congrats on the breakup cake and hang out and give it to her. She said she wasn’t free because she has to work, then later posted to her story hanging out this girl that she’s most definitely become best friends with over the last few years. 

We had a group hangout a few weeks ago and the whole vibe was SO AWKWARD because something felt so off with her. She was quiet and barely interacting with us. She didn’t even acknowledge me when I sat down next to her until I said something. I brushed it off but it hurt. 

I brought her flowers and coffee to work the other day when she told me she officially broke up with the boyfriend, but she was in a staff meeting (I didn’t know I wanted to surprise and cheer her up) so I didn’t even really get to talk to her, but she was grateful for the flowers and posted it on insta and tagged me.

Anyway…all that to say so you know the status of our friendship and how uncomfortable things really are right now.

I keep trying to save our best-friendness and do stupid things like ask her if she wants to go to a concert to an artist we used to love and see when we were younger. She said yes and talked about how excited she is! But the concert is on Tuesday and we haven’t talked since she said thank you for the flowers…and honestly, after our last hang out where I kinda just sat quietly beside her really has me feeling sad and not interested in going to spend time with her one on one anymore.

I don’t know what to do. Go to the concert and try to pretend like everything is okay like I have for the last 5 years, or tell her I’m not up for it and offer my ticket to her friend so they can go? I feel like I would be more comfortable with the second option because I really am just so sad about the loss of our friendship and the idea of standing next to her, singing along to songs we used to scream together…just idk. It feels awful to think about.

Please give me some advice on what to do about the event, and I guess the friendship in general?
Having a sit down conversation with her about this stuff would NOT go well so it’s not really an option. My peaceful options are: go and pretend and then stop making any attempts to keep a friendship going, or bow out of the event and also still stop making any attempts to keep a friendship going.

I think I’m done being the only one..but idk. My head is so muddy I need an outsiders perspective. Please help. 

TL;DR: my best friend got upset with me for a tough-love conversation around her cheating boyfriend 5 years ago, and friendship hasn’t been the same. I keep trying and it doesn’t seem like she does. Last hangout was super awkward and uncomfortable for me, but we have a concert coming up this week bc I’m dumb and keep trying to get us to connect. Do I go, or do I bow out and say somethings come up? Move on with my life?

1jt1hc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jt1hc1/rf_a_day_without_socks_or_underwear/,[RF] A Day Without Socks or Underwear,"In a way, Dorinda was glad her mother was dead, because she'd be heartbroken at the state of Dorinda's life. Mom would never blame her, though. You're the hardest worker I know, she once told Dorinda, but there are forces outside of our control right now that keep us down. 

Forces outside of our control force people to pay $10 for bland coffee in an overly-ornate paper cup that aspires to be a mug. Those forces compel you to order a cup of water here at the Treehouse Cafe, because you've spent five hours in the hot sun holding a sign and chanting slogans. And that plastic cup of warm tap water wasn't even free. 

Dorinda reflected on the faces that walked by her group of workers. Marta, the organizer, spent an entire night painting the signs. All of them had the same message: ""Respect and dignity are a human right, not a privilege."" All of the workers up-voted this slogan. 

They stood silently at first. Their quiet and upright posture seemed to raise the ire of many who walked by. A woman pushing a jogger dashed past them, knocking over one of Dorinda's fellow picketers.  She ran on without apology. An elderly couple shook their fists at the group. Marta had a ready strategy for the hecklers: she shouted ""Thank you so very much for your support and have a blessed day"" at the top of her lungs to drown out the profanities. 

It wasn't totally discouraging. One or two passerby raised their fists in solidarity, while another clapped and hooted from their car. One woman joined them. May I have a sign, she asked.

Dorinda fanned herself with the small placard she'd clutched and waved to anyone and everyone who would take notice.  She was grateful to Louise, her dearest friend who was now watching her son. Louise  allowed them to move in once her divorce was final. Dorinda was left with nothing. Stay as long as you need, Louise told her. Not wanting to impose, Dorinda took whatever work she could find. Butterfly Touch Cleaners was hiring. 

There were lots of rules, so many rules that it was incredibly easy to forget them, because they were the sort of rules you'd teach a young puppy. Like staying off the furniture. You plump, clean, vacuum, dust, shine, and wax every surface of the home you're cleaning, but come time to wait for your ride, you can't sit down anywhere inside the house, even on the hottest, coldest or rainiest days. 

One time, Dorinda got lucky. The rain fell in silver sheets and refused to let up, so one family  allowed her to sit on the tile floor just inside the doorway while she waited for the Butterfly Touch van. This same family allowed her fifteen minutes for lunch. Most didn't, so Dorinda learned to sneak stray candy or dried bread crusts snatched from the breakfast plates she cleaned.

Loud voices at the table behind her woke her from her daydream. 

Thank goodness for these trees, a woman said, and that lovely breeze.

Are you kidding me? It's damn cold here! Maybe if you'd been forced to wear jogging shorts you'd know what I mean.

Oh, God, don't tell me... your laundry, said their companion. 

C'mon, Herb, his wife soothed. It's just one day. Let them get the anger out of their systems and they'll all be back to work at our houses tomorrow. You'll see. This will all blow over and be forgotten.

If ours isn't back by tomorrow, said Herb, she damn well better start looking for another job! How dare she!

I don't know, Herb, they're pretty serious, said the other man, many of them haven't gotten a raise in years. 

If they don't like working for the money they get, let them go back where they came from. They should be grateful to even be working here!

Let's order, said the woman.

Let's hope there's someone here to take it, said Herb. 

Dorinda closed her eyes and listened. 

Hi, said the young server, may I take your order?

It's about time, said Herb.

I'm sorry, sir, we're a bit busy now.

Where's Margaret? She's our regular, Herb asked.

She's not here today.

Where is she?

I believe she's with the other strikers, sir.

Your manager should fire her. She should be disciplined.

I'll have the club sandwich, said Herb's wife.

Same, said their friend.

Why aren't you writing down our order, Herb demanded.

I'll be able to remember it, sir. 

Really, well, let's see if that's true. I want a BLT, hold the mayo, iceberg lettuce ONLY and some raspberry ice tea. After, and ONLY after that, a slice of apple pie.  Go ahead. Repeat back the order.

Sir?

You heard me, you idiot! What's our order? Go ahead, say it!

I-I'm not sure why you.....

Go ahead, you fool! Say it! Say it!

Dorinda snapped her head around just in time to see the girl's face, bright red and dripping in sweat. She dropped the stack of menus and fast walk back into the cafe. 

It'll be a miracle if this moron gets it right, crowed Herb.

Dorinda was tired. Forces beyond our control, Mom had said. 

She felt herself push out of the wooden seat and walk over to their table.  A part of her mind screamed, what are you doing? Don't draw attention to yourself. 

It was too late to turn back.

Dorinda stood in front of Herb, gazing down at him wordlessly, her breathing audible through the quiet spring air.

Their eyes were on her sign. Herb's wife smiled weakly, while their friend rested his chin on his hands and looked away.

Dorinda felt her body tense. Bills were due. She had to pay the sitter. And last month's savings went toward her son's medical care. 

Her fingers that held the sign began to bunch into a fist. She raised the sign over her head.

Herb gazed at her in terror. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin loose and sallow. His arms and legs were dried twigs. Old, sick and angry. He'll be that way forever. 

Dorinda caught her breath. She held out her hand.

Herb weakly took it and pumped it up and down. 

Have a blessed day, sir, she said.

1jt1h2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jt1h2i/is_she_pulling_away_or_just_being_careless/,Is she pulling away or just being careless? Outside perspective needed,"So I (F24) have been seeing this girl (F24) for a little over a month now. Things got really close really fast—we’ve been soft, emotionally open, slept over together, kissed a lot (even in public), and there’s been strong sexual tension. She’s told me multiple times she likes me, misses me, thinks I’m attractive, etc. We’ve had lots of really sweet moments, and I’ve definitely let her in.

She’s said stuff like “you’re not just a date,” “I only have eyes for you,” and “you’re really special,” so naturally, I’ve been starting to catch real feelings. And up until recently, she had been matching my energy.

But this past week, her behavior has completely shifted.

Here’s what happened:

I got back from a trip recently and we had a really good night together—she picked me up from the airport, we kissed in the car, got food, cuddled up, watched a show, made out, and she literally held me all night. The next morning we got coffee with my nephew. It was sweet and felt real.

Then the next day I went to visit her at her job. While I was there, one of her coworkers was trying to convince us to go out. I said I was down. She kept saying no, and said she was too tired and hungover from the night before. She said no like 3-4 times, pretty firmly.

But while I was there, we were being super affectionate. She kissed me in the store in front of people. We kissed and made out in the fitting room. She was clearly into me and happy to see me. She even said she wanted to sleep over again that night.

Then hours later… she never showed up. She never called. She ended up going out after all. Didn’t invite me. Didn’t explain anything. Just a late “don’t hate me” text with a sad face. Like… what?

I didn’t blow up. I just went quiet. I stopped sharing my location. And right after that, she suddenly texted me “:(” like she noticed I pulled back.

Later that night, she called me, but I was asleep. Then she texted “my nameeeee.”
I replied the next day like, “hey sorry I was helping a friend with some things.” Calm, chill. She hasn’t replied since.

I’m trying to be chill, but I’m not dumb. I can feel the switch. The energy just isn’t the same. It feels like I’m being left hanging after being so emotionally and physically close.

I want to understand:
	•	Is she pulling away on purpose?
	•	Is she losing interest?
	•	Is she scared of how real it’s getting?
	•	Or is she just being careless and not realizing what this feels like from my end?

She’s been saying sweet things this whole time. But now I feel like I’m the only one emotionally showing up.

I want to be real about it, but I also don’t want to push. Just need some outside perspective. Please don’t sugarcoat.

my mom wakes up super early in the morning to make sure she completes all the chores in time which includes waking us up in the morning. my dad is 60 years old YET she wakes him up every morning. my dad is not abusive physically but he sometimes abuses my mom verbally. she does everything she can, to keep us all happy but my dad is the typical guy with ""aurat ka farz hai yeh saara kaam karna"" mentality. i've never seen ""true love"" between my parents. every morning before my dad leaves, he screams at my mother and blames her DAILY for being late. tears are literally rolling down my eyes while writing this line but he literally treats my mom like an unpaid slave. MY MOM? THE ONE WHOM I LOVE THE MOST. i've literally seen her crying and it turns me red with rage. my dad is a kinda person who'll have different colours in front of relatives/strangers and is a whole different person with family. he verbally abuses, uses slurs for me, my mom and my brother at times, especially when he's angry. sometimes i feel like my father has given me nothing other than money. he is a highly misogynist person and i absolutely hate it.

recently, my mom fell ill and instead of taking her to a doctor, dad went like ""stop coughing"" while she used to be in thr kitchen? like bro? she's your fucking wife????

i almost come to tears when my friends say things like ""my dad prepared my tiffin today"" ""my dad prepares his milk and my coffee and my mom wakes up at 9"" like duh my dad has hardly ever been in the kitchen.

this is a little out of the post: but my dad is gonna retire this year and im kinda scared of how my parents would survive together alone. im sure my mother would take great care of him but he's the least empathic guy idk what's gonna happen. weekends when my dad is home are so bad, i prefer staying outdoors no matter what. because the level of negativity, poking, slurs etc in my house when my dad is home is sick.",3,1743965625.0,TeenIndia,19,1.0,False

I know it’s not water fasting, but I was not prepared nutritionally for a fast, it wasn’t my intention, and it’s all I have been able to consume. Now I have also been managing to drink more water and add in some electrolytes. 

I know the idea behind the 21 day bone broth fasting diet, and I have done intermittent fasting in the past with varying degrees of success. I was definitely addicted to sugar and caffeine and while this last week was emotionally horrible, and I felt like trash, I think I got through the worst of the coffee/sugar withdrawal part too. 

I have a significant amount of body fat to loose, last time I weighed myself (mid March) before this started I was 85kgs, on a 5’1” frame. I did weigh myself this morning and I was down to 80.9kgs, that’s almost 4.1kgs lost, that’s 9lbs. I don’t think I lost anything before this week started.

Does anyone have any experience with extended bone broth fasts? 

If this could be the catalyst to finally get the weight off, I could be all in. I’m having my tonsils removed in two weeks and won’t be able to consume much other than broth then anyways. So if I could stick to this until then, that would be 3 weeks, and then at least another 1 before I could even think about food after the surgery.

1jt1e59,https://www.reddit.com/r/nataliagrace/comments/1jt1e59/sympathy_for_the_barnettes/,Sympathy for the Barnettes,"I’m not quite grasping the incredible hatred for the Barnette’s that I see online. Witnesses confirmed that Natalia told them she tried to kill her mom and hurt her family. There’s video of her admitting to having thoughts of harming others. She called the police on herself admitting she had thoughts of harming others. There’s the sexually promiscuous behavior at the inpatient facility and then trying to molest her neighbor’s kids/grandkids.

The early puberty, maturity, manipulative behavior, sexual stuff, and violent actions (poisoning mom’s coffee) all together would confuse and stress most people out.

The Barnette’s did try to get help, many times, from many different professionals and resources. If the professionals tell them shes dangerous, she might be older than she says, etc, then what are they supposed to do? Not listen to them?

Natalia may have come from an abusive and traumatic background, and I understand that she deserves sympathy. I also understand the Barnette’s had their own problems and some craziness in them too. Or perhaps they were driven to do insane things they wouldn’t normally do because of the crazy circumstances? But even if they lied about or fudged some things, there is enough video and witness testimony (as I mentioned in the first paragraph) that there is really no denying that Natalia was an incredibly difficult and scary child to deal with.

The fact that someone was abused, doesn’t mean I should put myself or my family in danger for them. This goes for the Barnette’s as well as the neighbors at the apartment. People in Reddit comments make it seem like the neighbors were such terrible people. Well, if someone told me they had tried to kill their family I’m keeping my whole family away from them I don’t care if they’re 4 or 44, disabled, or not.

The real failures here are the systems and the Barnette’s not having proper channels or support to get Natalia the help she needs. They should have been able to free themselves of her or surrender her somehow.

Last thing I’ll say is, a family friend has a daughter who is a sociopath. Has done similar things, pulling knifes and threatening to kill her mom, very manipulative, lies and harms others, etc and it started very young. She has been in therapy her whole life, quite a privileged and comfortable, is now in her early twenties and is still problematic and scary but of course more mature and much smarter so much more devious. Her mom has done everything to try to help and has been chronically depressed and scared for almost 2 decades not knowing when something really really tragic will happen. 

Because of this, I spent some time researching sociopaths and they do exist. Symptoms start in early childhood, and there doesn’t have to be any abuse or trauma. Some kids are just born this way. It is more common than I realized. It is very difficult to get support from the state. Very difficult to get them into inpatient care or hospitalization. And if they are smart enough they can make themselves seem normal when it’s useful. Parents are kind of stuck and basically have to wait for the child to do something really bad like stabbing someone or getting arrested before the state will truly step in. So they live in constant fear. I also found dozens of online forums of parents sharing their testimonies and seeking support. 

Maybe Natalia is not a sociopath and she has some other disorder. But she’s not normal and I think most people who are being very judgmental of the Barnette’s would have really struggled to raise a child like Natalia especially when it’s not your biological child and you don’t know the full truth about their history.

1jt1b2u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jt1b2u,Jordnaer ***,"About half a year ago we went to the collaboration of Zilte and Jordnær with the idea this would be a one-off splurge (review: [Zilte X Jordnaer](https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1fhasi1/exquis_zilte_x_jordnaer_antwerp/))

Evidence says that was a miscalculation.

We were so amazed by Eric and Tina’s warmth and kindness and by the taste and execution of their dishes that I started planning a trip to Copenhagen shortly after. As Jordnær had already gotten its third star, they were mostly booked up, but I got lucky to snag a spot. Unfortunately, that was an error in the booking system, as they were closed on that day, but they swiftly were able to accommodate me a day earlier.

**About the location:** Gentofte is a bit outside of Copenhagen in a quiet suburb. The hotel does not stand out a lot, but it’s easy enough to find. The interior is bright and warm. Just what you would associate with the Danish hygge concept.

**Wine:** We went with a la carte both because of budget reasons and because we wanted to make it through the night with all senses intact. We had champagne to start, a couple of wines from the pairing, a dessert wine, and one of the best Negronis I’ve ever had. Prices are high, but that’s what you have to live with in Denmark. Coffee and Tea were also very good. They make herbal teas with fresh herbs that they bring out on a trolley. 

**Tableware:** Beautiful. Especially love the plate that creates the illusion of a hovering tartlet for the Sancho-pepper appetiser and the very big plates for the dishes with sauces. They really invited you to swish through the sauce and scoop all the leftover sauce up with the bread.

**Food:** Difficult to put into words how much I loved this meal. Eric asked us afterwards which dish we liked the most, and I found it impossible to answer. Usually, even at 3-star restaurants, there are some peaks and valleys in terms of how great the dishes are. Here I genuinely loved every dish. The famous amuses sequence is so good that I would be willing to pay 3-star tasting menu prices for it alone.

1. **Romanesco tartlet:** Just the right combination of cheesy, citrus, crispy and a bit spicy.
2. **Tartlet with snow crab:** Also finds just the exact right spot where the flavours seem to balance perfectly between nutty, juicy, and the sea.
3. **Sancho-pepper crustade: A**nother classic, and also here yuzu, hummer, roe, and pepper combine perfectly.
4. **Otoro with caviar**. This is probably the perfect umami bite for me. Like a taste wave hitting you in the face.
5. **Rosette waffle.** I really enjoyed how each of these appetiser tartlets / waffles / crustades give you quite a distinct textural and taste experience. The rosette waffle is no exception.
6. **Takoyaki**: The naughty one. Truly decadent.. This is like a luxury version of surf and turf, but with the forest flavours of the truffle replacing meat. Like a saltwater wave crashing into a mossy forest.
7. **Scallops**: Reminds optically of cherry blossoms, and the fruity, flowery broth indeed brings back memories of a spring trip to Japan. Beautiful.
8. **Essence of langoustine:** Amazing that cooked out langoustine be elevated to such a dish. This is the dish I had the lowest expectations for, but it completely blew me away. The combination of the langoustine essence, tomato and vanilla works perfectly together.
9. **Oyster**: Wasabi, Meerrettich, dill, buttermilk? Spicy, creamy, and the sea. Temperature was just right to pull this together. I think I wouldn’t have liked it warmer.
10. **White asparagus and lobster cotta:** As Eric said: a bit naughty to have dessert in the middle of the main dishes. Looks like a big spoon of hollandaise, but below hides the lobster and grapefruit, and they combine beautifully for a sweetish main course.
11. **Hamachi**: (forgot pic but you can find pictures in one of the other Jordnaer reviews) Probably the most minimalistic dish. Aged hamachi with ponzu, wasabi, and I again forgot to remember what it was that sat below. I think an oyster?
12. **Chawanmushi:** The egg custard is hidden below, as is a very, very generous amount of caviar. Warm, sweet, salty, a bit zesty? Lot going on here. Delightful.
13. **Bread:** Quote Eric: If Japanese milk bread and brioche had a baby in a bath of butter. Fantastic.
14. **Monkfish, ramson & blue mussels sauce:** If I had to choose one dish that didn’t stuck with me for a while afterwards, then it’s this one. It was still extremely tasty and I really enjoyed it. It’s just that all the other dishes had things that stood out just a bit more.
15. **Langoustine sakura:** Another stunner. Cooked over a Japanese grill, with a red kosho glaze, and combined with sakura aromatised beurre blanc. This is as good as a langoustine can be.
16. **Rose hip, litchi, rhubarb:** Fresh, tasty. I was a bit disappointed to see this without strawberries (probably not in season), but the taste made up for it. Perfect palette cleanser and start to the desserts. Will have to come back for the wild strawberry version another time.
17. **Leatherwood honey, milk, Tahitian vanilla, lavender:** Looking at it, I thought this might be too much honey, but it worked beautifully. Magnificent dessert.
18. **Truffle, hazelnut & chocolate:** In Antwerp we had a version of this dish with truffle ice cream but without real truffles that I really enjoyed. Well, this is the real deal. Like decadent truffle Nutella.
19. **Petit fours** Really great as well. Was most happy about the Japanese melon though, which was extremely juicy and refreshing.

**Service:** Fantastic. Very attentive and responsive. Also, from what we observed from other tables, they responded very well to the vibes of each group and adjust accordingly.

**Eric and Tina:** So, so charming. We were smitten by their warmth and enthusiasm in Antwerp and again here. They take time to joke around and for some small talk, and Eric even took us on a kitchen tour where we talked about his Japan and Barcelona trips, his cooking philosophy, and lots of other stuff. This really made it an 11/10 for me. And I’m already trying to figure out when we could squeeze in a Copenhagen trip again. Most likely we will make it a yearly pilgrimage.",41,1743965197.0,finedining,4,1.0,False

After she broke up with me, I felt like I would never fall for anyone again. I went on a few dates over the last few months, it never really sparked or led to anything. 

Now over a year later, I found someone that makes my heart race again whenever I see her. I met her at uni, and from the moment I saw her I was stunned by her beauty. She is inspiring, talented, interesting and is funny, everything one could wish for in a woman. She is the kind of person that lights up a room as soon as she enters. 

But at the same time she is like the moon, beautiful, but just too far away to reach for me. Tbh, I don't think she will ever think of me as more than a learning buddy/friend. We did grab a coffee together last Friday after learning for the whole day, but when we sat down in the café, there was this sort of awkward silence in the beginning. I simply didn't know what to talk about. My Brain was blank. After two or three minutes of silence, we finally managed to have a nice chat about traveling, food and stuff. But in the end it was only small talk. After that we went home and I went along with her for a bit (even tough it was the directly opposite direction) we talked some more while walking. A bit before we reached her apartment, we hugged each other and parted ways, and that was about it. 

I never even managed to compliment her even once, I was too nervous to tell her how great she looked, what a beautiful smile she has or how just seeing her makes my day. There are so many things about her to compliment, and I am too afraid to tell her any of that. I am afraid of how she would respond. 

I am by far not the best looking, funniest, smartest or anything else. I worked out a lot in the last few months, thinking it would help with my confidence, but nothing changed at all besides having a bit more muscle. I am still as insecure about my body as I was before. My talking/social skills are still terrible, besides trying my best to talk with new people as often as possible in the last few months.

So anyway, I'm here looking for an accountability buddy who share a similar wavelength. I've tried this before and I can say it was successful. However, nagkasakit ako way back COVID days and was not able to connect back with my buddy. 

How this works? Basically, we'll check on each other on a daily basis, like we're giving updates on our progress, if we did the habit we wanted to build/break etc. The habit can be as simple as waking up at a specfic time or up to quitting abusive drugs (sorry wala ako maisip haha) depending on how deep u want to share, syempre I will try to reciprocate kung ano lang yung gusto mo.

We can also have healthy discussions on our long term goals and then give inputs/ constructive criticisms or suggestions. The setup mostly depends on you, and how deep u want to share. This can be purely online or we can meet for a coffee. Can be Anonymous or we can get to know each other personally din. Can be platonic/ romantic. Again the possibilities are limitless 😂

About you:

1jt14gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1jt14gp/thinking_about_pulling_my_kids_from_ot_and_slp/,Thinking about pulling my kids from OT and SLP,"To preface I am also autistic. I understand the importance of therapies. My girls go to OT and SLP one day a week. We leave the house at 8:25A. It always seems to be a rush and stressor for all of us to get out of the house. The first appointment starts at 9am (OT 30min for daughter B), 10A (OT 60min for daughter A), 10:30A (SLP 30min for daughter B), 11A (SLP 30min for daughter A). All said and done we are back home at 12:15P. Dad usually stays home with toddler brother but sometimes brother comes along with me. 

Reasons to Pull:

Reason 1: I am slightly annoyed at the office due to their poor communication. They don't respond to texts or calls in a timely manner (I mean over a month to get a call/text back.) We use a state funded education fund (ESA for Arizona) to pay for their appointments. This matters because they want payment 3 months in advance, which we don't like. We agreed on 1 month and even that is pushing it because we prefer to pay for the service as we use them. 

We were going to their other office 1 hour away and we were on the wait list for the closer office for almost a year for my girls to have their appointments back to back. Well daughter B needed an evaluation but their person was that was out on leave and we waited another 3 months to get that. And they gave our back to back spots away. Maybe I am still holding a grudge about how long we have to spend at the office waiting. I think that is part of why I wanting to pull them. 

Reason 2: ALOT, I should say ALL of what they do my husband and I can at home with the girls. Most of the things they do there we already do. So why are we paying for this services and stressing everyone out getting out the door and waiting around for half a day every week?

Reason 3: The SLP provider is kinda flat and seems annoyed at times. She is good at her job but idk if she truly prefers working with children. 

Reason 4: The waiting room is bland, very bright, and uncomfortable. (It kinda puts me on edge honestly.) The only toys they have are toys I donated to the office because it is just a room with chairs and a coffee table. 

Reasons to Keep Them Going:

Reason 1: The OT is great and my girls really like going to her. They listen to her well.  

Reason 2: It is good for them to interact with other adults giving them the same information as mom and dad. Shows them we aren't ""bossing them around"" but actually trying to help them.

My dilemma is if we pull them and it doesn't work out idk where else they will go that isn't an hour away and their appointments will definitely be spread out. But what if it does work out and they do great learning the same things from their therapies at home with mom and dad.

I'm a 40-year-old woman originally from Poland, now living and working in the US. Life has taken me through a lot of beautiful (and a few bittersweet) paths, and now I find myself ready for something that’s meaningful—something real.

I'm not here for games, endless small talk, or hookups. I’m looking for a genuine emotional connection with someone who values honesty, kindness, and depth. I still believe in slow-burn conversations, thoughtful messages, and the kind of bond where two people can be themselves—flaws, quirks, and all.

A little about me:

I’m independent, emotionally mature, and love good conversation (preferably over coffee or wine).

I have a soft spot for literature, art, and old jazz records.

Nature walks and quiet moments beat club nights any day.

I’m child-free but open-minded, and I appreciate emotional intelligence above all.

What I’m looking for:

A man aged around 35–50, emotionally available, who’s also tired of superficial dating apps.

Someone curious about the world, and open to truly getting to know another person.

Ideally US-based (but open to connections elsewhere if something clicks).

If you’ve made it this far—thank you. Tell me what brought you here. Share something real.

I'm curious if any one else feels like their intense hypersexuality is what led them to explore bi sexual experiences.

Me for example, I'm a man who is married to a woman and I have always been incredibly and regularly sexual and horny. Sometimes I wonder if it's my ADHD and dopamine seeking brain that causes me to be so hyper sexual. 

Anyways, I'm not attracted to men or have any desire to have a relationship with a man but I do enjoy sexual experiences with other men. I wonder if my desire to have experiences with other men is simply a case of being so horny that I'll fuck anything that walks, rather than it being any kind of emotional or romantic attraction to men.

I don't know, just thinking out loud this morning while I drink my coffee.

Anyone else confused by their same sex sexual encounters and curious to understand why they exist?",15,1743964387.0,bisexual,21,0.94,False

This will impact [nearly every item you can imagine](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/which-products-most-affected-tariffs/): clothing, shoes, computers, phones, tablets, gaming consoles and controllers, automobiles, wine and spirits, everyday household items, furniture, coffee, chocolate.

The White House [expects the tariffs to raise $6 trillion in tax revenue.](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-tariffs-peter-navarro-6-trillion-tax-increase-2e5cc39d) That would be [the largest tax hike in U.S. history](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/economy/tariffs-largest-tax-hike/index.html).

The businesses that pay the import taxes will pass nearly all of it on to consumers by raising prices. So the responsibility for paying for this tax hike will fall hardest on all regular American families, especially those who already have fixed and limited incomes.

In Ohio, that’s a significant portion of our population.

Me (F35) recently divorced after 15 years together. Matched with guy (m30). We had great chats, met for coffee and two days later had a lunch date. Each time was great flow of interesting conversations. He was looking for something more serious while I was just thinking FWB. Note we are FB friends so I know no SO or funny business 

Because of living situations (we both recently moved back in with family) we got a hotel this weekend. 

Met for lunch, great two hour conversation, got to the room and had 3-4 rounds with cuddles and talks between. Then we went out for dinner and again flow was awesome. When we got back he wasn't able to preform, no big deal as I knew he's already came 3 times that day lol. I said let's just take a break and we laid there and the vibes just changed. 

He was trying to work through a anxiety attack, finally he said he was having issues and didn't know what to do. I offered if he just need time for me to distract him or hold him? He said hold him and I did for while. He was still working through breathing and his muscles twitched at times. 

Finally he said he thinks he just had to go. I kept it all light and said no problem and to drive safe. He got dressed in the dark kissed me goodbye a few times then kissed my forehead. As he left he said he would text me when he got home so I wouldn't worry. And he did. I said ""ok thanks"" and then ""I'd still like to talk when you get in a better headspace but if your no longer interested no hard feelings"". 

And haven't heard from him since. This is a super short relationship over two weeks, very new. 

However I really like him. I want to support him however I can and for now I just let him know that wasn't a dealbreaker and to give space? I think maybe it was obvious that I was genuinely into him and scared him off (I didn't say anything but I wasn't playing coy) He's been single 3 years and while hasn't said anything to show his feelings towards me I believe all his actions reflect care, respect and compassion
towards me. 

Any insight or thoughts on how to handle this? I feel like it's something about me that caused it but that's just my insecurities, logically I feel like it's him. ",1,1743963707.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

Any idea why this is happening?

I assume that, not being polarized, it has circuitry inside that makes sure that power always flows in one direction, regardless of how it's plugged in, so the motor always spins in the same direction because the blades are only effective that way, and that this circuitry just failed so it only works when plugged in one way but not the other.

But if so, what kind of circuitry does that (2 power diodes?), how is it that the motor doesn't now spin the wrong way, and is it now in any way unsafe to use and should be repaired or discarded?

My boyfriend (M29) and I (F24) broke up April 1st. But before I get too deep into that part, let me give some context. 

We've been close friends for about four years before we even thought of dating. He was friends with my neighbors and best friends with my brother-in-law so we were always around each other. He knew all of my family very well and I knew some of his. And while I've always had interest in him, he had a son and was newly (about a year) out of a long-term relationship. It seemed like a bad idea to pursue him at the time. 

And so, 4 years later, he had confessed his feelings for me and told me he wanted to take things further than friends. I was hesitant as it seemed weird at first, but I started to go out with him. He texted me all the time, wanted to see me all the time, talked about me to our friends, talked to my mom and little sister, etc. 

After a few months of consistent dating, he moved in with my sister and I. Everything seemed perfect. We all got along great, and even after arguments we always made up fast (he'd buy me coffee or flowers and always apologize). However, things started to go sort of downhill when he became OBSESSED with video games. What started as every so often turned into every second of his day (when not at work). Occasionally, I'd ask if we could take a walk or watch a movie together and he started to act like I was being too much. So I stopped, sucked it up, and treated things like normal. It was still good for a few more months (just constant gaming).

However, on April 1st, he came home from work, sat in his chair, and started playing. I had said hi to him and placed my hand on his shoulder, and he just stared at me (with a cold expression) before looking back at his game. I brushed it off (even though I felt sick to my stomach) and took a shower. After a while, I sat next to him to watch him play (usually he asks me too, and pats my head, or randomly hugs me while playing)... Instead he didn't look at me once. So, I went to the couch so I didn't annoy him and did my own thing. It wasn't until I heard him getting up to go to bed that I went back in. He turned on his side and watched his phone while I lied beside him. I asked him if he was okay, as he hadn't spoken to me and had barely looked at me, and he said ""Yes, I'm okay. Are YOU okay?"" feeling upset and confused I didn't answer his sarcastic question. So he sighed and turned back to his phone. Feeling the need to know what was wrong, I explained, ""You haven't talked to me or looked at me since you've gotten home, but you're talking to your online friends like normal. It feels like you're mad at me or something."" And he yelled at me to leave him alone. I started crying so he left the room. Then he back and asked me to leave the room since I'm ""the one crying"". I told him he should communicate that he needs space instead of treating someone poorly and he told me to get whatever I need to say off my chest because after this we're done. 

It's been almost a week and we haven't spoken one word to each other. It's been bothering me so bad, I've been crying all the time, I haven't eaten, I've barely slept, but he seems to be unbothered (on his game, per usual). I want so badly to at least talk to him, but I know it should be him who comes to me as he's the one who seemed to have the issue. So it's been a torturous waiting game, but I really want him back...

I’m the kind of employee who has to be told to take time off because my vacation time balance is at capacity. The reason I mention this is because I’m a very dedicated employee who rarely even takes a sick day so I’m pretty bothered by how my new manager is acting towards me and want to know if I’m overreacting.

I work remotely for a tech company as a software trainer. I do private sessions via Zoom teaching our customers how to use our products. Last week, my internet completely stopped working and I found out that the router had to be replaced. I messaged my manager at 7:30PM to tell her I had to call out the next day and asked her to please cancel my meetings with my customers because someone was coming to repair my internet and I wasn’t sure what time it would be fixed.

She was understanding but messaged me the next morning asking if it was fixed yet. I told her I was still waiting for the repair guy. She asked me if there was a coffee shop I could go work from. I told her that I need to be home for when they come to fix it, which shouldn’t even need to be said.

Then, she messages me again telling me that she doesn't see my emails to the customer to cancel their session. I told her that I thought it was clear that I needed her to reach out to them since I don't have internet access and can't contact them.

An hour later, she starts calling my phone nonstop. I told her that the repair technician is here right now and I can't talk. She texts back ""CALL ME RIGHT NOW."" This is when I find out that she still hasn't reached out to my customer to cancel the session. She asks me what the diagnosis is and if they will have it turned on in time for the session(which was 15 min away at this point). I told her I cannot guarantee that, which is why I called out for the day.

Then, she has me stay on the phone with her while we go through my entire schedule next week so she can look for a time to reschedule for them.... It was 7 minutes before their scheduled session at this point.

I feel like this is overstepping and dramatic. I called out and gave my reasoning. I don't need to keep in touch with you all day and it's extremely unprofessional to wait until 5 minutes before to inform my customer that I need to cancel.

1jt0jbw,https://i.redd.it/av0s7zo2a9te1.jpeg,Leflaive and Caymus Special Selection!,"I know I know. Caymus? We don’t do that here. 80’s Caymus, however, is not the same as modern Caymus. Randy Dunn was the mastermind of Caymus in the 80s, with this vintage actually being the first that he stepped away in a fully official capacity from the property. Tasting notes for both wines as follows:

2014 Domaine Leflaive Batard-Montrachet: where do I begin? A legendary vineyard and producer combination with a great white wine vintage to boot. I think the wine has started to come around nicely, with an excellent balance of fruit and slight funkiness starting to come in. Lemon curd, roasted yellow apples, Bosc pear, and hints of pineapple and guava meld perfectly with the white truffle and mineral character of the wine. The oak frames the wine well, adding subtle vanilla and baking spice notes that interplay nicely with toasted hazelnut. The real standout is the structure. Incredible persistence with a richness and creaminess that is perfectly offset by the acidity. Special wine.

1986 Caymus Special Selection: don’t ever let anyone tell you that Napa can’t age. Some of my favorite wines ever have been Napa Cabernet from the 70s and 80s. Still plenty of fruit, though the character was more dried. Cherry, blackberry liqueur, black cherry, and fruit leather are what comes to mind. There’s an earthiness to this wine, like fresh turned soil and roasted oyster mushrooms. Coffee, dark Chocolate, burnt cinnamon, and cigar box notes are very present. Elevated tannins are balanced by surprisingly present acidity. Once again, a finish that just doesn’t quit. I also had some 2001 Mouton at the same time, and was surprised to prefer the Caymus to the Bordeaux. If only they still made wines like this!

This was a great meal that was made better by the people I got to share it with. Wine is meant to be consumed and shared, so let this post be a reason to open that wine you’ve been holding onto! ",22,1743963237.0,wine,10,0.92,False

So for context I (27F) have a younger brother and he was dating this girl for 2 years. But that all broke the day he came to me saying she cheated. My brother has a best friend let’s call him C who’s also 23, C had showed no interest in D before but they were having an intimate relationship with each other behind J’s back. Now I told my girlfriend (27F) about it and we both agree it’s messed up. J got over it but met a girl K (23F) at a coffee shop a couple months later and they exchanged numbers. Now it have come out that C and D (D kept rubbing her proposal in J’s face by tagging him in posts and stuff.) are getting married and a month later J proposed to K to spite D. Now this may be where I’m the A-hole, I yelled at my brother and told him it was immature and only showed D’s betrayal still effected him. I told him that if he just lead K on and didn’t tell her he only did it out of spite I would drop out of the wedding. Before you say that I shouldn’t go to the extreme- this is the guy who threatened to break up with D because she didn’t understand how to do something and then pretended to cheat because she stopped talking to him for a little. He has done many other similar things and this is the last straw for me. When J announced the venue D ‘just so happened’ to have the same one. The day after J’s wedding. D is confrontational and J gets riled up easily. So- am i the a-hole for not taking my brother’s side because he got married out of spite?",0,1743963193.0,AITA_Relationships,1,0.5,False

1jt0hze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jt0hze,curdling update/experiment,"If you saw my previous post in this subreddit, I was concerned over the curdling of my milk in my coffee. Lots of helpful redditors said it was the milk. This is right…and wrong at the same time. I’ve been drinking the same milk for over a year now and it’s never done this…but I did change one thing. (For reference, I use Califia organic almond milk.) I used to mix the califia with chobani creamer and then use that it and it never curled and I haven’t switched my pods I use. I started using 1883 syrup and the almond milk instead of chobani (trying to cut calories). This is when I started noticing. So today I did an experiment to lay my curiousity and confusion to rest. Left to right: In the first glass, I have almond milk & coffee. Second glass, I have almond milk, coffee, and syrup. Third glass, I have almond milk, coffee, & pistachio butter. The result is that it is the sugar/syrup affecting it. The plain coffee & almond milk isn’t curdling. The middle one with the syrup is curdling. To confirm this, photo 2 is after I added syrup into glass 1 that previously wasn’t curdling. Mystery solved!",4,1743963142.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False
