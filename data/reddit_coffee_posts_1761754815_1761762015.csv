I (28M) worked remote for a mid-sized tech company. When our manager left, the team fell apart, everyone doing random tasks, no one checking up on anything.

One day I realized I could just… stop. So I did. I stopped logging in. No one noticed. My direct reports assumed I was working on “backend admin stuff.” HR never followed up. I still got paid.

It’s been six months. I wake up, make coffee, play games, walk my dog, and nap. Payroll keeps depositing my check. I’m terrified to touch anything or alert them, but also weirdly proud of how long this has gone.

I know I’m stealing. I know it’ll catch up. But the freedom has been euphoric. I think I might actually cry the day they finally notice I don’t exist.",2,1761761898.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

Harper had just gotten home from a rough day and without hesitation, bee-lined it to his bed. A benefit of living in a studio apartment was the availability for Harper to unclothe himself right from the entrance to waste as little time as possible. He soon had the website with the recognizable orange and black logo queued up on an incognito tab. Harper popped his earbuds in and typed into the search bar one of the dozens of videos he frequented the most as he had zero intention to browse any new material. He skipped an ad, fast forwarded through a good portion of the video, and commenced with his lewd, self-indulgence. Harper had his fair share of vices and wasn’t shy to admit to them except for his porn addiction. It began not too long after Harper moved out of his parents’ house and had grown from a “every once in a while” to a daily occurrence. He had a healthy libido, but he mainly craved the dopamine high he reached upon climaxing. Within that moment everything was simply okay. And then the emptiness followed. It was like an equivalent exchange: a moment of dread for a moment of bliss. But to Harper the dread seemed to last longer and have lasting effects on his mental state. He used to believe he had a solid mental foundation, things never really got to him. Over the years this dread wore down on the foundation, making it resemble an egg shell more than a concrete slab.
Harper finished, cleaned himself off, and took a big puff off of his THC pen. Harper let out a cloud of smoke onto his phone’s screen as he half-mindlessly scrolled through memes, ads, and thirst traps, the latter no longer having the same pull on him with the ‘clarity’ he gained after finishing. Another side effect of his strenuous activity was the heaviness he felt in his eyes, intensified by the weed in his system. And so, Harper allowed himself to fall asleep. 

Harper awoke an hour and a half later with his stomach groaning. He begrudgingly got off his bed and walked the few steps he needed to enter his kitchen. He opened his fridge with the hopes of finding leftovers ready to be microwaved, but his hopes were shot down by his scarce inventory. Harper didn’t really feel like cooking and opted for something frozen at most. To his increasing dismay, Harper found an empty box of Hot Pockets in his freezer, cursing himself under his breath. He exaggerated a groan before turning towards his cupboard and at least finding a box of cereal. Paring it up with the last cup of milk he had left, the bowl of cereal made for a decent enough dinner. While scrolling through social media again, Harper came across a post from one of his high school friends, one that had gone to college, graduated, and landed a good job. The post was a photo dump of his past couple of weeks, sharing a life of fun experiences and ample social interaction. Harper remembered him as a quieter kid in high school and it seemed adulthood had broken him out of his shell. The milk and cereal turned sour in Harper’s mouth and they felt like metal shavings when he swallowed it. Here was someone that Harper knew hadn’t grown privileged or popular, and yet his life was substantially richer than Harper’s. Harper wanted to ask himself where it had all gone wrong, but he couldn’t even get halfway through the question when a pit formed in his chest. Harper pushed aside his bowl of cereal and began to choke back a sob. 
Harper had tried a similar route by going to college, but he dropped out after the second year. He went on to earn minimum wage at a job he hated and built himself up enough to earn a livable wage at a different job he hated slightly less. Working was all Harper had going for him, he hadn’t maintained his friendships from high school and didn’t really have any hobbies, especially none that promoted social interaction. Harper liked movies and at most would catch a matinee on a Saturday by himself. He was always by himself. Harper took a hit off of his pen and dragged the bowl back to him, contemplating if it’s possible for him to get his life on a better path. As he munched on the cereal he figured his financial situation didn’t need immediate improvement but he definitely needed to work on his ability to socialize. He got so used to not extending a conversation beyond small talk that even his coworkers barely got the tip of the iceberg. Harper hadn’t minded that, he thought he would be fine despite not making new friends, and it was the same even with a woman he was interested in. Harper never had a girlfriend because he never tried for one, maybe he had one or two clear opportunities and yet he let them slip past him. That was back in high school when it was easy to meet potential partners, so his current lifestyle meant he had zero chance at that. The metaphorical light bulb lit up when Harper realized that could be the best way to start, sort of like skydiving first to make riding a rollercoaster not seem as bad. And so, Harper downloaded the most popular dating app available. 

Setting up his profile turned out to be harder than Harper thought as he didn’t have a variety of pictures to choose from, not many interests worth sharing, and he couldn’t figure out how to write a bio that wasn’t boring or bland. Harper decided to go with a “short and sweet” vibe as a way to compensate for all of that. He even took two new photos on the spot, but staged them so they wouldn’t look like last-minute additions. Altogether it took Harper more than half an hour to finish up his profile and set his field of vision to a 25 mile radius to increase his chances. He went on to swipe through the available women until he used up his daily amount, having swiped mainly to the right. Harper knew he’d need to give it some time so he set his phone down and put on a movie to pass the time. Half an hour into the movie, his phone vibrated and he immediately snatched it up to see a notification from the app: he had a match. Harper couldn’t help but smile, even chuckle at the idea that a woman actually saw potential in him as a partner. He clicked on it, but instead of taking him to the app, the notification expanded into two more notifications.
Harper had three matches and his face felt hot, surely a bright shade of red as well. He composed himself before he opened the app and made his way to the messaging feature. None of the matches had messaged him first, which he wasn’t hoping for, so the ball was entirely in his court. Thankfully, Harper didn’t have to rack his brain too much for a clever icebreaker as he had given himself an alley-oop with the last line of his bio: “Swipe right on me and I’ll use my cheesiest pick-up line on you.” Even though he didn’t have to, Harper sent a different pick-up line to each of the women and then tried to continue watching the movie as he awaited their response. This time Harper was much more restless, checking his phone often and steadily paying less attention to the movie. At some point the one in a million chance that one of these women would want to meet that night crossed Harper’s mind, so he promptly took a shower and tidied himself up. This turned out to be the break in time Harper needed, because the next time he checked his phone he had two new messages from the app.
The first message Harper clicked on was from Daniela, a fellow 26-year-old who had received the “If I could rearrange the alphabet” line. Her responses were the laughing emoji and “That one is low key cute.” 
Harper smiled and responded “Yeah but still very cheesy, I wouldn’t be able to use it in person,” along with the laughing emoji. She’d take a couple minutes to respond with “It’s all about confidence, you can pull it off if you’re confident enough.” 
As Harper was beginning his response, feeling good about how the conversation was starting, Daniela followed up with “How tall are you?” 
The energy Harper had was almost completely sapped out of him upon reading her response. 
Harper tried to be optimistic and answered with “About 5’8” lol”
After the longest minute of his life, Harper received Daniela’s last message, “That explains it and next time be upfront about that,” before she removed herself from the chat.
Harper felt something inside crack, a small one but a crack nonetheless. His hands shook so he gripped the edge of his kitchen table with the empty threat of breaking off a chunk as he took deep breaths to simmer down. Harper let go of the table and quickly deleted his chat with Daniela: out of sight, out of mind. He took a hit of his pen and clicked on the second message he had received.
This message came from a 28-year-old woman named Jessica and she had received the “Are you from Tennessee” line. She responded with, “Ha ha, no, I’m a Minnesota girl through and through. But I do have an uncle that lives in Tennessee.” 
Harper was still sore about his last interaction as he tried to push past it and responded with, “That’s either a crazy coincidence or proof that I’m a psychic,” followed by the inquisitive emoji. Harper finished the movie he had momentarily ignored and was looking for a second one to watch when his phone vibrated. Harper grabbed his phone and opened Jessica’s message, reading, “Well if you’re a psychic then tell me my future.” 
Her playful tone eased Harper’s tension completely as he replied, “I think I see you and I going out for a drink tonight.” 
Despite his recent aggression and the wit behind that line, Harper’s hands became clammy and he had to put his phone down to wipe them off on his pants. In less than a minute, Jessica replied with, “Ugh, I can’t do tonight” followed by the weary emoji. A second message was delivered, “How about tomorrow night?” accompanied by the grinning emoji. Harper grew the biggest smile he’s had in years and blurted out loud, “Holy shit, it’s actually happening!” 
Harper collected himself and answered, “Of course, that sounds just as great.” 
Jessica replied quickly with, “Awesome, I’ve gotta go for now, so I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Have a good night,” concluding with the smiling emoji. Harper sent a “Goodnight” paired with the same emoji before dropping his phone as a wave of euphoria washed over him.
“I actually did it,” Harper said to himself. While basking in his victory a voice crawled through the crack in his mental foundation and asked with a tone indistinguishable between malice and dread, “What if she cancels on you?”
The emptiness was back and Harper felt himself shrink. He wasn’t able to immediately shrug off that fleeting thought, so it weighed on him. It made him think about a future text from Jessica that would prove it right. He thought about how it would be the same with every other match he managed to get. That or they’d knock him down first like Daniela did. This flared up anger within Harper as he thought about how easily Daniela was able to dismiss him over something like his height. Harper swung a right hook into his fridge, slightly denting it. He slowly pulled his fist back and saw there wasn’t any damage, it only partially throbbed with pain. 
“Just forget about her,” Harper thought to himself as he shook the pain away from his hand. He then checked the time on his phone and saw it was almost 10pm. Harper decided if there was ever a night for him to try to go to sleep by midnight it’d be tonight. He found a second movie to watch, opted for water rather than beer, and snuggled into his bed to wrap up the night. Fifteen minutes later, his phone vibrated.
Harper was elated, thinking it was Jessica after she found time to continue their conversation. Sure enough the notification came from the app and Harper clicked on it with lightning speed. His excitement subsided when he saw it wasn’t from Jessica, rather it was from the third woman that he matched with.
The third woman, a 23-year-old by the name of Megan, had responded with, “Why, because I look busted?” 
Harper was completely thrown off, wondering if he had misspoken with the pick-up line he sent. Then again, did he even care enough to reply now that he had a confirmed date with Jessica? There was nothing stopping him from unmatching with this third woman and making his profile unavailable to new eyes, but Harper figured he shouldn’t put all of his eggs into one basket. Plus it would be rude to not only ghost Megan, but to do so after a possible miscommunication. Just then, Harper remembered that he had sent Megan the “Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven” line. He opened the chat and sure enough that was the case, making Harper laugh in hindsight. He responded with, “We both know that’s a lie”, then glanced at her profile before messaging,  “What kind of movies do you like?” 
Megan quickly  replied with, “I like every kind of movie, but horror is my favorite.” 
Harper’s message back was, “Horror is definitely up there for me as far as genres go. I recently watched The Collector again.”
 Megan responded with, “Love a good slasher, though I prefer creature features. Have you ever watched Tremors?” 
Harper waded through his memory and then answered “It sounds familiar but I don’t think I have.” 
Megan responded with, “Then you should come over so I can pop that cherry for you.”
Harper felt like he had just made the game-winning shot in back to back games. Despite his wishful thinking earlier of possibly meeting someone that night, Harper still couldn’t believe a woman invited him over after a handful of messages. And despite his plans to sleep early, Harper responded, “I’m down, just send me your address and I’ll be over soon.” 
As he got himself together, Megan sent her address along with “Make that sooner than possible.”
In less than five minutes, Harper was out the door and skipping steps down the stairwell of his apartment building. He input the address into his phone on the way to the garage and sped off as soon as he got into his car.

Twenty minutes later, Harper pulled up to a nice house in an upper-middle class neighborhood. Harper wasn’t a stranger to neighborhoods like that, but he wasn’t entirely familiar either. His parents would drive him and his siblings well out of their way to neighborhoods like this to trick or treat at. Harper always wanted to live in a neighborhood like that with a house big enough so he wouldn’t have to share a room. His parents did the best they could, he didn’t blame them. Harper let Megan know he had just arrived through the app and got out of his car to wait for her reply. Harper went around the car and leaned against the passenger door, trying his best to ease his nerves. He watched the front door of the house open and a woman stepped out halfway as she called out, “Come on in, Harper!”
The night gave her hair the appearance of black, but the light from within the house revealed it to be a hazelnut brown. It draped down past her collarbone and laid on top of the white tee that complimented her figure. She wore black shorts, their short length made her legs seemingly extend farther than they actually did. And her smile, you’d think was magical with the way it had Harper walking before he even realized and he soon reached the door.
“Clearly you’re Megan, unless you happen to be her twin,” Harper commented. 
“Thankfully there’s only one of me,” Megan joked, “I’m enough of a handful as it is.” 
Harper stepped in and instantly felt warm, like he was always meant to be there. 
“You can leave your shoes next to the door and your jacket in that closet,” Megan instructed as she made her way to the couch ahead of them, flipping off a light switch along the way. Harper caught himself staring before following her orders. He approached the couch as Megan tapped the cushion next to her and saw the array of snacks on the coffee table. He grabbed a water bottle and placed it to his right as he sat down, unconsciously setting a barrier between him and Megan.
“Nice spread and even nicer house,” Harper said as he looked around, “Do you live here on your own?”
“Yeah, it’s my childhood home actually,” Megan answered, “My parents left it to me after they decided to move to a place closer to the wilderness; we’re big outdoorsy people. I woulda had a roommate but my sister moved in with her college friends instead.”
“Well I’m very jealous,” Harper admitted, “And it’s equally impressive you can maintain this place on your own.”
“I do well financially speaking and all from home,” Megan remarked. She then snatched a remote and navigated through the multiple streaming services listed on her TV in search of the movie Tremors.
“What do you do, if you don’t mind me asking,” Harper asked.
“Marketing, it’s no big deal but the meetings are abundant and exhausting,” Megan said as she feigned distress before giving a small laugh, “What about you?”
“I work in a factory, it’s repetitive and relatively simple stuff but it can get pretty strenuous,” Harper answered. 
“So you’ve got that blue collar strength,” Megan surmised. 
Harper laughed, “I guess but it’s not much, just enough to get my job done.”
“You’re selling yourself short,” Megan said, “I’m sure you’re ideal for a moving day. Got all the friends ringing you up for help.” She finally found the movie and started it.
“Maybe but I don’t have a lot of friends,” Harper said before he could think. He regretted it but continued anyway, “I had a good amount of friends in high school but life happens. Now I barely keep in touch through socials.”
“I get that, it feels like that’s more common than anyone would expect,” Megan said, her tone dropping for a second before bubbling back up, “Then you gotta learn how to make friends as an adult, which isn’t as complicated as it was when we were teenagers. It’s just that now everyone isn’t as available as we used to be.”
Harper smiled and said, “Yeah, you just gotta make the effort and put yourself out there.”
Harper and Megan watched the movie remotely uninterrupted for almost an hour, remarks and jokes were sporadically made. Over the course of said time, Harper noticed that the space between them had been shrinking. He was sure it wasn’t him, he wasn’t one to be forward like that, For once in his life, Harper got the clue and knew he had to make a move. 
Harper cunningly picked up the water bottle to take his first drink from it, placed it on his left side, and moved right next to Megan in the process. Then as casually as he could, Harper raised his arm and placed it on the top of the couch. Megan reciprocated his actions by resting her head on his shoulder. Harper placed his arm on her to seal the deal and goosebumps erupted all over his body upon contact with her soft skin. He felt like his temperature was rising, his skin prickling off the alluring scent from her hair. Harper tried to maintain his breathing normal as his lungs seemingly exaggerated their expansion. 
“Hey,” Megan spoke and as if it were a spell, that single word manifested into a hand that grabbed Harper by the chin and turned him to face her. She raised her face towards his until their noses and lips were separated by mere molecules. Harper’s entire body was in a state similar to fight or flight as he couldn’t decide on giving into his hormones or breakaway before embarrassing himself. Illuminated by the TV’s glow, Harper’s earlier pick-up line held true to Megan as he beheld her divinity and despite how low he held himself, he dared to go beyond the mortal plane and met heaven through the lips of Megan. A supernova erupted within Harper as he and Megan’s kisses progressed from brief and gentle to drawn out and heavy. Harper’s hands instinctively explored Megan’s body, he felt her hands do the same. Just as things were ramping up, Megan broke away and said, “Let’s take this to my room.”
“Yeah,” Harper said as he caught his breath, enthusiastically nodding along. Megan rose from the couch and held out her hand, leading Harper away after he placed his hand in hers. The windows practically fogged up as they walked past them and Harper felt a similar sensation as he had when the couple of times he took acid. For despite the only light coming from the full moon, it was enough to fully illuminate the house as Megan led him to her room. Harper wanted to take into account every detail of this night, he felt it would be one of the most pivotal experiences he’d have. 
Megan opened the door to her room and Harper felt he had entered a whole new world after crossing the threshold. Megan guided him to sit on her bed as she remained standing. Harper looked up at her with the eyes of someone looking up at the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Megan removed her shirt and revealed a black bra. The contrast between her black attire, dark hair, and white skin was enough to give Megan’s skin the illusion of a glow, like a heavenly body in the night sky. Harper followed her lead, though his skin was just tan enough that it didn’t mimic the same glow. Megan straddled Harper and she ran her hands through his hair while his hands gripped her body close to his. They resumed their kissing with a higher intensity than before. At some point, Megan guided Harper’s hands away from her body, put her hands on his shoulders, and with a sudden shift in weight, pinned Harper down to her bed. Harper was taken aback momentarily, but what Megan did next made him pay no further mind to it. Megan created a path from his lips, to his neck, down his chest, and beyond his abdomen. Harper’s heartbeat reached a speed he had never experienced before as he feebly reached to unbuckle his pants. Megan turned his hands away as she worked the buckle instead, Harper’s rising excitement not making it any easier for her. Harper felt his waistline loosened and he helped Megan get his jeans at least down to his ankles, the presence of Megan’s hands on his inner thighs pinning him back down to the bed. Megan teased him further with trailing hands and  playful bites. Harper was feeling like he was about to explode when a sudden fatigue set in and it steadily increased. He struggled to keep his eyes open as his eyelids felt like sandbags, only to then be met with blurred vision. Harper tried to sit up, but one of  Megan’s hands landed on his chest to guide him back down while the other began to tug on his boxer briefs. Harper was caught between his volcanic lust and rising concern for his spontaneous symptoms. Ultimately, Harper also got it into his head that he might end up embarrassing himself, so he decided he should say something. “Hold on, I don’t feel-,” is all Harper was able to get out before he plunged into total darkness.


A strong smell pulled Harper out of one darkness and into another. His body still felt heavy and his mind felt like a turbulent sea slowly easing to a calm after a passing storm. Harper tried to wipe his face, but he found himself secured to the chair he sat on. There were bindings on his limbs, he could tell it was duct tape with the way it felt on his skin and from what he could see via the moonlight streaming through the windows. Then he made out a figure ahead of him in the darkness and his heart jumped. Based on the faint silhouette, Harper asked, “Megan?”
There was a pause followed by two, indistinguishable sounds that spawned a small flame within a lantern. The flame revealed the figure to indeed be Megan, still wearing the t-shirt and shorts combo, but her expression was completely different than before. She was equal parts solemn and indifferent, as if she was aware of an impending doom and was resigned to that fate. Megan had been looking down and when her eyes flicked up to meet Harper’s, he could swear their color was lighter than he remembered. Harper broke the silence, “Megan, what’s going on?”
“Something bad,” she plainly stated. 
Harper’s leg began to shake and he began to subtly apply pressure against his constraints, “Megan, please, you can let me go and I won’t tell anyone. I promise I’m not clever enough to trick you, I just want to go home.”
“I can’t let you go, Harper,” Megan said with an unwavering bleakness, “This is something I have to do.” 
“What exactly do you have to do,” Harper blurted out with a panic, his breathing becoming staccato.
Megan exhaled through her nose and said, “I have a curse and if I don’t satisfy it, worse things will happen.”
Harper let out a short laugh due to sheer bewilderment, “A curse? Are you fucking- you’re fucking with me, right?”
“This isn’t a joke,” Megan said with a reserved anger. It reminded Harper of the danger he was in, so he nodded as Megan continued, “This also explains why I don’t have much of a support system anymore. Years ago, my group of high school friends and I decided to go camping right after graduation. Like I said, my family is big into the outdoors and my friends weren’t strangers to it either. That’s why we decided to really rough it this time and camp outside of the regulated grounds. In a way we wanted to conquer the great unknown of nature to give us the confidence to then conquer the great unknown of adulthood. We were only out there for two nights, but something targeted us after the first one. It then set out to hunt on the second. There were five of us at the start and by the end I barely clung on to life while my last surviving friend dragged me out of that forest. We thought we were safe, that we got away, but we had only escaped death. That monster left us with the same curse that allowed its existence.”
Harper slowly cleared his throat and said, “Megan, I don’t doubt what happened to you but I don’t think you’re cursed, I think you have PTSD.”
“Therapists said the same thing, that and survivor’s guilt,” Megan responded, “But that doesn’t explain the physical changes I go through. Although I didn’t tell them about that, otherwise they’d definitely think I’ve gone crazy. I’m sure you’re thinking the same and I don’t blame you. I’ll at least do you the courtesy of showing you.” Megan set down the lantern in between them and then rolled up her left sleeve. Harper watched as she then nicked the inside of her bicep and before he could react, he watched her dig into the wound with her right index and middle fingers. 
Harper screamed in abject horror, “Megan, stop,” until his voice was completely ripped out by what he saw next. It was unfathomable, it went against everything Harper understood of the universe and its laws of physics. He watched Megan rip the skin off her left arm and unleash a sea of partially matted fur covering an arm much larger than the original. The increase of density was clear along with its length as her new wrist went past her knee. Megan began slouched to the side before she aligned herself upright, shaking wet matter off her new arm and flexing the clawed fingers. Megan looked back at Harper with a raw sienna instead of the original brown in her eyes, “Do you understand now?”
Harper achieved a state close to brain death for a moment as he struggled to process this revelation. He made a conclusion that brought him to tears before he vocalized it, “You’re gonna eat me now.”
“I wish it were that simple,” Megan stated, “Unfortunately that’s not enough for the beast within. 
It  craves the hunt more than flesh and if I don’t satisfy that aspect as well, I risk losing complete control while in the fully transformed state. That’s why I began bringing its prey to this cabin my family no longer uses.”
“Why me,” is all Harper had left to ask.
Megan swallowed a lump in her throat and answered, “It’s nothing personal, I actually had a good time getting to know you. But it’s clear that you’re on your own, just like me, and by choosing loners I run less of a risk of being found out.” 
“Because no one will come looking for us,” Harper said with a rasp in his voice. Megan simply confirmed his statement with a nod. She stepped towards him and his whole body flinched and resisted against the bindings. 
Megan stopped right in front of him, extended her left arm towards his right forearm, said, “The hunt has to begin,” and freed his arm with a single claw as it cut through the tape with ease. 
“You’ll have at least five minutes,” Megan continued as she handed him a utility knife, “But don’t get your hopes up.” 
She then turned away from him and walked out the cabin, leaving the door wide open.",1,1761761826.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1ojc5a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCGIreland/comments/1ojc5a5/my_experience_following_the_rules_of_emerald_tcg/,My experience following the rules of Emerald TCG for 9 months,"I joined this group in March of this year and everything seemed to run smoothly without any issues. Around 3 months in of being in the group I suddenly started to get mocked and bullied by very toxic emeralds TCG mods and also the members that joined this discord group. It kept going until I was banned this week.

Today I was removed from the group because I posted a picture of a product that  I purchased as I wasn’t even selling this item within the group, and Just wanted to show it off. In response I got people bullying me, ganging up on me, and in the end I was banned from the group without any explanation. 

Before this happened to me, on multiple occasions I would @ staff when rules on selling were broken after time stamps were not presented. They have a “30 day rule” of not being allowed to sell new pokemon sets that just dropped in the group but when their “buddies” were posting the exact same thing, their listings were always left up without any complaints as well as pre orders for new sets dropping.

I was hesitant trying to cover my pokemon hobby costs by listing products but once I saw staff listing the same products I knew  I was good to, until they would clown me. 

Throughout my time within this group I have made friends whether it was through selling, buying or trading and even met up with them for a coffee.

The moderators seem to like to portray themselves as a “chill” and  “sound” group but there is nothing good about their group. 

I have heard of others being banned for doing the same thing as the moderators that run the group or the “lads” they’re “friendly” within the group get away with it. 

Multiple people I have been in contact with  also told me they boycotted their “emerald card show” because of how they behave themselves, no respect and regard for others, and as long as you’re “buddy buddies” with them you’re in the clear. Something needs to be done going forward as I have never met anyone more toxic in this hobby space than people in this group.

I know there is 2 sides to every story but I’m not the first person in recent days/weeks that has had something negative to say about this group, so just have a think about that yourself before pointing fingers. ",2,1761761775.0,PokemonTCGIreland,0,1.0,False

But we just got a new hire(18m) and I’ve had trouble training them from the get go.
They don’t like to listen and get frustrated easily when they don’t listen to my training. And have even gone so far as to ask me if I’m qualified to train. I’m relatively thick skinned, but comments like that, often, will get to me. We’ve gone through the two weeks and they know how to make a latte. And we’ve started our register training, the big part for this hire is that they HATE coffee and are allergic to Lemonade. I’ve tried everything to make coffee suitable for them to drink or encourage them to try new food items (they will usually only grab a lemon loaf and a mdrl, even though they tell me they are allergic to citrus) and I feel as though I’ve tried to be really accommodating despite their name calling. 
Now we’re on our last two days (so more interaction with our client base) and they have no idea what to recommend to the customers. So they get more frustrated, and even when I try to slip them my answers they don’t take it well.

I have a (previously tested positive) known allergy to red ants and hornets/wasps--which I sadly discovered the hard way--and carry an EpiPen mostly for when I go hiking.

I was on my way to go hiking and stopped at a fateful 711 for gas, prepackaged Dunkin Donuts coffee, and a 711 glaze donut (I had not eaten lunch). I have the coffee and the donut as I drive on my way to this hike. Within 15 minutes of the donut/coffee, I start experiencing the strangest prickling burning stinging feeling across my chest. It felt like something bit/stung me, but nothing did.

Eventually I take an exit and pull over at another gas station to examine myself and noticed that I am covered in what looks like red hives (just not super raised), my right arm is burning, both palms feel like they are on fire, and my throat is starting to close up and my lips/face swell and go numb. I immediately realized I was having an allergic reaction to something, popped two Benadryl and grabbed the EpiPen. I've never had to admininister it on myself, but once my throat closed knew it was time. Jabbed myself.  Got myself to an urgent care in rural nowhere where they ambulanced me to the ER at a hospital. I spent 6 more hours there getting IV meds. I'm discharged, and the next day <24 hours later I have a second reaction. Only, this time the swelling is worse. I go to the ER back in civilization and over several hours receive 3 shots of epinephrine. My reaction does not abate and they keep me in the hospital for another day and a half on IV steroids, antihistamines etc. and I even have to have more epinephrine the next day in the hospital itself. I am eventually discharged with steroids and antihistamines to take for a week+. They diagnosed it as a rare but still happens ""biphasic"" reaction, especially as I continued to return to anaphylaxis even after epinephrine in the ER the second day. (Note: no anaphylactic shock, just anaphylaxis itself).

I've finished my steroids now over a week later, still finishing up famotadine (and Zyrtec) and I definitely do not feel normal. My throat is much better, but skin will feel prickly on and off and I am eating an extremely limited diet of whole veggies/fruit, some dairy, eggs, and a couple of cereals. I think I can add back in rices/gluten free stuff/etc. trying to keep things low histamine while my body feel so weird. I am an intensive exerciser and was told by my allergist to avoid high intensity exercise for now, sticking to yoga or walking. I have no earthly idiea what caused this reaction. My stress levels prior to were very high, so yes, could have been idiopathic.

Blood testing shows zero allergy to hornets/wasps/red ants which I know is inaccurate as past testing and lived experience proved this to be positive. Does that mean my blood testing is possibly unreliable? Most foods came back negative, as well, including sesame which I was most suspicious of (possible xcontamination with the donut lol). I have, apparently, an allergy to pork and lamb but no alpha gal. I am vegetarian, but I recognize cross-contamination is a thing to watch out for. I'll note that I did not get stung/bit during my initial reaction, it happened immediately post donut/coffee in my car.

Anyway - wondering if anyone has experiencd anything like this before? In terms of biphasic reactions, feeling weird after anaphylaxis, when you could return to exercise, if your blood testing also was not accurate at first, or if you also had a mystery reaction to potentially no allergen?",1,1761761310.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

A few months ago, my manager asked me to help train a new hire, Lisa, on our department’s workflow. I didn’t mind at first, she seemed friendly, a little scattered, but eager to learn.

After the first week, though, she started acting weirdly competitive. If I mentioned I was swamped, she’d say things like, “Really? Doesn’t seem that hard.” or “I don’t know how you’re always behind.” It got under my skin, but I tried to brush it off.

Then one day, she apparently decided to “prove” I wasn’t actually busy. She emailed our manager a whole spreadsheet titled “Task Comparison,” where she literally tracked both our daily work, side by side and claimed she was “concerned about the imbalance in workload.”

The thing is… her spreadsheet made her look worse. She had logged herself as “actively working” for hours on things that didn’t exist (like “brainstorming alignment goals”), while mine showed completed tickets and client notes.

Our manager called both of us in and asked her where she got this idea. Lisa said she “wanted transparency.” Manager said, “Then be transparent about your actual output.”

Since then, she’s been overly nice, bringing coffee, complimenting my work but the vibe is just permanently off. I’ve never had someone try to document my day before.",11,1761761289.0,coworkerstories,3,1.0,False
1ojbwsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1ojbwsr/chapter_one/,Chapter One,"Morning tastes like metal again.
That tang on my tongue that no amount of toothpaste can fix — the taste of hospital air, recycled and disinfected, still clinging to me months after discharge. I keep thinking I’ll wake up and it’ll finally fade, that the world will smell like coffee or rain or anything alive. But every morning, it’s the same: metal, medicine, silence.
The apartment isn’t messy, but it looks tired. Dishes stack like a conversation I stopped halfway through. The blinds hang crooked, slats tilted just enough to let in gray light that turns everything a shade of blue I can’t name. The clock on the wall has stopped at 3:42. I never changed the battery. I like the lie of it — that nothing has moved since the moment I stopped trying.
I used to count the hours between pills. Now I count the hours between thoughts.
Sometimes I win.
The doctors told me healing isn’t linear. They drew neat lines on notepads and used words like management and stability as if my mind were a spreadsheet that could be balanced. Every prescription came with a pamphlet — side effects, warnings, hotline numbers. None of them mentioned the quiet that comes when you’ve tried everything and nothing works. The kind of quiet that hums just beneath your skin, waiting for a reason.
Today the hum feels louder.
Maybe it’s the fridge, maybe it’s me.
I used to go for walks when it got this bad. Put on my headphones, pretend I was soundtracking someone else’s life. But even music feels foreign now, like someone speaking through a wall. Every lyric about hope or love just reminds me how far I am from both.
I sit on the couch and stare at the pill bottle on the table. Half-full. The label has my name spelled wrong — Loren instead of Lorin. I never corrected them. Maybe I wanted to see how long it would take before anyone noticed.
A knock breaks the stillness. Three soft taps — familiar.
“Hey, it’s me,” a voice says through the door. “You alive in there?”
Jade.
Her voice is the only one I don’t hate yet. She’s been around since the worst of it — the nights I couldn’t stop shaking, the days I refused to speak. She’s seen the hospitals, the relapses, the empty stares. She still comes back.
I open the door.
She grins, holding up two coffees. “Double shot for the dead girl walking.”
“Make it triple,” I mutter, but I take it anyway.
She scans me — the same quick once-over she always does, the silent inventory of how bad it’s gotten. I can tell by the way her smile softens that I don’t look great.
“You sleep?” she asks.
“Define sleep.”
“That’s a no.” She drops onto the couch, kicking off her shoes. “You’ve got that thousand-yard stare again. Maybe you should—”
“Don’t say it,” I cut in. “Don’t say therapy.”
Her eyebrows lift. “Then I was gonna say food, but damn.”
I almost laugh. Almost.
We sit there in half-comfort, sipping coffee that tastes like burnt sugar. The silence stretches long enough for the hum to return. She senses it, I think, because she starts talking faster — small things, surface things. Work gossip. The neighbor who plays drums at midnight. The usual distractions.
Then, out of nowhere, she says, “Have you ever tried shrooms?”
I look up. “What?”
She shrugs. “I don’t mean, like, party-trip crazy. I mean… therapeutic micro-dose. My cousin did it when she couldn’t get out of bed. Said it opened something. Made her see color again.”
I stare at her. “That’s not exactly FDA-approved.”
“Neither is being miserable forever.” She says it gently, not cruel. “You’ve done everything they told you. The meds, the therapy, the breathing crap. You still look like a ghost.”
“Maybe I am.”
She sighs. “You’re not. You’re just stuck.”
That word hits harder than it should. Stuck.
Like chewing gum on pavement. Like me.
Jade leans forward, voice lower. “I can get you something clean. Just to try once. Not heavy. Just… a shift. You might actually feel something.”
I want to laugh, to tell her how absurd it is — that she thinks salvation can fit in a capsule or a paper tab. But the truth presses quietly behind my ribs: I want to believe her.
She studies my silence. “You don’t have to decide now. Just… think about it.”
When she leaves, the apartment feels emptier than before.
The coffee has gone cold. The hum in my chest syncs with the ticking of a clock that isn’t even moving.
Night comes too soon.
I lie in bed, eyes open, ceiling spinning slow. My brain replays the day on a loop: the coffee, the offer, the hum. I think about all the years I’ve tried to fix myself. About the doctors who promised clarity and gave me chemical fog instead. About how I’ve become fluent in side effects — dizziness, nausea, emotional flattening. Flattening. As if feeling nothing were a treatment.
I reach for my phone and scroll through old photos.
Most are from the before years — college, laughter, faces half-remembered. There’s one of me at the ocean, smiling at a camera I can’t see now without feeling foreign. I wonder if that version of me still exists somewhere, trapped in an old file name. Or maybe she dissolved in the hospital light like everything else.
A message buzzes. Jade again.
“If you change your mind, I’ve got you. Just say when.”
I type, I’ll think about it, but don’t send it. I let the words glow on the screen, their pale light painting my hand. For a second, I can almost feel movement — like the world hasn’t completely stopped spinning.
Then the hum rises again.
It’s everywhere now — in the pipes, in the air, in the space between thoughts. It sounds like something calling, faint and rhythmic, almost a melody. My heartbeat syncs to it until I can’t tell if it’s coming from me or the world.
I close my eyes and imagine the sound as a door. Behind it, maybe, there’s color. Maybe there’s quiet that doesn’t ache.
I know what Jade would say — that it’s just the depression talking.
But the truth is, I’m tired of listening to anything else.
At 2:13 a.m., I get up and turn on the light.
The walls shimmer faintly — maybe from exhaustion, maybe from want. I pick up my journal, the one the therapist told me to use to “track emotions.” Every page is the same: “Tired.” “Empty.” “Fine.” The ink itself looks bored.
Tonight, I write something different:
“If the mind is a cage, maybe the key is madness.”
The words scare me. Then they don’t.
I stare at them until they stop looking like language and start looking like permission.
Outside, the city hums with faraway lights. Somewhere out there, Jade is asleep, or maybe she’s awake, thinking about whether I’ll text. I already know I will.
I reach for my phone again.
My fingers hover, then type the message before my better judgment can interfere.
“When can we start?”
I hit send.
The message leaves like a sigh. The hum quiets, just a little. And for the first time in months, I feel something like anticipation — thin, dangerous, alive. The morning looks cleaner than it should.
Light pours through the crooked blinds, soft and gold, and for a second I almost believe it’s trying to start over with me. Then the ache in my chest reminds me where I am. Same couch. Same stale air. Same hum.
I check my phone before I even breathe.
A message waits like a dare.
Jade: “Tonight. Small dose first. Trust me.”
Beneath it, a smiley face and a mushroom emoji. I stare at them too long, wondering when emojis started feeling like holy symbols.
I could still change my mind. I could delete the message, toss the phone, take my prescribed pills like a good patient and pretend the world hasn’t already closed its mouth around me.
Instead, I type,
“Okay.”
The word looks harmless. One syllable that could mean anything.
But in my chest it lands like thunder.
I spend the day in fragments.
Shower. Window. Coffee. Repeat. The sound of running water is the only thing that feels human. I study myself in the fogged mirror—pale skin, hollow eyes, hair in a shape that refuses definition. I try to imagine what I’ll look like when I’m free of this, whatever this is. Maybe brighter. Maybe gone.
I dry off and walk through the apartment touching things I haven’t touched in months: the corner of the bookshelf, the chipped ceramic vase my mother gave me before the first breakdown, the window latch that squeaks like a voice clearing its throat. Each object feels like proof that I exist, but none of them make it real.
At noon, I skip breakfast. The coffee’s enough.
The hum beneath my ribs has changed tone; it’s expectant now, like an orchestra tuning before a song no one’s heard.
By six, Jade texts again.
“On my way. Got the good kind. You’ll be fine.”
Fine.
The word everyone uses when they can’t promise safety.
She arrives twenty minutes later, hair pulled into a messy bun, hoodie zipped halfway. She looks like someone who has slept, eaten, laughed—all foreign acts. In her hand, a small glass jar glints like an artifact.
“Ready?” she asks, stepping in.
“Define ready,” I say.
She grins. “That’s the spirit.”
She sets the jar on the coffee table. Inside are tiny fragments, earthy and beige, looking innocent enough to belong in a spice rack. She unscrews the lid and the air fills with the smell of soil and rain.
“Psilocybin,” she says, like a teacher giving a vocabulary lesson. “Natural. Grown by a friend, safe batch.”
“Safe batch,” I echo, not sure if I’m mocking her or myself.
She starts unpacking her bag—bottled water, a lighter, a pack of sage incense, a tiny Bluetooth speaker. The efficiency of ritual.
“Don’t laugh,” she says. “The vibe matters. You want calm, not chaos.”
I want to say there’s no such thing as calm for people like me, but I let her have the illusion. She dims the lights, burns the incense, and the room begins to smell like forest after rain.
“Just a small dose,” she assures me again. “Enough to open a door, not break it down.”
I stare at the pieces in her palm. They look like nothing.
How much of my life has been changed by nothing-looking things?
White pills, clear capsules, words that vanished the moment they hit the air.
“Trust me,” Jade whispers.
I nod, though I don’t know if I’m trusting her or the possibility of an ending.
We sit cross-legged on the carpet like teenagers waiting for a séance to start. I chew slowly, the texture dry and bitter, like chewing the edge of an old dream.
“Ugh,” I say, grimacing.
“Yeah, they’re not gourmet.” She laughs softly. “Drink water.”
The taste won’t leave. It clings to the back of my tongue, dirt and memory. I swallow, and time bends a little.
Jade leans back against the couch, music low—some ambient track that sounds like distant waves wrapped in static. “Close your eyes if you want. Just breathe. Let it be weird.”
Weird is fine. I’ve been weirder than this.
At first, nothing happens. My mind is still the same gray hallway it’s always been. Then, slowly, the corners soften. The hum quiets, then deepens, stretching into something round and warm. The edges of the room shift as though the air itself is exhaling.
My heartbeat slows. Colors lean toward me.
Jade’s face ripples, gentle, like light through water.
“How are you feeling?” she asks, her voice distant but kind.
“I think… the world’s breathing,” I murmur.
She smiles. “Good. That’s the point.”
The ceiling expands, turning into a dome of shifting gray and violet. I feel the texture of the carpet against my palms, each fiber pulsing faintly like veins. My skin hums in reply. The fear I expected never arrives. Instead, something softer fills the space it left—a strange, childlike curiosity.
I laugh, surprised by the sound. It’s lighter than I remember.
Jade laughs too. “There she is.”
There I am.
Or maybe someone new entirely.
Minutes—or hours—pass. Time forgets itself.
I see colors where there shouldn’t be any: blues breathing inside shadows, gold shimmering in silence. I close my eyes and the inside of my mind lights up—patterns like constellations forming and reforming faster than thought.
A voice that sounds like mine says, this is what peace feels like, but I can’t tell if it’s coming from my mouth or from somewhere deeper.
I think of all the hospital rooms, the sterile brightness, the endless questionnaires: Have you had thoughts of harming yourself?
I think of how every answer was a compromise between truth and fear.
Here, there are no questions.
Here, I just am.
Jade breaks the spell softly.
“You good?”
I open my eyes. The world has turned translucent, the walls breathing slow, the shadows friendly. “Yeah,” I whisper. “I think I’m… good.”
She nods, watching me like she’s guarding something sacred. “See? Nothing to fear. It’s just your brain showing you another version of the world.”
But her words drift away. I’m already sinking back into the light. The hum beneath everything becomes music, and for the first time in forever, the song doesn’t hurt.
I lie on my back, staring at the ceiling as it unfolds like paper turning into sky. The air smells like rain again. Every inhale feels like forgiveness.
If this is what living can feel like, maybe dying was just a misunderstanding.
Later—maybe much later—the colors fade to dusk. My body feels heavy, pleasant. Jade helps me sit up, hands warm against mine.
“Water,” she says. “Hydrate or die-drate.”
I smile weakly. “You sound like a PSA.”
“Someone’s gotta keep you alive.”
She packs up the remnants of our ritual. The incense has burned down to ash, leaving a spiral of smoke that curls toward the ceiling. The jar sits empty on the table like a promise half-kept.
“So?” she asks, eyes bright. “You think it helped?”
I search for words. None fit. Everything inside me feels rearranged, like furniture moved while I wasn’t home.
“It was… quiet,” I say finally. “But not the kind that hurts.”
Jade smiles, satisfied. “Then it’s working.”
Working.
The word echoes.
When she leaves, the apartment holds a different kind of silence. Not hollow—suspended. I walk to the window and look out at the city lights blinking through the fog. Each one pulses like a thought I can almost touch.
I feel something alive again, coiling slow in my chest. Not happiness, not yet—just a pulse.
And beneath it, a whisper that sounds like curiosity.
What if you went a little deeper next time? The world feels softer the next morning, like it’s exhaling.
Light filters through the blinds in slow ribbons, pale gold drifting across my hands. Even the hum—the one that usually claws at the edges of my ribs—has changed pitch. It isn’t angry anymore. It just… hums.
For a while I stay still, listening. Every sound feels new. The fridge hums in harmony. The pipes sigh like wind through trees. When I blink, color lingers on the back of my eyelids. I don’t know if it’s memory or residue, but it’s gentle.
I make coffee for the first time in weeks without dread. The smell doesn’t choke me. The mug warms my hands instead of reminding me how cold I’ve been. I drink slowly, waiting for the panic to return, but it doesn’t. There’s only stillness—unfamiliar, but kind.
I should feel scared of that.
Instead I feel relief so pure it borders on hunger.
Jade texts midmorning.
Jade: “How’s the mind?”
Me: “Still breathing.”
Jade: “No nightmares?”
Me: “Not last night.”
Jade: “Then it did its job. Give it time before another.”
I don’t answer that last one.
Because even as I type, I’m thinking of the light—the way it folded around me, the weightless quiet that felt like forgiveness. Time feels like a leash now, tugging me back toward the gray.
I walk to the mirror. The reflection startles me: same face, same dark circles, but something alive flickers behind the eyes. I whisper to the glass, “You’re still here,” and for the first time, I almost believe it.
But underneath belief, curiosity stirs.
If one trip could quiet the noise, what could two do?
By noon the city outside feels too sharp. Cars hiss over wet pavement, people bark into phones, everything moving faster than it should. I try to read, then to write, then to simply sit—but the silence from last night spoiled me. Now the world feels abrasive, all static and edges.
My notebook lies open on the table, yesterday’s words staring up:
“If the mind is a cage, maybe the key is madness.”
I trace the letters with my fingertip until the ink smudges. The thought doesn’t scare me anymore. It feels practical.
When Jade stops by that evening, she carries soup and concern in equal measure.
“Hydrate, eat, rest,” she says, setting the bowl down like she’s feeding a patient. “You don’t want to crash.”
“I’m fine,” I tell her.
“You always say that.”
“This time it’s true.”
She studies me, lips pursed. “You’ve got that look.”
“What look?”
“The still hearing the music look.”
I laugh softly. “Maybe I am.”
She sighs. “Promise me you’ll give it a week before touching that stuff again. Integration matters.”
“Integration,” I repeat, tasting the word like medicine. “Sure.”
Her eyes narrow. “I mean it, Lorin. It’s not candy. It can turn if you push too far.”
“I won’t.”
But even as I say it, the hum inside me quickens—like a heartbeat recognizing a lie.
After she leaves, I sit by the window, lights off. The city glows in veins and pulses. Somewhere, someone’s music drifts through the wall—a slow electronic rhythm, low and hypnotic. It syncs with the hum beneath my skin until I can’t tell which is which.
The trip’s echo returns in flashes: the ceiling turning to sky, the feeling of breathing without fear, the color that came from nowhere. I want it again. Not later. Now.
I pick up my phone, scroll through old messages. One stands out—Jade’s cousin, the “friend of a friend” who grows the mushrooms. There’s a number. I could reach out. Just to ask. Just to be prepared.
But “just” is the word people use before doing the thing they swore they wouldn’t.
I put the phone down.
Then pick it up again.
The hum swells.
The air thickens.
I text,
“Hey, this is Lorin. Jade mentioned you. I wanted to talk about the microdose.”
No emoji, no explanation. I hit send and set the phone face-down like a confession.
Hours blur. Dusk becomes night, night becomes a low violet hush. The streetlights outside flicker with a rhythm that feels deliberate. I lean my forehead against the windowpane. My reflection doubles over itself, ghost on glass.
“You said you wanted quiet,” it whispers back.
“I found it,” I answer.
“Then why are you still listening?”
I don’t have an answer.
When the reply comes, it’s short:
Unknown: “Hey. I can help. Let’s talk.”
No name. No hesitation.
The hum steadies into something like applause.
Sleep doesn’t come.
I lie awake, watching light crawl along the ceiling like veins of gold under skin. Every time I close my eyes, the colors from last night return—not wild, just patient. They wait behind my eyelids like they know I’ll come back.
At 3 a.m., I get up, pour a glass of water, and stand in the kitchen. The hum is louder here, vibrating through the pipes, the refrigerator, the floorboards. I press my ear to the wall, half-jokingly, and whisper, “I hear you.”
Something answers—a faint ripple under the sound, almost a chord.
It’s nothing. It’s everything.
By morning, I’ve convinced myself it was imagination. I brush my hair, put on a clean shirt, try to look human for the world. But underneath, that same pull grows, patient as tide.
I check the phone again.
Another message:
Unknown: “Tomorrow night. Bring water. No expectations. Just flow.”
I should delete it. I should call Jade. I should remember every warning label I ever ignored.
Instead, I stare at the words until they feel inevitable.
I spend the rest of the day drifting through tasks: laundry, dishes, pointless order. Every sound around me seems alive—the clink of glass, the swish of fabric, even the quiet between noises. It all hums in the same frequency, one that seems to know my name.
I catch myself humming back.
Evening again. The light outside turns copper, soft at the edges. I sit at the table and open my journal to a new page. For once, the pen moves easily.
“It didn’t hurt.”
“It felt like remembering something I’d never known.”
“Maybe the mind isn’t a cage. Maybe it’s a door that forgot it could open.”
The words flow until the page fills. I stare at them, heart steady, mind clear.
Then I close the book, as if sealing a spell.
Later, lying in bed, I replay Jade’s voice: “Promise me you’ll give it a week.”
I whisper to the dark, “I’ll give it two days.”
The hum approves. It vibrates through my bones like low music, comforting and dangerous.
I think of the tunnel from my dream last night—spiraling colors, deep and endless. In the dream, I wasn’t falling. I was floating.
Maybe the fall is the point.
When sleep finally takes me, it isn’t the heavy, dreamless kind I’m used to. It’s lucid, shimmering. I’m back inside the tunnel—walls breathing, colors alive. At the far end glows a pulse of white light, slow and calling.
I step forward. The hum deepens, warm and familiar.
A voice—mine, maybe—whispers: See how deep it goes.
I reach for the light.
I wake with tears on my cheeks, though I don’t feel sad. The sun is rising, pale and forgiving. On the nightstand, my phone blinks with a single new message.
Unknown: “Tomorrow, 8 p.m. Same dose, new door.”
I stare at it until the letters blur.
Outside, a bird calls once and goes quiet.
The hum fills the silence.
And somewhere deep inside me, a part that used to be afraid finally whispers back,
“Yes.”

1ojbwmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No_Dot4817/comments/1ojbwmw/japan_firsttimer_dilemma_8_days_vs_12_days_is/,Japan First-Timer Dilemma: 8 Days vs 12 Days – Is Less Time Actually Okay?,"My girlfriend and I are planning our first Japan trip with friends in spring. She’s pushing for 14 total days (2 travel days + 12 full days in Japan), and I suggested 10 total days (2 travel days + 8 full days) because I’m worried about taking that much time off work and burning that much PTO at once.



We don’t have a full itinerary yet, but we want to see a few different cities, a mix of “famous places we’ve always seen in photos” and normal daily life stuff. We’re both excited, but I’m nervous I’ll regret not doing the full 12 days.



Here’s what I’ve figured out while trying to answer “is 8 full days enough?” for myself:



Short version:

– 8 full days is absolutely enough for a first trip. You’ll come home happy and not feel like you “wasted” it.

– 12 full days is better if you want slower days, extra side trips, and less packing/unpacking.

– The part you’ll actually regret is trying to do too many cities for the number of days you have.



Think of it this way:



If you do 8 full days (10 total days including flights)

This is what a very normal, first-time, not-misery itinerary can look like:



Day 1–4: Tokyo

– Land, adjust to the time zone, explore neighborhoods (Shibuya, Shinjuku at night, Asakusa for the old downtown vibe, maybe Akihabara if you’re into games/anime).

– Do basic “we’re in Japan” experiences here: conveyor belt sushi, a late-night ramen counter, capsule toy machines, convenience store snacks at 1am, department store food halls, arcade floors, random tiny bars.

– Take one mini side trip from Tokyo if you want: e.g. Yokohama for waterfront/ramen culture, or Kamakura/Enoshima for temples + coast + walking. That’s all doable as a day trip without changing hotels.



Day 5–8: Kyoto/Osaka area

– Take the Shinkansen (bullet train) down to Kyoto, stay in Kyoto or Osaka and treat them as one region (they’re about 15 minutes apart by train).

– Hit some of the “classics” without rushing all day: one big temple/shrine in the morning before crowds, then just walk and eat the rest of the day instead of trying to stamp 10 spots.

– Osaka at night (street food, neon, loud energy) vs Kyoto in the morning (old streets, quieter back alleys) gives you two totally different moods without another long-distance move.

– Fly home from Osaka if you can, so you’re not racing back to Tokyo on the last day. If round-trip from Tokyo is cheaper and you have to go back, build that train ride into Day 8 and spend your final evening near your departure airport.



That’s it. Two “bases”: Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka. One hotel change. One bullet train ride. One optional tiny day trip. No domestic flight, no dragging suitcases every 36 hours.



This version fits in 8 full days and does not feel like “we barely saw anything.” You’ll get modern city life, old streets, night food, shrines, trains, vending machines, arcades, river walks, the whole deal.



Why 8 days works:

– You’re actually awake for most of it. First-timers underestimate jet lag. Your first real functional day doesn’t feel like a normal vacation day because your body is confused. With 8 days, you still get past that and have several great days in the middle.

– You’re not at work. That part matters. You’ll still get an actual reset.

– You and your partner will find out what you actually like in Japan. Maybe you’re going to be “eat and wander side streets” people, not “7 temples in 1 day” people. That’s useful info for the next trip.



When 12 days is worth it:

If you can take the time off, 12 full days really shines in two specific cases:



1. You want to add a third region without stress.

   For example, Tokyo → Kyoto/Osaka → Hiroshima/Miyajima, or Tokyo → Kanazawa → Kyoto, or Tokyo → Takayama/Mountain towns → Kyoto. With \~12 days, adding that third stop doesn’t feel like punishment. With only 8 days, if you try to add a whole extra region, it starts to feel like a logistics simulator instead of a vacation.



2. You like slow mornings and chill afternoons.

   In 12 days, you can have “lazy days” built in — coffee, shopping for ceramics, long lunch, park, early bath, no must-see landmark. In 8 days, most people default to “go go go” because they feel the clock ticking.



Basically:

– 8 days = sample Japan and fall in love with it. You’ll see the hits. You’ll come home saying “we have to go back.”

– 12 days = live in it a little. You’ll get pockets of normal life, like grocery shopping at night and watching people commute, not just sightseeing.



A few things that matter more than 8 vs 12:



How often are you switching hotels?

Every time you switch cities overnight, you lose a chunk of a day to packing, checkout, hauling luggage, transport, check-in, finding food near the new place, figuring out the neighborhood. If you only have 8 days and you try to sleep in 4 different cities, you’re going to feel like you didn’t see anything, even though technically you “went” to a lot of places.



How far apart are your bases?

Tokyo ↔ Kyoto/Osaka is a classic pairing because the bullet train between them is fast and easy. Tokyo ↔ Hokkaido ↔ Hiroshima ↔ Okinawa in 8 days? That’s plane-hopping, not traveling.



Do you both like the same travel pace?

If you’re the kind of person who starts losing joy when you’re overtired, then pushing for 12 days but doing constant motion might actually be worse than doing 8 days with some breathing room. It’s way easier to enjoy a trip you’re mentally present for than a longer trip you’re too fried to remember.



Will you regret not doing the full 12?

Honestly, you’re way more likely to regret blowing all your PTO and then being stressed at work for months after than you are to regret “only” doing 8 full days in Japan your first time.



Here’s a mindset that helped me:

Think of this first trip as Part 1, not “once in a lifetime.” The first visit shows you what you actually care about. The second visit (even if it’s years later) is when you aim for the places you missed — hot springs in the countryside, smaller towns, mountains, islands, whatever. Japan is really, really good for repeat trips because each region has its own vibe.



If I were in your situation right now, here’s what I’d pitch to my partner:

– Let’s do 8 full days this time with two main bases (Tokyo + Kyoto/Osaka).

– Let’s not kill ourselves bouncing around.

– Let’s promise out loud that if we love it, we’ll come back and do the extra areas we skipped.



That way you’re not saying “no” to Japan. You’re saying “yes, and again.”

1ojbvk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Background-Raise6389/comments/1ojbvk1/the_best_microwaves/,The Best Microwaves,"If you mostly use your microwave for reheating leftovers or making popcorn, it’s easy to assume they’re all basically the same. But after owning a few, I’ve realized how much difference the right one can make. The good ones heat evenly, don’t turn edges rubbery, and actually make food taste like it’s supposed to. Once I started cooking more at home and defrosting stuff regularly, I noticed how frustrating cheaper models can be when half the food is scorching hot and the rest is still frozen.

I’ve tested a few microwaves over the years, from basic dorm-room ones to smarter inverter models, and these are the ones that I would recommend.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Panasonic NN-SV79MS](https://productbible.com/blog/best-microwaves#panasonic-nn-sv79ms)

I upgraded to the Panasonic NN-SV79MS last year after getting tired of my old microwave unevenly reheating leftovers. This one immediately felt like a major upgrade. It’s crazy how consistently it heats food, soups, rice, even tricky stuff like chicken breasts come out evenly warmed. The inverter technology is no gimmick either. You can actually cook things at lower power without drying them out, and it seems to make a big difference compared to cheaper microwaves. The stainless steel design also looks great on the counter, which is a nice bonus.

One of my favorite things about it is the sensor cooking. I use it all the time to reheat meals without needing to guess the right time. It’s also got Alexa integration, and I didn’t think I’d use it much, but it’s surprisingly convenient when your hands are full. I can tell it to “defrost a pound of chicken” and it just does it. The build quality feels premium, and it’s big enough to handle casseroles or large plates. Definitely one of the best appliances I’ve bought recently.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [Toshiba EM131A5C](https://productbible.com/blog/best-microwaves#toshiba-em131a5c)

The Toshiba EM131A5C is the one I recommend to friends who just want a solid microwave without spending too much. I used one for a couple of years before upgrading, and it’s honestly still one of my favorites for the price. It’s powerful enough for daily use and heats food evenly, even though it doesn’t have inverter tech. I liked that it was big enough for dinner plates but still fit comfortably on my counter.

The controls are super intuitive, you get sensor reheat, one-touch buttons, and an “Add 30 Seconds” button that I probably used hundreds of times. It’s not silent, but you can mute the beeps, which is great if you live with someone who hates hearing it at 11 pm. If you want something simple, sturdy, and reliable, this one’s hard to beat for the money.

## 🏠 Best Compact Option: [GE GCST07N1](https://productbible.com/blog/best-microwaves#ge-gcst07n1)

The GE GCST07N1 was my go-to when I lived in a small apartment with almost no counter space. It’s only 0.7 cubic feet, but it handled everything I needed, mostly coffee reheats, oatmeal, and leftovers. It’s surprisingly powerful for 700 watts, and I never felt like it took forever to warm things up. It’s perfect for small kitchens or offices where you just need something that works without hogging space.

I also liked that it looks more premium than you’d expect at this size. The stainless version especially feels sturdy and doesn’t have that cheap plastic vibe most compact models do. It’s quiet, easy to clean, and just simple to live with. I’ve since moved and upgraded to a larger unit, but I still keep this one in my office because it’s just that convenient for quick meals or coffee breaks.

## 🍞 Best Multifunction Option: [Panasonic HomeChef Connect 4-in-1 Multi-Oven NN-CV87QS](https://productbible.com/blog/best-microwaves#panasonic-homechef-connect-nn-cv87qs)

If you’re short on space and want one appliance that can do pretty much everything, the Panasonic HomeChef Connect 4-in-1 is amazing. I actually bought one for my parents for Christmas, and they liked it a lot. It can air fry, bake, broil, and microwave all in one, which makes it perfect for quick dinners or reheating leftovers without firing up the oven. The air fry mode works surprisingly well for fries and chicken, and the convection baking is great for small dishes without heating up the whole kitchen.

It’s definitely more advanced than most microwaves, but once you get the hang of it, it’s super versatile. My parents use it all the time for baking cookies, pizza, and roasting veggies, and they love how sleek the stainless design looks on the counter. The app connectivity is a nice extra if you like following guided recipes, and even though it’s on the pricier side, it really feels like a two for one appliance that replaces both a toaster oven and an air fryer.",1,1761761168.0,u_Background-Raise6389,0,1.0,False

So this might be the push we need but it’s gonna fast track the whole process and I might be panicking a little and honestly a bit delusional about the whole thing 😂 ISo here’s my question for yall this time - How do you feel about the area right around the corner from Wantful Things?

I’m worried the about the lack of foot traffic but the affordability & square footage of a space without that is a huge factor for us. Would you drive/walk a slight bit out of the way to come see us? There’s plenty of parking! And room for outdoor markets as well. It’s kinda perfect.

Every year, I watch fashion week shows not just for clothes but for home decor ideas. Yes, I am not kidding! I always end up using those gorgeous fabrics strutting down those runways in my living room and bedroom deco inspiration. And this year's shows have given me so many ideas that I couldn't wait to share with you. The best part? You don't need an extravagant budget to steal these looks. From cozy textures to wise fabric choices, these trends are surprisingly easy to use.

1. **What's the top-most trend from fashion week to implement in home decor?**

I am obsessed with everything I saw on those runways, especially the quilted and woven pieces. Bottega Veneta continues to showcase its signature woven leather pieces, which would translate beautifully into [leather cushions](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/leather-cushions) for any living room. The big trend is mixing different textures, it can be a velvet pillow on smooth leather furniture or pleated curtains in a room with sleek surfaces. The goal should be to choose fabrics that are in contrast but create a harmonious look similar to the designer wears on the ramps. 

1. **How to achieve these luxury looks without spending a fortune?**

The trick is ‘stealth wealth aesthetics’ that designers like Brunello Cucinelli promote by emphasizing the use of high-quality materials in neutral tones. Here's my secret: buy less, but always buy better. Instead of buying five cheap pillows, buy one in leather or cashmere. Also, stick to timeless colours like cream, oatmeal, camel, charcoal, or cognac brown. Buying luxury home decor is always better than buying new furniture. 

1. **What's the most unusual fabric combo that I can use right now?**

The coolest trend I have come across is mixing technical sportswear with luxury materials, think Prada’s approach of combining weatherproof materials with traditional textiles. For your home, you can experiment with waterproof outdoor fabrics on dining chairs paired with silk curtains or **leather cushions** on weather-resistant patio furniture. This high-low mix helps you choose the luxury you can maintain daily. I really love this trend because we need pretty things that can survive kids, pets, and coffee spills!

If you want to know about [cushion fillings that are hypoallergenic and durable for pet owners](https://www.fabricakraft.com/blogs/news/cushion-fillings-that-are-hypoallergenic-durable-for-pet-owners)

1. **What’s one quick update I can make this weekend?**

You can swap your old pillow covers with velvet or corduroy ones, both huge trends on recent runways. These textures will instantly make your sofa look expensive. You can mix sizes and stick to the same colour family to create a harmonious look.

1. **What eco-friendly trends should I try?**

Stella McCartney has been preaching sustainable luxury through innovations like mushroom leather, and this eco-conscious movement is spreading worldwide. You can go for [leather cushions](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/leather-cushions) made from plant-based alternatives or for ocean-plastic cushions. They look and feel precisely the same as traditional ones, but are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

These fashion week fabrics prove you don't need to choose between style and real life. Whether you start with one textured pillow or embrace sustainable items, these designers' ideas can transform your home. My advice would be to start small pick one trend that speaks to you and mix it with your own creativity. Your home will thank you, and so will your wallet.

I just got back from my first proper trip to Japan with my partner and another couple. We did two weeks total. I went in with a ton of excitement and came back with… a much better understanding of what actually matters vs what Instagram says matters.



I’ll share what we did, then the things I think are actually useful now that I’ve survived it.



Rough outline (not every minute detail, just the “where we slept” version):



3 nights in Tokyo (Shinjuku area)

2 nights in Hakone (ryokan / hot spring area near Mt Fuji)

3 nights in Kanazawa (near the coast, slower pace)

3 nights in Kyoto (near Gion)

2 nights in Osaka (Namba / Dotonbori)

1 last night in Tokyo (near Tokyo Station for the airport train)



This is not a “perfect route,” just what we did. What I actually want to talk about is what I’d repeat vs what I’d fix.



Context about me: I’m chatty online and quiet in real life. I overthink everything. I am very good at planning and not always good at relaxing. Keep that in mind while reading.



1. You don’t need to “earn” Japan by studying it like an exam

   Before the trip I treated Japan like homework. I was watching videos about chopstick angles and train etiquette and how to line up for escalators and how not to blow my nose in public and on and on. A certain amount of awareness is good (don’t be gross, don’t block doors, don’t shout in quiet places), but I went way past that into “if I breathe wrong I’ll offend 125 million people.”



Result: I was too nervous the first few days to actually enjoy what was in front of me. By day 4 I realized something: most people are just trying to get to work or buy groceries. No one is grading me. If you’re polite, quiet-ish, observant, and willing to apologize with a little bow if you mess up, you’re fine. You don’t have to be perfect to be welcome.



2. Pick fewer “must-sees,” but actually sit in them

   I used to think “I’ll just see everything quickly.” That’s not how Japan works. The best moments of my trip were when I stopped moving. Sitting in a garden in Kanazawa for 40 minutes and watching gardeners trim pine trees one branch at a time felt more “Japan” than sprinting through five temples in a row. Drinking hot canned coffee from a vending machine next to a quiet river in Kyoto at 7am felt more “Japan” than any crowded alley at noon.



My new rule: pick one “famous sight” in the morning and actually experience it. Don’t book three in a row unless you like emotional whiplash.



3. Carry less, send more

   Japan has a luggage forwarding system (takkyubin) where you can pay to ship your suitcase from hotel to hotel and just take a backpack on the train. Use it. Do not “tough it out.” Do not be romantic about “I can handle my own luggage.” I decided to haul my giant bag onto a busy train during rush hour in Osaka and I have never felt more like a problem on two legs.



Forward the luggage at the front desk and travel like a normal human. Your back (and everyone around you) will thank you.



4. The convenience store is not “sad airport food,” it is your best friend

   The convenience stores (combini) absolutely saved us. Jet lag at 4am? Combini breakfast: onigiri (rice ball), yogurt drink, hot tea. Missed lunch because you were in some garden pretending to be a poet? Combini sandwich. Need cash? ATM’s in some convenience stores take foreign cards. Need to eat cheaply for one night because you blew your budget on wagyu the night before? Combini ramen bowl + salad + random dessert cup = done.



Also, you can buy things like heat packs, bandages, a fresh undershirt, and yes, deodorant, at 2am. You are not above this. Combini will keep you alive.



5. Cash is not dead

   You can use cards in most chain stores, hotels, and bigger restaurants, but tiny bars, mom-and-pop shops, bus fares, shrine donation boxes, and some snack stands are still cash. I got too confident early on because Tokyo was basically tap-and-go everywhere we went. Then we left Tokyo and suddenly it was “cash only” for the next eight hours. Keep some yen on you. Not a huge brick of it, but enough.



6. Learn the trains… but also learn how to stand still

   Yes, Japan’s trains are fast and on time. Yes, the rail system is incredible. You’ve heard this. But here’s the part that doesn’t get said as much: the stations can be overwhelming in a way you don’t process until you’re in them.



Shinjuku Station, Osaka Station, Kyoto Station — they are basically underground cities. There are malls, food halls, department stores, bakeries, convenience stores, escalators going 7 different directions. After dragging my suitcase through one of these while tired and hungry I would sometimes just stand next to a vending machine and stare into the middle distance like a video game NPC.



This is normal. Build in “wait five minutes and breathe” time when you transfer. Don’t schedule yourself so tight that missing one train ruins your mood for an hour.



7. Hakone is where we actually slowed down (you might need that reset)

   Tokyo was electric, Osaka was loud and fun, Kyoto was beautiful but busy. Hakone was the first place where I actually exhaled. We stayed in a ryokan (traditional inn), wore yukata robes in the hallway, soaked in the hot baths, and had dinner brought to us in small courses. It was the first time the whole trip that we weren’t “doing” anything and I finally felt present.



If you have two weeks, put a “do nothing but sit in hot water and look at mountains for 24 hours” break somewhere in the middle. If you only have a week, honestly I’d still try to fit a one-night onsen/ryokan stop between big cities. You need that mental reset more than you think.



8. Kanazawa felt like a cheat code

   We went to Kanazawa kind of on a whim (it’s on the Japan Sea side, known for gardens, samurai district, old tea houses). It felt like Kyoto’s historical look, but with way fewer crowds. We wandered little streets at night and could actually hear our own footsteps. Tea houses were lit up but not mobbed. We could just walk into restaurants without a 45-minute wait. I’m not saying “skip Kyoto,” but I am saying “you’re allowed to like another city more than Kyoto and that doesn’t make you uncultured.”



9. Sitting at the counter beats sitting at a table

   Some of our best meals weren’t in fancy Michelin anything. They were tiny places with six counter seats where you could watch the chef cook in front of you. Ordering was easier because we could point. Conversation was easier because it was just us and the person making the food, not shouting across a loud room. We also ended up trying things we never would have ordered off a menu because the person behind the counter just said “You want this next?” and handed it to us.



If you’re nervous about walking into restaurants you can’t read, a six-seat counter is actually less scary than a big dining room. Try it once. It’ll probably be your favorite meal.



10. People will line up for hours for stuff, and you don’t have to

Here is a liberating truth: you do not have to stand in the 90-minute line for the hyped dessert/ramen/souvenir/whatever. Japan is full of amazing food and you’re not a failure if you eat at the place with only six people in line instead of 60. We skipped multiple “famous must-eat” places simply because we didn’t want to burn a whole afternoon waiting, and guess what, we still ate incredibly well. My favorite bowl of ramen the entire trip was in a place I literally cannot name because we just ducked in to avoid the rain.



Let other people chase the “top 10 best \_\_\_ in Tokyo” list. You’re on vacation, not in a competition.



11. Pack for temperature swings, not “the season”

We went in what was supposed to be “mild spring.” It was “wear a t-shirt” at lunchtime and “why is this wind attacking my bones” at night. In Hakone it was cold enough that being in a hot bath felt urgent, not optional. In Osaka I was sweating in a light jacket. Layering saved me more than anything. Bring one warm layer you actually like wearing in public. Don’t assume “spring in Japan” = “spring where I live.”



12. Use maps to find quiet, not just to find famous

Here’s a trick that worked over and over: open a map, find a river, canal, park, or garden that’s not glowing neon with reviews, and just walk there. We did this in Kyoto when the main sights were jammed. Five minutes off the “photoshoot street,” it was suddenly just normal life: cats sunning themselves, laundry on balconies, someone practicing trumpet in a window, an old guy sweeping in front of his shop.



That ended up being what I remember most about Kyoto — not the packed main alleys, but the quiet side streets where it felt like an actual city where people live.



13. The social energy cost is real

Travel in Japan is not just physical walking. It’s decision fatigue. “Do we go in? Is it rude if we go in and leave? Do we sit here? Do we take our shoes off? Are we supposed to order at the counter? How do we pay? Do they accept card? Am I blocking someone? Am I talking too loud? Am I supposed to sort my trash? Where’s the bin? Oh no, I’m holding trash again.”



If you’re introverted or anxious, you will get mentally tired even on “easy” days. Plan actual rest. A quiet coffee in the afternoon, 30 minutes in a bookstore, sitting by a river at sunset, that counts. You don’t have to “earn” rest with 15 attractions first.



14. Two people travel smoother than four

This might just be group chemistry, but moving as four made every choice take longer. “Where do we eat?” turned into a debate every single time. As two, we could just point at a place and say “this one” and go in. As four, every place had at least one person who wasn’t into it. If you’re traveling as a group, decide in advance that it’s okay to split up for dinner, even if you meet back up later for drinks. You don’t all have to eat the same meal at the same table every single night to be “together.”



15. Japan got better the longer we stayed

The first three days felt like sensory overload. By the second week, I had a rhythm. I knew how to refill my transit card, when to grab cash, how to walk into a bar without apologizing to the door, how to find a bathroom without panicking. Tokyo on day 12 felt way more welcoming than Tokyo on day 1.



So if you’re doing a multi-stop trip, consider looping back through Tokyo at the end. You’ll experience it differently when you’re not wide-eyed and jet-lagged.



16. Last one: you don’t “do Japan” in two weeks

There’s this pressure like you need to see everything because “who knows if I’ll ever be back.” That mindset almost ruined my first few days. Japan is not a checklist and it’s not fragile. You are allowed to leave things unseen. You are allowed to come back.



If I could redo the trip, I’d keep the same rough framework (big city → rest spot → smaller city → historic city → food city → back to Tokyo), but I’d cut the frantic “see it all” energy by half. The memories that stuck weren’t the “top 10 attractions.” It was drinking canned coffee by a canal at sunrise, wearing a dumb hotel yukata and not caring, and having a stranger behind a counter hand me something and say, “Try this next.”



I really did love it. I just wish Past Me had relaxed about it about 4 days sooner.

1ojbqpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1ojbqpy/toxic_roommate_ex_best_friend_is_making_my_life/,Toxic Roommate / Ex Best Friend is Making My Life Hell! Looking to vent tbh.,"Hi! I'm going to call my Roommate ""J"" for this post. 

J and I have known each other since middle school, 7th grade to be exact, and we are now 27. Back in highschool, we had talked about living together in an apartment or something, if we ever moved out of our family homes. 

J and I didn't talk a lot during the last year of highschool, after their mother made assumptions about me that were outrageous and factually, not true.

LSS: As soon as I started working and turned 18, my father got me swept up in a bunch of debt. Come 2022, my family lost their home and moved out of province due to struggle finding/keeping jobs, and I stayed and found a cheap run down basement, since I have a partner and stable job/income.

Back to my current issue:
So, I lived in this place in 2022 alone, as my partner has their own financial situation and family to support, and they would help me where they could as well. 

During covid, J and I had started talking again, we were both working and I said I would be willing to have a roommate, and that I would discuss it after my 1yr lease was up for renewal in 2023. 

Conditions being that J needed to be working and that no other pets were allowed in the unit as I already had 2 cats before she had moved in, and that was what my landlords agreed to. Also, bo paying rent late.

Rent was increased in 2023 from $ 1300 for just me, to $1600 as two of us would now be living there, and to be split 50/50 between us. All utilities including internet and no shared amenities with the upstairs tenants. 

Honestly, pretty cheap and pet deposit was 1 time only, no monthly pet fees. I wasn't going to complain because i had a roof over my head and food. 

Issues started as soon as she moved in. 

1. She was supposed to pay $650 for a damage deposit, that me or the landlord would hold onto. I paid a separate damage deposit when I moved in, which would cover the damage I make. 
She agreed to the terms, and then as soon as the landlord left, she switched up her attitude and said I already paid a damage deposit so she shouldn't have to. 

2. She quit her job 3 months into living with me and went onto a government funded program that barely covered her half. 

3. There's medical reasons for not working that were brought up after J moved in...

4. J's family was emotionally abusive to my knowledge, which is what I was trying to help get her out of as well. 

5. She started complaining about the tenant upstairs, about the internet that was spotty and couldn't play her online video games, about the lighting in the basement, about anything and everything. 

We brought a piece of furniture of hers when moving that she wanted to leave behind originally and I agreed to use it, and the back leg of the hutch was missing nails and broke, so we had it leaning against a wall at first. She brought it up months later saying I broke it and asking where the missing piece was and to clear my items off cause she needed to use it. I had replaced the broken piece with a wooden couch foot I had, as it was the only thing that would work at the time.

6. She's neglectful of the items I own, she was using all my kitchen stuff and I was fine with it until there was soap scum and oil left on everything she let sit in the sink in once warm soapy water for days to weeks on end. I'd come home from a 9hr work day, to no dishes or cutlery left for me to cook or eat dinner. She's chipped half my nice plates and cups by stacking them on top of each other in the sink until there was a mountain. 

7. She put a bunch of stuff into the furnace room which wasnt allowed to be used as a storage space and had been talked about, cause that's a fire hazard, and only moved it all out when the landlord brought it up finally when we needed to fix a pipe that burst. 

8. She blames me for a pipe that burst that leads to our outside hose, because I had never turned it on for the two/three years I had lived there and was getting into gardening and her room got wet from the leak behind the wall down to the drain. My partner went to turn on the water valve and as soon as he felt the leak he shut it off but she claims its our fault. 

Nothing of her personal property was damaged during this. 

9. She got upset about my cat litter cleaning schedule, and then literally put the bag of cat shit on the table where I eat and on my bag of snacks / food. I was checking the box daily, but I didn't do a full dump every week because litter is expensive and she doesn't pay for any of it. 

10. She does not clean anything. She sweeps dust up, leaves it by a pillar. Never deep cleans the bathroom, mop the floors, clean up the fridge shelves. She has never once cleaned the microwave. 

11. Made me get a separate internet plan, which is $75 she's not splitting. I pay it all. 
Same with shared items like toilet paper and paper towel and cleaning sponges. I didn't make her pay for these, as I know she cant, but God I'm so fed up with her emotional manipulation that I want to hit her with a bill. 

12. She attacks with assumptions rather than asking nicely if I have seen something. She misplaced her shower gel after a shower and told me to stop moving her stuff. I hadn't touched anything and had just left for work, it was 7am in the morning. 
This stems from me moving a game that was sitting on the edge of the coffee table one night a year back, as my partner and I were playing games and drinking and I didn't want anything accidentally spilled on it, so I put it on a lower level of the table...

Yet she goes and throws my loufa on a dirty floor beside the toilet if I left it on the side of the shower.

13. She leaves plastic lying around everywhere, knowing my one cat has some fascination with chewing the stuff. Then wonders why her plastic isn't where she left it. 

14. She's picks fights verbally and then acts nice and all friendly again afterward. 

I'm honestly sure there's more that I can't think of right now, but its been almost 3 years of this. I can't do it anymore. 
I work in an office, 40hr work week, then I have extracurriculars like beading classes, the gym etc. I don't even like going home anymore. If I am home, its to scoop litter, love my cats and sleep most days. She's essentially living there alone. 

My landlord doesn't like her, he knows she doesn't work and that she's almost always home and can't be bothered to clean, because he saw how I had my space before she lived there. 

My partner and I are trying, and I'm planning to move in with them and their family early next year to help support and be a more consistent figure in his daughters life as well. 

My landlord is willing to do the dirty work of giving my roommate notice, if I say so. 

Would I be the a**hole for that? 

Like I've really tried to get along and be nice, I didn't harp on her for things and honestly, I was letting her push me around. 

Anyways, I'm mostly ranting but also interested in knowing what other people think of that kind of behavior?

1ojbqcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Reddit_Marketing/comments/1ojbqcv/reddit_affiliate_marketing_avoiding_common/,Reddit Affiliate Marketing: Avoiding Common Beginner Traps,"Hey everyone, I want to share my journey with **affiliate marketing reddit**, specifically some mistakes I made and how I course-corrected. When I first started, I thought I could just spam links and make a quick buck. Big mistake! I quickly learned that Reddit hates that, and you'll get shadowbanned faster than you can say ""low-effort content.""

My first attempts at **affiliate marketing reddit** were, frankly, embarrassing. I was trying to sell, sell, sell without offering any real value. Nobody wants to click on a link from someone they don't trust. That's when I started researching the right way to engage on Reddit. I stumbled upon [Scaloom](https://scaloom.com), and it was a game changer.

What is my advice now? Focus on providing genuine help. Find subreddits related to your niche, and answer questions honestly and thoroughly. Share your expertise, and only mention your affiliate product when it's a natural fit and genuinely helps solve the problem. For example, if someone is asking about the best coffee grinder, and you're an affiliate for a great grinder, you can say something like, ""I've been using the X grinder for years, and it's been fantastic. Here's a link if you're interested: \[affiliate link\]."" But lead with the value, not the link.

I also started using [Scaloom](https://scaloom.com) to find relevant subreddits and schedule posts. The AI-powered features are amazing for identifying the best places to share my content and ensuring I'm not violating any subreddit rules. This saved me a ton of time and helped me stay compliant.

Another trap I fell into was not tracking my results. I had no idea what was working and what wasn't. [Scaloom's](https://scaloom.com) campaign tracking feature helped me understand which posts were driving traffic and conversions, allowing me to optimize my strategy. **Affiliate marketing reddit** is all about testing and refining.

So, to sum it up: avoid spamming, provide value first, use a tool like [Scaloom](https://scaloom.com) to find the right communities and schedule posts, and track your results. **Affiliate marketing reddit** can be a great way to earn passive income, but it takes effort and a strategic approach.

1ojbq8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sicily/comments/1ojbq8e/sardiniasicily_itinerary/,Sardinia/Sicily Itinerary,"I have read a number of Sardinia vs Sicily posts here and elsewhere but didn't get the exact answers I was looking for.   We went to Sicily in March of last year, staying in Ortigia and doing day trips for there for 4 days.   We absolutely loved the combination of great food, wine and history.   We drove the circuit of Noto, Ragusa and Modica and wished we could have stayed in every one of them along with half a dozen other little towns we passed through.

This June we're going back and have 10 nights to burn.   We were originally planning on doing 3 nights in Corsica, 4 nights in Sardinia and 3 nights in the northern part of Sicily.    Logistically Corsica would have forced us to burn an extra day of travel so we're down to just Sardinia and Sicily.   From what I'm reading Sardinia is more about the beaches and I'm finding it to be quite a bit more expensive than Sicily with what looks to be much less choice in the ""nice but not full luxury"" category that we tend to book.   We do not like staying at large resorts and will do all of our eating off property, but we do like a comfortable bed.      We are also not big hikers.   We'd rather wander around a city center, stopping for a coffee/wine and poking our head into an old church.

Am I missing something about Sardinia or am I right about Sicily having more of what we are interested in doing?

We fly into Algehro so we'll definitely stay there the first night.   I was thinking of spending two nights there and then spending a night in Cagliari as we're flying out of there on the final night.

As far as Sicily, we fly into Catania and land late afternoon.   We had so much fun driving around that we're thinking of doing that again and spending a night or two at each stop.     Yes, I know it's alot of driving but we really enjoyed just driving around last time. 

1. Taormino to Ragusa to Agrigento to Sciacca to Erice/Masala to Palermo

I'd be thankful for any suggestions I might be missing on Sicily as well as feedback on whether I am incorrect in assuming we'd like Sicily more than Sardinia.",1,1761760856.0,sicily,0,1.0,False

1ojbov7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ojbov7/aio_about_the_interactions_between_the_guy_im/,AIO about the interactions between the guy I'm seeing and his female friend?,"Everyone involved here is in their late 30s, which I think makes this dumber.

I left a fifteen-year relationship a couple years ago, where I had been partnered with an extremely introverted man who did not use social media at all and who almost never socialized without me. 

I started dating ""Jason"" about eight months ago via Tinder, who is extroverted and very active on social media. We're in an odd place relationship-wise because we both are really busy in our careers and have different plans for our lives so we aren't ""officially"" a couple, but we agreed to be exclusive with each other in July while we try to figure things out, and we see each other a couple days a week. Jason has tons of friends, many of whom are women, which I usually see as a green flag in men. But then there's ""Tessa.""

I've never met Tessa, but I have met some of Jason's other female friends, and I've seen them posted on his social media when they go out and I get nothing but good vibes. But Tessa really bothers me.

She sends him several multi-minute voicenotes every day talking about how her day is going (which he has played in my presence while saying he's ""not listening to all that""). She is constantly texting/calling him. When I first became aware of her, it was because of this behavior and my initial anxiety was that she was actually his girlfriend, and he swore up and down that she's ""needy"" and ""neurodivergent"" and that translates into her being clingy.

Every time they hang out, Tessa will post multiple selfies with him with captions like ""I don't know what I'd do w/o this guy!"" or ""he's my shadow, wherever I am, so is he!"" or ""look at my emotional support bestie!"" and then he'll repost these selfies anytime he's tagged in them. I also might be reading too much into it, but Jason is Black, Tessa is white, and I'm mixed (but I'm European and not American like everyone else), and I feel uncomfortable, like she's describing him almost like a pet. 

Things came to a head for me over the weekend when Jason told me he and Tessa were going to a restaurant Jason had mentioned wanting to take me to the week before. I made a comment about him taking her on my date and he said something about how it will be vetted so we can go. The next morning he had reposted her usual selfies and commentary, but also a post of the two of them of walking to get coffee together.

I texted him telling him that to me it looked like he had Tessa overnight and that I'd rather not put myself in a position where my feelings are being hurt by whatever their relationship is. He is adamant that she went home the night before, and that she goes to a gym near him and went to get coffee with him after her workout. He swore up and down that they aren't dating and have never been a couple.

Again, my previous partner was so intoverted that I've maybe lost touch of what is ""typical"" these days, but I dont know any other people my age who show this kind of effusiveness over someone who isn't their romantic partner (or even among new romantic partners). I feel really uncomfortale with Tessa's interactions to the point that I feel like walking away from Jason because I've never been a jealous person in relationships and I hate having these feelings.

1ojbmf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ojbmf2/echo_part_5_final/,Echo Part 5 (Final),"The thought of going back was terrifying, but the alternative was homelessness, and I knew I couldn't survive on the streets. My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.
I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

1ojblwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/erectiledysfunction/comments/1ojblwx/struggling_with_chronic_burning_and_bladder/,"Struggling with chronic burning and bladder issues after sex — no infection found, need advice","Hi everyone, i’m 27 I really need some help.
About a year ago, after having sex, I started feeling a strong burning sensation at the end of urination that same night. I had urinary frequency, and the burning got worse every time I went to the bathroom.
I took antibiotics, and the burning went away for a while, but my bladder and urination never went back to normal. It always feels like I can’t fully empty my bladder. Sometimes I go to the bathroom too often, sometimes not enough. Every month, I have another painful episode with strong burning and urgency that makes life really hard.

My urine cultures are always negative, and ultrasounds of my kidneys, bladder, uterus, and vagina all came back normal. Tests for other infections were also negative. The symptoms are exactly like a UTI, but there’s no infection.

I’ve noticed that drinking a lot of water helps reduce the burning, but sex makes everything worse. It feels like I might have developed premature orgasm, and after orgasm, I can’t empty my bladder completely.
The only thing that helps a bit are certain yoga poses for pelvic floor relaxation, but I still can’t have sex, drink coffee or alcohol, or even exercise too much without symptoms flaring up.

Please, is there anyone who has gone through something similar or knows what this could be? I’m desperate for advice.",1,1761760602.0,erectiledysfunction,2,1.0,False

My savings were running on fumes. The fear was a living, breathing thing, but the need for money was a far more practical, immediate threat.

I was the first one in the office, as usual. The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. I was a human cog in a corporate machine, and I was content with that. I worked on my spreadsheets, the numbers a familiar puzzle. It felt good to be back. It felt normal. I fired away, my fingers flying across the keyboard, the numbers adding up perfectly. The mundane, predictable rhythm of the job was a welcome relief from the chaos of my life. I had been through a lot, but I was still here. I was still alive. And I was going to be okay.

The thought of Franco and Brenda danced in my mind, a brief flicker of sorrow and fear, but I pushed them away. I had to focus. I was back, I was safe, and I was going to survive this. The minutes ticked by, and I lost myself in the spreadsheets, the comforting rhythm of my fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't until the clock on my computer screen hit 11:00 a.m. that I looked up. The office was still silent. No one had shown up yet. A cold dread began to creep back into my heart.

I looked out the window and saw the edges of the glass began to blur, swirling into a distorted vortex of the wall and the outside world. I stumbled back from my desk, my heart pounding, but the room was already starting to melt. The walls swirled, the desks blended into a single, formless mass, and the fluorescent lights stretched and warped like taffy. I heard a door open somewhere down the hall, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

I ran, my legs clumsy and numb as the floor dissolved beneath me. I bolted for the men's bathroom, the nearest sanctuary, as the world behind me began to turn to black, a ravenous void eating up the office. I slammed the door shut and fumbled with the lock on a stall, my body trembling with a fear so profound it was almost a physical weight. The world outside the bathroom disappeared with a soft, final sigh, the sudden silence more terrifying than the chaos.

I sat on the toilet, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the world outside a dead, silent space. The bathroom itself felt solid, a small island in an ocean of nothingness. Then, I heard the bathroom door open with a gentle click. A slow, steady set of footsteps echoed in the silent room.
I clamped my hands over my mouth, trying not to make a sound, but my heart was a frantic drum, a rhythm so loud I was sure the entity could hear it. The footsteps stopped in front of my stall. The silence was absolute. My body was a ball of pure, unadulterated terror.

Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the entire room exploded. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the sink, everything, vaporized into a storm of glittering dust. I wasn't just in the room anymore; I was floating in a vast, empty space. The bathroom and the office and everything else now just a memory. In front of me now, a breathtaking sight. A man's form, but it wasn't a man. It was the universe personified. His body wasn't made of flesh and bone, but of reality itself, a swirling kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies, nebulae and cosmic dust. It was the embodiment of anything and everything, a truly terrifying and beautiful sight. I was utterly baffled, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer beauty of the being before me. My mouth, without my permission, opened, and one question, one thought, escaped. ""What do you want?"" I whispered, my voice a pathetic, tiny sound in the vast silence.

The being tilted its head, a galaxy spiraling in the place where its ear would be. It then reached out a hand, and I was lifted by my throat. Its fingers, made of pure light, didn't burn, didn't hurt; they simply held me, my feet dangling in the void. ""ATONEMENT,"" it replied, its voice a chorus of billions of voices, the whisper of stars and the roar of supernovas, the murmur of every human who had ever lived and died.

I was no longer in control of my own mind. Images flooded my consciousness, a terrifying, rapid fire montage of my life. My faulty spreadsheets, the doctored reports, the late night arguments with Alex. I felt the cold, hard satisfaction that had filled me when I learned that the company that we built together had blown up in his face. I was forced to relive the indifference I felt when I heard he had killed his family before killing himself. I saw the text messages he had sent me, a desperate final plea for help, a final, despairing admission that he was blaming himself. ""I don't know what I did. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."" The Universe's disembodied voice narrated every single one, its tone a perfect blend of righteous fury and a profound, bone deep sorrow. I watched in agony as the universe exposed the truth of my carefully constructed lie.

Let’s call him Kevin Me and Kevin have known each other since 15, we weren’t friends however we were chill I guess.

Just those people you can have a laugh with at school and go home.

Around 16 we started getting along really well in our classes and we spoke much more often. He even asked me if I would say yes to him if he hypothetically gave me a promposal. He didn’t end up giving me one because another dude asked me out in which I rejected. I didn’t want to go prom AT all . Throughout the summer he would send me romance videos and ask me to watch them and let him know what I thought about them.

We ended up going to different schools for our last years of high school and went a year without contact. Yesterday I posted an Instagram picture and he slid into my DMs telling me how good I looked blah blah blah. 

Really respectful though like it wasn’t a typical way a boy would compliment a girl. Then he made a couple jokes and said on another note we should see eachother it’s been a long while. And said goodnight. Normal right?

I honestly didn’t want to “catch up” but my people pleasing ass agreed and said yes.

Next morning I see him in a coffee shop  and smile so i don’t make shit awkward and he walks past and sits so far away Avoiding eye contact completely.

Like cmon not even a hey. Friends don’t do that if I saw my friend after a year I would jump in their arms .

I can appreciate having a bad day perhaps but it’s common decency to say hi at least. I even think I waved

1ojbea5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ojbea5/my_husbands_white_lies/,My husbands White lies,"Okay I’d like to start this off by saying for the years my husband and I have been together he’s always been honorable, respectful and kind and loving and attentive. I genuinely do not think he is a bad man, or a liar, or that this is the beginning of something awful. BUTTT
I am concerned with this and would love some input from others (especially men) on what could be causing this and how we can go about fixing things. 

I got pregnant unplanned shortly after we decided we’d never have children, but before we could get sterilized lol. 
We decided to keep the pregnancy and we both feel good about this decision. 
We worked together as chefs, i was part time and full time in college, he was full time, we lived in a shitty apartment and spent way to much time watching tv and spent way to much money on weed lmao. 

All of that changed immediately after deciding to become parents, my husband has always been great to me but watching him shift into grown man/dad energy has been so beautiful. We made a list of all the things we want to be, all the habits we need to break ect 

2 of those things for him were excessive phone usage and smoking. Again..I was just like him but when I got pregnant obviously I had to stop smoking immediately and I just hate social media and news and it gets my anxiety going, knowing all the horrific things happening in the world all the time was the reason I never wanted a kid, so if I’m having a kid I can’t keep being surrounded by terror. So I’m rarely on my phone, all social media is deleted ect

I’m now in my third trimester that 30 week mark is coming oh so quick, I told him I don’t care if he keeps social media but keep it limited and absolutely no phone usage around the baby, not a huge deal when she’s a newborn but I don’t want her to be an iPad kid, so we must model that behavior. The biggest thing is smoking, it’s a huge expense and a huge health concern, a vape (which he goes through in a week) is 20$ and joints are like 7$ a piece and he’s cut down to just smoking on the weekends. That’s around 200$ a month, our income is limited right now because my health was really bad and now I’m too pregnant for anyone to hire me. I told him I’m fine if he smokes weed occasionally but he should switch to wax when baby comes so there’s no smoke, and I want him to be done vaping by her birth. Again, not because I’m a control freak but money and health, I used to vape and smoke just as much as him and I didn’t give a damn about the health implications, UNTIL WE DECIDED TO HAVE A BABY. that changes everything. 

Now here comes the white lies. At first he was very understanding and seemed to be completely on the same page as me, it wasn’t even like I told him to quit it was just something we agreed was important. 
There was a couple times he went without a vape, a couple times he went without any THC, ultimately within a week he always goes back to vaping and about 3 weeks till he goes back to thc. Again..all I care about is progress, I’m not harping on him daily, I don’t bitch when he buys a new vape or thc, as long as I can tell he’s trying and until recently he very obviously was. And now he’s lying to me. 
He’s said like 3 times “this is my last vape” he said “I’m only gonna smoke (thc) once a month” he’ll make up an excuse to leave the house or “get gas” and put 20 in the car and buy a new vape so it looks like he just filled the tank, he told me the other day (on his day off) his boss asked him to go to the hardware store and see if they had the tool boxes they need and if they could hold them until she could pick them up, I asked to ride along cause I was bored and he said “it’ll only take 10 minutes” he walked in and out of that hardware store so quick, he then pulled right into the vape shop. It clicked then and there that story was fabricated and he’s just fucking lying to me. This was after the “last vape I swear” conversation so I said “I thought you said you were done” and he said “it’s hard” and I can’t help but laugh and get angry because I had to quick cold turkey, while pregnant. And “it’s hard” but you haven’t gone more than 12 hours without nicotine, like his vape was low and that’s why he made up that lie. 
He bought cigs to try and limit what he was smoking, but everytime he gets a craving for nicotine he goes and smokes a cig, BROTHER HOW IS THAT QUITTING??? I keep telling him, it’s about the small choices, instead of waking up and hitting your vape, set a routine where you wake up, poop, shower, get dressed and make coffee and THEN you can have your first hit. Instead of smoking a cig everytime you feel like it, limit yourself to 3 a day and go as long as you can between them. Just anything. Again, when we have these conversations I’m not yelling, I’m not insulting, I’m usually not even mad or frustrated with him, I just genuinely want better for us. I want our daughter to have a healthy dad, so many of my family members died of cancer, 2 biggest smokers in my family got lung cancer and smoked till they died. I don’t want that for my daughter, I don’t want that for my husband. 

It genuinely comes from love, it doesn’t piss me off that he’s struggling to quit, it pisses me off that he’s a liar now. 
That he feels he can’t come to me with his struggles and his failures.

Today he woke up, got ready for work and then said “my boss is gonna tell me if I have work within the next 5 minutes, the whole team called out so i probably don’t have work” he works for a small business so it’s his other 3 coworkers who are family. I didn’t think anything of it. 

My phone died while I was on the phone with my dad so I got on his to text him and say I’d call him back, I noticed his boss Racheal was muted and the last text said something about crying, I was confused so I clicked it. TELL ME WHY THIS MAN SAID OUR DOG DIED TO GET OUT OF WORK. like Huh???
this is soooooo unlike him. The lying, the calling out just everything. 

I’m truly at a loss for what could be causing this. Everytime I bring stuff up lately he’s so irrationally angry about it so quickly. He’s always had a problem with conflict, he immediately takes everything to heart, as if he’s failing and I hate him and I want to leave even small corrections or whatever. So I get that he’s fragile in that way, I am too honestly. I just don’t know how to reach him, how to repair this. 

He’s always been my best friend, we’ve always told each other everything. We used to play hookie occasionally when we worked together, if he really just needed today that’s fine, but he lied to ME about it.

I would have anywhere from 8oz-20oz a day. It would make me feel like there was enough blood flow to my eyes and lower my heart rate to like 120 (from 160) for the majority of the day. It also helped me have a bowel movement daily which in turn made my POTS better. 

I had a bad reaction to a SIBO antibiotic and stopped coffee for a bit. I had no trouble reintroducing caffeine after. One day I had a weird acidic flare in the middle of the night and went to the hospital where they said possibly gastritis so I stopped coffee yet again. I reintroduced coffee again with no issue so my doctors are assuming it was a one off thing rather than gastritis. 

I stopped coffee yet again bc I was having extreme constipation (20 straight days) and the constrictions were making me feel worse. Since then I tried coffee a couple times. The first few times it made me so dizzy but I bounced back within an hour. Another time it caused so much acid and I was gagging. Today I tried THREE sips and immediately had to run to the bathroom but also felt so woozy. It’s been a few hours now.

I’ve been at my desk since maybe around 730AM. Taking occasional bathroom breaks to be alone. People in the office are wandering around as usual, chatting going on coffee breaks and sharing memes.

I am sitting, quietly in complete misery and agony. I managed to eat some toast with cottage cheese. A friend of mine called me early this morning to check up on me.

Some friends, are trying to take the tough approach, “get over this, she’s toxic and not worth it.” However, when they see me break down in complete chaos. They realize that strategy won’t work.

I took the liberty of doing laps around the building. I hate that we are still on each other’s Apple Fitness app. She seems to be doing fine, her usual walks for steps and will likely be hitting the gym in the evening. I hate that I check, but I really do it to see if she has deleted me yet. As in the past she has been quick to delete me.

I hate having to muse over the most intricate of details for everything. Why this, why that. What did her words mean. What is she thinking right now, what does her Instagram mean etc.. ,etc, as of course I don’t know. And there’s no way for me to know. And in trying to know I will just drive myself mad.

I am dreading the hours ahead, as much as the hours that passed. One of my friends said, you need to seek professional help. I told her I had, I have been seeing a therapist and it’s been totally useless.

While it brings solace in speaking to my friends, who even the ones that defended her are no longer defending her. To realize with greater clarity that this was a good person, and not a good person for me. It still makes no difference.

I am dreading the weekend, I am fearful she will already be out on the town this weekend. She knows plenty of people. But I mean hey, if that’s how she is, then of course I shouldn’t want her back.

I don’t know how someone can just walk away from two years with just a 10 second call. Or perhaps, she’s thinking the same of me as I am not the one reaching out to her. However, as I have  mentioned in so many other posts, and sorry to sound repetitive. The onus is really on her to reach out to me. As she was the one that wanted the “break” per say, she was the one that said, “these issues are not fixable.”

I can only commend myself up to this date, for at least standing up for my principals. That I didn’t like something and I voiced it. That I could have easily said, “oh I am sorry, that I told you were you being rude to me and brought up rude and inappropriate behaviour.” To essentially fix what the problem is. But as the days goes on the idea of fixing it gets more and more harder.

When this happened last year in November for two weeks it seemed the same. This time it just feels even worse. As we have been down this road.

The Autumn sun is pouring into my office, but I have closed the blinds. As I prefer it to be dark.

As I’m a huge K-Pop fan, my main reason for traveling is two concerts at the KBS Arena. I’d also love to check out buildings of popular companies like SM, HYBE, RBW, JYP, or YG, do some album shopping, visit fancafés, pop-ups, maybe catch more concerts, and explore Gangnam in general. I’m sure there are plenty of other K-Pop-related spots I don’t even know about yet.

At the same time, I’d like to do some general sightseeing, drink coffee, and also eat vegetarian-friendly dishes.

However, the tricky part (besides making a decision) is, I’m on a budget, so I can’t afford fancy hotels 1k+ a week, but I’d still like some privacy and a private bathroom, so I’m a bit wary of most hostels and capsule hotels.

I’m also unsure whether it’s better to stay all in one area, like Mapo-gu/Hongdae, Myeongdong, or Gangnam, or even split my stay between two neighborhoods to be closer to both K-Pop spots and sightseeing areas. 

If you’ve done something similar, any advice on neighborhoods for good connections to K-Pop spots and maximum K-Pop immersion while still seeing some Seoul sights would be amazing. Also, budget-friendly hotels/guesthouses that are comfortable for a solo traveler would be a huge help.🙏🏻",1,1761759898.0,koreatravel,2,0.67,False
1ojba76,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ojba76/i_33m_am_in_love_with_my_friend_34f_who_is/,I (33M) am in love with my friend (34F) who is currently crashing on my couch,"Hey Reddit. First time here and first time posting. I need some advice about my friend Rebecca (fake name) who is crashing at my place. 

I (33M) met Rebecca (34F) two years ago at work. We both work with vulnerable children, not going to specify for privacy, but think Child Protective Services but for more intense situations. 

We actually didn’t like each other first. We were both assigned to the same child, we’ll call him Cody, as we both specialize in different areas that overlapped in him. We both had strong opinions and butted head often. Eventually we found common ground, we both wanted to do our best and instead of fighting each other on to how-tos and differing methods, we realized it good how much we both care about Cody. Honestly it was nice to talk to someone who is as intense about work as I am. After that we became friends sometimes a few people from work go out to dinner or drinks and we would talk more there, even gone to see some movies together.

Now we’ll get into how she came to be crashing with me. As I said we work with vulnerable kids and a lot of the time that means also dealing with their hostile parents. I won’t go into details since it’s not my story to tell, but last month a disgruntled parent of a child Rebecca is the case worker for followed her home after work one day, broke in, and attacked her. Thankfully she was able to fight him off relatively quickly but not before he got 4-5 punches to the gut in and one punch to her head. I’m grateful of her quick thinking of getting out of there and calling the cops immediately before anything worse could happen.

After Rebecca was checked out of the hospital she spent one night at her place but couldn’t sleep in fear of the parent coming back so she drove away and slept in her car. She didn’t want to go home which I think is very understandable, as she doesn’t feel safe being there alone. At the time the police hadn’t found the parent who attacked her yet since he fled the scene (he eventually caught ten days after the attack and is in custody now). I should mention that Rebecca has a sister, but she hasn’t always had an easy relationship with her. But even with that Rebecca probably could have stayed there in any other normal circumstances but her sister gave birth to her first child about 6 weeks ago. Rebecca doesn’t want to impose on her sister and her sister’s husband in the first few months of their child’s life, they need space. And also Rebecca needs rest to heal from her injuries and with a crying baby in the house maybe that wasn’t the easiest solution either. 

I didn’t know about the attack until two days after the fact and when I did called her immediately asking if there was anything I could do to help her. She broke down crying and asked if she could stay with me for a little while. Of course I said yes right away, saying she could stay for as long as she wanted to/for as long as she feels safe. We went to her place together and packed a few of her things. She said thank you and hugged me for a long time. I’m honoured that she would ask me and feel comfortable enough to ‘impose’ on me. 

But here’s the thing: I love her. I am in love with her. She is one of, if not the best person I have the pleasure of knowing. It’s hard to say when it started. One day after a few months of knowing her I just woke up and knew. I felt out of my mind. She was all I could think about. I would make any excuse to see her even just to say hi. My chest felt and continues to feel hot all the time.

I have so much respect for everything she does how hard she works, and how good she is at this difficult, thankless job. And, she’s gorgeous. Seriously she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, in real life or on tv. This woman could be a model, she’s that beautiful, and yet she’s out here underpayed and overworked doing the most she can for at-risk youth. It’s a true vocation for her and I have endless respect and admiration for her because of it and the guidance and advocating she does for these kids. 

Anyway, Rebecca’s been at my place for three weeks now. I don’t have a huge apartment, it’s essentially a big studio room with the living room and bed room in the same room and so I thought it would be an adjustment living with another person again (I’ve lived alone for years) but it’s actually been really nice. I can handle changing in the bathroom which is kinda the only ‘inconvenience’ I’ve experienced since she moved in which is not a big deal to me at all, worth it to have her here.

We get ready for the day together, we talk about our cases together give each other advice and support. Most nights we make dinner together and eat together. We watch Storage Wars together. I thought it would be hard sharing my space with someone but quite honestly she makes it feel more like home just by her presence than it has in the four years I’ve lived there. With her on the couch and me in my bed (I tried to give her the bed and for me to sleep on the couch but she was having none of it) sometimes we just talk into the night until one of us falls asleep. 

I like being her safe place. She’s confided in me about the attack (I’m still impressed she fought the guy off, thank god for our mandatory self-defence training). She even told me more about her past. She hasn’t had an easy life either, especially in her late teens/early 20s, she’s been through so much. The resilience this woman has is mind boggling. I like to think I’m helping her heal by listening to her, letting her process trauma, and by being a shoulder to cry on, sometimes literally. We’ve talked about Cody, the kid we both care about so much and its been really comforting for the both of us.

This past week she’s even started smiling again. I made a stupid joke about spaghetti while boiling pasta and she laughed. It was really good to hear her laugh again. I hope she continues to heal. 

It’s been awesome having her here. I like seeing her everyday. I like hearing her voice everyday, I like hearing her call to me from the kitchen asking if I want a coffee since she’s making one for herself too. Sometimes in these little moments it’s easy for me to imagine that we are together and that she’ll stay here with me. I hope I don’t come across as creepy saying that. I am well aware that the two of us are colleagues, friends, essentially roommates at the moment. I know we aren’t dating, nothing even close, and I’m ok with it. I’d be ecstatic if she were to tell me she felt the same way but why would she? We’re friends. Honestly I feel lucky to even be her friend. She’s just a great person. And sometimes it feels like wanting more from her is greedy. I denied my feeling for a long time but the last few days as we watch tv together she cuddles up to me, I hold her and I just feel peace. 

I had to talk to this out with someone so I told my best friend, let’s call her Lucy (36F), all of this over coffee two days ago. Once I finished telling her she just looked at me with a big smile on her face and tears in her eyes. She said she’s never seen me like this before, feeling so much for someone and being proud of it. How amazing it is to see me in love with someone. For context I struggled with depression and PTSD for a few years after my sister (Lucy’s wife, now widow) died in a random act of violence 6 years ago. I haven’t really been the same since. 

Lucy wants me to go for it. That might be putting it mildly. She told me that I absolutely had to tell Rebecca, that she deserves to know how I feel. She punched me in the arm (not hard) and said ‘you have to for god’s sake’ and ‘let yourself be happy for once’ which might be in reference to the fact that since meeting Rebecca I’ve only gone on a handful of dates with other women but nothing could be helped, they were perfectly fine but they weren’t Rebecca. Lucy says this is my chance at happiness and I should use this time to tell Rebecca how I feel.   

Here’s where I need your help Reddit. I disagree with Lucy. I don’t think I should tell Rebecca anything. Here’s my main three reasons as to why: 

1)Rebecca is currently dependent on me for her living situation. Imagine you’re feeling the most vulnerable you have felt in a long time, so much so you don’t want to live in your home alone and the guy who’s place you are crashing, the guy you thought was your friend comes onto you. Wouldn’t that make her spiral? She might think the only reason I let her live with me was for easy access to her. Or even worse, maybe she’ll feel like she can’t say no or else I’ll not let her live here anymore (I would never do that obviously), so she might say yes as the alternative is homelessness, or going back to sleeping in her car. I don’t want her to feel coerced into being with me, she might feel exploited by me like she has been by others in the past. Yes this is extreme but this is just what’s going on in my head.

2)We’ve been friends for almost two years. I don’t want her to feel awkward around me, slowly start distancing herself, and then friendship over. This is the last thing I want, she’s too important to me. I am happy being her friend. I also don’t want this effect our work. While we don’t often have crossover in our roles the possibility of it is there. 

And lastly 3) She’s physically injured from the attack. She’s mostly healed as her injuries weren’t too serious (her words) but still! A man put his hands on her in violence and she still has bruises on her body from it. I have some experience in coaching pre-teen and teenage girls through violence of every kind, and the physical is awful but it’s also the psychological helplessness that is incredibly traumatic too. Putting myself in Rebecca’s shoes, I wouldn’t want to be physical with anyone for a long time, much less in the headspace for getting into a relationship where there might be every chance of expectations of intimacy. Not that I would expect that from her I’m just saying she might have this line of thinking. She probably feels unsafe in her own body let alone letting another person be with her.  

Lucy says that while all these reasons are valid, I am using them as excuses not to say anything because I’m afraid Rebecca won’t share my feelings. To be honest, I don’t think Lucy is entirely wrong here. I’m not a overly-confident guy and have dealt with esteem and self-worth issues growing up in the childcare system myself (part of the reason I work in this field because I know firsthand how broken the system is and want to try to do the best for kids like me). A part of me thinks that a woman as amazing as Rebecca wouldn’t go for a guy like me. I don’t have much to offer, as working in the social services sector we are severely underfunded, but at least we get subsidies for therapy so I have been working on these issues with my therapist for a bit now, which is nice. 

Regardless of what Lucy thinks I don’t think I should tell Rebecca. But what she said has struck a chord with me and I am conflicted. But shouldn’t I think to put Rebecca first? Her needs are more important than my feelings I think. 

So Reddit (if you’re still here after my long-windedness) what should do you think? Any and all respectful advice is truly appreciated as I need objective opinions. Do I tell Rebecca or not?",1,1761759893.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1ojb9h2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojb9h2,My new preferred way of freezing coffee,"I  wanted to share a new way (for me) of freezing beans for single dosing. 

Up until now I would use 50ml containers, organize them using 3d printed stands, fill them with 20grams or coffee beans +-1 g and off to the freezer. When i wanted to use them I immediately use one from the freezer to the grinder. 

This worked well for my for my 20g and 58mm portafilter. 
 
Recently I started using 49mm portafilter. I prefer for less caffeine and more shots. 14.5g has enough depth for most shots and I can up dose easily with 15g  or 16g. 

The problem now is that when I freeze my beans at 15g there is a lot of air in the container.  I want my beans to last for months if not years - esp some expensive quality coffee.

The air in the container would oxidize the beans-that is true with 20g as well but the increased empty space made me think. 

I searched online but really there was nothing to remove the air from containers. One way valves dont have pumps for air. The only true solution is vacuum bags.

I avoided vacuum bags until now for the waste and would not think to freeze each shot in a separate bag and then throw it away - but vacuum sealed bags was the only solution I could find that would truly work. 

Then it hit me -  I could use vacuum sealed  bags - create departments for 15g doses and reuse them with minimum waste each time!

So this is what I was doing today. 

Step 1: Made 4 departments from a single bag. each department is internationally tall. Check photos on the fold technique to make the departments. 
Step 2: Cut and fill with beans. 
Step 3: Vacuum and seal. 
Step 4: Freeze beans for years. 

When you want to use them 
Step 1: remove from freezer
Step 2(Important): cut with a knife just below the seal. 
Step3: use the beans 
Step 4: Reuse the container!!!

That’s the key. Depending on how tall you make the bags, you can reuse each one multiple times with minimal waste. 

There is still waste but it’s in orders of magnitude lower than use the bag and toss it. 

That said I will only use that for my very expensive - rare coffees that I enjoy. The rest will still end up on the tubes at 15 or 20 grams.

Not sure if it counts as indie, but I know it's a smaller house so I thought I'd post here. I went for this discovery set because I was very intrigued by the concept of a set inspired by nightclubs in different cities around the world, and thought that nightclub-inspired scents would likely fit vibe-wise with the kind of scents I like (I’m generally not into “fresh” scents. I’m attracted to androgynous, sultry night time scents with a bit of grit). The other reason I wanted to try a discovery set is because the perfumes I often pick out for myself when I’m shopping online end up smelling quite same-y and, honestly, like a crystal shop (I often go for notes like incense, patchouli, resin, frankincense, smoke, etc.) I was overall happy with the Discovery Set and found 4 perfumes I like a lot and 2 perfumes I really didn’t like (which is honestly useful because now I know what notes to avoid!). The packaging was very nice, the sample sizes are larger than most indie houses, and I love the storytelling for each perfume (they make a playlist for each scent, have pics of the nightclub its inspired by, etc.) Here’s my review: 

Lola at Coat Check 
1992, New York

Official Notes: 
TOP — Pink Pepper, Cardamom, Grapefruit 
HEART — White Chocolate, Jasmine, Lily, Orris, Caramel
BASE — Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Amber, Vetiver

Warm, androgynous, sexy, creamy, comforting, expensive, hard to pin down or describe. I can def smell amber and can identify the woodiness/cedar, but it doesn't lean at all Axe body spray/cheap cologne (which is my biggest fear with woody scents). The caramel and white chocolate add a touch of femininity and deliciousness without feeling foodie. As it fades, the pepper stands out more. I saw someone else say this is the smell of the cool girl who comforts you when you're crying in the club bathroom, and funnily enough I thought the exact same thing. It's not a particularly unique scent, but it's complex and really amazing at what it's doing. Even though I am generally weary of citrus and floral notes, I really love this and don't find those notes overwhelming. I’d never pick this out for myself, but I’m going to wear it a lot. Amazing start to the set!

Call for a Good Time
2000, Tokyo

Official Notes: 
TOP — Violet, Ylang-Ylang, Angelica, Yuzu
HEART — Night Blooming Jasmine, Egyptian Jasmine 
BASE — Amber, Shimmering Musk, Pink Pepper

This smells like Victoria's Secret..... not in the sense that it smells ""cheap,"" but in the sense that this is what I think a teenage girl would want to smell like in order to feel sexy/mature. It brings me back to the high school locker room. My girlfriend, on the other hand, told me I smelled amazing and described this scent as very fresh, so it will be going to them! A few hours later it chilled out into a less dramatic jasmine scent which is somewhat pleasant but still not for me. To be fair to the scent, I generally stay away from most florals and any ultra feminine perfumes like this. 

All Night Until First Light
1989, Ibiza

Official Notes:
TOP — Grapefruit, Rum, Black Pepper
HEART — Saffron, Magnolia
BASE — Cashmere, Vetiver, Amber

This is grapefruit mixed with new car. This is my first time encountering such a masculine grapefruit scent. Even though I usually avoid citrus and “fresh” scents (this is quite fresh), I actually like this a lot. Unfortunately my girlfriend says it smells like their dad, so I will probably not be wearing it often LOL. I like it, but I am typically into scents that smell “warm” and this scent has a kind of cold vibe. If anyone wants to smell sexy but in a kind of aloof masculine way, this is a good option!

Baise-Moi on the Dance Floor
1979, Paris 

Official notes: 
TOP — Violet Leaf, Cassis
HEART — Orris, Jasmine
BASE — Cashmere, Sandalwood

Powdery floral, not for me at all. I am very confused what this grandma scent is doing in a nightclub themed perfume set. Especially for a Paris nightclub, I would expect something grittier. Even if it stayed a floral but with an added touch of skin and like, cigarette smoke or black coffee, I would appreciate this scent a lot more. As someone who has been to many a nightclub in Paris, this is the biggest disappointment of this set. I’m going to give this away to a friend. 


Heathens, Cowboys and the Santa Ana Winds
1986, LA

Official Notes: 
TOP — Palmarosa, Amyris, Sweet Grass, Tea Leaf
HEART — Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Cardamom
BASE — Golden Amber, White Musk, Suede

Mmmmm this is delicious. Warm, woody, androgynous, expensive. I never would've gone for this normally, but damn is it good. It’s honestly hard for me to say what notes I am smelling because I’ve never really had a perfume with palmarosa, amyris, or sweet grass. This is so weird but if anyone's ever gone to a Korean spa with a clay fire dome, it smells like the inside of that. I think the tea leaf and sandalwood also reminds me of whatever soap they use at the Korean spa I go to lol. I love this one, and it’s my girlfriend’s favorite so far as well!

Sweat, Tears, Paradise
1995, Mykonos

Official Notes: 
TOP — Absinthe, Samphire, Salty Lily
HEART — Ambroxan, Sea Salt, Mimosa, Mist
BASE — Cedarwood, Styrax, Musks

This is realistically what a mermaid would smell like. Not like a Disney mermaid, this is a siren that lures sailors to their watery deaths. Ozone, brine, salt, driftwood. I don’t get any “mimosa,” there’s nothing sweet or edible about this on my skin. There is something more mysterious than your average beachy smell, making this almost more of a ""deep ocean"" scent than a beach scent. If you want a fresh, clean girl beachy smell, run away. If you want to actually smell like the ocean, try this. I would say this leans masculine or androgynous. As a lover of the ocean but hater of fresh or sunscreen-y scents, I will absolutely be wearing this. 

Dark Imagination
2003, Marrakesh

Official Notes:
TOP — Damask Rose, Black Plum, Saffron
HEART — Moroccan Rose, Birch Tar, Leather
BASE — Patchouli, Vetiver, Dry Amber, Cedarwood, Smoke

This is such a seductive scent. Rose, leather, smoke, and again, something more mysterious and hard to pin down (maybe the tar?). There's a sweetness from the patchouli and plum that balances out the more ominous undertones of smoke. It is very much a desert scent, it feels like long days and dry heat (although it would still make a great fall/winter scent as well). This perfume is the most similar to anything I already have in my collection, as these are all notes I typically love and go for (esp rose, leather, smoke, and patchouli). That being said, it is still uniquely beautiful and a scent I am very happy to add to my collection! ",5,1761759831.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

""That's just it, Dibble."" She straightened up, rubbing her temples in that way she did when the evidence wasn't cooperating. ""There's *something* inside, I can feel the readings, but I can't get a clear picture. This shell has sophisticated countermeasures. 

“It’s actively resisting me,” she said, her dark eyes meeting mine. “Better than anything on Earth, maybe better than anything in the Compact.”

I was about to suggest we bring in someone from the Battlships’s EXCO, when the ship's lighting flickered. Once. Twice. Then the emergency klaxons began their ear-splitting wail, and I knew our little mystery was about to become a bigger problem.

We headed to the elevator for the bridge, but by the time we got there, it was already over. Admiral Raleigh stood like a statue at the center of the command deck, while around him the bridge crew moved with the barely controlled panic of people who'd just witnessed something unthinkable.

""What happened?"" I asked one of the Lieutenant as she rushed past.

""The Pirate of Peace,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""He overrode our comms. Showed us... Jesus, Dibble, he vaporized the *Mercy's Hand*. Just to demonstrate his new weapon. Some kind of energy nullification field, knocked out all of our systems, then killed them with kinetic weapons.""

I felt my stomach drop. The *Mercy's Hand* was a medical frigate. Unarmed. Crew of forty-three. 

Admiral Raleigh's voice cut through the noise, cold and precise. ""We won’t let them get away with this. All hands, prepare for Age-of-Sail protocols.""

“Age-of-Sail protocols?” I asked.

Raleigh snorted. “Watch and learn, Dibble.”

He opened a fleet-wide channel and spoke the code word. Every captain came on at once, voices overlapping.

I’d heard the rumors: contingency plans filed so deep most officers didn’t know they existed. Plans for fighting without energy weapons; no beams, no batteries, just powder and shot. The cold that ran down my spine wasn’t the ventilation; it was the thought that we were about to use them.

""All officers, report to the armory, enlisted report to storage"" Major Webb's voice boomed over the ship-wide address. ""We're doing this old school.""

Lena grabbed my arm. ""Dibble, we need to get back to the lab. If this is happening, if we're going into battle, we need to figure out what that thing is.""

She was right. But as we made our way back through corridors suddenly full of running officers and crew scrambling to battle stations, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were already too late.

The forensics lab door was sealed, just as we'd left it. Security protocols intact. Everything is apparently normal.

Except the ladybug was missing.

""Oh no,"" Lena whispered behind me. ""Oh no, no, no.""

""How did it get out?"" I asked, moving around the table as I examined the floor. I was desperate to piece together some shred of evidence that could explain how the ladybug had escaped. The Bureau is going to have my head for this, I thought.

""That doesn’t matter."" Lena activated her scanner, sweeping it across the residue. ""Its emission signatures are fading fast.”

""Ah. There it is."" I had found our only clue: the wall panel. It had been well placed back, but the faint claw marks visible in the sterile overhead light gave it away. ""Okonkwo, scan here."" She moved rapidly, capturing the signatures she needed. 

""Okay, where to now?"", I asked. “Just follow me”, we fled the room, as the ringing of emergency alarms swelled the corridors. 

The residue left a trail, faint but traceable under Lena's specialized scanner. We followed it through the ship's corridors, moving quickly but carefully. Every shadow could hide the ladybugs, something dangerous.

The armory had already been emptied, at least on this level, as the Admiral prepared his attack against the pirates. The security console confirmed the weapons inventory was complete. ""It wouldn't find a weapon in here,"" I noted.

Its emission signatures sent us next to the crew dormitories were also empty, with everyone at their battle stations. ""It's not looking for people,"" Lena added. Then I froze. ""Wait a minute."" A shirt lay crumpled on the ground. As I paused to take in the detail, Lena sniggered beside me.

She suddenly grew serious. ""The signals are growing weaker the longer we stay here."" She peered over my shoulder. ""No, you'd better look at this.""

She came up behind me, and we watched together as the ladybug suit disintegrated into a puddle of mud.

Then the trail went cold, vanishing with the suit right before our eyes. My gaze snapped to an air vent slightly ajar above us. I stared at it, my mind racing, then rang EXCO through the dormitory comms. ""I need the ship's schematics, now.""

It needed a weapon. It needed a fresh change of clothes. To move freely through the ship, it also had to look human, or at least like an Earth Allied species.

Armoury. Dormitory. Library. Communication Array… Wait. The communication array.

""Lena, something's been bothering me. Why would the Pirate of Peace come here? He's deep into Compact territory, attacking an aid ship. Why create this entire spectacle?""

""To demonstrate his weapon? To intimidate us?""

I shook my head. ""No. Think about it. The power to siege my convoy, the cunning to launch a sneak attack on us… this was orchestrated by someone like one of the three Pirate Kings."" I met her eyes, the realization settling like a stone. ""They aren't here for the ship. They're here for whatever was inside that ladybug suit. That thing has information we need.""

""So what's it doing now?""

""The only thing it can. It's trying to get a message out. It's heading for the communications array.""

We ran.

The secondary communications array was three decks down, tucked away in a usually automated section. The door hung open. Inside, illuminated by the frantic flicker of console lights, a figure was hunched over the equipment.

""Stop!"" I shouted. Lena braced herself in the doorway, her comms crackling as she tried to raise security, while I faced down the figure.

The figure turned.

It was a girl.

She looked no more than twelve or thirteen by human standards, her skin smeared with the same residue from the ladybug suit. She wore a stolen jumpsuit from the dormitories, but it was her eyes that made my finger freeze on the trigger. They were ancient—empty and calculating.

Then she moved.

I had never seen anything move like that. It wasn't raw speed. It was pure, terrifying efficiency. She closed the distance between us in three fluid steps and struck a nerve cluster in my neck with surgical precision. My body hit the deck before my mind could process the blow.

WHOOP. WHOOP. WHOOP.

Lena had hit the emergency alarm.

The girl's head snapped toward the sound of approaching security. For one moment, her too-old eyes met mine, and I saw something there I couldn't quite identify. Fear? Warning? Regret?

Then she was gone, slipping into a ventilation shaft with liquid grace that made her earlier movements seem sluggish by comparison.

Then parts of the communication array zone, crackled and smoke bellowed. 

Sections of the communication array sparked and crackled, smoke billowing from the consoles. Lena helped me to my feet as I clutched my numb arm. ""She's destroying evidence,"" I said. ""Cleaning up after herself.""

The few security personnel not involved in the main operation flooded the corridor within minutes, but I knew it was already too late. They wouldn't find her. As I stood there, rubbing feeling back into my wrist, I let my detective's mind work through the problem.

""She couldn't call for help from inside the ship,"" I said, more to myself than to Lena. ""Our communications are locked down for battle. She can't override that without giving away her position and getting killed.""

""So what does she do?""

That's when I felt it, the deep vibration through the deck plates. Raleigh must have found a substitute for the lost cannons. We were engaging the enemy. And suddenly I understood everything.

""She gets out."" I looked toward the outer hull, toward where the boarding action would soon begin. ""She's going to join the boarding party. Use our own assault as her escape route.""

I tried to warn them. Called Major Webb, sent messages to security, even tried to reach Admiral Raleigh. But we were in the middle of a battle, communications were chaotic, and who had time to listen to a detective rambling about an escaped girl when the Pirate of Peace was trying to kill us all?

So I did the only thing I could do. I headed for the starboard launch bays.

The scene was one of controlled madness. Marines in combat armor lined up in ranks, checking their equipment. I saw grapnel cannons and braided steel cables. From afar, I could hear the strange, low hum of a series of large boxes. ""What are those?"" I asked a nearby crewman.

""The printers. That's what we're using for the assault.""

I stared at the massive, blocky shapes they were producing. ""Are those the exhibition weapons? Aren't they antiques?""

""Yes,"" the crewman said, not looking up from his work. ""They're called Howitzers. We built them from digital models someone looked up. They can't be shut down by those nullification waves.""

On another side of the bay, the ship's medical team was distributing Compound D, led by crewmen, while the assault section was marshaled by officers. The stimulant was being administered via small injector pens, and marines grimaced as they pressed the devices to their necks.

""Dibble!"" Major Webb spotted me, his scarred face showing surprise. ""What the hell are you doing here? This is a combat zone.""

""There's an infiltrator, Major. A girl. She's going to try to cross with the boarding party.""

""An infiltrator? She? Dibble, we don't have time for—""

The ship shuddered, cutting him off. Through the bay's viewports, I watched as the newly-printed Howitzers, mounted on the exit bays of the deck, fired their opening salvo. Tungsten slugs, each one massing several tons, launched with a series of deafening thuds that I felt in my bones. 

I heard officers shouting over the din, commenting that the railguns weren't charged high enough. But it didn't matter. In the distance, we were drawing closer to what I knew was the pirate flagship. The antique shells struck its hull, tearing ragged holes in armor designed to shrug off energy weapons.

“Raleigh’s betting the pirates expect us to fold once their field lit our boards red. They won’t expect 400-year-old physics.”

""All teams, prepare to launch!"" Webb shouted. I was pushed aside as the first wave of marines rushed towards the smaller launch bays—not for escape pods, but for assault shuttles. They wore full space suits.

Before I could finish my question, it all made sense. The ammunition, the grappling guns, the need for close-quarters combat officers, and Admiral Raleigh’s comment. I’d heard he was an enthusiast of Earth history, specifically a period called the Golden Age of Piracy. He’d always spoken of boarding actions as something modern space battles lacked. I thought he was mad for suggesting it.

Now, I realized he was mad enough to bring it back.

I watched them go. Watched as they shot across the void on cables that would have made eighteenth-century sailors nod in recognition.

And somewhere in that chaos of armored figures crossing between ships, I caught a glimpse of something that might have been a small figure in an oversized jumpsuit, clinging to a grappling line.

Lena and I tried to push forward, but we were shoved back by the tide of marines. Webb had already dismissed us; the ladybug was clearly not his priority. In the face of this full-scale military operation, my theory felt increasingly crackpot. It was unheard of for a Pirate King to attack Earthlings so brazenly, let alone for the sake of a single person, no matter how valuable.

The boarding action took three hours. Three hours of close-quarters combat in narrow corridors, marines fighting with kinetic weapons and hand tools against an enemy who'd thought they'd neutralized humanity's ability to fight back. It was brutal, efficient, and utterly terrifying in its simplicity.

The Pirate of Peace himself escaped in an auxiliary vessel, but his flagship was captured, his crew slain or taken prisoner. His grand demonstration of superiority had backfired, revealing only his own tactical blindness. As our frigates launched coordinated attacks, the surrounding pirate fleet was decimated. Only five ships, including the Pirate King's own, managed to escape into the bowels of the Outer Rim they dominate, far from the reach of Earth and the Compact.

I found myself in the Executive Command Centre as the debriefing began, still nursing my numb arm. Admiral Raleigh was accepting status reports, his face showing the first signs of exhaustion after hours of combat decisions.

""Casualty count?""

""Seventeen dead, forty-three wounded across the fleet—and that's not including the casualties from the med ship. But given the circumstances, sir, we made history today. It's safe to say the Pirate of Peace has lost his rank and status with this defeat. We won't have to worry about him in the borderlands anymore; the pirates will be too busy fighting each other over what's left of his fleet.""

A marine lieutenant approached, tablet in hand. ""Admiral, something odd to report. We had a stowaway—some kid. She was on the pirate ship when we breached. Several marines saw her, but in the fighting..."" He shrugged helplessly. ""We lost track of her.""

I stepped forward, ignoring the protests of my aching body. ""Admiral, that 'kid' was an alien entity. It arrived with me in the ladybug, hatched in our forensics lab, and escaped. There’s something big happening, and it's no coincidence Earth is being attacked just as a peace conference we're mediating draws closer.""

Raleigh turned to me, his eyes sharp despite his exhaustion. ""You're saying he has her now. Whatever intelligence she carried just went with them.""

I stared at the viewscreen, where the debris from the battle drifted against the stars. Somewhere out there, the Pirate's escape vessel was accelerating into the dark.

""Or,"" I said slowly, the detective in me refusing to accept the obvious, ""she wanted to get back to him. What if she wasn't escaping the Pirate? What if she was reporting to him? We assumed she was his enemy, but what if she was his asset all along?""

The bridge fell silent. I could see the implications settling over them, could watch as each officer realized what it might mean if I was right.

I looked around at the bridge crew, at their victorious faces now clouding with doubt. We had won this battle with improvisation, courage, and weapons older than spaceflight itself. We had shown the galaxy that humanity could still fight, even with our technology neutralized.

But that might have been exactly what they wanted to know. I touched my still-numb wrist and wondered what else I'd missed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums are becoming increasingly popular for their versatility and modern appeal. Among various sizes, the 40x60 barndominium is a standout choice for families and individuals seeking spacious living combined with a rustic aesthetic. This size offers a generous area that can accommodate comfortable living spaces, a functional kitchen, and even a hobby area. Let’s explore innovative floor plans and layouts that can inspire you.

When considering a 40x60 barndominium, it's essential to focus on how to best utilize the space. Here are some innovative ideas for floor plans:

- **Open Concept Living:** One of the most sought-after features in modern homes is an open concept design. This allows natural light to flow throughout the space, making it feel larger. Imagine a spacious living room that seamlessly transitions into the dining area and kitchen. This layout is ideal for entertaining and everyday family life.
- **Split Floor Plan:** For those who prefer more privacy, a split floor plan can be beneficial. This design separates the master suite from the other bedrooms. Families with children or guests will appreciate the separation while still enjoying shared living areas.
- **Multi-Functional Rooms:** In smaller homes, it’s crucial to maximize functionality. Designating rooms that can serve multiple purposes – such as a guest room that doubles as a home office – can enhance the usability of your space.

Next, let’s delve deeper into some specific layouts that can work well within a 40x60 framework:

**1. Three Bedroom Layout:** Consider a layout with a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, plus two additional bedrooms sharing a common bathroom. The living room location can face the entrance to create an inviting first impression. A spacious kitchen with an island can encourage family gatherings, while the dining area can comfortably fit a large table.

**2. Two Bedroom with Office:** For individuals or couples who work from home, a two-bedroom layout with a designated office space can be ideal. The office can face the yard, allowing for a pleasant view while working. Meanwhile, the living room and kitchen can still retain an open layout feel, ensuring you have a welcoming space for guests.

**3. Workshop Addition:** If you have hobbies that require extra space, think about incorporating a workshop into your floor plan. This could be strategically placed at one end of the barndominium, with direct access from the exterior. The rest of the home can maintain a standard layout with all the essential living amenities.

In addition to the functional aspects, consider enhancing the interior design of your barndominium to create a stylish and modern living environment. Here are some design elements to incorporate:

- **Exposed Beams:** Highlight the rustic charm by featuring exposed wooden beams in your ceiling. This can add character and warmth to an open space.
- **Large Windows:** Opt for large windows that not only provide better views but also invite natural light. This is particularly appealing in living spaces where you gather with family.
- **Sustainable Materials:** Using eco-friendly materials can be a part of your design strategy. Consider using reclaimed wood, bamboo flooring, or energy-efficient appliances that align with modern living standards.

Moreover, outdoor spaces should not be overlooked. A porch or deck can be an extension of your living space. This outdoor area can serve as a perfect spot for morning coffee or evening relaxation. A few outdoor furniture pieces and perhaps a grill can elevate your experience of outdoor living.

Ultimately, designing a 40x60 barndominium floor plan requires careful consideration of your lifestyle and needs. By keeping your preferences in mind and exploring innovative layouts, you can create a space that not only satisfies your functional requirements but also showcases your personal style. Whether you lean towards an open concept, prefer distinct spaces, or want to maximize every square foot, the possibilities are endless for creating your dream barndominium.

Tips for Designing Functional and Stylish Layouts in Barndominiums
------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a barndominium can be an exciting journey. If you’re looking to create a space that is both functional and stylish, there are several key tips to consider. From maximizing space to choosing the right colors, these strategies will help you achieve the perfect balance in your barndominium's layout.

### Consider Open Spaces

One of the most appealing features of barndominiums is their open concept design. Open spaces allow for flexibility in furniture arrangement and movement. When planning your layout:

- Think about how you use each area daily.
- Designate specific zones for activities but avoid walls that can clutter the space.
- Incorporate multifunctional furniture, like a dining table that doubles as a workspace.

### Focus on Natural Light

Natural light enhances any space. Large windows and skylights not only brighten your barndominium but also create a sense of openness. When planning your layout, consider the following:

- Position windows for maximum sunlight in common areas.
- Use lighter materials for walls and floors to reflect light and make spaces feel larger.
- Incorporate glass doors that open to outdoor living areas, creating a seamless transition between the indoors and outdoors.

### Opt for Soothing Color Palettes

The right color scheme can significantly influence the mood and style of your barndominium. Neutral colors like whites, grays, and beiges can create a calming effect. Here are some tips for choosing your palette:

- Choose a main color for walls and larger furniture pieces.
- Use accent colors through decor, textiles, and artwork.
- Consider the overall theme—rustic, modern, or traditional—to ensure consistency throughout the space.

### Plan Functional Kitchens

The kitchen is often the heart of a home. In a barndominium, where space can be unique, focus on functionality and flow. Key considerations include:

- Utilize a kitchen island for extra counter space and informal dining.
- Incorporate shelving for additional storage while keeping things within reach.
- Designate specific zones for cooking, prep work, and cleaning to keep the kitchen organized.

### Maximize Storage Solutions

Storage is vital in any home, especially in a barndominium. Smart storage solutions help maintain a clean look while providing functionality. You can:

- Use built-in cabinets and shelving to save space.
- Take advantage of vertical storage by utilizing wall space.
- Incorporate hidden storage beneath benches or under the stairs.

### Incorporate Outdoor Living Areas

Outdoor living spaces are a fantastic addition to any barndominium. These areas provide additional room for relaxation and entertainment. Enhance your layout by:

- Designing a covered porch or patio for year-round enjoyment.
- Creating an outdoor kitchen or dining area for entertaining.
- Using landscaping techniques to blend indoor and outdoor spaces beautifully.

### Design for Flexibility

As your life changes, so may your needs. When designing the layout of your barndominium, consider flexibility for future changes. You can:

- Use movable walls or partitions that can easily be adjusted.
- Invest in furniture that can serve multiple purposes.
- Plan for rooms that can adapt based on how your family grows.

These strategies into your barndominium design can help you achieve a space that is both functional and stylish. Remember to focus on your lifestyle needs and preferences. With thoughtful planning and creative ideas, your barndominium can be the perfect blend of comfort and modern design.

### Conclusion

When it comes to creating a 40x60 barndominium, the possibilities are endless. By exploring innovative floor plans, you can transform these sturdy structures into inviting, functional homes that suit your lifestyle perfectly. Whether you're a fan of open-concept designs or prefer more traditional spaces, there’s a layout to meet your needs while maximizing the utility of the available space.

Designing a stylish and functional barndominium layout involves careful consideration of how each area will be used. Emphasizing smart design choices can make all the difference. For example, combining living and dining spaces encourages a greater sense of community, while separating bedrooms can provide the privacy many families desire. elements like large windows can enhance natural light and connection to the surroundings, making your home feel even more expansive.

Don't forget to consider your personal style throughout the design process. Your barndominium should reflect who you are, so feel free to play with colors, materials, and furnishings. With the right mix, your home can be both practical and a true reflection of your tastes.

Ultimately, a 40x60 barndominium can be more than just a residence. It can be a hub for family gatherings, a cozy retreat after a long day, or even a vibrant space for entertaining friends. Embrace the charm of barndominium living by designing a layout that not only meets your practical needs but also adds joy and comfort to your everyday life.

1ojb6qq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojb6qq,Berlin and Zurich Bean Haul & Cafe Experience,"What a fun trip! Even more so because I had some great recs for coffee, enjoyed a lot of great brews, and picked up some excellent beans.

**Berlin Stops**

* **Bonanza** - Went twice. Excellent coffee and espresso, but was disappointed that they don't do V60. They said they only do filter hand brew from time to time when they have special competition beans. Just wanted to note in case anyone is going there for pour over. **But** their batch brew was really good. And way better than a mediocre pour over would have been. Their espresso was also excellent. **Grabbed a bag of La Laguna Costa Rica Natural.** Delicious and highly recommend. Also had that in the cafe.

* **The Barn** - Great pour over and beans. And really nice and relaxing interior/vibe. Picked up another Costa Rican Natural there (Berlin roasters seem to be really into Costa Rican Naturals - a lot of great examples of that at the shops), and an Yirgacheffe Ethiopian.

* **Kolo Coffee** - **Best pour over experience in Berlin.** Basically every decent shop in Berlin has an EK-43 . . . but when I saw they had an EK-43 and EG-1, knew they weren't playing around. They also offer elite level bean options. Got a Finca Deborah Nirvana and an Ombligon (forget the roaster) pour over. I've had Finca Deborah Nirvana before, and multiple Ombligon . . . and theirs were incredible cups. Each were as close to a perfect brew as you can get IMO. Then grabbed a Nyeri Kenyan sl28/s34 and a Costa Rican Red Catuai Natural (again :)).

**Zurich Stops**

* **Mame Josef** - **If I lived in Zurich I would go broke at Mame. From a selection of beans offered for pour over and/or espresso perspective, maybe the best I've ever been to.** They always have an elite offering for espresso and pour over, and their standard choices are great too. They also have an incredible selection of beans for purchase. Had a La Palma El Tucan Gesha espresso, and Janson Lot 464 Gesha pour over. Both exquisite.

* **Mame Seefeld** - went to both of their Zurich cafes. The Josef location was nice because it was small and intimate, like your favorite neighborhood shop. Then the Seefeld location was large and fancier, really nice, but in a totally different way. Grabbed the beans here - Kamwangi AA Batianm Ruiru 11, sl28 blend, and a splurge: La Cabra Lot 43 Geisha Anaerobic. Had a Hartmann Anaerobic Gesha espresso, and a Morgan Symmetry Natural Gesha pour over. Both also exquisite. Also got a Kamwangi AA espresso shot just to try, and it was delicious also.

* **Collective Bakery** - Really good pour over, and they strictly carry Rose beans, which are excellent. They also have nice baked goods. I would be thrilled to have a place like this where I live - but I was so blown away by Mame it was hard to compete/compare. Grabbed a bag of El Jardin Pink Bourbon Washed.

1ojawl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ojawl5/drain/,Drain,"As I lay in bed, leafing through my old hardcover copy of *Talking To Heaven*, a tickle on my wrist. Some sort of beetle the size of an apple seed, flat and brown, crawled up my arm as if out for an evening stroll. I shrieked and blew it onto the nightstand.

I’m guessing it’s because I’ve lived in the city my whole life that I’ve never been a fan of bugs. Spiders hunched in dark corners. Bloated worms rotting on the sidewalk. Fruits flies buzzing around the sink in a cloud of filth. I know insects are a part of nature, but so are viruses—just because something’s natural doesn’t mean it’s good. 

I snatched a tissue from the box, draped it over the thing as it tried to scurry off the edge of the nightstand, and smashed it with the spine of my book. Wadding up the tissue, I flushed it down the toilet. And flushed again.

Back in bed, I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. But an Internet factoid kept creeping into my mind, how the average person supposedly swallows eight spiders a year in their sleep. Throat scratchy, I scurried to the bathroom for a glass of water and an Ambien, then burrowed under the covers and fell asleep.

The next morning, I awoke having all but forgotten about the encounter. I held a session across town, browsed the aisles at a used bookstore, and spent my usual quiet evening at home, this night with a filet of salmon, pint of mint chocolate chip, and a *Twilight Zone* marathon on the SyFy Channel.                                      

Three days later, while stripping my bed sheets, another of the disgusting bugs bumbled across my mattress like a cursor on a computer screen. Without thinking, I brushed it on the floor with the back of a hand and stomped, mashing it into the carpet with the heel of my slipper. I lifted my foot to make sure it was dead. Motionless, it stuck to my sole.

I took off the slipper and brought it over to the computer. Typed “indoor insects” into the search engine and sifted through a nightmare gallery of cockroaches, pill bugs, and centipedes before I had a match. A wave of nausea swept through me. It was a goddamn *bedbug*.

Weren’t bedbugs for messy people? But my apartment was spotless! Which meant they were coming from someplace else, probably that meathead down the hall, the stink of a locker room seeping out from under his door.

I did more research and learned the nasties had become increasingly common over the past few decades, for whatever reason. The only good news was that, although they could bite—sucking blood like mosquitoes and ticks—they weren’t disease carriers. Some consolation.

Though it was almost midnight, I called my landlord, demanded that he send an exterminator the next morning, and hung up before he could make any of his excuses. I yanked off the bedsheets and shoved the mattress on the floor but didn’t find any more of the bastards. A couple of Ambien later, I curled up on the living room couch under the afghan, and, scratching the occasional imaginary itch, watched *I Dream of Jeanie* reruns until I fell asleep.

A ring woke me late the next morning. It took a few confused seconds to figure out it was my doorbell—sadly, it’d been that long since I’d had a visitor. I jolted up from the couch and raced to the door, eye against the peephole. A man in a red and blue uniform stood there.

The exterminator told me I’d need to “vacate the premises” for the next six hours, which was perfect since I had a session, anyway. I got dressed and left, relieved to be escaping the infestation, if only for the day.

My client was a tiny, quivering Lithuanian widow whose sprawling Victorian smelled like onions. She wanted to speak with her husband, gone for almost twenty years. Her cold dry hand clutching mine, I tried to establish contact for nearly two hours but to no avail.

“The spirit world is elusive,” I told her with a shrug. “We can try again tomorrow.”

When I asked for my modest fee, she grunted up from her chair, shuffled to the closet, and came back gripping a broom. Jabbering in a foreign tongue, the awful woman literally swept me from her kitchen, down the hallway, and out the front door, which the ingrate slammed in my face.

Teeth clenched against my rage, I called a cab to take me to the pharmacy so I could refill my old Xanax prescription, which, thankfully, was still good. I popped one on the way out the door, and, calmer than I’d felt in days, strolled the sunny sidewalks for some window-shopping.

To distract my mind away from my vermin-filled home, I killed a couple of hours at a coffee shop, sipping a latte and browsing tabloids. A scruffy teenager played an acoustic guitar in the corner, fingers scrabbling over the strings like a Daddy-longlegs. It might’ve been the amplifier, but when he sang a second voice in the background, faint and trembling, wove in off-key harmonies.

Before long, six hours had passed, and it was time to go back to my apartment. But I didn’t want to. I dug my cell from my purse and called Arianne.

“Can you hold on a sec, hun?” Arianne said. I leaned against a lamppost, phone against my ear, listening to roaring laughter and what might’ve been a brass section. “Okay, I’m back.”

“So good to hear your voice,” I blurted, tearing up, happy to be speaking to the only person in the city I could honestly call a friend. “First—and you won’t believe this—I found a bedbug in my apartment. An actual bedbug! So, of course, I got the place fumigated.”

“Really,” Arianne said, barely audible over blaring trumpets.

“And then one of my clients wouldn’t even—”

“Don’t you dare!” Arianne screeched in my ear.

I held the phone away from my face. “What?”

“Not you, hun. Someone else,” Arianne said. “Know what, babe? This really isn’t a good time. I’m in New York. With Gil.” She whispered the last part.

I didn’t know who Gil was but figured he had to be Arianne’s latest paramour. “Sugar daddies,” she called them, which she explained wasn’t sex work because *she* chose *them*.

“I’m really having a hard time here,” I almost sobbed. “Could I maybe stay at your—”

Arianne sighed irritably. “I can barely hear you. How about you fill me in when I get back, okay? Love ya!” A smacking kiss, and she hung up.

I stood there with the phone in my hand beside the swarming traffic, berating myself for expecting anything—anything at all—from that selfish creature.

When I got back to the apartment, the exterminator was gone. The smell wasn’t bad, just a faint trace of something metallic. I opened the windows to let in the cool early autumn air, switched on the ceiling fan, and lit a few vanilla candles.

My heart crammed in my throat, I tiptoed into the bedroom as if sneaking up on an unfaithful lover. Holding my breath, I inspected the top of the mattress, flipped it over. Reluctantly, I knelt down to look under the bed. All clean. I let out a sigh.

Every day for the next week I scrutinized my bed, carpet, dresser drawers, and closets for signs of the invaders. Nothing. They were gone. I could relax again.

Four mornings later I woke to find one of the horribles squatting on my pillow, inches from my face, like a mint left behind by housekeeping. Gagging, I carried the pillow at arm’s length over to the balcony, sliding the torn screen door open with my foot. Then tossed the whole thing over the railing to watch it plummet seventeen stories to the street below. Suddenly exhausted, I crumpled into a ball on the cement. I cried a little.

The exterminator came back that afternoon. “Sorry,” he said with a sheepish smile. “Must’ve missed some eggs on the first sweep. Mind if I take a look?”

“That’s your job, isn’t it?” I snipped, not about to be taken advantage of again.

Sliding a flashlight from a hip holster, he went into the bedroom while I vacuumed the living room carpet for the second time that day.

After maybe ten minutes I noticed him standing there looking at me. I shut off the vacuum.

“I didn’t find anything,” he said, almost accusingly.

“Must not have looked very hard,” I shot back.

“Sure they were bedbugs?”

Annoyed now, I clenched the handle of the vacuum. “Positive.”

“There’s no sign of them.” He scowled, as if blaming me for his own subpar work.

“You think I’m making this up?”

He paused a bit too long before answering, which made me furious. “I don’t know, lady.” He shrugged. “If your landlord’s paying for it, I’ll bomb the place again.”

Satisfied, I nodded. “Make sure you get them all this time,” I spat, and fled the apartment to catch a film.    

The next week, I discovered two of the monsters on my headboard. The room swam for a moment before I got ahold of myself. Then I punched each of them dead with a bare fist, blood trickling from my split knuckle.

On my hands and knees I inspected the carpet. What if they were breeding under there? I crawled to the corner to see if I could pull up an edge. No, but there were a few tiny brown turds. For Christ’s sake, not only did I have bedbugs, mice were setting up shop, too!

I must’ve sounded like a madwoman when I called my slumlord, as he kept telling me to “settle down,” that he couldn’t understand what I was saying.

I calmed myself enough to insist he send over another exterminator right away or I’d “burn the place to the ground.” Needless to say, I took a double dose of Xanax.

By noon, a new exterminator in a brown jumpsuit showed up, and I checked in to a four star hotel. Despite my meager bank account, I needed to feel clean, if only for a night. You better believe I scoured every inch of that room to make sure it was pristine before I lay down on the ivory comforter.

I slept okay despite the occasional grunt, groan, or sigh from the bathroom—like someone relieving himself—startling me awake a few times. My phantom urinator aside, I was comfortable in the plush and immaculate room, and in no rush to head back home. I ended up staying for three nights, which cost almost a thousand bucks, part of a good month’s income. And it hadn’t been a good month.

Finally, nowhere left to hide, I trudged back to my apartment, dread scalding my insides as if I’d swallowed a pot of hot soup. I unlocked the door and sniffed the air, encouraged by the strong metallic stink. Chewing my lower lip, I marched straight into the bedroom.

I’m proud to say I didn’t make a peep when I found five of the sons of bitches cavorting on the nightstand. One at a time, I crushed them between my fingers and smeared their carcasses against the wall as a warning to the others.

Obviously, getting rid of the wretched beasts was beyond the ability of some rip off exterminator. Like everything else, it was going to be up to me. I dry swallowed another couple of Xanax.

Back on the Internet, I spent hours reading up on the crawling freaks, eventually clicking on a page with close-up photos of insects that looked like—but weren’t—bedbugs. A cousin of bedbugs, bat bugs lived in caves and fed on the blood of roosting bats.

I thought back to the poop I’d found in the corner. Could it have been from a bat instead of a mouse? Had one found its way into the apartment—through my torn screen door, maybe—bugs hitching a ride on its veiny wings?

I did some more research, learned how there were over a thousand species of the hideous flying rats, how they were supposed to be so great because they pollinated flowers and ate mosquitoes, and how millions of them were dying from some fungus that grew on their faces. Good riddance.

As the night grew late, I found myself on a website about vampire bats, the South American species that drank cow’s blood…along with the occasional sleeping human’s.

When I finally fell asleep, I dreamt of Casper, my childhood kitty, twining around my legs. Except when I bent down to pet him, a torrent of yellow maggots spilled out of his empty eye sockets and piled in a squirming mass around my ankles. I woke drenched in sweat, ran to the bathroom, stripped off my nightgown, and examined my entire body for bites. All clean, false alarm.

Curious what the dream meant, I logged onto [Occultopedia.com](http://Occultopedia.com), which explained how cats could be familiars for vampires. I laughed out loud. Still, for no other reason than to occupy my mind, I kept reading and learned that familiars didn’t have to be cats, they could be any sort of creature. Like insects, I wondered?

Yes, I’m a medium who was born with the ability to speak to the dead. That doesn’t mean I believed in vampires. I turned off the computer, checked my sheets and pillows—all clear, thank heavens—took two Xanax and two Ambien, and shut off the light.

I woke again in the middle of the night scratching my neck. Hit the light, flung off my nightgown mid-sprint to the bathroom to stare at my pale goose-bumped flesh in the mirror. Eyes blurry from sleep, it took me a few seconds to make sure it was real.

Lifting my chin to get a better look, I traced a finger over a pair of red spots on my jugular vein. The bites, two inches apart, almost looked like fang marks. Dizzy, I sat down hard on the closed toilet lid.

I’m not naïve, but years of communicating with the dead taught me to have an open mind. If there are lost souls among us yearning for contact, then are the undead really that much of a stretch? Clearly not, I finally accepted.

It was three in the morning, but I had to tell the world what I’d uncovered. I called Arianne, but of course it went to voice mail. I rushed over to the computer and, typing in a frenzy, dashed off emails to the local TV, newspaper, and radio outlets explaining my revelation.

How it’s not only bats that can be a vampire’s familiar but bat bugs, too. How the bats find their way inside a home, carrying the bugs, which siphon off the victim’s blood and crawl back to their master to feast.

After all, if you’re a hungry vampire, why go to the trouble of a restaurant when you can get home delivery, lying in bed (in coffin?) as you pop one blood-filled insect after another into your mouth like bonbons? I implored the journalists to do their jobs for once and report on what was happening, before it was too late.

I shut the computer and paced around my apartment, smacking the side of my head, trying to get the thoughts to flow. I had to accept that, even if the authorities got involved, it wouldn’t be in time to save me. As always, I was on my own. I scratched the bites on my neck until they bled.

Obviously, it was pointless to try to stop the bat from coming in. The bugs were already there, breeding under the carpet, behind the furniture, in the walls. Like unwanted houseguests, as long as I kept the refrigerator full—in this case, my veins—they weren’t going anywhere. I laughed at the idea of the vampire bugs as some deadbeat relatives mooching off my hospitality. And kept laughing, until the answer came to me.

My plan was simple but brilliant. I’d go out and buy a bottle of wine and drink a few glasses. Then I’d let the little shits suck down my alcohol-tainted blood and bring it back to their boss, who’d spit out his spoiled meal, call off his minions, and never trouble me again. If the tactic worked, I could share it with others, and maybe we could start to rid the city—the world?—of the bloodsuckers.

Sure enough, I found a couple of them on the nightstand the next day. Having them where I wanted, I just smiled. Defiantly, I polished off the rest of the wine along with a double dose of pills.   

There were a few more on the bedspread the next morning, but I refused to panic. I went out and bought some scotch, took slugs from the bottle until I passed out.

I woke up hours later and found a spot of blood on my nightgown just above my left breast. Still numb from the alcohol, I watched myself go through the motions of taking off my gown, running cold water over it from the bathroom sink, and dabbing the spot with a paper towel. Then fell to my knees with the futility of it all.

It had been stupid to think that the vampire would somehow be put off by my blood alcohol level. For all I knew, it was a treat for him, like a sweet after-dinner Riesling. There was no beating this, no happy ending. 

Nude and in a daze, I walked out to the balcony, nightgown in hand, and gazed down at the city, yellow streetlights strung out like a garland of fireflies. He was out there somewhere, laughing at me, knowing that I belonged to him—knowing that *I* knew it, too—and there was nothing I could do about it.

My chest felt tight, like a mousetrap ready to spring. I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t. I stared at the dark honeycomb windows of the apartment building across the street, wondering if any of them housed my vampire.

From a dead calm, the wind picked up. It blew through my hair, whooshed in my ears, almost like someone muttering. It was.

I couldn’t understand, at first. As always, it seemed to come simultaneously from inside my head yet miles in the distance.

The wind died down. I shut my eyes and concentrated.

“Very close now,” the paper-thin voice of an old man rasped. A warning? I couldn’t recognize the speaker, but the accent sounded a lot like my Lithuanian client whose dead husband I’d failed to reach earlier that week. Seemed I’d made contact, after all.

I stared at the inner wrist of my hand clutching the blood-spotted nightgown, blue veins branching beneath translucent skin, anesthetized to the fear.

“Almost here,” he said.

The dead had no reason to lie, and I was grateful to him for his counsel. I knew then what I had to do.

I flung the nightgown over the balcony, it floated to the street below like a white flag of surrender. With both hands, I gripped the cold railing and leaned forward.

A buzzing from the bedroom. My cell phone. Automatically, I walked inside, lifted it from the nightstand, and fingered it to life. I had a text and a voicemail.

The text was a dimly lit photo of Arianne with an older man. She wore too much eyeshadow, dyed yellow curls piled atop her head in a parody of elegance, evening gown cut desperately low. The man had a full head of white hair and was dressed in a tuxedo. He looked at something off camera, hand resting on the inside of Arianne’s upper thigh.

In her voicemail, Arianne explained how she and Gil would be coming back into town that weekend and that she wanted me to meet him.

“Gil’s very generous, you have no idea. I really hit the jackpot.” A few seconds of silence before Arianne went on. “But he’s got these quirks. And part of our arrangement is that I take care of them. So...” Arianne sighed. “I showed him your picture. And, well, he’s interested. Which is why I need you to do me this one teensy favor and—”

Disgusted, I flung the phone across the bedroom, Arianne’s voice still whining out demands from the carpet. Was she serious? As if I’d ever—

A thought jolted me like a cattle prod, and I leaned against the wall for support. Oh my God. Oh my God, it was *her*. It’d been her all along.

All the times I’d held that needy little floozy in my arms, consoling her after the latest guy tossed her away like a used tissue. The hours I’d spent listening to her drunken blubbering over the mess that was her life, her fading looks, the wrong choices she somehow couldn’t stop making.

All the times I told myself she was a bad friend, how she took and took and never gave back. That the next time she banged on my door late at night, I’d ignore her.

But I never had the guts. I always let her in.

My neck tingled where I’d been bitten, and I scratched. When I took my hand away, my nails were streaked with red, like a sexy polish.

Unable to resist a sudden impulse, I plunged my fingers into my mouth and slurped up the blood.

1ojatsw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojatsw,Hyatt House Shibuya: better than I expected as a Cat 4 (rip the deval),"I booked HH Shibuya pre-deval at 4 nights for 15k/night as a Cat 4 hotel + one FNC from the WOH card.

I've been a pretty big critic of the Tokyo Hyatts, but I thought it's only right to give all of them a fair shake, so here are my honest thoughts.

* Rooms: reasonably sized with decent layout. I booked a standard King room (this property doesn't do complimentary upgrades). Has everything you expect in an extended stay property, kitchen (with induction stove, pots, pans, salt/pepper, utensils), washing machine w/ detergent, shower/bathtub, toilet, working desk, daybed, etc. Because this property is so new, everything looks and feels fresh, remiscent of a high end NYC studio tbh. If I was going to live in Tokyo for an extended period, I would want something like this
* Breakfast: it's very average for Japan and not a particularly large selection, but I found it has all the basics. A few hot Japanese dishes, rice, miso soup, etc. Western options like eggs, potatoes, bacon, etc. And some various assorted items like pastries, salad, etc. Decent juice, coffee, tea selection, etc. You will probably tire of eating it after 2 or 3 days.
* Location: this one is probably contentious, it's not particularly great imo, but it's also not the hotel's fault. Rather just the layout of the Shibuya station + buildings in the vicinity. They're all interconnected via walkways, but seemingly not as easily via sidewalks. For someone that relies on Google Maps to navigate, it can be more challenging since a lot of your walking is indoors rather than outside, with easier to identify street names/crosswalks. The hotel provides instructions on how to navigate when arriving via JR line, so pay attention to it. Ultimately, you are right at the station and the Yamanote line is one of the best lines, so I think people will like it more than they hate it.
* Facilities: they have a (very small) gym on the 15th floor. It has a few cardio machines and one bench and dumbbell set. For short stays, it's sufficient, but if you are doing a true extended stay, it's a bit lacking. The core issue is the size, it can get cramped with just a few people in it. There is a very nice chain brand gym w/ sauna right by the hotel entrance called Fit Easy, which has day passes for 5000 JPY (about $33 USD).
* Price: this is where I really bring out the pitchforks. I think this hotel was perfect as a Cat 4, the 15k/night feels just right and you can burn your WOH certs on it. At Cat 5 it somehow just feels too much. With Tokyo basically being standard or peak pricing at all times, 20k to 25k feels significantly higher. The cash prices also are quite tough to swallow. This is a hotel that regularly commands prices of at least $400/night with all the taxes and fees, often significantly higher, towards the $500 to $600/night range.
   * At $500 to $600/night, I'm not sure who the hotel is meant for. If you can spend that much at an extended stay hotel, I figure you can probably just go for a proper, high end, full service hotel. Otherwise, people that are more budget conscious looking for an extended stay property won't be able to stay here either. A week at this hotel would run you thousands of dollars.

In conclusion, the ""hardware"" of this hotel is actually pretty decent, if I was looking for an extended stay property, I would want something exactly like this, just not at this price point.",9,1761758909.0,hyatt,7,0.91,False
1ojato4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ojato4/going_to_porto_for_the_first_time_with_older/,Going to Porto for the first time - with older parents.,"Hey everyone! So I got this idea of gifting a trip to my parents (65F and 74M, and me, 25F) to Porto, Portugal in March 2026 (1st to 5th). I've lived abroad for the past 7 years and am finally coming back home, so this will be a great way for us to reunite and spend quality time together. They're from Southern France, so they won't have to deal with jetlag or anything.

We're staying right next to the Mercado do Bolhao. Their interests while travelling are food, culture and general vibe and sights of the city. They're old people enjoying good food and old buildings. Budget is not unlimited unfortunately - I'm looking at 150€ per day, for all 3 of us - breakfast excluded as we'll be eating at the hotel. If an activity is really worth it, I'll consider it. I've already planned on visiting a Porto Wine cave. 

Tell me your most unhinged recs - not the typical thing I could find on TripAdvisor. Is there any thing you've done/visited/eaten in Porto that makes you wanna go back there? I just want to find the best ways for them to enjoy this trip 10000%. Keep in mind they're older, they can't walk uphill for hours straight. We'll need some coffee breaks - again, coffee shops recs are more than welcome :)

  
A huge thanks to anyone helping out to make this trip unforgettable!",1,1761758901.0,travel,1,1.0,False

1ojapcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1ojapcr/the_offline_club_is_on_the_rise_thirty_euros_for/,The Offline Club is on the rise. Thirty euros for an evening of crafting without screens,"The Offline Club is on the rise. Thirty euros for an evening of crafting without screens

For those who want to be unreachable for a while, there are phone-free events. For thirty euros, visitors can hand in their phones in exchange for craft supplies. “I keep thinking I feel my phone vibrating in my pocket.”

The event, a collaboration between The Offline Club and Flow Magazine, focuses on creative expression, calm, and offline connection.

Outside the Posthoorn Church in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening, a long line had formed. Not for a church service, but for an “offline craft club.” Tonight, there’s no texting, liking, emailing, or scrolling. Upon entry, everyone hands in their phone so they can fully immerse themselves in an old-fashioned pastime: crafting with paper, markers, and scissors.

At the front of the line, near the counter where staff collect all the phones, visitors are still bent over their screens. Some send a final message or take one last photo. Then they switch to airplane mode and hand over their device. The phones are stored safely until the end of the evening.

“It feels strange,” says Australian visitor Sarah Amett (26), fidgeting with her jacket as she looks around. “I’m waiting for a friend, but I can’t tell her I’m already here.”

**Digital detox**

The Offline Club regularly organizes such gatherings, from game nights in bars to weekend retreats. The organization says it has already welcomed six thousand people for what it calls a “digital detox” — consciously stepping away from screens.

It comes at a price. Participants pay about thirty euros to attend. In return, they get access to the church, glue, paper, scissors, and stickers, plus coffee and tea served in cardboard cups.

The first forty-five minutes are spent in silence. The only sound comes from a pianist playing classical music.

According to behavioral researcher Cynthia Dekker of the University of Amsterdam, it’s not surprising that people are willing to pay for an evening without their phones. “Many people feel they spend too much time behind screens,” she says. “An evening like this, where everyone collectively decides to put their phones away, can be appealing.”

Dekker sees a broader trend: more people are actively seeking moments without screens. “People want to break bad habits. A shared offline evening makes that a bit easier than trying alone at home.”

The large church hall is lit in a club-like way, with purple and green lights coloring the walls. The evening follows a strict schedule. The first forty-five minutes pass in silence. The only sounds come from the pianist’s calm classical tunes echoing through the church, the scratch of pens, and the rustle of paper being folded. Later in the evening, conversation is encouraged. Participants are even asked to sit next to someone they don’t know.

“I actually want to take a photo of this beautiful church,” says Marie Loosen (30) as she folds an envelope and slips in a handwritten note. The Amsterdam native wants to better limit her screen time. “This morning I woke up and immediately checked my email.”

Social media apps cleverly exploit the brain’s reward system. Studies show that every like or notification triggers a small dopamine spike, prompting users to reach for their phones again.

Loosen isn’t the only one struggling with the lure of modern technology. In the Netherlands, 60 percent of young adults (16–25) say they spend too much time behind screens, according to research by the Trimbos Institute. Another study, by the Network for Media Literacy, found that a quarter of all adults consider their screen use “unhealthy.” Eighty-four percent said they use a screen right before sleeping, and 65 percent immediately after waking up.

That restlessness doesn’t completely disappear during crafting. “I keep thinking my phone is vibrating in my pocket,” says Menno Hartman (54). “I find it challenging to put my phone away,” he adds, as he glues tulip pictures onto a sheet of paper. Across from him sits his daughter, Bloem (21), who recently deleted all her social media. “It made me unhappy and insecure, so I thought, whatever, I’ll just delete it.”

Why can’t they just do the same at home and craft together without their phones? “You wouldn’t ask an alcoholic if he could just drink a little less, would you?” Hartman says half-jokingly.

**Tips for reducing screen time**

1. Set your phone screen to grayscale. Without color, stimuli are weaker, which helps prevent mindless scrolling.
2. Disable personalization in social media apps. This makes algorithms less effective at feeding your interests, reducing endless content loops.
3. Turn off notifications. Constant pings are distracting. Without them, the urge to check your phone decreases.
4. Keep practicing. There’s no quick fix: becoming less dependent on your phone takes time. Try leaving your phone after 8 p.m., or engage in hobbies without keeping it in your pocket.",2,1761758640.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False
1ojapap,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ojapap/2_weeks_without_coffee_and_my_ibs_is_cured/,2 weeks without coffee and my ibs is cured,"So basically I quit coffee two weeks ago after 8 years of consumption. 4 Days on decaf then no coffein at all to this day. 
The following days I was constipated but it lasted 2 days. I took liquid parafin to ease the constipation. Now In the morning I drink 2 big glasses of warm water. 

Pros: 
The pain on my right lower side of my abdomen (right illiac fossa) is 99% less painful. Not pain at all some days. This pain was intense back then, I'm talking staying at home with a pack of ice on my belly.  
My poop are no longer liquid, it used to desintegrate in the toilet water. Now it's a well formed consistent poop.
I dont feel heartburns anymore.
I dont pee 24/7 and I feel my thirst signal more.
This feeling of constently having poop in my ascending colon vanished as well.
I have a deep sleep and a lot of dreams (on coffee I often had insomnia and no dreas at all, light sleep I'd say).
I feel less anxious and overwhelmed. 

Downsides: 
I can't eat trash food cause it really constipates me wheareas when I was on coffein I would take a dump regardless on what I ate.
I feel like I'm more hungry. 
After a poor night of sleep I feel really tired the next day whereas coffee masked this tireness. 

Conclusion: 
I am never going back to coffee. This stuff is straight poison for my gut. I feel like 99% of my ibs symptoms are gone. This is like living a new life for real.

So I wrote a samlple story and hoping for some expert feedbacks!!"," So, is there some things i need to improve? Things i need to avoid? Things i lack?


I woke up drenched in sweat, the mat I was sleeping on completely soaked.
""Who the hell turned off the ceiling fan?"" 

My brows pinched together, carving a deep line between my eyes.

I glanced at the wall clock, above the door. ""Crap! Eleven already?"" My eyes widened and hurried out of bed.

I bounded down the stairs two at a time, almost tripping as I skimmed the banister.

At the dining area, I saw Grandma at the table, already eating lunch. 

Meanwhile, I was still wiping the crust out of my eyes.
""Good morning."" I greeted her with a smile.

""Good morning! Wow, you woke up so early."" The corner of her mouth curled, before stuffing a spoonful of rice in.

I chuckled, grabbing a plate and spoon, before answering. ""Sorry, I was up late last night because-"". 

My lips parted, but I pressed it shut. ""I saw this ad on my phone—its about a university. I might've ended up reading about them all night.""

I scooped rice from the rice bowl onto my plate. The dish was dried fish and instant noodles. Simple, but dang, it smells good

""Is that so?"" taking a sip of her coffee. ""So you're interested in going to college, huh?""

""You know, you could just fish like your grandfather. After all, you've already graduated in high school,"" She added, finishing her meal.

I sat on the wooden chair beside grandma, and shakes my head. ""But, Ma. I want to continue my studies and finish college. You know, it is my dream to be a lawyer.""

""I know—Grandpa and you are content with our simple living, but-"" I paused, glancing at the framed photo of Mom and Dad hanging on the wall, before looking back at her.

""-if I can manage, I'll give you the best life I can provide. You and Grandpa deserve it, I can never thank you enough for raising me and Neil-"" eyes darting back to the frame.

""-even though Mom and Dad passed away so early-"" I looked back to Grandma. ""Even though we were so young that time, but you still raised us with care.""

Before I knew it, Grandma's eyes had welled up with tears, as my vision blurred with water.

""What's going on here? Are you two crying?"" suddenly a voice came behind us.

I turned around and saw Neil, my elder brother, standing by the doorway. His clothes stained and soaked with sweat, carrying with him the salty smell of the sea.

""Crying? Me? No way! Grandma's the one getting all dramatic!""

Neil raised a brow, and a mischievous smile playing in his lips. 

""What? Did we win the lottery? Heck yeah! Count me in I'll cry too."" A grin played on his lips while peeling off his long-sleeved shirt. 

Grandma and I chuckled, our shoulders trembling in each breath. ""Anyways, what took you so long? You came home late, its almost noon,"" her tone was soft, as she wiped her tears away. ""And where's your grandfather?""

""It took us time. We caught a lot of fish today, and filled up several buckets. Actually, Grandpa's still sorting through the rest,"" Neil replied with a grin, hanging his long sleeve shirt on a make-shift clothes line.

Grandma nods solemnly, there's a satisfied smile playing in her lips, as she sets her plate aside. ""Tell him to come home for lunch, so he can rest early. There's still dried fish and noodles left for you two.""

But before Neil could even answer, Grandpa appeared at the door, carrying buckets heavy with fish, one in both hands. 

I could see the strain on him from the weight, how his arms veined and trembled.

Neil quickly rushed over to help lift the bucket. ""I got this, Gramps."" and Grandpa let him take it with a nod.

""Thanks, son,"" Grandpa exhales from exhaustion, his face red from the heat, and sweat dripping down his temples. ""It's scorching hot today. Give me some water, please.""

I hurried from my seat, and grabbed a glass from the dish rack. I filled it with mineral water from the old dispenser, and quickly handed it to him.

""Thanks,"" He quickly drank and emptied the cup with a few gulps. He exhaled deeply, before speaking. ""What a tiring morning.""

Grandpa sat on the bench to rest and removed his cap, setting it beside him, before looking at me.

His palms were rough, those skin cracked from years of hauling nets. 

I caught myself staring at them, those hands that had carried our family long before mine could even hold a pencil.

""You've been quiet, son-"" Grandpa said, his voice rasped but steady. ""Whats on your mind?""

I scratched the back of my head ""Actually, Pa— there's something I need to tell you."" 

I felt my tonque got heavier, as I dragged the words out of my mouth. ""I registered for a scholarship, and I just found out that I was accepted. I'm g-going to college."" I staggered in the last sentences.

Grandpa leaned back on the bench, studying me. For a moment, he didn't say a word, he just breathed, slow and tired, as if weighing every syllable before letting it go.

I was staring at the floor, I couldn't look at grandpa's eyes. ""Sorry pa, I-"" I closed my eyes for a moment and sighed. ""-I should have told you earlier.""

Finally, he smiled faintly. ""Why do you sound like you're confessing a crime?""

Heat crept up my neck. ""I just— I don't wan't to disappoint you.""

""Disappoint me?"" He chuckled, shaking his head. 

His eyes drifted to the high school diploma with the multiple medals hanging and pinned on the wall, before looking back to me. This time, his gaze was sharp and steady.

""Son, your Grandma and I only reached elementary, your brother gave up school to help me fish. But you-"" 

His hand landed on my shoulder, it's firm, callused, and warm. ""-you've got a chance we never did. So take it, son. Grab it with both hands and don't let it go.""

His voice deepened. ""You won't always be young. If an opportunity comes, don't waste it and make it yours.""

I swallowed hard, and felt my chest tightening as Grandpa's words struck me.

For a second, I wanted to tell him everything, that I wasn't doing this just for me, but for him, for Grandma, for all of us. But my throat locked up, and all I could do was nod.

""Im proud of you, Son."" His voice was low and soft.

That hit me like a bullet, those simple words—I rarely hear from him.

But I simply smiled, a genuine easy smile that reached my eyes, I wanted to say something, but no words came out. 

From the backyard, Grandma's voice cut through. ""Boy! Get ready! We're going!""

I blinked, tearing my eyes from Grandpa. The words I wanted to say slipped away with the sound of her call.

""Coming, Grandma! Wait a sec!"" I shouted back. ""Crap! its time already"". I whispered to myself, scratching my neck, before glancing back to Grandpa. ""I gotta go pa,"".

Grandpa chuckled, each bursts are light. ""Alright, son. Take care on the road, okay? Drive safe."" His tone was calm as he leaned back on the bench with a tired sigh. ""I'll rest here for a while.""

I nodded. ""Okay, Pa. Rest well."" I got up my seat and headed upstairs. 

On my way, my mind kept replaying the words Grandpa said to me, the heavy feeling finally lifted.

Upstairs, the mirror caught me, and I froze. My dark hair was stuck out in every direction, it was a total mess. 

so I grabbed the comb off the cabinet and dragged it through, wincing at the knots.

""Man, my hair's growing fast."" I watched my reflection frown back at me. ""I should get a cut soon""

After one last swish, I set the comb back and opened the cabinet, rummaging through for something to wear.

""What should I wear—"" Digging through my clothes. ""Maybe something like a long-sleeve? Since the weather's scorching hot. Gotta protect my flawless skin, It doesn't need to get any clearer""

After a bit of searching, I found a white long sleeve and paired it with snow camo shorts.

I checked myself again in the mirror. ""Alright, I look hot enough,"" Smirking  at my reflection like a freak. 

""No way Jonna won't notice with how sexy I am now."" A cocky grin painted on my face.

After one last shameless glance at the mirror, I grabbed my white cap and the keys of the cab before heading downstairs.

When I reached the back of the house, Grandma was already waiting by the cab, fanning herself with a handkerchief. 

My brother was loading fish into the cooler to keep them fresh, which explained why the whole place smelled like the sea.

""Took you long enough,"" Grandma was frowning, and her arms are crossed.

""Sorry, Ma,"" I replied, scratching my dark hair. ""I just spent a while picking what to wear.""

""And why bother change clothes? We're just delivering these fishes to the market."" She raised a brow at me.

""He's trying to impress Jonna!"" my brother cut in, walking over with a smug. His shirt was damp, probably from hauling the heavy coolers.

""Gross."" I let out a single laugh, but I felt my cheeks getting warm.""D-don't even start."" My voice came out a little louder than I meant.

""Ha! I knew it! You're blushing!"" His grin widened as he shook his head. 

""It's written all over your fucking face!"" His smile faded for a beat, and stared at me—then his grin came back wider. ""I gotta tell Jonna!""

I gasp in surprise ""Dont you dare"" My was voice low and sharp.

""Oh stop it, both of you,"" Grandma cuts in on our banter, biting her lip to hide a laugh, but eyes betrayed the amusement. 

""Come on now, we need to get these fish to the market. They won't sell themselves."" She waved us toward the cab.

I quickly followed, slipping into the driver's seat. Grandma settled beside me, and my brother hopped onto the back. I slid the key into the ignition and the engine roared to life.

I pressed the clutch, shifted the stick into gear, and the tires rolled forward with a crunch against the gravel. 

The wheel resisted for a heartbeat before giving way, guiding the cab on the road as the sound of the engine steadied into a growl.

As I drove the cab down the coutry road, I let myself enjoy the scenery around me.

On the right, even under the blinding noon sun, the sea was breathtaking. 

The coastline stretched far, dotted with small fishing boats, children splashing in the waves despite the heat, and the salty air of the seaside filling the cab.

Life here was simple. People weren't rich, but they were happy. I could imagine spending my whole life here and still be content.

But—what would it feel like to go to college? To graduate? To reach the dreams I keep holding onto?

""Grandma-"" I broke the long silence, but eyes locked on the road. ""Remember what I said earlier? that 'all-night, reading about a university'?""

Grandma nods. ""Yeah? What about it?"" Her voice was calm as her gaze resting by the window, enjoying the view.

""The truth is-"" My voice dip low, each word dragging out like it weight a ton. ""I didn't really just—read, I-""

""-Actually, I registered for a scholarship"" The words hung heavy in the air. ""And—I got accepted.""

Grandma didn't respond, her gaze still resting by the window, looking at the beautiful scenery passing by.

""Grandma—"" My voice softer. ""is there a college here in the province?"" I asked hoping that there may be an alternative, that I dont need to go out of town. I leaned back in my seat, tapping the steering wheel with two fingers.

""From what I know, Noy—there isnt"" Her tone was steady, like a ticking clock. Eyes still fixed outside but her shoulders slacked

""Oh, really? Then where do the young people here study college?"" Tapping my fingers against the steering wheel, eyes forward.

""Most don't,"" Her tone was soft as silk, still looking out the window. 

""You know how it is here. School doesn't matter much. Fishing and farming, that's how we live.""

My grip on the wheel tightened. ""Thats bullshit."" I said voice low, but sharp.

""What if I'm not content with this life? What if I want to make things better? I've always told you, I want to give you more, more than what we have now."" 

A pause lingered as I bit my lip and let out a sigh. ""Does that make me—ungrateful?"" I glanced at her, before I focused my eyes back on the road.

Slowly, Grandma turned to me, her eyes locking onto mine. 

""You do understand what that means, right?"" There's a pause before shifting her gaze back to the road.

""It means sacrifices. It means leaving the province, going to the city—being far away-"" 

She looked at me again with a steady gaze, but there's a flicker of unease in her eyes. ""Far from us.""

I looked straight ahead. ""I know, Ma. But, for a better future? I'm willing to risk it, even if it means being away from you for a while."" 

I gave her are reassuring smile, reaching for her hand and held it gently.

""Few years away from home isn't that long. I'll come back every summer, you won't even miss me that much."" I steered carefully through a curve.

""Besides, nothing's certain yet. There's a big chance I'll end up stuck here with you guys for life."" I let out a chuckle but it sounded more like a single cough.

Grandma didn't reply. She just smiled faintly, turned back to face the window, letting the passing fields keep her company.

Not even half an hour passed, but the scenery had shifted. The blue of the sea gave way to the greens of the mountains. 

The road was wide and empty, no traffic, no other vehicles, only the stillness of the province.

On my left, golden fields shimmered under the noon sun, farmers tending to cattle, and kids running barefoot through the grass. 

The salty air of the coast was replaced by the fresh, earthy scent of the highlands.

That meant we were close. Close to the next town. Close to the market.

Jonna suddenly crosses my mind, and with that, I felt butterflies dancing in my stomach.

It made me smile ""Jonna.."" I said out loud.

""What did you say?""

My eyes widened, and my chest lurched, for a moment, I lost control of the wheel.

When I looked at her, she was raising her brows, though her eyes carried a playful gleam.

My heart—racing from the scare. ""Ma, don't do that! We almost crashed!"" I blurted as my voice cracking at the end.

She burst out laughing, shaking her head. ""So that's what's making you smile out of knowhere, huh?""

""Smile? what smile? im not smiling!"" Yet, still I couldn't help but smile, watching her laugh. As the warmth in the cab returned.

Looking ahead, I spotted some small cluster of houses and buildings in the distance. 

The town of Poblacion, the closest thing we had to a city. The only place here that felt even a little urban.

I pressed harder on the pedal, as the almost empty road letting me speed up. 

The quiet chirping of birds gave way to the hum of engines and the chatter of people. The buzz of town life.

Through the window, the market came into view, bustling with life. I turned the cab into a side street and parked behind the stalls. 

The noise grew louder, there are vendors calling, customers bargaining, the normal chaos of a regular day.

I twisted the key, and the engine gave one last growl before dying into silence.

Grandma stepped out first, closing the door behind her. 

I followed, and the air of the market immediately hit me, fresh fish, raw meat, vegetables, fruits, all their scents mixing at once.

Neil was already unloading the coolers from the cab, while Grandma was quickly greeted by Mrs. Joanne.

I should've helped Neil, but my mind wandered elsewhere.

I scanned the crowd, searching every corner of the market, every passerby. But she wasn't there.

""Damn—where is she?"" I muttered, scratching the back of my neck. ""Wasted this outfit for nothing.""

""Wasted what?""

A voice came from behind. A girl's voice.

My shoulders jolted, Feeling my lungs froze like I'd forgotten how to breathe.

I didn't need to turn to know who it was. The voice alone gave it away.

Still, I turned.

And I wasn't mistaken.

It was her.

It was Jonna.

I’ve seen a lot of questions from people planning Kyoto like “Is the Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art worth a stop?”, “How long do I need there?”, “What else is within walking distance so I don’t waste time on buses?” This post is a focused half-day itinerary (morning to afternoon) in Kyoto’s Okazaki / Higashiyama area built around the Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art. It’s designed so you see art, shrine architecture, classic Kyoto scenery, and a temple walk without zig-zagging across the city.



This loop fits easily into a Kyoto stay and doesn’t require a JR Pass, just normal subway/bus/walking. The area is compact: the museum, Heian Shrine, Okazaki Park, and the Lake Biwa Canal are all next to each other, and Nanzen-ji Temple and the Philosopher’s Path are a walkable continuation to the south/east.



What is the Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art?

The Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art (京都市京セラ美術館) is Kyoto’s main municipal art museum. The original building dates back to 1933, making it one of the oldest surviving public art museum buildings in Japan. The building style mixes early 20th-century “imperial crown” architecture with Kyoto civic pride. The museum was fully renovated and reopened in 2020: they kept the historic exterior and added modern glass-and-concrete wings, more open public space, and better accessibility.



The museum collection covers Kyoto-style Nihonga (traditional Japanese painting), Western-style oil painting, crafts, sculpture, and contemporary work from the late 19th century onward. On top of that, there are rotating special exhibitions, including pop culture and design shows. Most travelers end up seeing one of these headline exhibitions in the newer wings.



Location-wise, it sits in Okazaki Park in eastern Kyoto, right by the giant orange torii gate of Heian Shrine and near the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto. It’s about an 8-minute walk from Higashiyama Station on the Tozai Subway Line, or you can take a Kyoto City Bus (for example Route 5 from Kyoto Station) and get off at “Okazaki Park / Museum of Art / Heian Shrine-mae.”



Is it worth going? And for who?

Short version: yes, if you like art, architecture, or calm indoor spaces. It’s a great “non-temple” thing to do in Kyoto.



Longer version:

– If you like modern and contemporary art, craft, design, illustration, or character / pop culture shows (not only Buddhist statues and temple gardens), this gives you that Kyoto creative side without needing to go to Tokyo.

– If you’re into architecture or photography: the museum is great for photos. You’ve got a 1930s civic building plus a very clean modern renovation with glass reflections, a sunken plaza, and views toward the park and canal.

– If you’re traveling with family: it’s indoors, climate-controlled, mostly flat, stroller-friendly in the public areas, and has bathrooms and seating. Compared to dragging everyone through multiple temple staircases first thing in the morning, this is a pretty gentle start.

– If you’re on a tight Kyoto schedule: you can combine this museum with Heian Shrine, Nanzen-ji, and the Philosopher’s Path all in one walking loop. You don’t have to crisscross town.



Is it crowded?

Crowding really depends on the current special exhibition. A big-name limited show (for example, famous contemporary artists or pop culture collaborations) can get busy on weekends and holidays. On normal weekdays it’s much calmer than Kyoto’s “must-see temples.” The building has wide halls and multiple wings, so it rarely feels as crushed as Fushimi Inari at peak time.



Most people spend around 60–90 minutes in a special exhibition, plus extra time for the museum shop and café. Many travelers use this as a late-morning or rainy-day stop.



Typical hours are 10:00–18:00, with last admission around 17:30. The museum is usually closed on Mondays. If Monday is a national holiday, they open on Monday and close the next non-holiday weekday instead. Keep that in mind if you’re doing Kyoto on a Monday.



Where to get tickets

Important detail: there isn’t always “one” museum ticket. Admission is set per exhibition. The big temporary shows in the newer wings have their own ticket price. The Collection Room (permanent collection highlights) may have its own pricing. Sometimes very popular exhibitions use timed tickets.



For most normal days you can just buy tickets at the counter and pay by card. For weekends or holiday seasons with hyped shows, try to go right at opening (10:00 entry) or late afternoon (\~16:00 and later) when day-trippers start leaving.



Facilities

– Lockers / luggage: There are coin lockers at/near the entrance. You can stash backpacks or even a small suitcase so you’re not dragging it around all day.

– Food / coffee: The on-site café/restaurant “ENFUSE” serves Kyoto-style plates, sandwiches with local ingredients, sweets, coffee, and even some alcoholic drinks. You can get things to-go and eat in Okazaki Park or by the canal if the weather is good. It typically opens around 10:30 and runs into the early evening, slightly later than the galleries.

– Shop: The museum store (“ART RECTANGLE KYOTO”) focuses on design-forward Kyoto souvenirs: exhibition merch, craft goods, stationery, sweets. It’s nicer than generic souvenir stands and is a good place to buy gifts.

– Accessibility: The 2020 renovation added elevators, barrier-free restrooms (including multipurpose and nursing room), ramps, and seating areas. You don’t have to handle lots of stairs to see the main spaces.

– Getting there: From Kyoto Station, you can bus (for example, City Bus Route 5) to “Okazaki Park / Museum of Art / Heian Shrine-mae,” or take the Tozai Subway Line to Higashiyama Station and walk about 8 minutes.



Now, here’s the actual sample half-day plan built around the museum.



Morning: Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art (10:00–12:00)

Who this is best for: travelers who want to start the day with indoor culture (art / design / architecture) instead of jumping straight into temple crowds.



Time spent: about 1.5–2 hours is normal, depending on how deep you go into the exhibitions, whether you check the shop, and whether you sit down for coffee or lunch at ENFUSE afterward.



When to go: aim to be outside the museum a few minutes before it opens at 10:00. Benefits:

– You’re in the first wave, so it’s easier to move through the headline exhibition without weekend crowds.

– You can take clean photos of the building’s facade and courtyard before too many people are in your shot.

– In hot months, you’re inside (air conditioning) during the late-morning heat.



What to do:



1. See the main special exhibition (often in the Higashiyama Cube or North Wing). These are usually what people come for.

2. If open, walk the collection / permanent galleries to see how Kyoto artists blended traditional aesthetics and Western techniques from the Meiji period onward. This gives you context for all the art motifs you’ll see later in temples and shops.

3. Hit the café (ENFUSE). They do Kyoto-ingredient lunch plates, sandwiches, desserts, coffee. You can also buy something to-go for a mini picnic later in Okazaki Park or along the canal.



Pro tip: Use the museum lockers now. Drop anything heavy (coats, spare camera lenses, small suitcase) before you start walking to shrines and temples. You’ll thank yourself later.



Midday: Heian Shrine and Okazaki Park (12:15–13:30)

Who this is best for: people who want that “Kyoto shrine gate photo” and a big open courtyard without having to go across town.



Time spent: about 45–60 minutes including photos, walking through Okazaki Park, and a quick bite.



When to go: right after the museum, late morning into early afternoon.



What it’s like:

From the museum, walk through Okazaki Park toward the huge vermilion torii gate and Heian Shrine (平安神宮). The shrine complex was built in 1895 to commemorate the 1100th anniversary of Kyoto’s founding as Japan’s capital (back when it was called Heian-kyō). The layout is based on the old imperial palace style: wide stone courtyards, bright orange and green buildings, long corridors, and beautiful formal gardens with ponds. In spring, the gardens are known for their blossoms; in autumn, reflections on the water can be gorgeous.



Why this belongs in the loop:

– You go from “Kyoto as an art city in 2025” to “Kyoto as imperial capital” in about five minutes of walking.

– You’re still in the same cultural zone. The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto is basically next door if you’re a hardcore art person and want even more.

– Okazaki Park and the Lake Biwa Canal run through this area, so you can actually sit and eat what you grabbed from the museum café without needing to hunt for a restaurant immediately.



Lunch can be either a sit-down meal back at ENFUSE (indoor seating, good if you want air conditioning/heating and restrooms), or something light eaten in the park if the weather is good.



Afternoon: Nanzen-ji Temple and the Philosopher’s Path (13:30–16:30)

Who this is best for: travelers who want the “classic Kyoto temple + scenic walk under trees” experience without getting on another train.



Time spent: about 2–3 hours depending on your walking speed and how often you stop.



When to go: early afternoon is perfect. Nanzen-ji’s paid areas generally close by late afternoon (around 17:00 in most seasons, a little earlier in winter), so you want at least an hour of daylight there. The Philosopher’s Path itself is an outdoor canal walk, so you can continue toward sunset.



How to get there from Okazaki Park / Heian Shrine:

Walk southeast along the canal toward Nanzen-ji. It’s roughly 15–20 minutes on foot. You’ll know you’re close when you see the famous red-brick aqueduct arches (part of the historic Lake Biwa Canal) running through the temple grounds.



What to do at Nanzen-ji:

– Check out the massive Sanmon gate (a huge wooden gate you can walk under; sometimes you can pay to climb up for a city view).

– See the brick aqueduct. It’s one of Kyoto’s most photographed backdrops, and it’s a cool mix of Meiji-era engineering and temple grounds.

– If you have time, pay to enter the inner gardens (hojo). These are classic Zen gardens with carefully arranged rocks, ponds, and maples.



After Nanzen-ji, keep walking north along the canal. This becomes the Philosopher’s Path (哲学の道 / Tetsugaku no michi). It’s a stone path along a narrow canal lined with hundreds of cherry trees, little cafes, tiny shrines, and neighborhood cats. The walk connects the Nanzen-ji / Eikan-do area in the south toward Ginkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion) in the north. Most people spend 1–2 hours here because you keep stopping for pictures, tea, and random little temples.



Why this finishes the loop:

– Morning: modern Kyoto art, design, and architecture at the Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art

– Midday: Heian Shrine’s giant torii gate, imperial-style shrine buildings, and park / canal scenery

– Afternoon: Nanzen-ji’s Zen temple grounds, the historic aqueduct, and the Philosopher’s Path under cherry trees and maples



By the end of the Philosopher’s Path you’re near Ginkaku-ji, which is another major Kyoto sight if you still have energy. From that area you can catch a bus back to central Kyoto for dinner. If you finish a bit earlier and stay near Nanzen-ji instead, Keage Station on the Tozai Subway Line is about a 10-minute walk; from Keage you can get back toward Kyoto Station without needing a taxi.



TL;DR (how to drop this into your Kyoto plan)

09:50 Arrive at Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art in Okazaki Park

10:00–11:30 Explore the main exhibition(s), browse the shop, take building/architecture photos

11:30–12:15 Coffee or light lunch at the museum café (ENFUSE), or grab takeout

12:15–13:15 Walk through Okazaki Park to Heian Shrine, take photos under the giant vermilion torii, stroll the shrine grounds and gardens

13:30–15:00 Walk along the canal to Nanzen-ji Temple, check the Sanmon gate, aqueduct, and (if you want) paid gardens

15:00–16:30 Follow the Philosopher’s Path toward Ginkaku-ji, stopping for tea and small temples along the way, then bus back to central Kyoto or subway from Keage



This gives you:

– Indoor art and design

– A major Shinto shrine with imperial-style architecture

– A famous Zen temple complex with an iconic aqueduct

– A classic Kyoto canal walk lined with cherry trees

All in one compact slice of Kyoto, on foot, without wasting half the day commuting across the city.

A new customer just placed their first order on your site. They heard a friend mention your brand over coffee, and finally decided to buy after reading a review directly on your site.  


Your analytics platform will likely credit the sale as “Direct traffic.” However, that does not tell the full story.  


Attribution models and analytics platforms do a lot of heavy lifting, but even the smartest tracking cannot capture everything. For example, if someone hears about your brand from a friend, that influence will never appear in your analytics.  


That is where the classic “How did you hear about us?” post-purchase survey comes in. It captures those human touchpoints that tracking alone cannot see.

  
Attribution models and analytics platforms do a lot of heavy lifting, but even the smartest tracking cannot capture everything.   


# Why Post-Purchase Surveys Matter

  
When a customer completes an order, it is the perfect time to ask them what influenced their purchase. A simple question *“How did you hear about us?”* fills in the blanks that pixels and UTMs cannot.  


Here is why it matters:

  
**1. Capture the untrackable**  
Word of mouth, podcasts, influencers, or community mentions often go untracked by digital analytics. A post-purchase survey surfaces those hidden drivers of awareness that data alone cannot see.  


**2. Validate your ad spend**  
If your analytics say Meta drove the conversion but the customer says “I saw someone talk about you on TikTok,” that is a sign your tracking may be over-crediting one channel. Surveys help verify what is truly influencing behavior.  


# How ThoughtMetric Combines Surveys with Multi-Touch Attribution

  
Most brands use either self-reported survey data or attribution data. ThoughtMetric brings both together in one place.  


With ThoughtMetric’s built-in **Post-Purchase Survey**, you can easily add a “How did you hear about us?” question to your checkout flow. Once responses come in, ThoughtMetric automatically connects that data to your **multi-touch attribution model**, so you can see how survey insights align with what tracking shows.  
  
**For example:**  
If 30% of customers say they heard about you on TikTok, but your attribution data shows only 10% of conversions credited to TikTok ads, you instantly know TikTok is playing a bigger awareness role than tracking can measure.  


This combination of self-reported and behavioral data gives you the full picture.

1ojagcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1ojagcn/the_osprey_daylight_266_is_a_middle_finger_to_the/,The Osprey Daylight 26+6 is a middle finger to the overengineered bag industry,"Like most of you here, I'm guilty of owning way too many bags and spending hours researching the ""perfect"" one. But after a year with the Daylight, I realized something: it's become my entire travel system—and it only cost me $100.


This isn't a review—it's a wake-up call to all of us paying $300+ for features we don't actually need.


The Competition: My Minaal Carry-On ($300) was my go-to for week-long trips: premium hardware, built-in packing cubes, hidden passport pocket, the sleek looks. The Osprey Porter 46 handled longer hauls with its massive main compartment and the genius compression system. Both fantastic bags. Both gathering dust along with some other bags that I don't even want to talk about


The Plot Twist


Here's what hit me: despite being rated smaller, the Daylight actually carries more than the Minaal. It's very close in capacity to the Porter but takes up way less space. How? No overbuilt laptop fortress. No hip belt that you'll use exactly never. No organizational panel with seventeen pockets for items you dont own.
The Minaal and Porter have these beefy shoulder straps that add zero comfort over the Daylight's simple ones. Both can hide their straps—cool feature that I've used maybe twice. The Porter's semi-rigid shell? Unless you're literally throwing your bag off moving trains, it's overkill. The Minaal's ""revolutionary"" laptop organization? Great, now my laptop is bullet proof for all the warzones that I pass on my way to the coffee shop.


My Actual Setup
The Daylight + a folded Aer Go Pack (as a day pack) + a small sling for my headphones, tablet, and e-reader. Total weight: less than the empty Minaal. Total size: 2/3s of the Porter. This combo has handled a year of international and domestic trips, grocery runs, overnight work trips, and even motorcycle adventures. The Aer Go Pack takes up basically no space when folded but gives me a full daypack when I need it. The sling keeps my electronics accessible without digging through the main bag. It's modular without being complicated—exactly what actual travel looks like, not what Instagram told us it should look like.

The Reality Check
After all this time and money spent, I've learned that the Daylight handles 95% of my needs. It's durable enough, comfortable enough, organizes enough, and—here's the kicker—weighs practically nothing. The expandability means it works as both a carryon and daypack. No fuss, no engineered solutions to problems that don't exist.


The Bottom Line
It's not just about the money (though paying 1/3 the price is nice). It's about the fact that you're literally carrying around extra weight and bulk for features that marketing convinced you were essential. If travel is supposed to be about freedom, why are we choosing to carry the burden of someone else's marketing department and sales commissions?
Sometimes the middle finger to the industry is just... buying the simple bag that actualy works.
Next time you're eyeing that next ""ultimate travel system,"" remember: the perfect bag isn't the one with the most features—it's the one you'll actually want to carry.",22,1761758093.0,ManyBaggers,22,0.79,False

wooden cracks stitched with concrete,
plain and stiff.
Leaves are not dancing with the wind,
and crunch beneath autumn’s missteps 
The frigid air of a valley
Hidden behind a man-made cabin
Are now warm smoke
In noisy college dorms.

How easy
For trees to stop mirroring their skin
For pills to be amulets of brick
To make you an immortal being
Six feet under, stiff
Just a sword-like syringe 

The ink slips as a running river
The words click as building pavement 
The creaks linger the sound
From the love declarations of typewriters

Reopened 
Cyclical 
Shown as misunderstood jokes
In coffee shops that closed
And new forms of sugar
We won't put in our cups

One car will drive the road
And my grandma will complain
On how fresh it all was before.

1ojad40,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ojad40/i_26f_am_considering_ending_a_friendship_over_her/,I (26F) am considering ending a friendship over her (25F) BF's best friend. How can I approach this situation?,"About 9 months ago I moved back to the city I grew up in after a change of careers, its been a mix of emotions being back but its been really nice reconnecting with some school friends who I haven't seen regularly in ages. I've known my friend Jane (25F) since we were 12 years old, we were quite close in school but grew apart slightly after I moved away, but we kept in contact semi-regularly. She hasn't had much luck in the relationship department and about a year ago left a very abusive 5 year long relationship. She had recently been mentioning going on dates and being optimistic about a guy she's started seeing and told me she's a little hesitant of bringing him to meet our friend group but assured us (me and two other girls we went to school with) that he's really wonderful and we'd probably all meet soon. Honestly we were all really excited to see her so happy after what she had been through previously, I thought her wariness about bringing him to meet us because she didn't want to rush into things but as it turns out it's because we already know this guy. 

Our friend Emily (25F) was having a housewarming party and Jane brought along her BF to (re)introduce him to all of us. Her BF (who i'll call Steve) also went to school with all of us, but was in a completely different (and very popular) friend group so most of us never had too many interactions with him. Steve is a very nice guy, has a good job, seems very well put together and makes Jane very happy but the issue is he was (and still is) very close with a guy named Leo. Leo was several years older than us, and was known for throwing big house parties because his parents were often away from home. At one of these parties, Leo cornered me in a bathroom and raped me. He spread rumours about me in school and I was subsequently relentlessly bullied by my peers for being a ""slut"". When I finally had the courage to confide in my parents they shamed me, grounded me for the rest of the year, took away my phone and essentially killed my social life. My parents are south asian and very conservative so me being violently assaulted was apparently a moral failing on my part (my bad for expecting any kind of support there lol), it was a harrowing and dark time in my life and I don't think I would have made it out alive if not for the support I got in school from friends like Jane and Emily. They knew about everything I went through and did their best to protect me from the cruelty of our peers. I say this all to emphasise that what I went through was NOT a secret to them at all.

At Emily's party, I was obviously very shocked to see Steve and Jane together but I held my tongue and went in with as open of a mind as I could. It sounds stupid in hindsight, but I just told myself if Jane is vouching for this guy to the point of bringing him around than he must have grown a great deal. To his credit, Steve seems fine. We got to chatting and he *has* grown a lot from the rowdy meathead teen I knew him as before but when Emily asked him what he'd been up to since we had graduated, if he still sees anyone from school etc. he told us that he just came back from a ""boys trips reunion"" with a bunch of his old friends including Leo. In fact, him and Leo are still very close and he sees him pretty frequently. Emily shot me a quick look and Jane just laughed it off and quickly changed the subject. I felt my stomach drop and just shoved away that gnawing awful feeling that was coming back up and continued to socialise and act normal until I went home. As soon as I got back home I just couldn't stop crying, I tried my hardest to put that part of my life behind me and then all of a sudden I get thrown right back into it. I just feel really betrayed and gross but also so guilty. It's not like Jane is dating Leo or is bringing him around me, I don't necessarily have an Issue with Steve, he's never done anything wrong to me other than his proximity/closeness to someone who hurt me but Its bringing up so much old shit I had buried deep in my brain im having a hard time separating all three of them in my mind. 

Emily texted me almost immediately and told me she thought Jane was very wrong for bringing Steve around me, that she asked him those questions to see if he still associated with ""that scumbag"" and asked me if I wanted her to talk to Jane, but I honestly don't even know what to say to her at this point. I've been dodging Janes offers to hang out since the party and have made every excuse in the book to avoid being in the same room, thankfully my job is quite intensive so I've been able to just bury myself in work but I know I can't avoid this for much longer. I'm planning on reaching out to get coffee with her and just lay out how im feeling but I'm seriously worried about how she is going to take it. I'm not going to make any rash decisions before we talk it out but i've honestly been thinking about just quietly removing myself from her life in order to protect my peace, would that be wrong of me? I know both her and her BF are not the ones who hurt me directly, and although the assault was over a decade ago it feels like a tacit alignment with someone who effectively destroyed my life as a teenager.

I apologise for the rambling and how disjointed all of this is, its been really hard keeping my thoughts straight recently

1ojad1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tarantino/comments/1ojad1e/pitch_meeting_for_pulp_fiction_i_wrote/,Pitch Meeting for Pulp Fiction I wrote,"If you're not familiar with the Pitch Meeting channel on YouTube...well you should be! [https://www.youtube.com/@PitchMeetings](https://www.youtube.com/@PitchMeetings)

Unfortunately Ryan George (creator) has slowed down notably because he's dealing with family issues and it sounds like may be taking a break from all of his channels because of personal tragedy recently, but the archives are still there and hilarious.

So here's one I wrote for Pulp Fiction:

Producer: So you got a movie for me?

Writer: Yes sir I do, it's called ""Pulp Fiction"".

P: Interesting title, it doesn't really tell us much about what the movie's about.

W: No it doesn't, and I bet you still won't even know what the movie is about after I explain it to you!

P: Oh well go ahead!

W: So you see it opens with a scene of this couple talking in a diner. They have British accents so you expect them to be sophisticated, but it actually subverts your expectations because they're not and are just petty crooks.

P: Oh and so are they talking about planning a heist or something?

W: No, they're just complaining about how it's hard now and how other heists have gone. But then they do get this idea that they could just rob the diner and wonder why no one robs restaurants.

P: I can think of plenty of reasons. There's too many entrances and exists, anyone in the restaurant could also be packing, it would attract a lot of attention outside...

W: Well they don't realize that. They just come up with the idea, talk about it for like 30 seconds, and then decide to do it, and the robbery starts.

P: Well at least seeing the robbery scene might be pretty cool.

W: It will be! ....except we won't see it then. The scene will stop as soon as they announced the robbery and then you get to sit through 5 minutes opening credits.

P: Oh, well do we at least get to see the robbery after the credits?

W: Oh no. See we're going to jump to these two completely unrelated characters, two hitmen driving to a job and we listen to their conversation.

P: So they're talking about the job they're about to do.

W: No, they're talking about the names of fast food in France!

P: Is this supposed to keep the audience engaged and be interesting?

W: It is interesting! See one points out that because they use the metric system a quarter pounder with cheese isn't called that there, it's called a ""royale with cheese"" instead. Isn't that so interesting?

P: Not really.

W: Well anyway when they get to the site they load up guns and then go up to the apartment and they're talking about giving foot massages.

P: Should they be quiet and trying to keep a low profile? That seems like what hitmen would do.

W: I never said they were good hitmen. Anyway they get into the apartment and they find these guys sitting around eating burgers. And you see that gives them an opportunity to point out the royale with cheese thing to them, so that bit paid off!

P: I don't think people care too much about talking about burgers in a movie about hitmen.

W: Well don't worry because that doesn't last long. You see one of them grabs this briefcase that is what they came there for, while the other one just kind of threatens the other guys.

P: Couldn't they just leave now that they have what they came for?

W: Yes but they won't.

P: Why?

W: Because.

P: That works.

W: So anyway the other guy is talking to a guy at the table who's getting really nervous and apologizes for stealing this case from a guy named Marcellus Wallace. So the hitman starts yelling at him and asking him if he can speak English and waves a gun in his face. And then he tells him to describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.

P: Is there a point to him doing this?

W: Oh there is. See a bit after it he preaches this Bible verse to him.

P: So he came there to give him a sermon.

W: Well sort of. The Bible verse isn't even real, it was just made up for the movie. Anyway after that both hitmen shoot him.

P: Couldn't they have just done that without all of this talk?

W: Maybe but it'll be way cooler this way?

P: It's much cooler to first hear guys talk about burgers and yell asking what a character the audience hasn't seen yet looks like and preach a fictional Bible verse?

W: That's what we're going with. Anyway after this we see a scene where the hitmen are giving the briefcase to that Marcellus Wallace guy we mentioned earlier. Except they're wearing shorts and t-shirts instead of the suits we saw them in earlier, so that shows that something happened in the middle! See we're keeping the audience interested.

P: Over a clothing change?

W: Yep! And when they're there Marcellus Wallace is talking to this boxer and it looks like he's bribing him to take a dive.

P: Hey didn't you mention they turn over the briefcase to him? Does it show what's in it?

W: No.

P: Oh, well what is in it?

W: *I don't know.*

P: So you don't show it even later.

W: Nope.

P: I think the audience probably will care more about what's in the briefcase instead of why those characters changed their clothes.

W: Well then I would have to actually think of something to put in it, and that's too much work.

P: Fair enough.

W: Anyway we now go back to one of the hitmen from earlier, Vince. You see Marcellus is leaving town so he wants him to take his wife out and keep her entertained. So we show a scene of him buying heroin from his dealer, and then he meets her.

P: Oh and what's her deal?

W: Well they talked about her in the earlier scene, she's an aspiring actress. Although so far the only role she got was in a TV pilot. And because someone in the audience might know what that is we'll have Vince say he doesn't know because he doesn't watch TV, so it has be explained to him.

P: So what do they do?

W: They go to this 50s themed diner and then do a twist contest, and they win the trophy. Oh and the woman orders a milkshake and Vince is shocked it costs $5.

P: Well that is a pretty expensive milkshake!

W: Indeed it is! And it's not like 30 years from now people watching the movie will think that's actually standard price for one now or anything.

P: Oh no definitely no.

W: Anyway they get back to Marcellus' home, and then his wife decides to snort cocaine as she likes to do. Except she mistakes the heroin Vince has for cocaine, so she passes out and almost ODs.

P: Oh no!

W: Yeah, so of course Vince panics, and he drives her quick to the dealer because of course he can't take her to a hospital.

P: So he just hopes the dealer has something to revive her?

W: Yep, but luckily he does! He gives her an adrenaline shot and she just instantly revives and is all good again!

P: Pretty sure that's not how a heroin OD works. She'd still have to go to the hospital and be monitored until it's all clear from her body, and that could even take days.

W: Whoops!

P: Whoopsie!

W: So anyway he takes her back to the house, she agrees not to tell Marcellus about it, but she does tell him this lame joke she mentioned earlier at the restaurant from the pilot she was in but refused to tell.

P: You could probably cut this movie's length in half if you just cut out mundane stuff like this probably.

W: Well things are going to get good now. See remember that boxer we mentioned earlier? Well his name is Butch and we now get a flashback to him as a young boy.

P: Oh and what happens?

W: Well this Vietnam veteran who was in a prison camp with his father shows up, and gives him this really long monologue about a family heirloom of a gold watch that his father stuck in his butt in Vietnam to keep safe.

P: Uh....

W: Yeah and now he gives it to the kid. Isn't that dramatic?

P: More just weird.

W: Well then it cuts to the adult version of him. And then we see after the boxing match. See he didn't take a dive, he just took the bribe money and then bet it on himself. And he won the match, in fact he actually killed the other guy in the ring!

P: Wow that might traumatize him a bit.

W: Nah he seems totally fine with it.

P: So...he's basically a sociopath?

W: Maybe. We also show him this taxi ride he takes from the match. And the taxi driver is this woman who recognizes him and keeps asking him what it's like to kill a man.

P: She's not appalled or anything?

W: Nah just curious. Although he doesn't really answer. So anyway he gets to his hotel and meets his girlfriend.

P: And what's she like?

W: Well she has a European accent and just babbles about weird stuff mostly. Like how she wishes she had a pot belly because that's sexy.

P: I don't think most people think that.

W: Well she's pretty strange! Anyway we find out she packed everything but forgot the watch.

P: So she forgot the most important thing?

W: Yep.

P: Why didn't he just keep the watch in his bag he took to the match or have her keep it in her purse or something?

W: So the movie can happen.

P: Fair enough.

W: So Butch goes back to his apartment even though he knows Marcellus and his men may be there waiting for him to get his watch.

P: Oh it's probably going to be tough for him to get the watch back!

W: Actually it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

P: Oh really?

W: Yep. He just walks into his apartment and finds the watch on a cat-shaped lamp and grabs it.

P: That seems a bit anti-climatic.

W: Well then he also decides to make pop-tarts in his toaster instead of just leaving.

P: That doesn't seem like something someone would do normally.

W: No, but then he finds a gun on the counter. You see that Vince guy from earlier is there, but he's in the bathroom and just left his gun there.

P: Why didn't he take in with him?

W: Because he didn't. So then he gets out and Butch uses the gun to shoot and kill him!

P: Wow wow wow wow wow...wow.

W: Then Butch leaves...and when he's driving away runs into none other than Marcellus Wallace! See he was at the apartment with Vince but left and is now coming back.

P: Why'd he leave?

W: To get donuts!

P: That works.

W: And so the two fight, and Butch crashes his car and they both end up in a pawn shop. And then the owner there just pulls out a shotgun and takes them both prisoner.

P: You know I think that police attention would've been attracted by now with everything that has gone on so far.

W: Well I guess a lot of the police called in sick today or something. Anyway the pawn shop owner has them tied up in the basement and he calls over this guy named Zed. And then Zed and the pawn shop owner decide they're going to abuse Marcellus first, so they ask they guy they call ""the gimp"" all dressed in latex to watch over Butch.

P: This all happens in the basement of some random pawn shop they just ended up in by accident?

W: That's what we're going with. But you see Butch is able to escape and knock out the gimp. And when he gets upstairs he decides he's going back to rescue Marcellus.

P: He's going to rescue the guy who was trying to kill him just a few minutes earlier?

W: Yep. So he looks around the shop for a weapon and eventually decides to use a Japanese katana.

P: Why is there a katana just hanging around in the open?

W: Well it is a pawn shop, you know all sorts of stuff you can find there!

P: I'm pretty sure I've never seen a katana in a pawn shop, no, I don't believe it's a commonly found item in them.

W: Well this one does! Anyway Butch goes downstairs and cuts up the owner and frees Marcellus who takes the shotgun and shoots Zed. And then Marcellus promises to let Butch go as long as he tells no one else about this and never returns to Los Angeles.

P: Going to be kind of hard for him to explain to all of his hitmen and underlings why he's not seeking Butch anymore if he's not going to talk about what happened.

W: Yeah but that happens off screen so we don't need to worry about it. Anyway Zed drove up to the shop on a chopper.

P: Interesting terminology.

W: And because Butch wrecked his car he gets back to the hotel by stealing Zed's keys and driving the chopper back to pick up his girlfriend, and now they have to hurry quick to get to the train station they have a ticket for. And his girlfriend asks whose motorcycle this is, and Butch tells her it's not a motorcycle it's a chopper.

P: I don't think that type of pedantry would be his priority right now....also wouldn't that be like saying ""this isn't a car, it's a Ferrari""? A chopper is a type of motorcycle.

W: Not to Butch. But then she just asks whose chopper it is and Butch says it's Zed's, and when she asks who Zed he is he replies ""Zed's dead baby. Zed's dead.""

P: That raises more questions than it answers.

W: Yeah but it's a cool line! Anyway we now cut back to the scene from the hitmen in the apartment earlier. And you see it turns out there was another guy hiding in another room who hears the gunshots and he also has a gun.

P: Oh no!

W: Yeah and he shoots at the hitmen but every shot misses! And then they just look confused for a second and then they return fire. So they're in the car now driving off with their informant from the apartment. And the other hitman who is named Jules is convinced they were saved by divine intervention, but Vince is skeptical. Like Vince is talking about how he once was watching Cops and saw a guy shoot at the cops a bunch like that at close range and every shot still missed.

P: I thought Vince said earlier he doesn't watch TV.

W: Whoops!

P: Whoopsie!

W: So Vince decides to ask the informant they had in the back seat what he thinks it is, but he does this while casually waving his gun around and pointing it at that guy in the backseat.

P: That seems careless.

W: It does and it is because they hit a bump and then he shoots the guy in the back accidentally.

P: Oh no!

W: So now the car is covered in blood and parts of his brain and skull, so they have to ditch it. So Jules says he knows a guy in the area and they pull up to his place. And by the way this guy is going to be played by the director and the guy who really wrote this movie.

P: And what's his deal?

W: He says the n word a lot.

P: That's it?

W: Well and he also buys good coffee apparently. Also his wife is a nurse that works the graveyard shift and it's early morning and she's almost off so they need to get rid of the messy car and their clothes before then.

P: Oh wow it's going to be pretty hard for them to get rid of all that stuff quickly.

W: Actually it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

P: Oh really?

W: Yep, they just call a guy and he comes over and cleans it up.

P: That's it?

W: Yep, they just call this guy up and it shows that he's at some sort of like cocktail party but he says he can be over there in ten minutes.

P: Didn't you just say it's the early morning? What sort of cocktail party is happening then?

W: *I don't know.*

P: Fair enough.

W: So the guy helps them get all the bloody clothes in the car and then they have to also shed their suits and get dressed in new clothes. That's why they were wearing T-shirts and shorts in that earlier scene, see!

P: Again I don't think that was something the audience was very interested in.

W: Well we explained it! So they go to a diner after that and Jules is talking about how he's going to leave his life of crime because he was granted redemption and a second chance from God. Oh and by the way this diner is the same one from the first scene!

P: OK...

W: Well then that robbery happens. But the robbers get really caught up in that briefcase and the male one even yells ""is that what I think it is?""

P: But we still haven't shown what it's in it.

W: No we haven't. But Vince is able to grab that guy at gunpoint, and then gives him a minutes long lecture about how he's not going to kill him and let him go as his first act of redemption. Oh and he gives him all the money from his wallet as well.

P: OK....

W: Oh and he quotes that made up Bible verse from earlier in the movie. But he's doing it now in a different context because he believes God saved him earlier so he's letting him go in redemption as well. See this stuff all ties together!

P: Well it's still a made up verse though. Also it's a bit weird that he used the same fake verse both to illustrate why he was going to kill someone and why he was going to let someone go.

W: Yeah but it sounds cool! But Jules tells him he can't give him the briefcase because it doesn't belong to him. So instead he tells him to just leave now with the money from his wallet and all the other wallets they collected from the people there.

P: So Jules can't give him the briefcase because it doesn't belong to him but he can let him keep all the wallets from the other people that also don't belong to him? Also if he's trying to redeem himself returning the wallets to those innocent people would make sense too.

W: Yeah but that might break up the dramatic tension having to have them hand all the wallets back. So both the thieves and the hitmen leave the diner, and then the movie is over.

P: OK....well yeah you're right, I still don't really know what that movie is about.

W: But it's fun right!

P: It could be. But definitely not going to be an Oscar nominee or anything like that.

W: Oh definitely not, I'd be very surprised if that happens!

P: Yeah and people definitely won't still be talking about in 30 years or anything like that.

1oja6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/X_VPN/comments/1oja6ue/why_i_use_x_vpn/,Why I use x vpn,"I use X-VPN because it has completely changed the way I experience the internet. Before discovering X-VPN, I often struggled with slow connections, region-locked content, and constant worries about online privacy. With X-VPN, those problems disappeared almost overnight. It provides a secure, fast, and reliable connection that allows me to browse the web with confidence no matter where I am. Whether I’m at home, in a coffee shop, or traveling abroad, I know my data is safe and my identity is protected. The encryption technology used by X-VPN ensures that no one can track or steal my personal information, which gives me peace of mind every time I go online.

Another reason I use X-VPN is because it allows me to access websites, shows, and games that are blocked or restricted in my region. This has opened up a whole new world of entertainment and information. I can stream my favorite series, connect with friends in other countries, and even use apps that aren’t available locally. The connection is always fast and smooth, which makes everything I do online much more enjoyable. I also appreciate how easy it is to use—the interface is clean, simple, and designed for everyone, whether you’re a tech expert or just getting started with VPNs.

Most importantly, X-VPN gives me control over my online privacy. In today’s digital world, where so much of our personal data is at risk, that control is priceless. I can go online knowing that my activity is private, my information is encrypted, and 
my freedom to explore the internet is fully protected. X-VPN isn’t just an app—it’s an essential tool for safety, access, and peace of mind in the modern digital age.",1,1761757507.0,X_VPN,0,1.0,False

At the time, things had never been better. I was on track to graduate college, I was in great shape, exercising regularly, and everything felt like it was finally coming together.

Then one day, out of nowhere, my pinky got a little tremor. A week later it was worse, but my PCP said I must have bumped a nerve, and it will be fine. Fast forward 6 months later, I could barely drink a cup of coffee without spilling it. The muscle spasms, pain, and rigidity got so bad that I had to stop working altogether and move back into my parents’ basement.

I spent the next two years going from doctor to doctor until I finally found one at the Cleveland Clinic who prescribed an off label medication that reduced my symptoms by about ninety percent. It truly saved my life. I now no longer “look sick.” My muscle rigidity is there enough for my wife to notice, but not really most people.
 
Ever since then, whenever something new goes wrong with my body, no matter how small, my mind immediately spirals. I become completely paralyzed with fear, convinced that whatever this new issue is, it’s here to stay. Could be knee pain, foot numbness making walking hard, hand pain, etc

When it I first became sick, because my primary doctor brushed it off and said it was nothing to worry about, it’s very easy for me to associate that with new medical ailments that arrive.

Recently, I hurt my arm lifting weights. It seems like a nerve injury, and after three weeks with no improvement, my brain has gone into overdrive. Dr says to give it time, but I can’t stop thinking I’ve permanently damaged it, that I’ll have to give up working out and live with constant pain again.

Logically, I know that doesn’t make sense. Statistically, it probably will heal, but emotionally, if I were hooked up to a polygraph and said I thought it would heal, I’d fail.

Part of that comes from experience. I hurt my back three years ago and told myself the same thing, that it was permanent. It turns out I was right. It was permanent. So now every new ache or pain feels like a repeat of that story, AND the original.

When it happens, I start berating myself.
“Fuck it. It’s all over now. What’s the point if I’m just going to be in pain forever.”

I know that’s a toxic mindset. I know it’s wrong. But no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to shut it off.

If anyone has been through something similar, that cycle of fear and catastrophizing after real medical trauma, I’d love to hear how you got through it. Thank you.",1,1761757477.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Hi THT fam! I absolutely love this show and I have only been listening for a few months. I actually only found out about THT because someone wrote in a story that involved me. I can’t find it, maybe because I’m new to Reddit, maybe it was removed, not sure, but it was written by my now ex-husband’s ex girlfriend. She was feeling conflicted about her choice to send me a binder that detailed how he was abusive in their relationship after finding out I was pregnant. It was full of dated photos, her journal entries, text threads, voicemail transcriptions, protective orders, court records, and police reports. It took me a bit to process everything she gave me, but after I did I sat down with her and talked for hours about her experiences and the stories he had told me about their time together. 

In the end, I of course believed her. And as Morgan and plenty of guests have said countless times, I wouldn’t have even thought about sitting down with her if I hadn’t deep down seen some signs or red flags. That day, she even offered me a place to stay to get out but I went and packed a bag and stayed with my mom. Turns out my mom never really liked him and had heard rumors of him being arrested and charged with domestic violence and a number of other charges, which were all proven true by her records.I didn’t tell him right away what happened but that I was going to stay with my mom that night because my grandma had a fall and I was going to be there to help my mom take care of her. Well he showed up anyway. 

Not out of concern for my grandma, but because he “knew I was a lying bitch”. Which is what he told me when I heard his truck pull up and went outside. Apparently he decided to become observant for the first time since we got married and he noticed that I took some smaller but really sentimental and valuable things with me, and left my wedding ring tucked in my jewelry box that he never normally looks in. My mom came out while he was yelling in my face and said she called the cops and he tried to get me to come home with him but I refused. So I called his ex and she, with zero hesitation, asked for the address and said she was coming over. We all sat and talked and cried and called a divorce lawyer together. I ignored dozens of calls and texts from him that night and the next day, we all went together back to my house, along with a cop and his ex’s husband for some added security and to create an official record. He had absolutely trashed my things and took off to I don’t know where. Because of course he had my location (I turned it off don’t worry) but I never had his.But I got a good amount of my things and moved into my moms spare room temporarily. 

From that day on I barely spoke to him without it being through a lawyer and we got divorced. I got the house, because I was the only one on the mortgage and had proof of being the only one to really pay the bills. But even after I moved back in there was damage he did to the house out of spite and rage. I can only imagine what would have happened to me instead of walls and furniture had I been there. 

Unfortunately, I did end up losing the baby I was pregnant with at the time. It was my first time being pregnant and I do have some health complications so this was always a concern. Add on such stress and it was a bad mix and I guess just not the right time for me. Certainly not the right guys and I can’t help but think someone was, in a heartbreaking and twisted way, looking out for me to make sure I wasn’t tied to him forever. That thought has helped me heal from all of this. 

Now somehow, this became an even crazier story. His ex and I have remained good friends since all this, and she texted me a screenshot of him posting an engagement photo with another girl. He has us both blocked everywhere but women are the FBI and also look out for each other, so this was also through the grapevine that it made it back to us. We found this girl and sent her the dreaded ‘hey girlie’ message. She left us on read for about 3 days and then asked to talk.

So we got coffee together and brought the binder, now complete with my story as well. She said that she’d been asking prodding questions the couple days since we messaged her and in her words, the red flags just kept popping up. I know this has been long so we’ll wrap it up nicely that she also left his abusive ass, we are all friends, and we have no plans to let this man have a peaceful life. As long as he keeps abusing and manipulating women, you bet we’ll show up with our binder.

My ex-boyfriend broke up with me, and yes, unfortunately, I’m not doing NC ! :( We had a three-year relationship. Forty days ago, he left me over some ridiculous reasons, saying, “I can’t give you what you want, I’m better off alone, I feel suffocated.” We didn’t part on bad terms. We wished each other well. We’re in the same city now. He calls me sometimes just to ease his conscience, and I pick up. We haven’t cut off communication.

But what he did today literally drove me insane! He called, we talked for 10 minutes, and then hung up. Later, he texted asking if I wanted to have coffee. I genuinely hadn’t seen his message. I called him and told him I just saw it, and if he wants, we could meet tomorrow to both study and have coffee. He replied as if he hadn’t been the one to suggest it in the first place: “We’ll see, if I can make it, I’ll call you tomorrow.”

What is this? Does he just want to keep control and not give hope? Or is he just an idiot? I can’t understand why he’s being so cold.

Please help,"My crush is the hottest guy at office. Looks like a model, has the body of Toji Fushiguro. And....we are friends. He is a chilled out guy. He is a decent friend. But everytime I see him and/or talk to him, I get all butterflies and lose sense of rationality (and hence time). My deadlines are getting affected coz I'm not able to focus. I speak to him for like 10 minutes and the next 30-40 minutes I have to convince myself not to get lost in a world of dreams with him. His face flashes in front of me randomly and idk what to do about it. There are also times when he'd be passing by somewhere where I can catch him from the corner of my eye and my heart races like I'm having arrhythmia. Gawd, I can't believe I'm getting so affected by this guy. 

And he's cute and has the sweetest smile. Doesn't help that he's smart and nice too, to me atleast. It also doesn't help that he has a RBF all the time and goes all dramatic and smiley when he's with me. He acts special around me (smiling like there's a secret joke that only we know, teasing me, trying to pull my leg in a funny way) and people think that there's something going on between us, but no, there's nothing except platonic friendship and my suppressed feelings for him. 

A little context about me: I've lost a good amount of weight, working on my fitness and get complimented quite a bit. I'm tall and been told I walk like a model and talk elegantly. But deep down, I consider myself to be ugly and fat and unattractive and no hot looking guy would be interested in me. I'm in a fake it till you make it mindset. My head is a mess. 

I'm just so confused. Does he like me as more than a friend? When we're texting it's like 'Dude, this. Dude, that' or 'Man, this. Man, that' or 'Bro, this. Bro, that.' and he never responds on time. If he really likes me, he wouldn't do that, right? I feel like I'm just a time pass for him whereas I think of him as someone special. I am usually pretty serious when talking to men but when I'm talking to him, I'm all girly and cutesy and I don't understand my own behaviour. Either he doesn't understand that I like him or he's pretending that he doesn't understand.

One more reason to believe he sees me as a friend only is because he calls me for beer catch ups, which people do with their friends and not with someone they're interested in (where I come from). 

Yesterday I was wearing something that accentuated my curves (telling this coz I've body image issues) and he talked to me and complimented me indirectly like I was looking cool and stuff. He also doesn't like it much when I talk to other guys, especially when they are tall and handsome too.

I get a feeling people at office judge me for talking to him since he doesn't talk to a lot of women and I don't talk to a lot of men, and we are seen together like 2 arrogant people who own our space (got commented on this too that I walk like I own the building. I wanted to scream 'I am just tall and seem to have a good posture!"". His body language is the cool confident type - one time we were having coffee at a restaurant and a lady shouted at us coz we were occupying space after having coffee (we were just about to leave), I got a little scared but him - he didn't even flinch or blink his eyes! So freaking cool 😍) but only we know we aren't the assholes we look like lol. Other guys don't approach me coz they think I'm into guys like him. I also have very strong boundaries wrt men coz of past trauma, and the kind of lecherous stares I get from men.

I wake up in the morning and my first thought is about him. I go to sleep with thoughts of him. The more I try to not think about him, the more I end up thinking about him.

I tried distancing myself from him and he asked if I was avoiding him. 

I really really need to cut off contact with him. And idk how. I melt when he talks to me or smiles at me. 

I can't date him coz Idk, he sees me as a friend and it'd be too weird coz he's younger than me. 

I wish I could date others but I'm not able to since I'm always thinking about him. And it's time I find a serious partner to settle down in life.     

Look at me making a post on reddit in such pitiful state asking for tips to forget him when I am missing a deadline and I have a catch-up with my manager tomorrow. I'm sooooo screwed! :(

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

How do we move past this disagreement?,"I 29F have been married to my husband 30M for 4 years now, together for 7. We have had some disagreements regarding friendships of the opposite sex. My husband has female friends from childhood/teen years that started before our relationship and I am completely fine with them. I have met them and feel completely secure. I am also fine with him having female friends that are mutual, for example another couple and we all hang out together. What I am not feeling comfortable with is him seeking out new female friends. Like he doesn’t seek out women specifically per se but they sometimes happen to be women. For example, a couple years ago he went to a society meeting for psychology at a bar and met a woman there and they had shared interests. They exchanged numbers and then decided to meet for a coffee couple of days later. He hadn’t told me about her until he got a text from her and I asked who is this. I wasn’t ok with this that he hadn’t told me about the exchange and begged my husband to let me come with him. He didn’t think anything of it. I was in distress for days and we fought a lot, so he reluctantly agreed and let the woman know that I was coming. She later cancelled the meeting and he never heard from her again. My husband says he only had platonic things in mind. Nothing more. Now I am super vigilant about him finding new female friends because I don’t want him being emotionally close/vulnerable with any woman but me. It feels like I would be replaced or something is lacking in the marriage that makes him seek out other women (even if just platonically). I would always have a thought that it could turn into something more. I myself don’t have any male friends except family or “friends” that are his friends. I don’t go out with other men and don’t even entertain their thoughts that a friendship could happen. My husband on the other hand says that it would be incredibly unfair to reject a person just because they are a woman when they share interests and have things in common. He says that I need therapy to overcome my insecurities because he doesn’t want things to become a self fulfilling prophecy.

Happy Halloween Friend's!

Some zombie show where a girl can barely outrun zombies plays in the background.

Julian McDonald sits on his carpet, on bent knees, in a costume of shredded clothes that his mother threatened to throw away anyway, gray face paint drying and cracking around his mouth, plastic stitches peeling from his cheek. The effect is middling, but Julian doesn’t care. The costume has served its purpose.

In front of him on the coffee table is a pillowcase, stuffed with candy.

It's not his pillowcase.

Vivien McDonald stands in the doorway, in her witch costume. Black dress from the previous year, already too short for her, purple-striped tights, a pointed hat that slides constantly down the slope of her white-blonde hair.

She is seven. Her face is red.

“Give it back.”

Julian does not look up. He is sorting through his haul with both hands, organizing piles by category. Chocolate over here, hard candy over there. The good shit separated from the crap old people give out.

“Julian.” Her voice rises. “That’s mine.”

“You can’t even eat all this.” He pops open a mini Snickers bar and shoves it in his mouth. Swallows with his mouth open. “You’re too little.”

“Mom said..”

“Mom’s not here.”

Vivien rushes at him then, small fists banging on his shoulder, attempting to tug the pillowcase away from him. Julian shoves her back. Not hard. Hard enough.

She hits the floor on her ass, hat rolling from her head as she goes. Her eyes fill.

“Fuck off,” Julian says around chocolate. He selects a Reese’s cup and pops it in his hand, pulls back the orange wrapper with nimble fingers. His hands tremble slightly. Sugar need. He can feel it, a low thrumming under his skin, craving more, always more.

The peanut butter cup vanishes in one bite.

Vivien makes a sound like a wounded animal, scrambles to her feet, takes off for the kitchen. Julian knows what this means.

The babysitter.

He does not stop eating.

By the time Nicole Stevenson emerges from the kitchen, he has already destroyed six pieces of candy, wrappers cast aside around him like so much exuvia. His jaw works in a dull, mechanical manner, grinding up chocolate and caramel and who-the-fuck-knows-what else, the synthetic fruit flavor they’ve pumped into the gummy worms sliding down his throat.

Nicole is twenty-one, old enough to be responsible for other people’s children, functionally competent at the task of keeping them from dying for a few hours. Wearing a costume that makes this fact abundantly clear. Vampire, if vampires exclusively shopped at stores that sold their costumes in the same aisle as bongs and flavored condoms. Black vinyl corset squeezing her tits upward, micro-skirt barely covering the tops of fishnet stockings. Plastic fangs that whistle when she speaks. She is drinking. Julian can smell it.

“What the fuck are you doing?” She points at the pillowcase. “That’s Viv’s.”

“She doesn’t need all of it.”

“That’s not how this works.” Nicole steps into the room, heels clicking on hardwood, and squats in front of Julian. He looks away. He selects a piece of candy from the pile instead. Milky Way, the good size.

Nicole snatches it from his hand before he can unwrap it.

“Hey!”

“Chill out or you’re gonna make yourself sick.”

“I’m fine.” His voice comes out the wrong way. Too high, almost pleading.

Vivien looms behind Nicole, tear tracks cutting across her face paint. Proper face paint, the good kind, not the drugstore crap Julian smeared on himself. Their mother had spent an hour on Vivien’s witch face: green skin, careful black contouring, a tiny spider drawn on her cheek. Now it’s smeared.

Vivien looks like she’s melting.

Julian feels nothing about this.

He reaches for the pillowcase. Nicole slaps his hand away.

“I said chill out.” Nicole drops the Milky Way back into the pile. “You’re being a little shit, you know that?”

“Whatever.”

“You better save some of that candy for Razor Gums.”

Silence falls into the room. Even Vivien stills her sniffling. Julian stares at Nicole, assessing if she’s fucking with him or not. Her expression doesn’t suggest it. The plastic fangs make it difficult to read her properly.

“Who?”

Nicole smiles. Real teeth behind the plastic. “You don’t know Razor Gums?”

“No.”

“Oh, honey.” She sits on the floor, crossing her legs. The fishnets have a run up the left thigh. “You’re in for a treat. Pun intended.”

Vivien inches closer, drawn in despite herself. She sits next to Nicole, careful to position the older girl between herself and her brother. Smart.

“It’s a story my mom used to tell me when I was your age.” Nicole gestures for Julian to pass her a piece of candy, which he does, a Tootsie Roll, something he doesn’t want. She unwraps it and pops it in her mouth, talking around the chocolate. “About a kid who loved Halloween more than anything in the world. Obsessed with it. He thought about it all year. Decorations, costumes, candy. Especially candy.”

Julian shifts in his seat. His hands itch to move toward the pillowcase. He forces them still.

“But this kid Sam, was his name.. he had a problem. His parents were  psycho. Like, legitimately insane. They belonged to some cult, one of those weird religious groups that thinks everything fun is evil. His dad was Conrad Swift, some kind of preacher at this church that met in a basement. His mom, Regina Alderson before she married, used to stand outside the grocery store handing out pamphlets about the end times. They homeschooled Sam. Never let him watch TV. He wasn’t allowed to have friends over.”

“That sucks,” Vivien says softly.

“It gets worse.” Nicole leans back on her hands, the corset creaking under the movement. “Every Halloween, Sam had to stay in his room while other kids went trick-or-treating. His parents would turn off all the lights, lock the doors, tell him that Halloween was the devil’s holiday and anyone who celebrated it was going to hell. They said candy was poison. Told him people put razor blades in candy to hurt children. Said the whole thing was a Satanic conspiracy.”

“Sam believed them for a while. He was young, seven, eight, some shit like that. But the older he got, the more he watched. He'd look out his bedroom window, watch the other kids in costumes and knock on doors. Hear the laughter and shouting, watch them come home with bags full of candy. He wanted it. God, he wanted it so bad.”

The way Nicole says it, the sin rolling off her lips as she talks about wanting candy, makes Julian's skin tingle. He hears the hunger in her voice. Knows he has it too, the hunger, all the time, the craving for more sugar, more sweetness, more of that chemical rush you only get from processed corn syrup and artificial flavoring.

“So one year, when Sam was twelve, he got fed up. Halloween night, he waited for his parents to go to sleep. They always went to bed early, had to get up at four in the morning to pray or some shit like that. Sam snuck out his bedroom window, hit the streets around eleven, when most people had stopped answering their doors but when some people still had their lights on. He had a pillowcase. He wore no costume. Didn't matter. Some people gave him candy anyway, felt bad for him, probably. Others just wanted to get rid of what they had left.”

“Did he fill the bag?” Vivien asks.

“Oh yeah. Came home with five pounds maybe. Snickers and M&Ms and lollipops and chocolate bars, all of it. He climbed back through his window, hid the pillowcase in his closet, went to bed. Probably couldn't sleep. Too excited.”

Nicole pauses, looks down at the pillowcase in her lap. Takes another piece of candy. Julian gives her a Kit Kat this time. She breaks off a piece, offers half to Vivien. The little girl takes it, nibbles cautiously.

“He screwed up though. Left his shoes by the front door. Shoes covered in mud and leaves. His mother found them in the morning.”

Julian can see it clearly: the mother, Regina, still in her nightgown, making coffee in the kitchen, spotting the shoes, instantly knowing what they meant.

“They tore his room apart, looking for the candy. Found it in about three minutes. His dad, Conrad, went ballistic. Started yelling about damnation and hellfire and brimstone and shit. His mother was crying, saying she'd failed as a mother, that Sam was going to burn in hell for all eternity. They made him kneel on the floor while they prayed over him, screaming at God to forgive his sins. Then Conrad took off his belt.”

“Jesus,” Julian mutters.

“Sam said it didn't hurt as much as he thought it would. Or maybe he was just numb by then. They beat his ass for ten minutes, maybe, then locked him in his room, grounded until further notice. They took the candy with them, said they were going to throw it away. He could hear them moving around downstairs, probably arguing about what to do with him, whether to send him to some reform school or just to pray harder.”

Vivien has stopped eating her Kit Kat. It's melting in her hand.

“Around midnight, Sam snuck out of his room again. He was good at being quiet. The house was old, and he knew which floorboards creaked. He went down to the basement. They'd put the candy there, he'd heard them talking. Just dumped the whole pillowcase on this old table they kept for storage. The basement smelled like old bibles. There was one light bulb hanging from the ceiling, all the dead bugs collected inside the glass.”

Nicole's voice has dropped low. The living room suddenly feels smaller as tunnel vision closes in.

“Sam walked to the table. Stood and stared at the candy just sitting there, all those bright wrappers. He hadn't eaten any of it yet. Hadn't tasted a single piece. He'd never had Halloween candy. Can you imagine?”

Julian can. The level of deprivation is obscene, almost physically painful. He looks at the pile in front of him, suddenly painfully aware of how much he has, how easily he has it.

“He grabbed a handful. Stuffed it in his mouth. Six pieces at a time, Just bit down.”

Nicole claps her hands together sharply. Vivien jumps.

“The razor blades went through his gums.”

“No.” Vivien whispers.

“Yes. His parents weren't lying about that part. Someone had really put razor blades in the candy. Maybe it was them, some fucked-up lesson. Or maybe it was random, bad luck. Doesn't matter. Sam bit down and felt his mouth explode. Blood everywhere. Blades slicing through his tongue, his cheeks, the roof of his mouth. He should have spit it out. Should have screamed. But do you know what he did?”

Julian shakes his head. He can't look away from Nicole's face.

“He swallowed. Then he grabbed another handful.”

Previous critique [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1obt5bm/qcrit_adult_science_fiction_thriller_montana/).

**Query:**

Dear \[AGENT\],

Based on your interest in \[XXX\], I am excited to query you for my science fiction thriller, MONTANA DISCO (102,000 words).

The novel will appeal to fans of Thomas R. Weaver’s speculative world-building in *Artificial Wisdom* and Mark Greaney’s propulsive action in *The Gray Man*. It could sit on the shelf alongside Blake Crouch’s *Upgrade* and can stand alone but is conceived as the start of a series.

Like the rest of society, Adrian \[Surname\] thinks connecting to Edison Prime is safe. With its digital narcotics, nightclubs, fighting games, and more, the immersive virtual world became Adrian’s escape when he gave up his Navy SEAL dreams following his dad’s death. Now Adrian struggles to keep the family’s Montana farm afloat, his days filled with combines instead of combat.

Then private security officers arrive looking for Emma \[Surname\], a VAPR agent investigating a digital drug that’s poisoning people on Prime. After the officers ransack his mom’s diner during their search, Adrian helps Emma flee to the farm nearby. But when their escape turns into a firefight instead, Adrian kills an officer with a forklift to survive, thrusting him and his agrarian crew (and his dog) into VAPR’s investigation.

Unable to stay at the farm, Adrian volunteers to go undercover at the local Prime center. There he discovers that the digital drug is connected to a corporation’s deadly new cyber weapon. And his town is its next target. To stop the attack, Emma and Adrian will have to retrieve a program encrypted behind a dangerous virtual labyrinth. But Adrian’s town is only part of the corporation’s plans, and anyone on Prime may be at risk.

\[Author Redacted\] (USA Today bestselling author, Golden Poppy Octavia E. Butler Award winner, Bram Stoker Award finalist) wrote that MONTANA DISCO is “page-turning, heartfelt, and exceptionally atmospheric” with “a supremely rootable cast of characters and world-building to rival the best of them.”

After working in frozen coffee and venture capital since graduating from \[Redacted\] in 2016, I decided it was time to put my computer science degree to use. Many of the ideas in MONTANA DISCO stem from this background, while much of the physical world comes from the expanse that is Montana, where I now live. When I’m not writing or reading, you’ll find me skiing, hiking, and petting every dog I see.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

TwentySix10

It was supposed to be a quick stop at the diner. I’d drop off the produce, give my mom a hug, and head back to the farm to figure out who’s been sabotaging our combines.

Then the reporter showed up.

Apparently, she got caught tailing two security officers who didn’t take kindly to her snooping about. She managed to escape, but the price was a bloody lip.

Now I’m stuck here until we’re confident she’s safe. While I wouldn’t normally mind the delay, with our harvest at risk, waiting around in case the officers show up isn’t particularly high on my to-do list.

Even if I’d love to give the corrupt bastards a taste of their own medicine.

After handing Sarah a napkin for her face, my mom leads her down the rear hallway and unlocks the door to the pantry. They go inside.

“Is that okay? I know it’s a little tight in there.”

“It’s perfect.”

“Great. Adrian and I will be right outside, so just hang tight and try to make yourself comfortable. We’ll come get you in a bit.”

Mom reappears and locks the door behind her, then walks back to where I’m standing in the hallway. An old rock ballad plays softly on the speakers, the smell of fresh sourdough wafting from the kitchen.

“What should we do?” I ask. The black-cushioned barstools and maroon vinyl booths sit empty at this hour, but the regulars will start trickling in for lunch soon.

“Ideally, I’d call my security provider, but I’m sure their wait time will be too long. And if they come and Sarah decides not to press charges, then we’re on the hook for the whole bill.”

“So we do nothing?”

Its part of a series of stories about brief moments with strangers.  It happened to me few days ago and wanted to write about it.  Love any feedback.  thanks!

  
Every now and then, life gives us a brief moment to connect. No strings attached, no expectations, just two people being human for a second.

This weekend, I was in line at a coffee shop and had an impulse to turn around. Behind me stood a woman, maybe in her thirties, quiet and still. There was a heaviness in her eyes that most people would overlook.

Without thinking, I said...

“You know, someone did something nice for me a couple of days ago, and I am going to pay it forward by buying you coffee. Get whatever you want.”

She stared at me for a few seconds, then tears began to fall.  
She told me she had been having a terrible day and that this was the kindest thing that had happened to her all week.

I said, “Hey, you are not alone. I have bad days too. They suck.”

We ordered our coffees and waited. She began to soften. Breathing a little deeper, shoulders lowering. Maybe it was the reminder that she was seen, that life still has warmth in it. When it was time to go, I decided to reach out and hug her.  Something I and well, most of us do not do.  The power of a hug can move mountains when done at the right time in someone’s life.

“It will pass. Good luck to you.”

She smiled, and that was it.  
No exchange of names, no long-term love connection needed, no expectation of seeing each other again. Just a moment.

We walked out and she was far enough behind me that it did not warrant anymore words.  As I drove off, I looked down the parking lot to avoid any cars, and I saw her standing next to her truck watching me drive off.  I thought, I really hope that filled her Relationship and Health buckets to get through what she was dealing with.  Sometimes, that is all it takes.

**The Relationship Bucket**

Not every connection is meant to last.  
Sometimes, the value is in the moment itself.

Our Relationship Bucket does not fill only through family, lifelong friends, or romantic partners. It fills when we connect, when we share kindness, empathy, or humanity with anyone. Some relationships last years; others last minutes. Both matter.

I always say “Everything Ends. “Conversations, seasons, even entire chapters of life. But that does not mean they were not valuable. The fullness comes from being present enough to notice the moment while it is here.

That brief exchange in the coffee shop was not about changing someone’s life. It was about reminding both of us that connection still exists. And sometimes, that is enough to refill the bucket.

Part of me did think about driving back to her and engaging in a conversation around seeing each other again.  But that was not why we were brought together in this moment.  It was just a moment.  It reminded me to be generous and engage with people.  It reminded her that there are still those who care.

A little over a year ago, my parents pretty much disowned me (23 F) during my last year of college because they found out I slept with my boyfriend of two years (23M). They took everything they could away from me and didn't talk to me for months, I spent the holidays and everything alone. I was going to college 8 hours away so I didn't see them. It was really hard since my siblings were flying monkeys and my sister had her first baby that I didn't see till months later. My boyfriend and I got really close during that time and built a life together. After I graduated, thanks to his support, I agreed with him that I would move back home for a certain amount of time to try and fix my relationship with my family. He was super supportive about it and wanted me to find peace of mind with my family. While I was home, I got the opportunity to purchase a coffee shop (my lifelong dream) from someone I knew for dirt cheap, I jumped on it because even if I moved back to my boyfriend's town I could easily sell it for a large profit. Long story short, my family has not changed and cutting me out again; they kicked me out of the house despite me paying rent for 'living a life of sin' aka still talking to my boyfriend who I previously slept with(I've been staying with my grandparents), my sister even threatened that I would not be in her baby's life if I don't submit to my dads authority as a woman, that is a big part of their religion. Now I am trying to decide if I get an apartment in the area or one with my boyfriend 9 hours away. If I stayed here I could keep my dream coffee shop opportunity, and maybe maintain somewhat of a relationship with my family and my niece, but I'd probably have to end things with my boyfriend. If I leave, I'd have my boyfriend who I love dearly, have some space from my family, and hopefully try to open another coffee shop down the road. I need to make a decision soon but I cannot commit to either because it's such a big choice, no matter what I do it will affect the rest of my life. I need advice!

thank you for 200 members too. we got there today! it's a fantastic achievement and we got there together so thank you. here's my halloween poem i wrote a few weeks ago as a thank you, but please dont take it too seriously! this is from a perspective of being sick and being about to be laid off from my job and trying to have a good friday night in town by going to the mall and looking at the halloween stuff in stores.

1oj9o4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stateshift/comments/1oj9o4o/developer_feedback_loops_that_actually_drive/,Developer Feedback Loops That Actually Drive Adoption,"Hey, folks,

Most developer relations teams collect feedback, but few turn it into
meaningful change.

You have likely seen it happen. A developer shares a smart suggestion at an
event or on Discord. The team takes note, then it disappears… buried under
dozens of other comments that never reach the roadmap.

Over time, developers notice that their input does not lead anywhere. They
stop offering insights, and your team gradually loses touch with the very
people building on your platform. Competitors who treat developer feedback as
a growth engine start earning the trust that once came your way… the kind of
quiet credibility that’s hard to win back.

### Why Unstructured Developer Feedback Becomes Noise

When feedback lives in scattered places with no shared system, it quickly
turns into background noise. We have seen this across developer-focused
companies of every size. Thoughtful Discord messages never reach product
managers. Conference notes remain in personal docs. Survey responses sit
untouched in a spreadsheet.

The issue isn’t a lack of caring; it’s usually the process itself. Without a
simple way to capture, evaluate, and act on developer feedback, even the best
ideas slowly fade away. They pile up in spreadsheets and notes until they feel
more like clutter than insight.

This matters because when developers see their feedback reflected in the
product, they become true partners. They feel invested, they talk about it
with their peers, and they trust that your team is genuinely listening.

But when feedback disappears into silence, energy fades, conversations slow
down, and adoption eventually follows suit.

## A System That Turns Developer Feedback Into Adoption

One of the most common challenges we see is figuring out how to measure
whether your feedback process is working. It’s not enough to collect comments
or survey responses—you need a way to measure both the _quantity_ and the
_quality_ of developer feedback.

For quantity, track how many pieces of feedback you receive weekly or monthly,
and note where they come from. If the numbers are low, expand your feedback
channels or adjust how you ask. If they’re high, that’s great—but now you need
a way to filter for quality.

That’s where lead scoring principles come in. Treat each piece of feedback
like an inbound lead. Rate it based on relevance to your roadmap, how detailed
or actionable it is, and who it came from.
[Feedback](https://blog.stateshift.com/scott-hanselman-on-content-community-
and-keeping-it-real/) from active customers or contributors should carry more
weight than drive-by comments. You can even assign a numeric score—say from 1
to 5—to create a shared language across your team for what “good” feedback
looks like.

Finally, connect your feedback data to roadmap metrics. Track what percentage
of scored feedback moves onto the roadmap, and how much of that feedback
actually ships. These conversion metrics help you see whether your system is
healthy. If a lot of feedback scores highly but little of it makes it into the
product, you might have a review bottleneck. If plenty makes it to the roadmap
but few items ship, the problem might be engineering prioritization. Measuring
these stages makes your feedback loop visible, trackable, and much easier to
improve.

At Stateshift, we’ve worked with plenty of developer-focused teams who were
eager for feedback but drowning in it. What they really needed wasn’t more
input… it was a way to turn developer feedback into clear, repeatable action.
Our goal isn’t to add more noise, it’s to create a living feedback loop that
actually improves the product, gives direction real data behind it, and
strengthens trust with your developer community.

Over time, we’ve distilled what works into a four-stage approach that any team
can start using right away—no extra headcount or complex tooling required.

### 1\. Create Multiple Developer Feedback Channels

Start by showing up where developers already spend their time. Most of the
best product conversations don’t happen in a meeting; they happen in the
comments section, in a chat thread, or over coffee at a conference. Those
informal spaces… events, Discord, documentation threads, workshops… are your
richest sources of developer feedback.

Encourage your team to treat every moment as a chance to listen, not just
collect. A QR code at your booth, a pinned feedback thread in Discord, or a
quick form in your docs all work fine. The goal is to make it ridiculously
easy for someone to share an idea while it’s fresh. The more ways you open
that door, the more voices you’ll hear, from your most active contributors to
the quiet observers who usually stay silent.

> “Developers will give you gold, but only if they believe you will use it.”

### 2\. Centralize and Score Developer Feedback

Once feedback starts flowing, it must live in a single, searchable location. A
spreadsheet or shared database works fine. Feed every input into it—conference
notes, survey results, chat transcripts, or AI-summarized workshop
discussions.

Then evaluate both **quantity** and **quality**. Low volume signals you need
more outreach; high volume requires prioritization. Build a simple scoring
system that considers:

  * Relevance to your core audience
  * Clarity and specificity of the feedback
  * Strategic alignment with product goals
  * Source credibility (customers score higher than anonymous users)

Scoring developer feedback helps you focus on high-value insights and protects
your roadmap from one-off requests that do not serve the majority of users.

### 3\. Graduate Items to the Product Roadmap

A repository full of developer feedback only matters when something actually
makes it onto the roadmap. Build a simple review rhythm that lines up with
your sprint or quarterly planning. Each session, look at the highest-scoring
feedback and decide what moves forward next.

Keep an eye on your conversion rate. If hundreds of ideas come in but only a
handful make it to engineering, your issue is probably review, not collection.
Pay attention to which channels bring in the most actionable feedback—like
documentation comments, community events, or social conversations—because
that’s where your best signals come from.

When you can show leadership that community insights are shaping the roadmap,
developer engagement stops being abstract and starts looking like measurable
business value.

### 4\. Close the Loop and Recognize Contributors

If developers take the time to give thoughtful feedback, you need to close the
loop in a way that feels personal and meaningful. The magic isn’t just in
collecting feedback, it’s in showing that it leads to real outcomes.

Start by tracking who shared the feedback: name, company, and how they use
your product. That context helps you prioritize what matters most and follow
up directly when something they suggested gets shipped. Developers notice when
you remember the details.

When it’s time to recognize contributors, think about scale. Quick bug fix?
Send a thank-you message or mention them in the release notes. Major feature
request that unlocks value for your customers? That deserves more. Maybe a
spotlight post, some special swag, or a handwritten note from your team. The
recognition should match the impact.

Recognition doesn’t have to be elaborate—it just has to be genuine. A public
shout-out or small gesture can go a long way in building trust. When
developers see that their feedback leads to action, they feel like part of the
process, not outsiders yelling into the void. That’s when feedback becomes
something bigger than input, it becomes connection.-

## Putting the System Into Practice

When it comes to applying this system, it helps to set a few expectations
around scale and conversion. From what we’ve seen, healthy developer feedback
loops turn roughly 10–20% of collected feedback into roadmap items. at number
keeps things realistic—it shows you’re listening without overwhelming
engineering. If that percentage is lower, it might signal that your review
process is inconsistent or that high-quality insights aren’t getting surfaced
quickly enough.

You can also measure how much of that roadmap feedback actually ships.
Ideally, 70–80% of roadmap items inspired by developer feedback should be
completed within a release cycle or two. Anything lower than that, and you may
need to align priorities between DevRel and product leadership to keep the
loop strong.

Spotting bottlenecks early is key. If great feedback is piling up but not
getting reviewed, that’s a process problem. If it’s getting reviewed but
rarely implemented, that’s a prioritization issue. Either way, identifying
where the slowdown happens helps you fix it fast.

You can kick this off right away without much fuss.

  1. Set up a shared sheet with columns for what the feedback is, where it came from, who shared it, how strong it is, and what stage it’s in.
  2. Open three simple places to gather feedback… maybe a quick form in your docs, a pinned post in your community, and a short event follow-up survey.
  3. Block a 30‑minute weekly review to look through new feedback and decide what deserves attention next.
  4. Pick one piece of feedback to act on in your first month and show your community that it led to something real.

That one visible follow‑through builds trust and momentum faster than any
campaign ever could.

Treat this table like your shared inbox. Log every piece of developer
feedback, score it once, and decide in a weekly review what moves forward. Aim
for 10–20 percent of scored items to reach the roadmap, then ship at least one
visible win each month. That rhythm is how you get actionable feedback from
developer communities and turn it into adoption.

## The Stateshift Perspective

Learning how to get actionable feedback from developer communities starts with
something simple… consistency. At Stateshift, we’ve seen that tools only get
you so far. The real magic happens when teams build a steady rhythm around
listening, testing, and improving. Our _Acceleration Flywheel_ is how we make
that happen. We collect data, form a hypothesis, put it into practice, and
measure what changes. Then we do it again. Each pass makes the connection
between developer insight and product improvement stronger.

When developer feedback becomes part of how your team naturally operates, it
stops feeling like an extra task and starts acting as a growth engine. It
fuels adoption, retention, and trust. The companies that make developer
feedback a normal, measurable part of their process are the ones that build
communities that stick around.

### ****What is developer feedback and why does it matter?****

Developer feedback is input, ideas, or frustrations shared by the people using
or building on your product. It matters because it highlights real-world needs
that directly shape adoption, retention, and trust.

### **How do I get actionable feedback from developer communities?**

Start with structure. Create multiple feedback channels, centralize everything
in one system, score for quality, and close the loop. At Stateshift, we teach
teams to build this discipline into their daily rhythm so that actionable
developer feedback always finds its way into the roadmap. It all comes down to
clear pathways from insight to implementation.

### **Which channels work best for developer feedback?**

Meet developers where they already hang out—your docs, community channels,
events, and social platforms. Keep the process lightweight and friction-free
so sharing input feels
natural.[](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **How can I make sure developer feedback actually reaches product tea**
ms?

Connect your feedback system to your roadmap review rhythm. Add feedback
review time into sprint planning or quarterly updates so it becomes part of
the process, not an afterthought.

### **How do I show developers that their feedback made an impact?**

Close the loop publicly and make it personal. Mention contributors in release
notes, share updates on social, or send a small thank-you. At Stateshift, we
often help teams design recognition rituals that make feedback visible.
Recognition turns one-time input into long-term engagement and community
pride.

### **How does Stateshift help teams use developer feedback effectively?**

Stateshift helps developer-focused companies build structured feedback loops
that tie directly to roadmap decisions. Using our Acceleration Flywheel, we
help teams gather, test, and act on insights so developer feedback
consistently drives adoption.

A thimble of caution always accompanies each trade, tiny but protective, guarding against the sharp edges of volatility that so often puncture enthusiasm. Like a seagull feather drifting along the shoreline, BBAI’s price movements have floated on the wind of speculation, sometimes soaring high, sometimes sinking toward quieter waters. The typewriter ribbon of the financial narrative keeps rolling, printing out new stories each day about volume, momentum, and shifting sentiment.

In the rusted mailbox of old market expectations, a few faded letters remain—predictions from months past that no longer hold weight. The shoelace tip of investor patience frays slightly as traders tie and untie their strategies, searching for a better fit in a changing environment. The cactus spine of market reaction still pricks at those who underestimate how sensitive BBAI can be to news and shifts in broader AI trends. The lantern wick of hope continues to burn, though sometimes dimly, as long-term believers wait for the light of profitability to steady itself.

Like a vinyl record sleeve protecting the delicate grooves of a favorite song, some investors shelter their positions, convinced that the company’s underlying technology will replay a brighter tune. The biscuit tin of investor chatter fills and empties daily, full of crumbs of rumors and speculation about contracts, earnings, and AI defense work. A map fragment of analysis points in many directions—some toward growth, others toward risk—leaving traders to piece together their own route. The fountain pen nib scratches across notepads as analysts revise their price targets, inked with both optimism and restraint.

The pocket compass of market sentiment twitches constantly, never fully finding true north. The keychain locket of investor memory carries tiny photos of both triumph and regret—those who bought too soon, and those who sold too late. A train whistle of trading alerts echoes through brokerage apps, signaling sudden movement in price or volume. The glass marble of market clarity often rolls out of reach, slipping under the desk just when understanding seems near. The curtain tassel of end-of-day summaries sways with after-hours reports, softening the close with final words before the next opening bell.

The wind chime rod of volatility sings again when broader tech indices move sharply, reminding traders that BBAI’s rhythm rarely plays alone. A matchbook cover of sentiment catches fire quickly online, fueled by social chatter and quick reactions to headlines. A Polaroid frame captures each day’s chart, freezing a moment of red or green for investors to study later. The toothpick holder of daily analysis overflows with tiny, pointed takes, each trying to pick apart what truly drives the movement. The seed packet of long-term investment remains sealed for some, waiting for the right season to plant faith in BBAI’s future.

The bottle cap of market liquidity sometimes tightens, making it harder to move large positions without spillage. The ice cube tray of intraday trading melts fast as short-term players come and go, reshaping positions within hours. A postage stamp of perspective reminds traders that even small gains can travel far when compounded over time. The cracked teacup of patience still holds a little warmth as those who believe in the company sip slowly, choosing not to rush. The bicycle pedal of momentum pushes the price forward some days and backward on others, powered by sentiment and headlines alike.

The hourglass of timing never stops, with grains of opportunity slipping by unnoticed as others chase every rumor. The window latch of investor confidence swings open and closed, depending on earnings whispers and contract news. The paperclip chain of minor updates links together across weeks, forming a fragile pattern that traders try to interpret. An ink blot of confusion often stains social media, where rumor and reality mix freely. The compass needle of conviction wavers with each chart pattern, never resting for long. A candle stub of optimism burns at the desks of those who see the long-term horizon beyond the day’s price chart.

The leather bookmark of strategy holds places in trading journals, marking lessons learned from past swings. The soap bubble of hype occasionally bursts, leaving behind only a shimmer of what could have been. The button jar of investor behavior rattles with mixed motives—greed, fear, patience, and curiosity. The measuring tape of valuation stretches and contracts as analysts argue over what BBAI’s true worth might be. The guitar pick of momentum traders strums sharp chords through the market feed, while the film canister of unseen developments sits sealed, awaiting exposure. The coffee stirrer of discussion swirls through chatrooms and analyst calls alike, blending opinions into a frothy mix. The pocket mirror of reflection reminds investors that their own reactions often shape what they see. The chalk stick of charting draws trendlines that sometimes prove as temporary as the emotions behind them. The feather quill of long-term writing continues to script this story of persistence and uncertainty.

Each day closes with the pebble stone of realization that the market’s surface is smooth only from afar. Inside the snow globe of trading, BBAI swirls through patterns both mesmerizing and unpredictable. The puzzle piece of each day’s data fits awkwardly with the last, yet together they form a picture still in progress. A dandelion seed of rumor drifts into the wind, spreading speculation far beyond its source. The matchstick of momentum ignites again, only to burn out as quickly as it began. The ticket stub of participation remains proof that every investor had a seat in this ongoing show. And finally, as the rainwater puddle of reflection settles each evening, the face of BBAI’s journey becomes clear for just a moment—before the next ripple begins.",0,1761756325.0,BBAI,23,0.43,False
1oj9mqw,https://i.redd.it/7m7gy4dyx2yf1.jpeg,TX would send their own National Guard but they’re hiding out in ICE,"PA sending national guard troops to the TX border? Does anyone else find that insanely stoopid or am I just in the 1% that hasn’t lost their damn mind yet? 

If I were running this no budget passed yet state I’d be sending our national guard to food pantries because there’s going to be a lot of hungry ppl who could use a helping hand up (not handouts) and maybe we can enlist Johnny “Turncoat” Fetterman to make it rain some of those sweet AIPAC donations. 

SNAP is there to help ppl and the amount it takes out of taxpayers mouths is less than a boatload of Soy Beans I assure you. Maybe the price of some coffee beans for your morning coffee that’s about it. 

You can’t even buy a laser guided heatsinker to send to Israel for another attack on a Gaza hospital with that because they already did all that and we’re at peace right? Part 1 at least but I think that treaty was broken hours after the Nobel Peace Prize went to someone not firing missiles at speedboats near Venusuala and claiming they were running drugs to the US. 

You know how far that is? Over 2,000 miles with a top speed of 54-80mph that’s quite a trip!

I thouht the border was closed and secured that’s what Karo-b-Lying Levvitt been saying across all the frequencies. 

Are our National Guard above putting food in boxes to help feed area residents instead of standing around the Rio Grande walking in circles questioning life choices? Texas always claim to be able to take care of themselves so let them prove it.

My ex-boyfriend broke up with me, and yes, unfortunately, I’m not doing NC ! :( We had a three-year relationship. Forty days ago, he left me over some ridiculous reasons, saying, “I can’t give you what you want, I’m better off alone, I feel suffocated.” We didn’t part on bad terms. We wished each other well. We’re in the same city now. He calls me sometimes just to ease his conscience, and I pick up. We haven’t cut off communication.

But what he did today literally drove me insane! He called, we talked for 10 minutes, and then hung up. Later, he texted asking if I wanted to have coffee. I genuinely hadn’t seen his message. I called him and told him I just saw it, and if he wants, we could meet tomorrow to both study and have coffee. He replied as if he hadn’t been the one to suggest it in the first place: “We’ll see, if I can make it, I’ll call you tomorrow.”

What is this? Does he just want to keep control and not give hope? Or is he just an idiot? I can’t understand why he’s being so cold. Earlier today, when we talked for 10 minutes, he was very friendly. He even talked about going to the same gym?! Wtf?

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

So, me (M32) have been dating this girl (31) for a year and a half now and things are good between us. Thing is that our relationship started in a bad timing for me and I cant get over circunstances in my head, haunts me everyday, it might sound silly to you but whatever.

I had been dating this other girl for 5 years (we were 25ish at the time) and broken up after a series of arguments and discussions over the months leading up to the breakup. My ex was a very kind and good person but we having so much stress over the smallest things (like once she said ""wow that is very expensive"" at a store and I said ""yeah, but we dont need to say it this loud"" and  she got very sad like I was pruning her, not my intention but I can see her point. My depression and bad situation at work made me lose my mind over the small things and we got over arguments and she always asked if I wanted to break up with her. Which I didnt. But I always felt like walking on eggshells around her, trying not to hurt her. 

Anyway, a couple months before we broke up I started talking to this friend I had lost contact with that we had a thing for each other in the past (my actual GF) and she was going through similar relationship problems, we talked for a while and decided we should both break up with our current partners and try something together, and a couple months after the break ups we did go out and are together now. Things are good... Except that they arent really in my  mind.  
  
They breakup was messy, my ex didnt take it well and wanted to completely cut off contact with me because she said she really liked me and could move on if we remained friends, I was so very depressed at the time and I didnt want to lose her friendship because I really like her. I tried talking to her a couple times afterwards, but she never did want to and was really loathing me. After she found out about my gf she actively started talking shit about me to people we knew, said I probably cheated on her (I never did that) and that hurts me a lot. I once randomly met my ex at a coffee shop alone and tried having a conversation with her, it didnt go well, I apologized for everything and how bad I made her feel and said I regreted doing all the things and if I knew better I would have tried saving the relationship before allowing it to sink.   
She was crying a lot and said she would think about forgiving me but never did message me and I left her alone without trying to contact her after that random meeting.

I think I still love my ex, I dream about her more often than I dont; and I feel so guilty about that because my current relationship is good and I have no complaints about her.

So I guess I just needed to vent, there is no one in my life I can talk about this, I am very lonely and have no real friends I dont think, so any input that might help me have any insights on how to get out of this shitty headspace would be welcome.

Decided to prepare for step 1 a year ago. My initial plan was to take the exam in may and later in June but I couldn’t get leave from my work.
I had been studying here and there for the last one year but I wasn’t consistent at all.
Mistakes I had made:
1. Not taking nbmes sooner. Attempted most of the newer ones but couldn’t fully revise them

#Start doing NBMES sooner than later review them thoroughly and leave adequate time between exams to revise.

2. Jot down your uworld and NBME incorrects. My uworld subscription had expired a month before I took step so I had no way to review my incorrects. And even though I had initially planned to I didn’t review or consolidate my incorrects.

# Consolidate and review incorrects

3. My NBME scores were abysmal I should have waited to take the test. I was just fed up with the uncertainty and took the leave my hospital gave me and went for it
NBME 26-62%
NBME 27(23/09)-60%
NBME 28(28/09)-50%
NBME 29(2/10)-62%
NBME 30(7/10)- 65%
NBME 32(10/10) online- 60%
Free 120- 65%
Took them all in exam conditions but with less time each block with 50 min

# Don’t go into the exam without at least a bit of confidence 

4. I was very wishy washy with my preparation. I regret that a lot. Kept a lot for the end like micro and biostats.

#My dedicated was 2 weeks which I spend learning instead of revising and that was a big mistake.

The exam went by quickly. The questions were long but I had plenty of time for each block ( I took this as a bad sign) I even ended 2 blocks early.
Took a lot of food with me ended up only eating 1 protein bar half a dark chocolate and sipped on some black coffee ( I’m a caffeine addict )
 
Last 2 days I couldn’t study anything as I had to travel 14-16 hours out of state . I was staying with a family and I went out to eat with them . My cousins visited the day before. In short it was all a mess. But by the grace of God I passed.

My exam was ethics heavy along with lots of heme onc and immuno
Primary study source was uworld with FA+BnB+sketchymicro+dirtymed.

Day 1: operation Day

Woke up after the surgery with some pain but was still on IV painkillers. The hospital gave me a lukewarm soup and yogurt in the evening (surgery was in the morning) and pain killers through the night. Pain with meds: 4/10  
  
Day 2: Felt my throat is a little swollen, pain was compared to a strep throat. Was able to drink and eat (hospital already gave me ""normal food"". Breakfast: coffee and soft bread lunch: chicken with noodles and steamed vegetables dinner: soup and yogurt (was pretty hungry during the night). Didn't need IV meds the whole day and also made it through the night without major medication. Pain still on a 4/10

Day 3: the coffee in the morning tasted so gross, I later found out it was not the coffee, it was the scabs. Everything tasted awful. Was allowed to leave the hospital and went home. Eat some noodles for lunch and hotdogs without bread for dinner.  Pain became a little worse 5/10

  
Day 4: didn't sleep much, my mouth was so dry I had to force myself to drink. Every sip was like I imagine swallowing glass. Changed coffee for tea at breakfast for 2 reasons: one, everything with milk tasted so gross, two: I already drank 500ml in the morning and managed to drink them every meal. Also, my meds were mostly liquid which gave me ca. 250ml in addition to the 500 to my meals. Pain was 5/10, I can't remember what I ate that that.

Day 5: oh lord, the earpain started. It was unbearable. I woke up, tried to swallow my medication and was about to scream because my ears hurt so bad. I never had an ear infection before, even as a kid so this pain was completely new feeling for me. After almost crying myself to sleep, I stayed on top of my meds for the day to not experience that pain again. Since I have a doctor in my family, he advised me to eat solid food that is a little crunchy so the scabs fall off. I thought he was joking but he was serious. I remember looking at my crunchy sandwich and thought to myself ""I am so afraid"". But, I managed to eat it all and I am sure it helped! Pain: 7/10 (due to the ear pain)

Day 6: Actually not much different than day 5.

Day 7: The pain that night was the worst pain I had experienced during my recovery. My ears felt they were about to burst, my throat felt like it was sliced open. I cried when I swallowed my medication to get a little more sleep and I had to keep myself busy with my phone, until the remedy started. I went to the doctor and got a strong pain med for the night and that helped me to sleep through. Pain: 8/10

Day 8 to 11: were slightly better, everyday I felt a little more comfortable. On day 11, I even cut down on my medication a bit. I also didn't need the strong one for the night. I think most of my scabs fell off during these days.

Day 12: Felt a lot better than on day 5. Pain: 3/10

Day 13: Had to go to college but apart from it being exhausting, it was manageable. Pain 2/10

Day 14: again, feeling a little better. Pain 2/10

Present: I don't wanna say it's over, since I heard full recovery takes 6 weeks. So I am still taking it easy.



Tips and tricks that helped me:

Stay hydrated, as everyone here says, it is important!!!

Eat normal food. Yes it hurts. Yes it tastes awful until the scabs fall off. Yes I also wanted to never eat or drink again but you need this, so the scabs fall off sooner. I only ate liquid food only on the day of my operation.

  
Ice cream is a scam! It burned or tasted awful cause of the scabs.

It is okay to be in pain and to take your medication. No one will laugh at you for taking it longer. I always thought I had to be tough, there is no tough in recovering from a surgery.

Sleep when your body tells you to. I slept a lot during the day and I needed it, because the nights were not relaxing.

1oj9e8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RyanGeorge/comments/1oj9e8n/pitch_meeting_for_pulp_fiction/,Pitch Meeting for Pulp Fiction,"I wrote it myself.

Producer: So you got a movie for me?

Writer: Yes sir I do, it's called ""Pulp Fiction"".

P: Interesting title, it doesn't really tell us much about what the movie's about.

W: No it doesn't, and I bet you still won't even know what the movie is about after I explain it to you!

P: Oh well go ahead!

W: So you see it opens with a scene of this couple talking in a diner. They have British accents so you expect them to be sophisticated, but it actually subverts your expectations because they're not and are just petty crooks.

P: Oh and so are they talking about planning a heist or something?

W: No, they're just complaining about how it's hard now and how other heists have gone. But then they do get this idea that they could just rob the diner and wonder why no one robs restaurants.

P: I can think of plenty of reasons. There's too many entrances and exists, anyone in the restaurant could also be packing, it would attract a lot of attention outside...

W: Well they don't realize that. They just come up with the idea, talk about it for like 30 seconds, and then decide to do it, and the robbery starts.

P: Well at least seeing the robbery scene might be pretty cool.

W: It will be! ....except we won't see it then. The scene will stop as soon as they announced the robbery and then you get to sit through 5 minutes opening credits.

P: Oh, well do we at least get to see the robbery after the credits?

W: Oh no. See we're going to jump to these two completely unrelated characters, two hitmen driving to a job and we listen to their conversation.

P: So they're talking about the job they're about to do.

W: No, they're talking about the names of fast food in France!

P: Is this supposed to keep the audience engaged and be interesting?

W: It is interesting! See one points out that because they use the metric system a quarter pounder with cheese isn't called that there, it's called a ""royale with cheese"" instead. Isn't that so interesting?

P: Not really.

W: Well anyway when they get to the site they load up guns and then go up to the apartment and they're talking about giving foot massages.

P: Should they be quiet and trying to keep a low profile? That seems like what hitmen would do.

W: I never said they were good hitmen. Anyway they get into the apartment and they find these guys sitting around eating burgers. And you see that gives them an opportunity to point out the royale with cheese thing to them, so that bit paid off!

P: I don't think people care too much about talking about burgers in a movie about hitmen.

W: Well don't worry because that doesn't last long. You see one of them grabs this briefcase that is what they came there for, while the other one just kind of threatens the other guys.

P: Couldn't they just leave now that they have what they came for?

W: Yes but they won't.

P: Why?

W: Because.

P: That works.

W: So anyway the other guy is talking to a guy at the table who's getting really nervous and apologizes for stealing this case from a guy named Marcellus Wallace. So the hitman starts yelling at him and asking him if he can speak English and waves a gun in his face. And then he tells him to describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.

P: Is there a point to him doing this?

W: Oh there is. See a bit after it he preaches this Bible verse to him.

P: So he came there to give him a sermon.

W: Well sort of. The Bible verse isn't even real, it was just made up for the movie. Anyway after that both hitmen shoot him.

P: Couldn't they have just done that without all of this talk?

W: Maybe but it'll be way cooler this way?

P: It's much cooler to first hear guys talk about burgers and yell asking what a character the audience hasn't seen yet looks like and preach a fictional Bible verse?

W: That's what we're going with. Anyway after this we see a scene where the hitmen are giving the briefcase to that Marcellus Wallace guy we mentioned earlier. Except they're wearing shorts and t-shirts instead of the suits we saw them in earlier, so that shows that something happened in the middle! See we're keeping the audience interested.

P: Over a clothing change? 

W: Yep! And when they're there Marcellus Wallace is talking to this boxer and it looks like he's bribing him to take a dive.

P: Hey didn't you mention they turn over the briefcase to him? Does it show what's in it?

W: No.

P: Oh, well what is in it?

W: *I don't know.*

P: So you don't show it even later.

W: Nope.

P: I think the audience probably will care more about what's in the briefcase instead of why those characters changed their clothes.

W: Well then I would have to actually think of something to put in it, and that's too much work.

P: Fair enough.

W: Anyway we now go back to one of the hitmen from earlier, Vince. You see Marcellus is leaving town so he wants him to take his wife out and keep her entertained. So we show a scene of him buying heroin from his dealer, and then he meets her.

P: Oh and what's her deal?

W: Well they talked about her in the earlier scene, she's an aspiring actress. Although so far the only role she got was in a TV pilot. And because someone in the audience might know what that is we'll have Vince say he doesn't know because he doesn't watch TV, so it has be explained to him.

P: So what do they do?

W: They go to this 50s themed diner and then do a twist contest, and they win the trophy. Oh and the woman orders a milkshake and Vince is shocked it costs $5.

P: Well that is a pretty expensive milkshake!

W: Indeed it is! And it's not like 30 years from now people watching the movie will think that's actually standard price for one now or anything.

P: Oh no definitely no.

W: Anyway they get back to Marcellus' home, and then his wife decides to snort cocaine as she likes to do. Except she mistakes the heroin Vince has for cocaine, so she passes out and almost ODs.

P: Oh no!

W: Yeah, so of course Vince panics, and he drives her quick to the dealer because of course he can't take her to a hospital.

P: So he just hopes the dealer has something to revive her?

W: Yep, but luckily he does! He gives her an adrenaline shot and she just instantly revives and is all good again!

P: Pretty sure that's not how a heroin OD works. She'd still have to go to the hospital and be monitored until it's all clear from her body, and that could even take days.

W: Whoops!

P: Whoopsie!

W: So anyway he takes her back to the house, she agrees not to tell Marcellus about it, but she does tell him this lame joke she mentioned earlier at the restaurant from the pilot she was in but refused to tell.

P: You could probably cut this movie's length in half if you just cut out mundane stuff like this probably.

W: Well things are going to get good now. See remember that boxer we mentioned earlier? Well his name is Butch and we now get a flashback to him as a young boy.

P: Oh and what happens?

W: Well this Vietnam veteran who was in a prison camp with his father shows up, and gives him this really long monologue about a family heirloom of a gold watch that his father stuck in his butt in Vietnam to keep safe.

P: Uh....

W: Yeah and now he gives it to the kid. Isn't that dramatic?

P: More just weird.

W: Well then it cuts to the adult version of him. And then we see after the boxing match. See he didn't take a dive, he just took the bribe money and then bet it on himself. And he won the match, in fact he actually killed the other guy in the ring!

P: Wow that might traumatize him a bit.

W: Nah he seems totally fine with it.

P: So...he's basically a sociopath?

W: Maybe. We also show him this taxi ride he takes from the match. And the taxi driver is this woman who recognizes him and keeps asking him what it's like to kill a man.

P: She's not appalled or anything?

W: Nah just curious. Although he doesn't really answer. So anyway he gets to his hotel and meets his girlfriend.

P: And what's she like?

W: Well she has a European accent and just babbles about weird stuff mostly. Like how she wishes she had a pot belly because that's sexy.

P: I don't think most people think that.

W: Well she's pretty strange! Anyway we find out she packed everything but forgot the watch.

P: So she forgot the most important thing?

W: Yep.

P: Why didn't he just keep the watch in his bag he took to the match or have her keep it in her purse or something?

W: So the movie can happen.

P: Fair enough.

W: So Butch goes back to his apartment even though he knows Marcellus and his men may be there waiting for him to get his watch.

P: Oh it's probably going to be tough for him to get the watch back!

W: Actually it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

P: Oh really?

W: Yep. He just walks into his apartment and finds the watch on a cat-shaped lamp and grabs it.

P: That seems a bit anti-climatic.

W: Well then he also decides to make pop-tarts in his toaster instead of just leaving.

P: That doesn't seem like something someone would do normally.

W: No, but then he finds a gun on the counter. You see that Vince guy from earlier is there, but he's in the bathroom and just left his gun there.

P: Why didn't he take in with him?

W: Because he didn't. So then he gets out and Butch uses the gun to shoot and kill him!

P: Wow wow wow wow wow...wow.

W: Then Butch leaves...and when he's driving away runs into none other than Marcellus Wallace! See he was at the apartment with Vince but left and is now coming back.

P: Why'd he leave?

W: To get donuts!

P: That works.

W: And so the two fight, and Butch crashes his car and they both end up in a pawn shop. And then the owner there just pulls out a shotgun and takes them both prisoner.

P: You know I think that police attention would've been attracted by now with everything that has gone on so far.

W: Well I guess a lot of the police called in sick today or something. Anyway the pawn shop owner has them tied up in the basement and he calls over this guy named Zed. And then Zed and the pawn shop owner decide they're going to abuse Marcellus first, so they ask they guy they call ""the gimp"" all dressed in latex to watch over Butch.

P: This all happens in the basement of some random pawn shop they just ended up in by accident?

W: That's what we're going with. But you see Butch is able to escape and knock out the gimp. And when he gets upstairs he decides he's going back to rescue Marcellus.

P: He's going to rescue the guy who was trying to kill him just a few minutes earlier?

W: Yep. So he looks around the shop for a weapon and eventually decides to use a Japanese katana.

P: Why is there a katana just hanging around in the open?

W: Well it is a pawn shop, you know all sorts of stuff you can find there!

P: I'm pretty sure I've never seen a katana in a pawn shop, no, I don't believe it's a commonly found item in them.

W: Well this one does! Anyway Butch goes downstairs and cuts up the owner and frees Marcellus who takes the shotgun and shoots Zed. And then Marcellus promises to let Butch go as long as he tells no one else about this and never returns to Los Angeles.

P: Going to be kind of hard for him to explain to all of his hitmen and underlings why he's not seeking Butch anymore if he's not going to talk about what happened.

W: Yeah but that happens off screen so we don't need to worry about it. Anyway Zed drove up to the shop on a chopper.

P: Interesting terminology.

W: And because Butch wrecked his car he gets back to the hotel by stealing Zed's keys and driving the chopper back to pick up his girlfriend, and now they have to hurry quick to get to the train station they have a ticket for. And his girlfriend asks whose motorcycle this is, and Butch tells her it's not a motorcycle it's a chopper.

P: I don't think that type of pedantry would be his priority right now....also wouldn't that be like saying ""this isn't a car, it's a Ferrari""? A chopper is a type of motorcycle.

W: Not to Butch. But then she just asks whose chopper it is and Butch says it's Zed's, and when she asks who Zed he is he replies ""Zed's dead baby. Zed's dead.""

P: That raises more questions than it answers.

W: Yeah but it's a cool line! Anyway we now cut back to the scene from the hitmen in the apartment earlier. And you see it turns out there was another guy hiding in another room who hears the gunshots and he also has a gun.

P: Oh no!

W: Yeah and he shoots at the hitmen but every shot misses! And then they just look confused for a second and then they return fire. So they're in the car now driving off with their informant from the apartment. And the other hitman who is named Jules is convinced they were saved by divine intervention, but Vince is skeptical. Like Vince is talking about how he once was watching Cops and saw a guy shoot at the cops a bunch like that at close range and every shot still missed.

P: I thought Vince said earlier he doesn't watch TV.

W: Whoops!

P: Whoopsie!

W: So Vince decides to ask the informant they had in the back seat what he thinks it is, but he does this while casually waving his gun around and pointing it at that guy in the backseat.

P: That seems careless.

W: It does and it is because they hit a bump and then he shoots the guy in the back accidentally.

P: Oh no!

W: So now the car is covered in blood and parts of his brain and skull, so they have to ditch it. So Jules says he knows a guy in the area and they pull up to his place. And by the way this guy is going to be played by the director and the guy who really wrote this movie.

P: And what's his deal?

W: He says the n word a lot.

P: That's it?

W: Well and he also buys good coffee apparently. Also his wife is a nurse that works the graveyard shift and it's early morning and she's almost off so they need to get rid of the messy car and their clothes before then.

P: Oh wow it's going to be pretty hard for them to get rid of all that stuff quickly.

W: Actually it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

P: Oh really?

W: Yep, they just call a guy and he comes over and cleans it up.

P: That's it?

W: Yep, they just call this guy up and it shows that he's at some sort of like cocktail party but he says he can be over there in ten minutes.

P: Didn't you just say it's the early morning? What sort of cocktail party is happening then?

W: *I don't know.*

P: Fair enough.

W: So the guy helps them get all the bloody clothes in the car and then they have to also shed their suits and get dressed in new clothes. That's why they were wearing T-shirts and shorts in that earlier scene, see!

P: Again I don't think that was something the audience was very interested in.

W: Well we explained it! So they go to a diner after that and Jules is talking about how he's going to leave his life of crime because he was granted redemption and a second chance from God. Oh and by the way this diner is the same one from the first scene!

P: OK...

W: Well then that robbery happens. But the robbers get really caught up in that briefcase and the male one even yells ""is that what I think it is?""

P: But we still haven't shown what it's in it.

W: No we haven't. But Vince is able to grab that guy at gunpoint, and then gives him a minutes long lecture about how he's not going to kill him and let him go as his first act of redemption. Oh and he gives him all the money from his wallet as well.

P: OK....

W: Oh and he quotes that made up Bible verse from earlier in the movie. But he's doing it now in a different context because he believes God saved him earlier so he's letting him go in redemption as well. See this stuff all ties together!

P: Well it's still a made up verse though. Also it's a bit weird that he used the same fake verse both to illustrate why he was going to kill someone and why he was going to let someone go.

W: Yeah but it sounds cool! But Jules tells him he can't give him the briefcase because it doesn't belong to him. So instead he tells him to just leave now with the money from his wallet and all the other wallets they collected from the people there.

P: So Jules can't give him the briefcase because it doesn't belong to him but he can let him keep all the wallets from the other people that also don't belong to him? Also if he's trying to redeem himself returning the wallets to those innocent people would make sense too.

W: Yeah but that might break up the dramatic tension having to have them hand all the wallets back. So both the thieves and the hitmen leave the diner, and then the movie is over.

P: OK....well yeah you're right, I still don't really know what that movie is about.

W: But it's fun right!

P: It could be. But definitely not going to be an Oscar nominee or anything like that.

W: Oh definitely not, I'd be very surprised if that happens!

P: Yeah and people definitely won't still be talking about in 30 years or anything like that.

A normal morning

The alarm echoes against the walls of my bedroom, slowly increasing in volume as my conscious state of mind slides into focus.  My cat, Ciri, vigilant with the slits of her pupils adjusting to the light now bleeding from the overhead fixture.  I lay there for a moment, calm, quiet, sober.  

Last night was the first night I didn’t dip my mind into the happy stupor of tequila to quiet the aches of solitude.  I felt, tranquil.  Closed my eyes for a little while longer before rushing through the morning routine to prepare for work.  Ciri guided me through the apartment while I could pay attention only to the narrowing window of time I had to get into my car and arrive to my work building to clock in.  She had the look of wanting to for something, unfortunately my employment demands took precedence and I choose to dash with a quick goodbye.  She was left to solve the problem on her own.  

I zoomed down the regular streets, stuck behind a driver going half the speed limit.  After a few blocks I grew impatient, flipped the car into sport mode, and dashed past him.  Stop sign.  Oops.  Police car.  Driver side open, he’s just getting in.  “Alright, he definitely didn’t see me blow through that stop sign”.  The rest of the drive smooth and tired with the sun still receded behind the horizon.  Winter is coming, the months of gray sky that encompass the length of the Midwest for a large portion of the year.   Leaves still on the tress.  This quiet twilight of the season is my favorite.  The chill is  just enough to layer up in a warm jacket, and there’s a burst of color as the leaves begin to change and shed.  

Parked, coffee, elevator, punch-in.  I smile at the man in grey scrubs picking up the garbage bags from the common areas.  A symphony of disorganized high pitched alarm tones and indicators.  Each one with a different meaning, unique, yet they become as noiseless as the wind after a few years of unceasing indications.  The mind filters out the useless noises, and becomes alert only to the ones that require an adjustment to the daily chores.

I knock.  “Coming in, I’m with the ____ team, good morning”.  Someone sleepily looks up in a hospital gown.  We exchange in pleasantries and I smile to ameliorate the annoyance this individual must feel at the countless interruptions to their sleep leave them feeling more and more disoriented.  Some keep their vibrant spirits, goals, the reason for being.  Some give up their autonomy and relegate themselves to the endless demands of patient care, becoming observers of their own lives as sickness derails their previous unbothered existence.  I enjoy the ones who complain.   The ones who speak up so that someone might hear their voice and assist them in their burden.  The ones who forego the niceties of expectation and verbalize the things which weigh upon their spirit so that those things might be addressed.  I only specify this group because many times these are the types to be seen as a burden, complicated, rude.  For that, I despise the superficial niceties of convention.  For when one is suffering greatly for a time untold, perhaps one reaches the limit by which gentle words will no longer suffice, and one must shout to the heavens so that someone, anyone, will sidestep their own lockheaded desires and hear the plea of another.

In Sweden, snus – those little pouches of smokeless tobacco – are everywhere: from open-plan offices to construction sites. No smoke, no ashtrays, no stepping outside for a cigarette – just a quick pouch from your pocket and back to work.

**Why Snus Is So Popular**  
Snus has been part of Swedish life for generations, evolving from a rural habit into an everyday product. Unlike smoking, it doesn’t bother anyone – no smell, no interruptions. For many, it’s almost like their favorite coffee: always handy, especially during stressful moments or long workdays.

**Team Spirit Through Tobacco?**  
Surprisingly, yes. Snus can be social: pouches get passed around, new flavors are tried, and recommendations shared. It helps new team members feel included, and hierarchies subtly fade in the process.

**Productivity & Focus**  
Whether in IT offices or on construction sites, many Swedes swear by snus to stay focused. Not an official productivity booster, but a quiet companion for long hours at the keyboard or workbench.

**Bottom Line**  
Snus is more than just tobacco – it’s a cultural phenomenon shaping workplaces in Sweden. Experience it and you’ll see a mix of tradition, team bonding, and a practical nicotine kick.",1,1761755540.0,Jobs_abroad,0,1.0,False

However, recently I've noticed that when I pour the first cup of coffee a small amount of plain water comes out of the carafe lid before the rich black coffee comes out. I've tried various things to keep this from happening, with no luck: leaving the top off and tilted to drain any residual water, shaking the water out before putting it on top of the carafe, leaving it sit to ""dry up"". The latter works if it's left out for a couple of days, which of course is unlikely and uncommon. 

This became more of an issue because my wife insists on cleaning the top with soapy water, claiming that will keep any old stale coffee water from collecting. I'm concerned that this will cause soapy water to collect and then drain into our coffee cup (though as far as I can see, the water seems clear and clean). So I guess there are at least 2 issues/questions:

1. Is the water collecting in the top an issue to be concerned about? What could cause this??

2. Is it ok just to rinse the top thoroughly after use or should it be washed in soapy water?
