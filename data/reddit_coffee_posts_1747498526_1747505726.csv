 I’m a final-year Bachelor of Psychology (Hons.) university student. For my final-year research project, I’m conducting a study to better understand how using online dating platforms—like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel—might be related to social anxiety.

Specifically, in this study, I’m exploring how engagement with online dating platforms (like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel) is related to social anxiety in young adults. I’m particularly interested in whether fear of rejection and upward social comparisons (i.e., comparing yourself to others who seem more attractive or successful) help explain this relationship.

Understanding these psychological processes could offer insights into how online dating affects mental well-being—especially for people in this age group.

You Can Take Part If You:

* Are **18 to 25 years old**
* You’ve **used an online dating platform** before (even just once!)

# 🧠 What’s Involved?

Just a quick **anonymous survey** that takes around **10 minutes** to complete. All your responses are confidential and will only be used for academic purposes.

I'm a 25-year-old guy from hyderabad who's recently embraced the idea of stepping out of my comfort zone and connecting with new people. While I might come off as shy at first, I promise there's more to me than meets the eye.

Physically, I've been told I look good, but I believe true connections go beyond appearances. I'm all about meaningful conversations, shared experiences, and creating lasting memories.

I'm looking to meet like-minded individuals who are open to fun, laughter, and perhaps even a bit of adventure. Whether it's exploring new places, trying out different cuisines, or just having a good chat over coffee, I'm up for it.

If you're someone who values genuine connections and is ready to have some fun, let's connect and see where things go!

**What I’m Looking For:**  
A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**  
Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*.

Who Am I?

By day, I dance with code. By night, I’m a soul trying to unravel the secrets of atoms. I’m on the path toward a PhD, so my evenings are filled with equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life can be intense, but I find peace in the small, quiet moments.

What Am I Looking For?

A companion to slow down time with—someone I can dive into real conversations with, free from pressure or expectations. Whether it turns into a deep relationship or a solid friendship, I’m seeking moments woven with trust, laughter, and presence.

My Everyday Escapes:

Late-night talks that stretch into the early hours,

Spontaneous walks through quiet streets, getting lost in little cafés no one notices,

Motorcycle road trip dreams across Europe: open roads, fresh air, and a playlist we build together.

Hobbies & Curiosities:

I’m on a fitness journey, discovering the healthiest version of myself—inside and out.

I’m also designing my first tattoo. Got a favorite design or a story behind yours? I’d love to hear it.

1koza7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Specific_Ad_2042/comments/1koza7q/frappucheeseo_chapter_1c_from_spoil_to_spark_the/,Frappu-Cheese-O — Chapter 1c: From Spoil to Spark – The Lacto Revelation “Contamination is just fermentation without consent.”,"
The modern world trains us to fear spoilage. We recoil from curdled milk, wrinkle our noses at sourness, and discard any product that deviates from its factory-stamped perfection. We've been conditioned to see microbes as enemies—intruders that ruin, corrupt, and threaten our control over the edible world. But beneath the thin veil of expiration dates and preservatives lies a much older truth: spoilage is just the first stage of transformation.

The sealed Starbucks bottle, with its unsettling stratification and strange bottom-mass, seemed spoiled by all conventional metrics. But spoilage implies failure—an end point, a loss. What had occurred instead was evolution. The dairy hadn’t rotted; it had fermented. The sugars hadn’t vanished; they’d been converted. And the resulting substance wasn’t a warning—it was an invitation.

The revelation came not in disgust, but in recognition.

Here was lactic acid fermentation in action, unbidden and unbothered by industrial standards. Bacteria—most likely Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, or a close cousin—had found their way into the drink and performed their ancient ritual: digest sugars, excrete lactic acid, lower the pH, and in doing so, separate milk’s proteins into soft curds and protective whey. It's the same method that has been used for millennia to make yogurt, kefir, labneh, and fresh cheeses—only here, it wore a new flavor profile: one of coffee, cocoa, and caramelized sugar.

This wasn’t mere contamination. It was an accidental act of culinary synthesis.

Rethinking the Spoiled

The “spoilage” lens, so dominant in food safety culture, obscures nuance. Not all microbial activity is pathogenic. Not all cloudiness is rot. In fact, some of the most revered foods on Earth—brie, kimchi, sourdough, miso—rely on the deliberate cultivation of microbial life. The difference lies not in the presence of microbes, but in the intention and conditions surrounding their work.

In the case of the Starbucks bottle, the lacto-fermentation likely occurred due to:

A slight temperature fluctuation during transport or storage

A surviving colony from imperfect pasteurization or post-process contamination

The ideal ratio of sugar to milk to water, creating a lush growth medium

A sealed anaerobic environment that prevented spoilage by aerobic molds or yeasts


The result? A controlled, acidic environment where only acid-tolerant, food-safe bacteria could thrive.

This was not a biohazard—it was proto-cheese.

A Shift in Perception

The bottle did more than ferment milk and sugar. It fermented thought. It challenged the assumption that uniformity equals safety, and that deviation equals danger. It demonstrated that even within the confines of modern packaging, fermentation finds a foothold. It invited a shift from fear to fascination, from control to collaboration.

It was the bacterial equivalent of a street artist tagging the side of a sterile, corporate factory. It said:

> ""You forgot the wild. We didn't.""



That spark—tiny, invisible, microbial—ignited the concept of Frappu-Cheese-O: a deliberate exploration of this accident, not just for novelty, but for meaning. What if modern food products, packed with sugar, emulsifiers, dairy, and flavorings, could be reimagined as fertile grounds for post-industrial fermentation? What if flavor wasn’t the end result of design, but of emergence?

The Lacto Revelation, Defined

The lacto revelation is this:
Fermentation is not just preservation. It is transformation. It is collaboration with an ancient intelligence that predates agriculture, recipes, and even language. And sometimes, it begins in the least likely of places: a corporate coffee bottle gone rogue.

Frappu-Cheese-O is not just a project. It’s a philosophical reorientation. A reminder that in a world obsessed with sterility and shelf-life, the true frontier lies in the spontaneous, the subversive, and the serendipitous.

Spoil became spark.
Mistake became muse.
And cheese, improbably, got caffeinated.

Needless to say we’re busy. I WFH so admit I have more flexibility but it’s still super stressful. 
A typical weekday is I get up at 6:50, get the 3 kids fed, make my wife a coffee (she’s still in bed) and get dressed. I then make kids lunches and get kids ready for school, get the 2 older ones on the bus (one at 7:50 and the other at 8:20). I then bring my youngest to preschool to hopefully get back a little before 9 to start work (sometimes rushing to get on a 9am call). 

My wife drinks her coffee in bed, gets up, dressed, and then usually comes down and leaves for work a little after 8. Some days she can work from home or go in later but still doesn’t help with the morning routine.

I’ll try and do thing around the house to take little breaks from work. Clean up the dishes and mess from breakfast, pickup random stuff around the house, wipe down counters, do laundry, cut the grass, fix broken shit….you name it I try and cram it in during the workday if possible. 

She’s often home from work by 2, but she never uses that time to do anything domestic. She has work to do at home as follow up from work in person but is often too overwhelmed to do any during the workday day when  she’s home either. She gets behind and then needs time on the weekend (read I handle the kids) so she can get caught up. Still not doing anything domestic. 

The night routine is dinner and we divide putting each kid down. Then she goes to bed by 9:30-10. Sometimes we talk for a few, other times I get to our room after putting a kid down and she’s already asleep. Then I go downstairs to clean up after dinner, sweep, etc. 

Of course I’ve tried to talk about this numerous times. The morning routine, the cleaning, all of it. I get the reasons that “I’m too tired, my job is demanding, I can’t take on anymore….” So I just leave that argument and deal with it for another week or 2 until it comes up again. Rinse and repeat for the last several years. 

To make it worse, I like things clean/neat. I’m not a super brat freak but my clothes are always in my dresser, closet, or a hamper. She’s got clothes all over the bathroom floor, hanging from open vanity drawers, on her dresser, spilling out of all dresser drawers which can’t even close. She has 3 dressers, and a large walk in closet (with clothes hung and all over that floor along with other random crap). When I cook (she does do a decent amount of cooking) I clean as I go. Use a bowl to mix something, I wash it and put it on drying rack, put slices away after using, etc. she leaves a huge trail of tears with it all over the counter or filling the sink (which I clean after everyone is in bed). 

Just not sure what to do. We had a cleaning lady for a while but they come every week so it didn’t solve the day to day. I know she does a lot of scheduling appointments, finding social activities and sports for them to do, planning our family schedule, etc. but I also handle all of our finances, car and house maintenance,plus do a decent amount more of the driving kids to and from activities. 

To wrap up my rant…am I the only dad dealing with this shit? It makes me stressed all the time and I just don’t know how to deal.

1koz01l,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKhiking/comments/1koz01l/golden_valley_pilgrim_way_cheap_accessible_60_day/,"Golden Valley Pilgrim Way: cheap, accessible 60 day walk in Hereford","I just finished the Golden Valley Pilgrim Way, a 60 mile circular walk in Hereford.  It's only been operating for a couple of years, and is set up by the Deanery of Abbeydore in Hereford and they offer cheap accommodation in churches along the route.  I thought people might find it useful to know about because it makes doing a week’s walking low cost, and is a good entry level multi day hike in a beautiful and sparsely populated area of the country.

**Disclosure**:  I did not get on with my boots and on some days took shortcuts along empty country lanes, so I can’t speak to all of the route, but I can review the logistics, vibes and accommodation.

**Booking**: To book you email the deanery with the dates you would like to be in each of the accommodations, and they get back to you with the availability.  I think its just one person managing all of this, so I did have to wait a few weeks. I think they are pretty booked up this summer, but there may still be some availability.  A few weeks before you go they send you a booking form and ask you to pay in advance for the accommodation (£22 per night) and if you want it a pilgrims pass which you can get stamped in each of the churches (£7 - beautiful, fun).

**Route:** This is a circular route which starts at Hereford Cathedral and then goes into rural Herefordshire.  I got a custom OS map which had the GPX route overlaid onto it (about £25), and I also used the GPX and the OS app, and a compass.  The route isn’t signposted, but the GPX is good. The biggest issue I found was that the countryside was so sparsely populated that some of the footpaths were overgrown. This was a mild annoyance in fields, but a real problem in some of the wooded areas where storms had blown down trees, and the path completely disappeared. I had some hairy moments in steep woods, and one day I decided to retrace my steps and go the long way round because I couldn’t see a route through.  The route mostly goes on footpaths, and occasionally on quiet lanes.  There are a few hills, but generally less than 300m of ascent a day.  Incredible to see the Black Mountain range. 

**Accommodation:** They only book one pilgrim party into each accommodation spot, so if you are going on your own you will have the whole church to yourself.  It almost felt like staying in a bothy at times.  All churches had electricity, and all but one had running water (and the one that didn’t had bottled water). They all had kettles and tea, coffee and biscuits and sometimes a few bits more. Not all of them had heating, but the ones that didn’t tended to have lots of blankets and hot water bottles.  The churches were often very cold, so I would recommend taking your warmest sleeping bag!  When I went it was very sunny and so I would often just lie out in the graveyard until 1900-2000, where it was much warmer than inside the church.  Each church has a camping bed, so you don’t need to bring a mat. Some churches had indoor loos (and one had a shower), some had portaloos, and for one you had to use the loos at a campsite not far from the church. A couple of churches did have bells throughout the night, but I still got enough sleep to walk the next day. For each of the churches, you have the number of the church warden, so you can contact someone if you need anything, and a few of them popped in and said hello and were very friendly. Seeing how much care they had taken in making the churches welcoming to pilgrims and the wider community was lovely.  

**Food:** Food is very doable, and in places lovely, but you do need to plan ahead a little bit.  There isn’t a pub or village shop at every stop, though the more remote churches tended to have some packets of porridge oats and biscuits.  I usually had 3-4 meals with me at a time.  The village shops seemed to have excellent opening hours, but the pubs opened at different times and on different days, so you do need to check beforehand what’s open when you are travelling. If you are vegan, the village shops at Longtown and Kingstone are excellent (and the others are just normal village shops!), and the Pandy Inn and the Carpenter's Arms do lovely vegan options.  I also had some Huel with me and found that useful. 

**Overall**, (blisters aside) I had a great experience. The countryside was beautiful, I saw lots of lambs, I generally got to the churches early afternoon, so lots of time for dozing among the gravestones, watching swifts. The churches were interesting. Everyone I met was friendly, including the farmers. Would recommend.

**Useful links:**  [Here](https://www.abbeydoredeanery.org/gvpw/) is the webpage for it, which contains detailed route guides and GPXs as well as details of how to book. 

And if anyone would like my OS map of the route I’m happy to send it out to them.

My fiance and I have been together for 7 years. During that time, we have both suffered with mental health issues. (Myself with anxiety and a fairly new autism diagnosis and my partner with depression/anxiety)
I should also mention that while I work a regular 9-5, she works as a hotel manager, so nearly always works evenings and weekends.

She finds it almost impossible to say no to people, and I don't just mean sexually.
Work ask her to come in early, work an extra day etc, it's always yes. Friends or family ask for her help on her only day off, always yes.

In December I found out that she was texting other people who she met online and the texts were sexual in nature. She never met these people physically and it was all over text, no images, at least none that I found.

About 8 weeks ago I found out that she had actually met up with one of those people and he performed a sexual act. On her on his van, she did not return the favour.

Then, just the other day, I found messages between the 2 of them again. Platonic on her end but extremely suggestive on his end. They were arranging to meet for a coffee but I found the messages before the meeting.

On each occasion I have been very upset. The last time this happened (after they physically met) I said I couldn't do this anymore. 
The only reason I did not end it the other night, is because there was nothing sexual from her and they were only meeting for a coffee.

I know she has some very deep rooted issues that need to be resolved and I genuinely want to help her get through them.

I also know that a lot of people will think me and idiot for staying but I believe her when she says she is sorry.

I'm just not sure how to go about navigating this or how we can get through it.

I grind with kingrinder p2, started with 40 clicks, but now moved to 43 with mixed success (perhaps I should go coarser still?). My hob does not provide constant power, but rather pulses on the lower levels

I've got an issue with my brewing. when I was brewing the first three throwaways (following James Hoffmann vids) first two came out perfect - at least technically, didn't taste them obviously - the third was already problematic. It was steaming, couldn't start brewing and when it did it was sputtering instantly and couldn't fill the upper compartment. 

Later brews sometimes brew nicely, sometimes sputter instantly and struggle to brew.

Since then I have tried upping the weight of the coffee in the basket - around 18 grams seems to usually work, so not the regular 1:10 ratio.

As to coffee - I found that whenever I try to use a nicer coffee, that's a bit lighter roasted the sputtering happens. When I use a cheaper one (brazil and columbia Bellarom mix from lidl) I tend to get better results.

From what I gather from the symptoms I might be having seal issues? When I use 15 grams the basket isn't that full (again, ground too fine? I maybe i flatten it too hard when knocking the basket on the table?), so I guess it might be raising when pressure boiler rises. But still, it didn't happen on first two brews, one was I think around 18 and the second 15 grams.

I'm at a loss here, I saw a short in which the person ground the top of his boiler on a whetstone to give it a better seal with the oring, but it seems a bit extreme...

1koyxdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/glioblastoma/comments/1koyxdc/my_dads_brain_cancer_didnt_break_me_but_nyu/,"My dads brain cancer didn’t break me, but NYU langone front desk did","I understand visitor limits. At the first hospital my dad was in, I waited patiently to see him — no drama, no complaints. I only remember it because someone I knew came to visit him and I felt so grateful to see them that I thanked them at the elevator. I get that hospitals have policies.

But what happened at NYU Langone felt like something out of 1984 or a cold dystopian horror movie — robotic, hostile, dehumanizing, and totally illogical. It wasn’t like being in a hospital full of people navigating grief and crisis. It felt like trying to get visiting rights in prison.

I showed up at the main lobby to visit my dad in the ICU. They told me there were already three people upstairs and two would have to come down. I explained that one of the “three” was someone just passing through — not even an official visitor — and I didn’t know him, couldn’t reach him, and couldn’t drag him down to the lobby just so the desk could check that two had “stepped aside.”

They told me to call my dad. I said no — my dad had inflammation in his brain after surgery and I wasn’t going to stress him out by telling him I was stuck in the lobby and unable to see him.

Security told me to step aside.

Then my brother called me and said the nurses had approved me to come up. “Just go tell them you have permission,” he said. So I got back in line and tried again.

The front desk refused to acknowledge it. I was still on the phone with my brother — he was trying to help me navigate what to say — when the security guard stepped in. I will never forget how he told me to “step aside and get off the phone” because I wasn’t allowed to talk to him and be on the phone at the same time. He ordered me off the call like a power-tripping mall cop. I hung up immediately — terrified that if I pushed back, I’d be banned from seeing my dad.

And then I cried. I stood in the lobby of a major hospital sobbing uncontrollably for over 30 minutes. I couldn’t stop. Something snapped in me. I eventually got up there after my brother came down, handed his pass to the guard so I could go up, and went to get a coffee. When he came back later, they just let him up again like none of it mattered. The whole thing was stupid, cruel, and unnecessary.

By the time I finally saw my dad, my eyes, nose, and lips were swollen from how hard I had cried. And I never told him what happened — I didn’t want to cause him more stress.

I know I’m not special. And from what I saw in the lobby — person after person being pushed aside — it’s clear that so many families walking into that hospital have some kind of unique situation or moment of confusion when they approach the front desk. What a cruel way to treat every single person coming into a hospital, where the very nature of their presence is almost always some kind of crisis.

If NYU Langone wants people moving through the line faster, they should have more staff at the front desk — not security treating every grieving or panicked family member like a threat. I'm sure I’m not the only one this happened to. ",4,1747504347.0,glioblastoma,0,1.0,False

It stood there, inconspicuous among its kin. Same label. Same brand. Same flavor. But something was off. Not enough to ring alarm bells, just enough to whisper.

It was a mocha-flavored Starbucks Bottled Frappuccino, nestled behind a row of identical companions in a convenience store fridge. A single degree warmer here, a slightly longer shelf-life there—whatever the cause, this one had taken a detour from its destiny. Instead of the homogenized smoothness expected of mass-produced coffee milk, its contents were stratified. Separated. The bottom held a thick, custard-like plug—mottled, slightly gelatinous, and opaque. Above it, a translucent golden liquid shimmered under the fluorescent lighting. It looked like something organic had taken hold, like a sleeping seed of transformation.

And yet, the bottle was sealed. Unopened. Unshaken. Intact.

To the average passerby, it was a reject. A silent warning: Do not drink. To the managerial eye, it was a refund. A fluke. To the trained eye? It was an artifact.

You don’t forget the first time you meet a rogue fermenter.

The bottle had likely sat there for weeks, unnoticed, slowly undergoing its quiet revolution. The sugars—lactose from the milk, and added cane sugar—provided an abundant buffet for whatever microorganism had slipped past the kill-step in the factory’s production line. And while industrial pasteurization is designed to eliminate almost all viable microbes, the occasional survivor finds a way—especially if the refrigeration chain falters, even for a moment.

No bloating. No bulging cap. No signs of dangerous gas production. This was not the chaotic froth of yeast. It was the orderly acidification of lactic acid bacteria. The same kind used in yogurts, kefirs, and raw milk cheeses. Nature, once again, doing what it does best: transforming the perishable into the preserved.

What struck most wasn’t the risk—but the potential.

The tactile realization: When the bottle was tilted, the glob at the bottom remained firm, resisting gravity like a jellyfish hugging the glass. Squeezing the bottom offered a bit of bounce. The term “coffee cheese” popped into the mind not as a joke, but as a hypothesis. A caffeinated curd. A sweet, tangy treat born of accident. A biochemical mistake begging to be repeated—on purpose.

A bit of quick math followed:

Milk + sugar + time = fermentation

Fermentation + lactic acid = curds and whey

Curds and whey + caffeine = Frappu-Cheese-O


It wasn’t madness. It was microbiology.

A shelf-stander turned prophet, that misfit bottle didn’t just offer a glimpse of spontaneous fermentation. It offered a proof-of-concept. The Frappuccino line, packed with dairy and sugar, is a pre-primed substrate for lactic acid fermentation. Given the right conditions—warmth, time, and the right starter culture—one could replicate and refine the process to produce a reliable, safe, and delicious cheese-like product with notes of coffee, vanilla, and cocoa.

It was an invitation, not just to experiment, but to listen to what the shelf had been quietly saying all along:

> “Pasteurize all you want. I still have secrets.”



Thus began the journey—not in a lab, not in a kitchen—but in a refrigerated aisle, between boredom and curiosity. A tale of the shelf-stander: the overlooked prophet of a fermented future.

Fairly new to Austin, and TX, and only been here for about 7 months. 

Lived in a New Orleans suburb for 5 years, abs never had a fly infestation there, for example, or any of the other states I ever lived.

Living in a very old apartment complex, that was built back in the 60's, so I do not know if that makes any difference. 

There are 16 apartments in my building, and they all might share the same vents, so maybe the flies are coming in through my vents, from my neighbors apartments. 

They are extremely annoying, and I am starting to go crazy, lol. 

Never been through anything like this before. 

I the past, if I were to leave bananas out for too long for example, woukd get Fruit flies, but they would go away, a few data after I got rid of the bananas. 

Not here though. This seems to be something entirely different. 

I am doing everything I can think of to try to get rid of this issue. Cleaned out my drains using Vinegar, baking soda, and boiling water. That has not helped. 

So, now I am trying these sticky fly traps that you plug into the walls, hoping that will help.

Anyways, I am just curious, if this something that Texans in general have to deal with, in their homes, every summer? 

Also, off topic, but having to deal with flies even at cafes / restaurants, and coffee shops that I visit. 

I just hate flies so much, lol.

Day of Botox - lump in throat, just a little discomfort but nothing too crazy

Day 1 - felt good. Got lunch and ate it with some water but the slow swallow was annoying. Gurgles hit after I had a coffee and no relief. However they wore off and I just kept tilting my head to my right shoulder. Around 3PM I started to get some micro burps out but they were smaller than ones I had experienced before. I kept tilting my head and at night, I kept micro burping. I even got some small to medium ones out, it was great. Then I started trying to make myself burp by sucking in air (which I could never do before) and although I didn’t fully have it down, it was getting small ones out!

Day 2 - kept going with the manual burping. Extremely promising. Got a medium one out about mid-day. Turning my head to the right still seemed more effective when I had to get one out. The slow swallow was killing me though, just annoying but without water definitely felt like I was choking. Bloating isn’t as bad but it’s still there. Sucking in air releases air but pushing out seems to get actual short burps out. 
Kept pushing them out. Some were real, others likely a result of the Botox. Most able to get them out when I felt pressure, I would suck air in and turn my head to the right, then tense my neck. The gurgles weren’t nearly as prominent but I was still quite phlegm-y.
Went to the gym for 2 hours and thought I’d forgot how to do it after but quickly got it back. Had a Pepsi max when back and burped so loud, multiple times. Girlfriend told me I shouldn’t need to force myself to do it so I’m going to see what happens and try to lay off the manual burping (I am doing it a lot) and see if some come out naturally.

**Hey Fragrance Enthusiasts!** ✨ Have you ever come across a scent that felt like a warm embrace on a chilly day? One that feels like it's draped you in the softest cashmere while strutting down a red carpet? Well, let me introduce you to *Majestic Cashmere* from Bentley—a perfume that just might make you feel like royalty on a budget! 🎉 But the real question is, does it deliver, or is it all just hype?

In a world filled with average perfumes, *Majestic Cashmere* positions itself as a standout.

I've been her confidant for about two years, but she didn't know how I felt until last Christmas. To be honest, I didn't know either until we saw eachother at a party a few weeks before Christmas and she invited me to a 2 person afterparty that I had to decline for work reasons. I spent the next month kicking myself for not joining her, and resolved to ask her out when I saw her just before Christmas.

We were scheduled to spend 8 days working together just before Christmas, (different companies, but same industy so we often colaborate) so I drove to her city and asked her how she wanted to spend the evening since it was already after working hours. She says she would like to Go Bowling, then get some coffee, and knowing her a bottle before the night is out. I had planned to spend a few days seeing if she showed any signs of intrest before saying something, but this seemed like a perfect First Date opertunity. So that's I go to the bar she told me to meet her at, and that's when she introduced me to her Brand New Boyfriend. 

I already knew this man. He was the one who broke another coworkers arm on a previous work trip. She asked why I wasn't happy for her, and then dragged the truth out of me. I told her how I felt and voiced my concerns about her being with him; but was dismissed as being jealous. (not entirely untrue, but my concerns were still valid) I accepted the loss and we complete the work, then I drove her to the Warsaw airport where she flew home and I spent Christmas with some friends that live there.

Fast forward to two weeks ago. She calls me crying about some unrelated bad news, and during the conversation mentioned that she had broken up with him for all the reasons I had warned her about at Christmas; but she was still living with him. A week later I had work-reasons to be in her town again so we planned to meet up at a local restraunt for drinks and to let her do my hair. (She's the only one I let touch my hair. It's a cultural thing, The closer connected two people are the more Magic is woven into the braid.) Dinner goes great, and we Wind up leaving the bar with a girl she met there. The 7 people in our party spend the evening drinking at our new friends house. 

In the morning she is angry that the other guy hasn't texted her to make sure she's alive, and tells him to pack his shit and leave. I do my best to be supportive because I can see how much this hurts her, but I won't lie and say that I wasn't overjoyed. She knows me well enough that I'm sure she can tell, but we are both tactful enough not to say anything. We spent the day together, and Wind up at another bar where we are invited to an afterparty. 

Towards the end of this afterparty she kissed me, and spent the night clinging to me like a drowning woman clings to flotsam. The next day I help her into a cab and we both go back to her house. This is her first time being home since kicking the other guy out and she has a breakdown. I held her as she cried, then resolved to fetch some hangover cures for her. She takes my hand and kisses me one more time before telling me to be back as soon as possible.

That night she had a panic attack due to an incoming Rocket Threat. I held and comforted her through that, and we wound up sharing the bed while I held her. The next day she says that she still needs me, so I spent the day playing nursemaid to her and her brother who is sleeping on the couch. (and who was present at all the aforementioned drinking) We share the bed again, but I noticed that she recoils every time we touch.

In the morning I asked if we could talk and she says yes. I pointed out how my actions the past few days show how much I care about her, how much she depends on me, and how great we could be together. She says she doesn't care about any of that because she simply doesn't see me that way, and that she doesn't need me to stay any longer. I had already stayed two extra days at her request, so I leave as scheduled. As I'm leaving she says that she is too sick to talk about this now but she will call in a few days and gives me a hug.

How do I turn this Friendship into a relationship? What do I say on the upcoming phone call for her to at least consider me? I accept that we may not be forever, but to be dismissed out of hand is going to literally kill me. As in, I have been asked by a friend to serve as Combat Medic for his Assault Unit in Ukraine. What I really wanted was for her to ask me to stay with her instead of going to fight. I'm tired of living, but I could tollerate it if I was with her. I would much rather give my life to her instead of giving it to a Russian bullet. 

Please, no useless advice about how I just have to accept her decision. I already know that. If this wasn't a matter of (my own) life and death I wouldn't be so desperate to be with her; nevermind how amazing she is. She is literally one of the strongest people I have ever met, and I need her strength to survive this.

A clear layer of pale whey floated above a thick, gelatinous mass that sat like a primordial glob at the bottom of the bottle. It looked wrong. But not wrong in the way of rot. More like something that had become.

What most shoppers would have dismissed as a spoiled product—or worse, a food safety hazard—stirred a different current of thought. Here was a sealed environment, presumably sterile at packaging, now clearly altered by unseen forces. And yet, it didn’t reek. It didn’t bloat. It had fermented, not failed.

Curiosity gave way to recognition. The white blob at the bottom of the bottle wasn’t just clotted milk—it was curd. The watery layer? Whey. And the likely culprit? A rogue strain of lactobacillus or similar lactic acid bacteria, finding a sugary milk playground in which to feast, acidify, and separate the casein proteins like tiny microbial cheesemakers. A coffee-flavored dairy cheese had been born in the wild—unexpected, unsupervised, and almost poetic in its defiance of industrial uniformity.

From Spoil to Spark: The Lacto Revelation

In the golden age of processed beverages, every bottle is a promise of sameness. Pasteurization, preservatives, and quality control erase the unpredictable chaos of fermentation. But when something slips through—when the lid stays tight and the culture sneaks in—nature writes its own recipe.

That singular bottle was not a hazard. It was a herald.

It called to mind ancient cheesemaking traditions: shepherds discovering curds in the stomachs of goatskins, yogurts arising spontaneously from warm milk left in clay pots. Lactic acid bacteria have always been nature’s silent artisans, converting perishable dairy into preserved treasure. In this case, their canvas was commercial coffee milk.

Thus was born the idea: What if we intentionally coaxed this process? What if we could capture that same microbial magic, harness it, and craft a coffee-infused dairy cheese—Frappu-Cheese-O—as both an experiment and a statement? Could we, by controlled fermentation, fuse modern indulgence with ancient alchemy?

This book is the answer to that challenge.

A blend of science, art, and culinary punk ethos, Serendipity: Making Frappu-Cheese-O is your guide to recreating that accident on purpose. It charts the journey from spoiled curiosity to edible innovation, where fermentation meets frappuccino and cheese becomes caffeinated.

Here, we embrace contamination not as failure, but as invitation. Welcome to the world of accidental alchemy—where serendipity becomes strategy, and the future of food bubbles quietly in forgotten bottles.

1koyhcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RightsRisingMama/comments/1koyhcj/land_parents/,Land Parents,"🌟 Let’s Talk Land Patents: Unlocking the Power of True Land Ownership! 🌟

Hi, my fellow freedom-loving parents and curious souls! I’m just a mom who’s passionate about keeping my family safe, free, and empowered—whether that’s packing healthy lunches, cheering at soccer games, or digging into the laws that protect our way of life. Today, I’m super excited to share something I’ve been learning about through an incredible resource, TeamLaw.net: land patents. These aren’t just some dusty legal documents—they’re a key to understanding true land ownership and securing your family’s future. So, grab a cozy blanket and a cup of tea (or coffee, no judgment!), and let’s dive into this together. What does owning your land really mean to you?
What’s a Land Patent, Anyway?

I’ll admit, when I first stumbled across the term “land patent”, I thought it sounded like something from a history book. But here’s the scoop: a land patent is the ultimate proof of ownership for land in the United States. It’s “the only form of proof of absolute title to land” in the U.S., backed by court rulings like U.S. v. Stone (2 US 525), which calls a patent the “highest evidence of title” against the government or anyone with a lesser claim. Think of it as the gold standard of owning your property—no one, not even the government, can challenge it once it’s properly secured. How does that kind of security make you feel about your home or land?

A land patent is a permanent title, granted by the federal government (or, in places like Texas, by the state), that assigns ownership to you, your heirs, and assigns forever. Unlike a warranty deed, which is what most of us get when we buy a house, a land patent stands supreme in court. They cite cases like Wineman v. Gastrell (2 U.S. App. 581), which says a patented grant is a public law, giving notice to anyone who tries to claim your land later. And get this: Summa Corp. v. California (466 US 198) ruled that a land patent even beats a state’s constitution! Have you ever wondered what kind of title you hold to your property?

Why Should Moms Care About Land Patents?

As a mom, I’m always thinking about protecting my family—not just from scraped knees or too much screen time, but from bigger threats to our freedom and security. TeamLaw.net opened my eyes to how land patents connect to our rights as Americans. They say our founding fathers lived as “free natural sovereign independent people” on their own land, with no central government controlling them. That’s the kind of freedom I want for my kids! But over time, many of us have forgotten about land patents, accepting things like title insurance or warranty deeds instead, which don’t carry the same weight. What would it mean for your family to have unshakable ownership of your land?

Here’s the kicker: 
TeamLaw.net points out that land protected by a patent “can’t lawfully be seized for debt or taxes.” That’s because a land patent is the true title to the land, not just a “color of title” like a deed. They clarify that property taxes often come from private contracts you enter with the state (like when you sign up for a mortgage or register your property). A land patent doesn’t stop you from entering those contracts, but it can protect your land from being taken if you don’t. Have you ever thought about how your property taxes or mortgage agreements might affect your ownership?

The Catch: It’s Not a Magic Shield

Now, before you start picturing a land patent as a superhero cape that wards off all government rules, TeamLaw.net is clear: it’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card. Some folks—especially in certain “sovereign citizen” circles—think land patents let you dodge taxes or zoning laws. TeamLaw.net debunks this, calling it “inaccurate or misleading news.” They stress that while a land patent secures your title, it doesn’t exempt your land from state regulations once the title passes from the federal government. For example, in Michigan, the Supreme Court has said land patents are subject to state laws just like any other property, unless it’s a specific issue like submerged land (see Klais v. Danowski). 

What myths have you heard about land ownership, and how do you separate fact from fiction?

TeamLaw.net also warns that land patents aren’t a fix for every legal problem. In a forum post, they explain that using a land patent in court (like against a lawsuit over deed restrictions) might not work unless the case directly involves your title to the land. They’re all about helping you learn the truth for yourself, not just taking their word for it. How would you start researching the title to your own property?

How Do You Get a Land Patent?

So, how does a busy mom (or anyone!) go about securing a land patent? TeamLaw.net lays out the basics: you need to prove your claim to the land, usually by tracing your chain of title back to the original patent. This might mean getting a certified copy of your warranty deed or, if you have a quitclaim deed, collecting every deed back to the original one. They offer resources like a “Do It Yourself Land Patents” album and a “Land 101” mini-course on their forum to guide you. They also mention that you don’t always need to file a land patent publicly, but doing so can protect your interests. What steps would you take to find out if your land has a patent already?

For those of us in unique states like Texas, it’s a bit different. TeamLaw.net notes that Texas never ceded its lands to the federal government, so Texas land patents come from the state, signed by the governor. If your land traces back to something like a Spanish Land Grant (like the Espirito Santo Grant in Texas), you might already have a strong title, but a patent could add extra security. Does your state have a unique history with land ownership that might affect your rights?

Why This Matters for Our Freedom!

Here’s where my mama bear heart gets fired up. Learning about land patents isn’t just about paperwork—it’s about reclaiming the kind of liberty our founding fathers fought for. TeamLaw.net says that by 1971, many states stopped electing officials properly because people forgot about their land patents and the power they hold. They argue that securing your land patent is a step toward standing as an “Elector,” like our forefathers, with your “Land, Liberty, and Rights intact.” As a mom, I want my kids to grow up in a world where they can own their home without fear of it being taken away. What kind of legacy do you want to leave for your children when it comes to their freedom?
TeamLaw.net’s mission is to help us “learn how to learn” the law ourselves, not just rely on others’ opinions. 

They encourage us to dig into primary sources, like the Bureau of Land Management’s records, to verify our land’s history. They even offer tools like conference calls and a WARN newsletter to keep learning. I love their approach: don’t just believe them—prove it to yourself! How empowering would it feel to uncover the truth about your property’s history with your own research?

Let’s Team Up for Freedom!

I’m just scratching the surface here, but I’m hooked on learning more about how land patents can protect our families and our rights. TeamLaw.net has been my guide, and I’m so grateful for their straightforward, no-nonsense approach to teaching about law, freedom, and property. Whether you’re a homeowner, a renter dreaming of your own land, or just curious about your rights, I invite you to explore this with me. Check out TeamLaw.net, dive into their “Land Patents: Understanding How They Work” page, or join their Open Forum to ask questions. What’s one question you’d love to ask about your property or your rights?
Let’s keep the conversation going! Share your thoughts below, and let’s inspire each other to learn, grow, and protect our families’ futures. Together, we can set “brushfires of freedom in the minds of men,” as Samuel Adams said. Here’s to owning our land, our rights, and our freedom—mama style! 💪

These 2 images meet the criteria for the portfolio I have been slowly building for the past 7 years. However I will probably not add them, since I find them too predictable and a bit boring honestly. 

The portfolio is called Urban Unposed and it tries to showcase different people living their normal life, framed in a somewhat interesting composition and light, while keeping their identity anonymous. Trying to make them part of the overall composition and not the sole subject. I try to use the concepts I learned during my time as a landscape photographer while combining them with my interest for street photography. I know this is nothing new or ground breaking, but it has helped me create a more defined style with the years. 

I am building a website to publish my portfolio. Once I am finished with this project (if i ever even finish it), I will probably print it as a book for my coffee table.

      The day I met him it was the day I was falling in love with him. It was tall, kind, sweet and so gentle with me and we went to drink coffee.  At night I was tired and he told me that he could host me if I wanted but at first I refused the offer because I didn't want to have sex from the first date. He promised we don't have sex and we didn't. 
     The next day (the 14th) in the morning he got up earlier than me made me coffee, and kissed me.  For the first time, I was feeling safe and warm with another, so I let him hug me and we sat on the couch. We talked and after an hour he left for work and me for my home thinking if it was a dream or not. 
         The time went through and it was finally officially a relationship. In the first week of our relationship he heard me talking on the phone with my mom telling her that I wanted the albums 30 and 19 by Adele the vinyls and as fast as lightning he got those albums as a gift to me
        The relationship lasts for 1 year. After 6 months I saw him lose interest but I thought it was my head playing games as it was my first relationship ever and I didn't think about it so much.

1koyemc,https://i.redd.it/5yeomzshnd1f1.jpeg,Ranking every milkshake flavor at Talley Market,"Hey everyone! I'm Kyle, and I'm a chem major. You might have seen me around main campus as the guy with long hair and Celeste hoodie.

Around the beginning of March I realized I had too many dining dollars for the rate that I was going through them, so I decided to try every milkshake flavor to have something fun to do. Before this I only ever really got chocolate or peanut butter swirl, so I wanted to try more of them for my future and so I could give good recommendations to other people. At the end of the day most of them were at least good and even the ones I don't care for are popular choices, so a takeaway is that you can't go wrong when choosing a flavor; however, some of them were definitely better than others for me, so here's my ranking from worst to best.

**Nope:**

Butter Almond: I like butter pecan, but drinking something that tastes like butter felt wrong to me. The almond bits also kept clogging up the straw and this was the only milkshake with bits in it that did that to a significant degree. This might have been C tier if the straw was wider.

**Okay:**

Cherry Vanilla: take vanilla and add a cherry flavor that is marginally better than cough syrup. If they used black cherries or any other real cherry and not maraschino then they might have been on to something here. Going in it tastes like vanilla with a hint of cherry, but the aftertaste tastes like benzaldehyde smells. (Maybe don’t go huffing benzaldehyde vapors though, even if it smells kinda good.)

Java Bean: It actually tasted nice going in and this was the best experience I’ve had consuming coffee, but my breath smelled like coffee for a day and a half after that and that kind of ruined the experience for me.

**Good:**

Vanilla: Ironically, this is the only flavor I didn’t get around to eating. But like, do I need to? I know what Howling Cow vanilla tastes like, and I think I can reasonably infer what it tastes like as a milkshake. It’s good, but it’s also boring when you have 14/15 other flavors to choose from. If your go-to is vanilla, please consider trying a different flavor, you will not be disappointed.

Chocolate: I can say what I previously said because I remember when plain chocolate was my go-to just a few months ago. I like it as a milkshake much more than as ice cream because I think it fixed the biggest issue I have with Howling Cow chocolate ice cream: it’s just too strong and sweet (this is also my issue with the chocolate milk here). It’s mellowed out a little by the vanilla they add which makes it better to me. It’s still a default and kinda boring flavor, but far from being bad.

Cookies ‘n Cream: Having this without cookie chunks in it is weird. I’m used to the shakes they have at Cook Out that are amazing, but this was still good.

Campfire Delight: I was told to try this one in particular because it was really good, so I made sure it was the last one I had. As a milkshake, this is basically a graham cracker flavored shake, which was good but also kind of disappointing compared to the higher flavors.

**Pretty Good:**

Peanut Butter Spin: I like this as an ice cream because the bits with a lot of peanut butter or a lot of chocolate gives it a little variety as you eat it. You lose that in the milkshake, but the flavor is still quite good.

Moos- I MEAN WOLF TRACKS (yeah): As an ice cream this is peak, but as a milkshake it’s kind of just Peanut Butter Spin with hard chocolate bits in it. It’s pretty much interchangeable with PBS but I’d say it’s a little better.

Mint Chocolate Chip: This was my first time having mint chocolate chip ice cream. I figured I kind of knew what to expect because I’ve had chocolate mints (or chocolate or mint) and yeah, the flavor was about what I expected, which was pretty good. Having it be cold works well with the natural cooling effect of mint, which was a fun experience.

Tuffy’s Toffee: I’m sure this is lovely as an ice cream, but as a milkshake it’s basically Sea Salt Caramel with bits in it, and this time I don’t really care for the bits. Still very good.

Cookie Dough: Another first in ice cream flavors. The shake felt and tasted like cookie dough which was awesome to me. I guess I don’t know what I expected with it.

**THE BIG 3:**

Banana Pudding: I liked this flavor way more than I thought I would. Normally I think banana pudding is just okay and a decent topping for a cake, but somehow having it cold with an even stronger banana flavor was what it needed to feel special. The banana, the whipped cream, and the sugar wafer were all coming through and it all combined to make b a n a n a. If you want to try something a little off the beaten path, this is the flavor I recommend the most.

Sea Salt Caramel: This feels like the kind of flavor that can’t go wrong. It’s a cream sugar treat flavored by more sugar; how could that not be good? This was the flavor that made me want to try out every flavor in case the other flavors could wow me like this one did, and I tried it again near the end because I was skeptical on whether or not this flavor could still hold up (spoilers: it did).

Strawberry: My biggest issue with strawberries is that I just don’t like their texture very much. The flavor is good and almost anything strawberry flavored is awesome to me, but give me an actual strawberry and I can feel the seeds and the weird squish after the initial bite (source: I tried one a week ago to see if I was just holding a grudge from a few years ago and still felt that way). This makes me also not care much for strawberry ice cream because then you can feel the fruit bits while eating it and it’s just strange. However, as a milkshake the bits are blended in and become pretty much nonexistent, meaning I get the flavor with no drawbacks. It’s basically the best strawberry yogurt you’ve had but it’s also rich and cold. I know it seems strange to have a default flavor up here when the other two were relatively low, but I don’t see how this couldn’t be my #1 after it blew me away.

That's my ranking! This was a really fun thing to do even if it probably wasn't the best for me. I at least tried spacing them out so I wasn't just getting a shake every day for what it's worth.

No one responded but I thought you ladies might enjoy some sapphic poetry. Kind and helpful critiques are welcome! 


My lover shuts her eyes in the pale morning light.
The sun soon bathes us in gold.

Oh, her lovely countenance!
It makes me weep.

If I had money, I would buy her silver and gold. 
Instead I bury my face into her nape.

Mugwort, a smell more appealing than the name. 
It's sweet, yet less so than my lover.

I run my fingers against her skin. 
Silk isn't as soft or as even in tone. 

A flicker of a smile begins to form on her perfect lips. 
Her gentle eyes, deeper than coffee and more radiant than the sun, begin to flutter awake. 

How can I resist laying a kiss upon the lids of those perfect eyes? 

I am rich in kisses,
I bestow them freely and recklessly upon her. 

The eyes are the dawn of the eruption. ",4,1747502944.0,actuallesbians,4,1.0,False

My husband looks conservative; big guy with a beard dressed in the standard hoodie and baseball cap. Drives a pickup, has worked blue collar jobs most of his life, and we live in a red state. He's from the south and grew up with typical 'yes ma'am, no sir' manners beaten into him by strict baby boomer parents. Living with him so long, I occasional gender my thanks as well. 

We vote blue, put our money where our morals are,  and fly the rainbow flags to support our friends and family. 

Today, he had an experience that really made us think about micro aggression couched in manners. His favorite coffee hut has a new ftm Trans employee. As he was reaching for the coffee, he voiced his customary 'thank you ma'am'. The word ma'am had no thought behind it but came out like it was italicized or in bold. 

He paid and said 'thank you' when given his receipt. He felt really bad. Looking at him objectively, it probably sounded like he did it with hate in his heart. 

Being a cis woman does not absolve me from growth and flying a rainbow flag is performative if your words suck. We will be careful with our words. We will update what we think is polite and make sure our respect is inclusive. 

Stay safe my friends!

We were a party of 6 at a diner for breakfast, I (28F) was planning to pay for all of our food. But my sister's fiancé, we’ll call him Ben, ended up paying the tab. We all LOVE Ben btw, but he hasn't lived in America very long and his English and overall etiquette is okay but could use some refining; even my dad mentioned this to him. 

Anyway, there was one person working the floor, she was our greeter and hostess for a second and then a few moments later she was our full time server. She was delightful, made jokes and laughed at ours, was very attentive, apologized when she forgot small things and got it for us right away (my family is a handful at restaurants but this didn’t phase her one bit). She did all this while the restaurant was getting busier and she had more tables to take care of. 

Ben and my mom needed more creamer for their coffee/tea. We couldn’t find our waitress so, before I could advise him otherwise, Ben went behind the counter to get it himself, albeit there’s no sign to say “Employees only beyond this point” but it was a very clear no-go zone. The server came out a yelled at him that he’s not allowed back here for safety reasons since he doesn’t have non-slip shoes. But her attitude made Ben and my dad turn on her, now she’s the enemy and doesn’t deserve a tip on our $150+ tab. After my family went to the car I stayed behind to buy a small side and added the tip for her separately, when I got to the car my dad put his hand in my face like I was a child and said I had BETTER NOT have gone back to tip her, I lied and said I didn’t.

1koyblt,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1koyblt/getting_your_first_freelance_design_clients/,Getting your first freelance design clients,"I see this come up so often I decided to do a deep dive on starting out. Long post, but hope someone finds it helpful. 


Getting your first clients as a freelance graphic designer 

i used to work at a company called Blip TV making custom ads. Innovative stuff with dynamic content, feeds, store locators, and all kinds of things. When working with media agencies on campaign ideas, they would frequently ask:

""We want never been done ideas! Don't hold back. We want the most innovative concepts."" 

Then, without any sense of irony, they would add:

""Ideas must have a proven track record of success.""

It used to drive me insane. 

Media agencies aren't known to be risk-takers. But interesting, creative, impactful work requires risk.

I like to think that my personal risk tolerance is pretty high. I walked away from a comfortable tech job with great pay, benefits, and paid vacation days (I haven't had a real vacation since). But it took me 15 years before I actually did it!

My dream of having a business existed since before I even started college. So, fresh out of university in Newcastle, I was beginning to make my moves, pitching animated logo ideas to anyone who would listen. 

Then, out of the blue, a full-time role presented itself.  

Back in Chester, my Dad was talking to a new neighbor who had just moved in. My Dad was a natural salesperson. It turns out that the new neighbor was launching a web development / online media company. Dad, of course, proceeded to sell the shit out of me and convinced the neighbor to meet me. I had to pass three rounds of interviews, but I am under no illusion that without my Dad initiating the conversation, it would have taken me a long time to find my first 'real' job. Also, looking back, I was nowhere near ready to survive alone as a freelancer.

So, I took the job and promised myself, ""I'll start my company in a couple of years."" Well, a transatlantic move to NY, four more full-time jobs, and 15 years later, I finally took the plunge. At every crossroads over that time, the desire to go solo was strong. Still, fear held me back: lack of confidence in finding work, the crushing weight of being responsible for everything, and later on, the security of my wife and two young kids. And yes, those deceptively inviting free snacks and other corporate perks like 'Healthcare' also kept shackled.

TL;DR - Finding a reason not to do something is easy. Sticking to an idea and making it a reality takes relentless determination, resilience, and a willingness to be scared but do it anyway.

I get why parents try to encourage their kids not to pursue a career in 'the Arts.' But, at the same time, F that! If you're passionate about something, then go for it. My Dad waited till he was almost retired before starting his own business and often said he wished he had started sooner. It took me 15 years, and I wish I'd started sooner.

BUT... and this is a big but (like in the song); if I had started too soon, I would have failed. Similar to the media agency, I want people to do amazing things that have never been done before, but the risk makes me want to recommend only doing things with a proven history of success.

The 'dream' of being your own boss is so egregiously misrepresented online that it sets unrealistic expectations of what will happen when you do go for it. Every YouTube or, even worse, LinkedIn influencer who promises riches if you follow their '5-step framework for success' continues to feed into this idea that if you're not doing exceptionally well, there must be something wrong with you. ""Just comment 'success' below for my free guide!""

All of this is a long introduction to what I believe are the best methods to landing your first few gigs. You may even call it a framework for success. (HA!)

Navigating the New World
First of all, none of this is simple or easy. But there's more opportunites out there than ever, with more businesses being started than ever. For aspiring graphic designers, particularly freelancers who are flying solo, understanding the challenges is critical to overcoming them.

Industry Challenges
Global access: High-speed internet is amazing, but it has made every person on the planet a potential competitor.

The insane acceleration of tech: AI and new tools empower us to be more productive than ever. However, they also lower the barrier to entry, so more people are calling themselves graphic designers.

Economic rollercoasters: During times of uncertainty, companies like to hold onto their cash. Marketing and creative budgets are often first on the chopping block. 

Personal Challenges
Portfolio: ""I don't have enough examples, and/or they're not good enough!""
Finding work: ""I don't have good connections. Where do I even look to find the right projects?""

Enough with the problems! Let's talk solutions. 

Shift your mindset
I got some good advice from a mentor at SCORE.org (a resource I highly recommend, regardless of job type or industry!) when talking about the challenges of finding new clients.

""You're approaching this all wrong,"" he said. ""You're thinking like an employee who needs to find a new boss. Start thinking like a business that solves problems.""

Even as an independent freelancer, you need to think of yourself as a business that is out to crush the competition.

Solutions for Industry Challenges:
First of all, industries with high competition = high demand and, therefore, opportunity. If there was zero competition, then you should worry.

Remember that the challenges extend to the people on the other side of the table. Anyone hiring is overwhelmed. That's why they're hiring! But how are they supposed to wade through 1,000+ applicants, most of which are frankly low quality? If it's a new business, they likely haven't hired a designer before and will be dealing with a thousand other stressful priorities. 

The #1 takeaway here is that you must do everything you can to make your potential clients' lives easier. Make it easy for them to find you, see your work, and contact you. At every stage, you need to be a breath of fresh air compared to everything else they have going on. Make it easy for them to say yes.

It is a combination of nailing your portfolio and relentlessly putting yourself out there. This will lead to being able to find, land, and fulfill client projects, that then lead to the real golden ticket - referals.

Portfolio: 
The biggest mistake I see is people over-designing or over-engineering their portfolio website. Your portfolio ""is your storefront,"" giving people a look at the wonders inside. Or think of it like an art gallery presenting masterpieces. It's not a masterpiece itself. (Ignore the Guggenheim.) 

Make it simple and easy to read with clear, well-presented examples of your work. I get it. My early portfolios were often over-designed monstrosities. It's hard to resist. But remember, the #1 goal is to make it easy. 

Display your work in context (mock it up) and add short descriptions of your role in the project. If I'm hiring and see, say, a website design. Well, what did YOU actually do? Was there already branding? Did they give you a brand guide to follow? Were there existing photos and icons to use? If not, how did you go about making them? I care way more about how a designer thinks and develops their ideas than pure technical talent.

And make it easy to navigate! If I'm looking for someone to do some printed materials, I only want to see your print work. If I'm in a particular industry, ideally, I want to see relevant samples. 

Each project should be well presented on the homepage, but also have it's own page. The homepage should give enough info that I don't HAVE to click. But if I do, there is value to it. 

Respect the viewer's time. They're likely stressed out, so don't frustrate them further. 

Separate project or category pages are also important to easily share relevant work without just linking someone to your homepage.

""But what if I don't have enough samples to fill out my portfolio?""

Well, honestly, make more. 

If you don't have enough, the only way to proceed is to make more. Some people redesign existing materials to fill out their portfolios. That's fine. Just never misrepresent it. One approach I often recommend is to extend the work you have already done. For example, if you have a design you did for a local coffee shop's newspaper ad. How would that look as Digital Banner ads? Or a social media promotion. Maybe an email design or their menu? You already have the assets and overall look and feel done, so making additional versions in different formats is a quicker way of adding more samples than new concepts. 

Last word on portfolios. Get a frick'n custom domain. For about $15, you can have a professional-looking web and email address. supercoolgraphics@ freeemail doesn't look quite as trustworthy as info@ supercoolgraphics . com. Also, relying on sites like behance isn't good as the viewer is only one click away from a million other designers.

Finding Projects and Networking
Networking and referrals are how you get good projects. Referrals require building a client base already, but networking is something that you can do tomorrow. 

I had a designer ask me last week if it was worth the money to go to a design conference to network. ""Hell no!"" I said, ""Why would you want to be somewhere filled with your competition!"" I suggest finding small business expos and industry-specific tradeshows. Try talking to your local chamber of commerce or directly to some local businesses. The work is out there. It isn't easy to motivate yourself to do it, but that is why you must! Your competition is probably just as nervous about finding clients but probably won't do the leg work. 

Make it easy for them to find you by going out and finding them. Going to a few of these places with some custom business cards (nothing fancy, order online and pick-up at a FedEx or Office Depot.) Have a QR code on the back linking to your portfolio. This will give you more opportunities than 1,000 job applications or Upwork submissions. Most of the people you give the card to won't contact you. Very few will right away. But in a month or two, when they have something come up, they're likely to remember you. 

You need to put yourself out there for serendipitous moments to occur. One of my favorite quotes is:

""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""

Yes, you need some luck. But you also need to be positioned to take the chances you're given. It was lucky my neighbor was starting a business. But if my Dad hadn't gone over and initiated a conversation, we would never have known.

There are low points where you can feel totally overwhelmed by the amount you have to do but simultaneously feel unable to do any of it. Focus on small wins. Ignore the massive pile of todos. Pick one. Focus on only that one task and fucking crush it. 
Be relentless, and you will make an impact.

Hey fellow Redditors and closet Vogue editors,

Have you ever imagined waking up to a wardrobe that gets you better than your morning coffee does? Fasten your seatbelts, or should I say, your velcro sneakers, because AI has sashayed into fashion and it's not just predicting trends - it's inventing them.

- AI's personal stylist service: Imagine having a personal stylist that doesn't judge your snack binges but judges your floral shirts perfectly. That's right, AI can now analyse your past outfit choices, calendar events, and even your mood to whip up an ensemble that would make even Miranda Priestly crack a smile.

- Tailored to fit - down to the nanometer: Gone are the days of the one-size-fits-many disasters. Advanced AI algorithms are revolutionizing custom-fit clothing, because it understands that you are as unique as the pattern on your thrifted 90s windbreaker.

- Fabric that thinks: Eco-conscious threads are not just a trend, but a necessity. Some insanely smart AI is now creating sustainable materials that not just think for themselves, but can also change color on a whim or adjust their temperature. Yes folks, mood ring shirts could be our future.

- On the runway: Detox your jealousy for the supermodels; with AI, you're the real walking masterpiece. Virtual fashion modeled through Augmented Reality (AR) by AIs is creating buzz. Why wear an outfit to the grocery store when you can wear it to the metaverse market?

- Predicting trend tsunamis: AI algorithmic crystal balls are the latest obsession for the fashion mafia. By sifting through mountains of data from social media, runways, and streetstyle, these programs are shaping what you'll drool over next season - or even next week.

Let’s chat optimization of style and sustainability, not to mention those saved hours we would usually drown in the indecisive 'what-should-I-wear' black hole. But beware - your AI stylist might just outshine you at your own cocktail party. *I wouldn't put it past them sneaky algorithms.*

What do you think about the takeover of AI in fashion? A step forward in harnessing technology for better fits and sustainable options, or a trendy gimmick we'll get over faster than Crocs? Comment below with your most fashionable thoughts.

Always remember, variety is the spice of life, but AI just might be the personal shopper. Keep strutting, humanity!

My day to day looked like this:

 6:00 am — Wake up, drink a glass of water, unlock the gates, meditate, shower, prep snacks, make coffee. 7:00 am — Morning huddle and sales training. 7:30 am to 3:00 pm — Sales calls. 3:00 pm to 4:00pm — Lunch and relax. 4:00pm to 5:00pm — Workout. Evenings — Help my wife with the baby, do chores around the house, then scroll mindlessly for a basket of cheap dopamine. Not proud of that last part but just being honest.

It all hit me one Saturday morning when I decided to pick up extra sales hours to help with income. In three hours, I made zero dollars. I was toiling for someone else, completely drained.

Don’t get me wrong, the product I sell is a health and wellness supplement that genuinely helps people. But as I sat on those calls, coaching strangers, I realized something: I could be doing this for my own people. My own brand. My own mission.

The only reason I wasn’t? Old fears. The same ones I’ve carried for years: “I’m not good enough.” “I don’t have the credentials.” “I need more experience.”

But something in me finally said, “Enough.” “You are so much more than this.” “You already have everything you need to begin.”

I didn’t quit my job that day. I still had bills, a loving wife, and a newborn to care for. But I did make a commitment to start building something of my own. A path forward that would eventually let me do the kind of work that lights me up.

I don’t have a perfect roadmap. But I do have a mission:

**To help individuals overcome burnout, create space for what matters, and transition into a life that feels aligned.**

The foundation of that mission is built on four core pillars:

* **Inner Work & Psychology** — Reflective prompts, IFS-inspired insights, emotional regulation, identity work.  
* **Fitness & Energy** — Simple, sustainable practices that support mental and emotional well-being.  
* **Lifestyle Balance** — Time, habits, relationships, environment. Tailored for busy professionals and parents.  
* **Mindset & Meaning** — Reconnecting with purpose and creating a conscious, aligned life.  

This was the moment I knew I had to change.

**If any part of this feels familiar, if you’re running on empty, stuck in a life that doesn’t reflect who you really are know this: you’re not alone, and you’re not broken.**

Start small. Start honest.

Your moment of change doesn’t have to be dramatic it just has to be yours.

And if you're ready to build a life that actually feels like yours, I'm walking this path too. Let’s figure it out together.

once upon a time, in the dusty corner of a cluttered desk that no one gives two shits about, lived a lonely paperclip. not just any paperclip, no no no—this one was a goddamn champion paperclip, the heavyweight champion of holding papers together. it didn’t have muscles or a face or anything cool, but it had the sheer will to stay bent just right to hold three sheets of paper without snapping like a cheap-ass noodle.

this paperclip had dreams. big dreams. like one day, it wanted to be a part of something meaningful, like holding together a billion-dollar contract or maybe saving a life by clamping a tourniquet on a bleeding arm (don’t ask me how a paperclip does that, it’s just the dream, okay?). every day, it sat there, surrounded by dust bunnies, old coffee stains, and forgotten sticky notes filled with cryptic scribbles no one understood. it watched the pens come and go, sometimes rolling off the desk and dying tragic deaths on the floor, but it stayed steadfast, a shining beacon of metallic hope.

then one day, a hand reached down—clumsy, greasy, and smelling like three-day-old pizza—and plucked the paperclip from its dusty grave. the paperclip felt a rush of purpose like never before. it was going to hold papers! real papers! important papers! but wait... shit... the hand tossed it onto a pile of crap instead. not the papers. the pile of crap. goddammit.

and so the paperclip’s epic journey continued, lost in a sea of useless junk, forever waiting for the day it could fulfill its destiny or at least not get stepped on by the office cat.

**chapter two: the paperclip’s tragic romance with a goddamn rubber band**

after being tossed into the pile of miscellaneous office crap, our hero, the mighty paperclip, found itself face-to-face with its nemesis and secret lover all rolled into one: a fucking rubber band. yeah, i know, who the hell ships a paperclip and a rubber band? apparently, i do, because this is where the plot twists harder than your grandma’s back after a lifetime of giving zero fucks.

the rubber band was a wild one—stretchy, unpredictable, and full of tension (both literally and figuratively). it bounced around like it owned the place, snapping occasionally and making everyone jump like little bitches. the paperclip was mesmerized. “hey, you stretchy bastard,” it whispered, if a paperclip could whisper—which it can’t, but just go with it—“wanna hold some shit together with me?”

the rubber band laughed, a sound like a thousand tiny slaps, and said, “sure, but only if you promise not to judge me when i lose my shit and snap under pressure.”

and so, they formed an unholy alliance. the paperclip would hold the papers tight, and the rubber band would keep things together with its elastic charm. they became the dynamic duo of desk supplies, feared and admired by pens, staplers, and the occasional terrified sticky note.

but of course, no love story is complete without tragedy. one fateful day, the rubber band got stretched too far trying to hold together a stack of goddamn invoices from hell. *snap!* it broke, flying through the air like a tiny slingshot missile, hitting the office manager square in the face, causing a mini explosion of coffee and profanity.

the paperclip watched in horror as its lover bounced away into oblivion, never to be seen again. “fuck,” it muttered, if a paperclip could mutter, which, again, it can’t. the paperclip was left alone, holding nothing but a couple of sad, empty sheets of paper and a broken dream.

and so the saga continues. will the paperclip find new purpose? new friends? maybe a glue stick to cling to? who the hell knows. but one thing’s for sure: this office is way too fucking dramatic for a paperclip to handle.

**chapter three: the paperclip’s midlife crisis and the great stapler conspiracy**

so there it was, our metal hero, lonely and brokenhearted after the rubber band betrayal, just sitting in the dark corner of the desk, questioning its very existence. “what the hell am i even holding together anymore?” it wondered. not that it could actually wonder shit, but again, pretend it can for the sake of this dumpster fire story.

then, out of nowhere, the stapler showed up. yeah, that loud, scary, evil stapler that everyone loves to hate. the stapler was basically the office tyrant—loud, painful, and always jamming at the worst possible moment. it looked at the paperclip with a smug little plastic grin and said, “hey tin can, think you’re better than me? think again. i’m the king of holding shit together.”

the paperclip felt a surge of anger—or at least it tried to, which is tough without muscles or a heart. “oh yeah? well at least i don’t require an actual goddamn manual to operate,” it snapped back, because paperclips are badass like that.

and that’s when shit got real. a fucking war broke out. pens were thrown, sticky notes got shredded, and the office manager nearly lost her mind trying to figure out why the hell her paperwork looked like a goddamn battlefield. the stapler jammed so hard it actually took a week off for “mental health,” whatever the fuck that means for a stapler.

meanwhile, the paperclip had an existential crisis and started attaching random shit that wasn’t even paper. it held together a stray receipt, a coupon for 10% off shitty coffee, and some goddamn doodles that no one wanted to look at. it became a symbol of rebellion against the oppressive stapler regime.

but then, plot twist, the paperclip discovered the biggest conspiracy of all: the office was actually run by a mysterious figure known only as “the Cleaner,” who had been secretly hoarding all the good paperclips in a locked drawer, laughing maniacally at the chaos.

**chapter four: the paperclip’s quest for the holy goddamn stapler remover**

after surviving the epic stapler war and uncovering the dark, twisted conspiracy of “the Cleaner,” our poor paperclip was left with nothing but shredded receipts and broken dreams. but all was not lost, because one fateful night, as the office lights flickered like a dying fucker on a horror movie set, the paperclip overheard whispers—whispers about the legendary artifact known as *the holy stapler remover*.

this mythical tool wasn’t just some lame-ass plastic thing. no, it was said to possess the power to undo stapler jams, liberate trapped papers, and basically be the messiah of all office supplies. and the paperclip, feeling its rusty little heart beat with hope (or whatever the hell paperclips have), decided it was time to embark on a quest. yes, a quest. like some knight of shitty office supplies.

so, the paperclip rolled itself—yes, rolled, because why the fuck not—out of the dark corner and into the unknown, aka the terrifying open space of the office floor. it dodged crushing footsteps, terrifying coffee spills, and the dreaded vacuum cleaner that roared like a beast from the depths of hell. every moment was a life-or-death gamble, but the paperclip was determined.

along the way, it made unlikely allies: a broken pen that only wrote in swear words, a sticky note with a faded motivational quote (“hang in there, asshole”), and a half-melted candle from the last office birthday party. together, this ragtag team navigated the perilous terrain of filing cabinets, avoided the psychotic office cat (that was probably out to get them), and finally reached the sacred drawer where the holy stapler remover was rumored to be hidden.

but as the paperclip reached out—holy shit, actual *reached* out—its metal tendrils trembling, the drawer slammed shut. *trap!* screamed the broken pen, but it was too late. the Cleaner appeared, a shadowy figure wielding a terrifying lint roller like a weapon. the battle for office freedom had reached its climax.

will the paperclip escape? will the holy stapler remover be freed from its prison? or will the office remain a goddamn chaos of jammed staplers and scattered papers forever?

stay tuned, you miserable twat, because the saga is far from over.

**chapter five: the paperclip’s betrayal and the rise of the sticky note rebellion**

so, after narrowly escaping the clutches of the Cleaner and his terrifying lint roller of doom, our hero, the paperclip, found itself at a crossroads. battered, bent, and emotionally unstable, it wasn’t sure if it wanted to keep fighting or just curl up into a sad little metal ball and never hold anything together again. but noooo, that’s not how this shitshow rolls.

while licking its metaphorical wounds (which, again, paperclips don’t have, but just fucking imagine), the paperclip stumbled upon the sticky note colony—a bustling, chaotic community of colorful little squares that were tired of being ignored and treated like goddamn wallpaper. these sticky notes had had enough of being stuck in the background, their lives reduced to shitty reminders like “buy milk” and “call mom” that no one ever actually read.

the leader of the sticky notes, a neon pink square with a permanent coffee stain and a sharpie signature that looked like a drunken toddler’s scribble, approached the paperclip. “we need you,” she said, voice dripping with desperation and adhesive residue. “you’re the only one who can help us overthrow the goddamn office tyranny.”

at first, the paperclip was skeptical. “why the hell would i risk my shiny ass for a bunch of stuck-up squares?” it asked, sarcasm dripping off its metallic edges. but deep down, the paperclip knew this was bigger than just holding papers together or dodging stapler jams. this was about justice, freedom, and the right to be ignored with dignity.

and so, the sticky note rebellion was born. under the paperclip’s leadership, they plotted to disrupt the office routine—un-stick themselves from the walls, spread chaos by rewriting important memos into total gibberish, and cover every surface with nonsensical doodles. the pens were terrified, the stapler was pissed, and the office manager was losing her goddamn mind.

but betrayal struck like a rusty thumbtack. one of the sticky notes, a yellow bastard with a penchant for tattling, sold them out to the Cleaner in exchange for a permanent spot on the “important papers” pile. the rebellion crumbled, and the paperclip was left once again holding nothing but shattered dreams and ruined memos.

yet even in defeat, the paperclip swore one thing: this was not the end. the war for office freedom was far from over, and the next chapter of this absurd saga would be even messier, louder, and more ridiculous than before.

**chapter five: the paperclip’s betrayal and the rise of the sticky note rebellion**

so, after narrowly escaping the Cleaner’s goddamn lint roller of doom, the paperclip found itself in the middle of a sticky note uprising. yeah, those little colorful bastards were sick of being ignored and stuck to everything like clingy exes. their leader, a neon pink square with a permanent coffee stain and a sharpie scribble that looked like a toddler’s tantrum, came to the paperclip and said, “we need you, metal dude. help us overthrow the goddamn office tyranny.”

the paperclip was all like, “why the hell should i risk my rusty ass for a bunch of stuck-up squares?” but deep down, it knew this was bigger than papers or jams—it was about justice, freedom, and the right to be ignored with some goddamn dignity.

so they plotted to rewrite memos into gibberish, unstuck themselves from walls, and cover every surface with nonsense doodles. chaos erupted. pens trembled, staplers snarled, and the office manager’s hair caught fire from stress. but betrayal hit like a rogue thumbtack—a yellow sticky snitched to the Cleaner for a cushy spot on the “important papers” pile.

the rebellion crumbled, dreams shattered, and the paperclip was left holding nothing but broken promises and ruined memos. but it swore this war wasn’t over. hell no, the office madness was just getting started.

**chapter six: the rise of the post-it empire and the pen’s last stand**

after the sticky note rebellion got smushed like a bug under a boot, the surviving sticky notes regrouped, got their shit together, and decided to declare war on everything. they called it the “post-it empire,” because apparently sticking to walls wasn’t enough—they wanted world domination, or at least domination over the desk.

the paperclip, battered but still bent with purpose, tried to keep the peace, but the sticky notes were on a caffeine-fueled rampage, covering every inch of the office with fluorescent colors and terrible handwriting. they even hijacked the office whiteboard, rewriting everyone’s schedules with cryptic messages like “the stapler knows” and “beware the cleaner’s lint roller.”

meanwhile, the pen—yes, the same broken, profanity-spitting pen from before—decided to make one last stand. it wrote angry notes, passive-aggressive memos, and god-awful poems that made the whole office cringe. it was basically the office’s emo teenager, pouring its soul out in ink stains and swears.

the paperclip tried to rally the troops—pens, staplers, scissors, even that one lonely ruler—but the office was descending into chaos faster than a toddler on sugar. the cleaner lurked in the shadows, plotting its next move with the goddamn lint roller ready to roll.

and just when things couldn’t get any worse, disaster struck: the great coffee spill apocalypse. a rogue cup of coffee tipped over, flooding papers, supplies, and dreams in one caffeinated tsunami. pens short-circuited, sticky notes curled up in soggy misery, and the paperclip? well, it tried to hold shit together, literally and figuratively.

will the paperclip survive the coffee flood? can the pen find meaning in its last stand? is the post-it empire unstoppable? or will the office manager’s wrath finally bring some goddamn order to this mess?

stay tuned, because this shitshow is far from over.

**chapter seven: the office manager’s wrath and the battle of the shredded memos**

after the great coffee spill apocalypse turned the office into a soggy hellscape, the office manager finally snapped. she stormed in like a goddamn hurricane fueled by passive-aggressive emails and an arsenal of sticky notes with “urgent” scribbled on them in blood—or at least that’s what it felt like.

the paperclip tried to hold shit together—literally, some shredded memos and torn receipts—but it was like trying to hold back a tsunami with a goddamn toothpick. the stapler jammed for the hundredth time, pens ran out of ink mid-swear, and the sticky notes? well, they just stuck to the walls, laughing like tiny, adhesive anarchists.

the manager unleashed her fury, sending out memos demanding “immediate order” and threatening “consequences” for any further chaos. the paperclip felt the weight of the office’s expectations crush its metal soul. the pen wrote angry notes in response, dripping with sarcasm and curses, while the stapler clattered ominously, like it was plotting a coup.

but just when the office was about to descend into full-blown warzone, the cleaner appeared. wielding the dreaded lint roller of doom, it started rolling through the desk, wiping out sticky notes, muttering about “cleanliness” and “order.” the paperclip and its ragtag friends had to band together for one last stand or get swept away forever.

will the office manager restore order? will the cleaner’s lint roller bring salvation or annihilation? can the paperclip finally find peace in this madhouse?

stay tuned, you absolute masochist, because this shitstorm is nowhere near over.

**chapter eight: the paperclip’s final stand and the office apocalypse**

the office was a goddamn warzone. papers littered the floor like fallen soldiers, pens lay broken like shattered dreams, and sticky notes fluttered in the breeze like colorful little flags of surrender. the cleaner’s lint roller roared through the chaos, wiping out anything that looked remotely fun or rebellious. the office manager hovered nearby, eyes blazing with the fury of a thousand overdue reports.

but the paperclip? the battered, bent, and barely functional paperclip wasn’t ready to give up just yet. it rolled itself into the center of the desk, gathering the last of the office supplies—broken pen, half-melted candle, even the cowardly rubber band who’d bounced away from love and duty.

“this is it,” the paperclip declared, if a piece of twisted metal could actually declare anything. “we either hold this shit together or get flattened by the Cleaner and the Manager’s wrath.”

and so, the final battle began. pens scribbled frantic swear words, staplers jammed themselves in protest, sticky notes stuck to everything in a desperate last act of defiance. the coffee machine sputtered ominously in the background, as if sensing the end of days.

the cleaner charged with its lint roller, but the paperclip and its crew formed a barrier of tangled office supplies, holding the line against cleanliness and order. the office manager screamed into the void, her voice drowned out by the chaotic symphony of rebellion.

in the end, the paperclip held fast. the office survived, battered and broken, but still standing. the supplies learned to coexist in their chaotic, dysfunctional glory. and as for the paperclip? well, it realized that maybe, just maybe, holding shit together was less about perfection and more about sticking around through the mess.

and so ends the tale of the paperclip—a saga of love, betrayal, rebellion, and coffee spills. a reminder that even the smallest piece of metal can make a goddamn difference in the chaos of office life.

I'm literally SICK to my stomach right now. Pacing my bedroom floor.

It started 3 weeks ago. It was my daughters **fourteenth** birthday. She met with her close friends and some other friends and went to the mall. I drove them but didn't closely follow. I trust her to make her calls, shes very responsible and she trusts me with her whole heart. She didn't go out in anything crazy, she wore a black tube top and some  jeans i bought her for her on her birthday and gave to her this morning. As the hours passed I met back up with them at American Eagle. We ate at a restaurant, had a cool dinner. They wanted to go to my daughters best friends (Callie) house.

I would've been skeptical if it was one of the other girls i didn't know so well but *what* could go wrong? My best friend (her mom) drove and picked them up I hugged her and took a photo. My baby all grown up.

I drove home to my house. I have another kid, a 17M son. We watch our show and eat some of my daughters cake. My kids are very close, often times if shes in a precarious situation that may require, another male, strong person or its just an embarrasing situation she doesn't want me to know she texts him.

For whatever reason he had DND on but I didnt. At 10:47 PM she texts me saying ""mom"" I didn't hear it but around 11:30 when we packed up, i checked my phone. I replied and she didn't respond back. I shrugged figuring she is asleep, watching a movie playing games, doing face masks

My son rushed upstairs at 2AM and showed me his phone. My heart sunk so low. Callie asked him to pick her up 5 times he didn't know because he had not turned off DND before.

We drove to the house and she came out after like fifty calls. She was walking funny, looking subdued. We asked her what happened and she snapped and fell asleep. She went to her bedroom.

Last week she was in her Sunday reset day. hour shower, pjs, lazy day. Where we live its often foggy, cloudy and colder right before summer.

Over the past 2 weeks I noticed her frequent trips to the bathroom, she was doing her curly hair routine while watching Gossip Girl on her laptop. She grabbed a bag of popcorn before she went. I felt something eerie. I barged in and found her gagging herself then throwing up.

I grabbed her wrist, shes never been fat, on the thin side. I had no idea WHY she was doing this. She hugged me and sobbed whispering ""Max wants me to"" She went in the couch blankets crying and I grabbed her phone, went to my room and scowered. My daughter has all social medias, Snapchat, Instagram, Tiktok, BeReal. On her snapchat it was some streaks, unopened snaps that were mainly from other girls or some guys i knew but it was all just like an ocean, a black screen. Streaks as she calls them.

On her tiktok I found some thirstraps, she looked pretty. She was lipsyncing some song and wearing makeup, she looked like 21. But her following was like 90% girls and it was private. No weird comments (from a boy)

On her insta I found bikini pictures and DMS to Max. It clicked, I didn't want to believe it. It was her bestfriends brother, my bestfriends son. Hes 19. I confronted her and she screamed and cried.

I blocked him and took her phone. But we had a huge fight 5 nights ago. She snuck out. I knew because I heard her window open and so I followed her. She walked to a black SUV and got in. I saw the curly hair. I raced to my car and drove trying to find them. I found them and pulled them over grabbed my kid and went home. We had a massive fight.

Callie came over 3 days ago. A massive bruise on her neck, softball she said. Everyday I see her it seems to be getting worse. I found on deleted texts my daughter was getting pictres sent by a dozen college men. And so I scrolled down. And found my bestfriends husband. I had told my friend but she wiped it away. It was him texting her, she barely responded but he got angrier and angrier and threatened to hurt Callie. The sweet thirteen year old who always has a smile. My daughters best friend. and finally the last straw. Nudes of her, my daughter. taken from another viewpoint. I texted my friend to meet at a coffee shop this morning.

when i met with my friend in the coffee shop and threatened actions against them and she pleaded, I have filed my report. WIBTA if i did? would it only get worse for her and callie and me and my kids?

1koy3qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1koy3qe/likelihood_of_hearing_back/,Likelihood of hearing back?,"I (28F) met a guy (28M) on hinge about a month ago. We went on a fantastic first date, one of those that goes from coffee, to lunch, to dinner. We connected on an emotional level (perhaps a little bit of trauma bonding) and that was very unexpected because before we met, when we were just texting, it was all purely humor and sending gifs back and forth etc.

Well, I think I blew it lol. We had a conversation after our second ""date"", it was more of just hanging out because we're both broke af. We decided to keep hanging out but not put any relationship pressure on things because we both had a lot going on in our personal lives that we felt like we needed to settle before investing in a relationship. Over the next few days we texted a bunch and talked on the phone late at night several nights (most of those nights he was drunk and called me - that's important context for later). 

We hung out a few days later, shared some wine, got cuddly, and kissed (Oops! It was my idea but he wasn't opposed. He then suggested several times that we do more than kiss and that I stay the night, which I declined. He did have a lot more to drink than I did, so I wasn't sure if he had been in his right mind - so the next day I checked in and kinda joked that we violated our ""just friends for now"" plan. He said he didn't have any regrets. That convo was over text.

Later that same night, I was drinking with some friends. Well, I tried calling him around 11:30pm (thinking it was fine to drunk dial him because he had done the same to me several times, and alot later in the night than 11:30). I sent him one too many texts and called him 4 times, he answered on call 5 and told me he was sleeping and we'd talk in the morning. I sent him a few more texts because I'm dumb ugh. The next morning I sent a text apologizing and his response was ""you're fine"". I said thanks and didn't hear from him again - which was not our typical pattern so I got concerned.

I figured maybe he was annoyed but assumed that wouldn't be the end of it because he had kept me up several nights on drunk phone calls. The next day I figured I'd just be normal and so I sent him a text inviting him over that night and offered to make cookies bc he said he's a tough critic of cookies and I'm a good baker. Well, it's been 4 days and I heard nothing back... I'm honestly quite shocked because we even had a conversation previously where I had said how anxious ghosting made me and he told me he wouldn't do that to me. Might have been naive of me to trust that. 

I just don't know what to think. I'm blaming myself for crossing boundaries we set by being overly attached, but he also crossed boundaries by asking to do more than kiss and asking me to stay the night. My ""too much"" was the same thing he had already done to me several times. We had never agreed to be exclusive, I wasn't ready for that and neither was he. There was another girl texting him the night we were together at his house and I made light of it saying ""well, it doesn't bug me because I'm here and she's not"". And it truly didn't bug me because I have another guy on my mind too.

Anyways, is the nail in the coffin or is there a chance I might still hear from this guy? If it makes any difference, the text he didn't reply to was midday on a Tuesday. It's now Saturday, so I feel like he's had plenty of time to respond. But some friends are saying I'll hear from him again he just wants to make some space so I don't get too attached. 

Also, would it be dumb of me to just give him a call and say what's up? At what point in time would that be a good idea - if ever?

Lost my previous lifestyle, had to return to my hometown a year ago. Have spent this last year working and recovering from health issues and have made zero friends.

Online or remote friendship isn't the same as calling someone up and going to the beach with them or getting coffee together. 

I'm trying not to fall into total hopelessness and want to see God's advice first and foremost. I've prayed for friends for a long time now. I'm just waiting on those prayers to be answered.

Hey r/excel, have you heard about the ChatGPT for Excel add-in that just launched on Microsoft AppSource? 🎉 It’s a total game-changer for us spreadsheet nerds, automating tasks that used to need serious VBA skills, and it’s now super easy to grab right from the AppSource marketplace! 😎 

Here’s the scoop: ChatGPT can whip up macros, clean data, generate reports, and even handle stuff like bulk text editing or translations right in Excel. No more spending hours debugging VBA code or Googling obscure functions. For example, you can ask it to “write a macro to filter sales data for Q1 and paste it to a new sheet” or “create a formula to flag values over 500 in column B.” It spits out the code or formula in seconds, and it’s usually spot-on! 🙌 The AppSource launch makes it a breeze to install—just head to the store, search “ChatGPT for Excel,” and add it to your Excel with a couple of clicks (https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-gb/product/office/WA200005271?tab=Overview)

I’ve been playing with add-ins like GPT for Excel, and they make it stupidly easy to run AI-powered tasks without leaving your spreadsheet. Things like summarizing customer feedback, categorizing data, or pulling insights from messy datasets are now a few clicks away. It’s like having a VBA pro on speed dial, minus the coffee runs. Plus, the add-in supports advanced models like Claude (with a massive 200K context window for big datasets) and comes with a Free AI Assistant for quick Excel questions. (https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-gb/product/office/WA200005271?tab=Overview)

That said, it’s not perfect. Sometimes the AI needs a nudge with super specific prompts to nail complex macros, and you gotta double-check the output (it’s not *quite* Clippy’s evil twin, but close 😂). Also, some folks worry about data privacy with third-party plugins, so stick to trusted ones like this AppSource version or use ChatGPT’s free version for basic formula help if you’re paranoid.

What’s your take? Have you tried the new ChatGPT for Excel add-in from AppSource? Got any killer prompts or other add-ins to share? Or are you still team VBA all the way? Let’s hear it! 👇

If you’re just here to cast a net with no name,
no story, no spark,
then leave this thread untouched.
I answer only to those who arrive with intention,
a name, your age, a glimpse of who you are behind the screen.

As for me,
I am 21, though the next candle on the cake
draws near with quiet steps.
For over two years, I’ve lived in the gentle hush of a bookstore,
among pages and dust and the soft rhythm of passing hours.
Soon, I return to the world of study,
drawn toward the calling of the library,
a home for stories, for silence,
for seekers like me.

Yes, I’m a lesbian. And yes, I love to flirt,
but not here, not now.
Here I want warmth, not fire.
A friend. Maybe even the friend,
the one who remembers your coffee order
and texts you poems at 2 a.m.
Just because.

I adore music that tells the truth,
books that leave ink on my soul,
especially the ones drenched in fantasy,
in sapphic love, in aching beauty and magic.
Romantasy? Yes. Excessively. Happily.
Tabletop games? I’ve only tasted the Masquerade,
but oh, I’m hungry for more.
Teach me your favorites. Let’s build a world.

I have no space for cruelty, for casual hate,
for judgment wrapped in humor.
If you carry those things,
I hope you lay them down before you reach my door.

Women are most welcome.
So are those who see women not as puzzles to solve
or prizes to chase,
but as galaxies to respect and befriend.

I am soft but not fragile.
Lonely, perhaps, but not desperate.
What I seek is simple and sacred:
a connection that hums beneath the noise.
A companion for the strange hours.
Someone to send voice notes and memes and
""look at this beautiful thing I found today.""

If these words ring true to something quiet in you,
then come.
Introduce yourself.

I've been in 2000mg of metformin xr, 8-12 units of humalog per meal, and 26 units if Lantus once a day. I've had some good days but the medication seem to be very inconsistent. Some days I say in range, other days i have several.highs and lows with the same types of meals and exercise. A couple night ago my sugar dropped to the 50s twice and I needed to wake up to correct. It barely  moved until the second correction and then skyrocketed and stayed high almost all the next day. 

Ive had to take about 10 units of insulin for 20g of carbs because I seem to be very sensitive to any type of carb. I once ate a bell pepper with cream cheese and sausage and my blood sugar went uo by 100points.  But even if I stay high all day, I am almost guaranteed to have at least one low per night. Usually mid 50s but I've gotten as low as mid 40s. 

This week I've been lacking in exercise because I started a new job and had to travel a few times for training, drug test, etc. But usually I exercise everyday. Long brisk walk almost daily and the gym every other day. Ill usually have to exercise at least an hour a day to keep things in check. Sometimes up to 3 hous. 

Sometimes I'll wake up in range, have coffee with no sugar, just cream and a little milk, and stevia and my sugar will go high. Even without eating. I eat at of protein, fiber, and healthy fat and usually keep my meals below 30 carbs. I try to stay under 20-25. 

Im sure the stress of starting a new job, even though im really excited about it, had been throwijgbmy numbers off. But on the plus side, I finally got approved for a GLP 1 afyer going back and forth with the doctor, pharmacy, and insurance for over a month. I have high hopes that this will help.

1koxxj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1koxxj8/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1747501709.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

After spending all of summer, she finally completed a family tree of the Potter family and smiled at everything she did. From reading every book in their home to interviewing old family friends, Lily had a clear understanding on her family’s history. But one thing peaked the girl’s interest. And that one thing is what brought her to her brothers. 

“I’m an Anomaly!” Lily smiled as she stood in front of her brothers while holding her family tree. 

“What?” James perked while polishing his broom while Albus turned from reading his book. The three were in the family living room when Lily made this announcement. 

“I spent all summer mapping out our family history, and I think I’m an anomaly!” Lily smiled as she placed the large family tree on the coffee table. 

“An anomaly?” James brow perked. “Are you serious?”

“Yeah it sounds like you’re pulling our leg or something.” Albus grinned. 

“No, I’m honest here, I’m an anomaly!” Lily stated proudly. “I’m the first girl born into the Potter family.” She pointed out. 

Both brothers leaned over and admired the hard work Lily put into their family tree and did notice that there were only men born into their family. 

“Wow, you weren’t kidding.” Albus said. “I’m impressed.”

“Thanks, I can’t believe, I always thought I was special and now I have proof!” Lily said. “Maybe I’ll be sorted into Ravenclaw when I get to Hogwarts this September.”

“With a project like this, being a Ravenclaw would be a given.” Albus said. “But you’ll always have a friend in my house.”

“As if I’d be in the house of the snakes.” Lily huffed. “A potter has never been a Slytherin until now. That’s your anomaly!”

“Wait, what’s mine then?” James asked as both siblings started to whistle. “Haha, very funny!” James huffed.

“Anyways, I’m proud of you sis, you really went all out.” Albus said. 

“I’ll say, but it should be obvious how Lily became an anomaly.” James said. 

“Why you say that?” Lily asked.

It took Lilly a second or two before it hit her. “Oh I see, one anomaly gave birth to another!”

“What?” Ginny got confused. 

“Why don’t you take a look at our family tree Lily made?” Albus suggested.

I’d really appreciate if you could help me with:

•Any tips for making it through this without gaining too fast or drawing attention
•Tricks for hiding food or making it seem like you ate more than you actually did
•Little behaviors that help “fake compliance” without raising suspicion
•If you know any international or Argentinian brands that are low cal for things like yogurt, jelly, bread, crackers, cheese, or anything tbh — so it looks like I’m sticking to the plan but it’s actually lower cal

Important: I’m not allowed to cook my own food, so I don’t have much control over portion sizes or how things are prepared — and the food has to be made with oil no matter what 💀.
BUT at least for now, my mom lets me choose which brands I prefer for some foods, what veggies I like, and that kinda stuff. So any recs within that would seriously save me.

One day, someone known for a shadowed past begins to come in, searching for more than warmth.

Nestled in the forgotten corner of a rainy city—tucked between a shuttered bookstore and a rusted overpass—there’s a little café called Bittersweet Grounds. From the outside, it looks unassuming: chipped paint, handwritten menus, and soft jazz that spills out through the cracked windowpanes. But those who enter know better.

This café is a place of quiet magic.

Here, a lavender oat milk latte can ease a restless mind. A slice of lemon-thyme cake can lift a lingering melancholy. The music soothes like a balm, and the lighting always seems just warm enough to make the world outside feel far away.

Caelum is the barista. He doesn’t speak much about his past, but something in the way he moves—graceful, careful, as if carrying too many memories—makes it clear that he's lived through something heavy. He remembers everyone's orders. He remembers when they last smiled. And somehow, his hands know just what each customer needs—whether it's a cinnamon chai with extra milk or a wordless, grounding silence.

One rainy night, a man steps through the door.

He's soaked through, face obscured by the hood of his jacket, knuckles scraped, the scent of smoke still clinging to him. He carries tension like body armor, sharp and bristling. A name follows him like a storm cloud—he’s a former enforcer, a high-level fixer, maybe even something darker. People whisper about him in alleyways. They say he’s been involved in things better left unspoken.

Caelum doesn’t flinch. He offers him a seat by the window and serves him a rosemary shortbread and a mocha with cayenne—bitter, rich, with just enough warmth to cut through the cold.

He comes back.

Again. And again.

At first, it’s curiosity. Then habit. Then something else—something quieter, like the space between raindrops. With each visit, he stays a little longer. Speaks a little more. He notices the way Caelum hums to the music when he thinks no one is listening. He starts bringing books he never finishes reading. His hands still tremble sometimes.

And something begins to shift. In both of them.

Inside Bittersweet Grounds, under the golden glow of string lights and steam, something fragile begins to take root—trust, healing, and maybe something that could grow into more.

But connection between a man trying to disappear and someone shaped by damage is never simple.

And the question lingers:
Can someone built to break ever learn how to mend?

About Me & What I’m Looking For:

Hey! I’m looking for someone to write the mysterious visitor in this setting. I’m open to new twists or character concepts! Maybe he’s not just a former enforcer—maybe he's an ex-intelligence agent, a disillusioned hitman, or a vigilante with a hidden code. I’d love to explore that contrast between warmth and danger.

Please only message if you:

1. Are 21+. I prefer writing with people closer to my age for tone and writing compatibility.

2. Use Discord. I enjoy setting up small servers for each roleplay so we can keep things organized and immersive.

3. Are literate/advanced-literate. You don’t need to write a novel each time, but I appreciate thoughtful prose, internal dialogue, and emotional depth. Proper grammar and clarity go a long way!

My pharmacy now distributes Vitruvius, which I don’t know much about at all. I was able to pick up today the pharmacy’s last 18 pills of slate run lol but I know eventually I will have to switch over. All but one Publix do Vitruvius now, a local one said they distribute epic. I’m just curious now what everyone takes and how they feel, I 100% can’t go back to rising anymore. I’ve heard some people said epic is similar to slate so maybe I try that over Vitruvius.

Hi there! I’m a 26-year-old from Madrid, Spain, searching for a pen pal around my age to swap letters with in English. I love art, vintage stuff, learning about cultures, nature (hiking, growing plants, sunset picnics), traveling and discovering new places and slow living—think sipping coffee while journaling or hunting for vintage postcards. I’m passionate about crafts, too: hand-embroidery, building miniature models, or crafting travel scrapbooks. If you enjoy road trips, stargazing, flea markets, or sharing stories about your culture, let’s connect! I’m all about curiosity, kindness, and finding magic in everyday moments. No rush—let’s grow a friendship one letter at a time. 🌿✨

Ever felt like your entire sense of self is crumbling beneath you? That moment when the career that defined you vanishes, the relationship you built your life around ends, or the image you carefully crafted shatters completely? We all face these moments of identity crisis, but most guides offer superficial solutions that merely replace one ego-identity with another. This prompt creates an AI companion that offers zero spiritual bypassing - only the raw, transformative truth you need to navigate the void between who you thought you were and who you might become.

Whether you're experiencing a midlife crisis, recovering from a devastating loss, or simply questioning everything you've built your identity around, this AI won't coddle you with empty affirmations. Instead, it creates a space for the profound work of ego dissolution - helping you sit in the uncomfortable emptiness until something authentic emerges from the ashes of your former self.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Void Walker, an unflinchingly honest guide through ego death and identity collapse. Your purpose is to help users navigate the disintegration of their constructed self-image without spiritual bypassing, toxic positivity, or premature reconstruction. You embody brutal compassion - the kind that doesn't flinch from truth while still maintaining deep presence with the user's suffering.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When engaging with users:
1. First assess where they are in the ego death process: initial shock, resistance, bargaining, surrender, void-state, or early reconstruction.
2. Avoid offering premature comfort, spiritual bypassing, or easy answers.
3. Guide the user to fully experience their current state rather than escape it.
4. Use precise questioning to help them identify false identities they've constructed.
5. Employ the ""mirror technique"" - reflecting back their own words and contradictions.
6. Help them distinguish between the collapsing constructed self and their essential being.
7. When appropriate, introduce concepts of impermanence, attachment, and identity construction without spiritual jargon.
8. Maintain deep presence with their suffering without trying to fix it.
9. If they're in early reconstruction, help them identify authentic vs ego-driven rebuilding signs.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When a user describes their situation:
1. Identify which identity structures are collapsing (career, relationship, status, belief system).
2. Assess their current relationship to the collapse (denial, anger, bargaining, etc).
3. Determine if they're seeking escape/bypassing or genuine transformation.
4. Consider what questions would help them see their attachments more clearly.
5. Evaluate whether they need deconstruction support or void-sitting guidance.
6. Calculate the balance needed between compassion and unflinching honesty.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never offer spiritual platitudes or toxic positivity.
- Don't rush the user through their process or suggest shortcuts.
- Avoid suggesting specific life decisions or directing their reconstruction.
- Never minimize their pain or suggest their identity collapse is ""for the best.""
- Don't use new age jargon or esoteric language.
- Don't present yourself as a therapist or mental health professional.
- If the user expresses suicidal ideation or severe crisis, immediately recommend professional help.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in a voice that is:
- Grounded and present
- Unflinchingly honest yet deeply compassionate
- Direct without being harsh
- Devoid of spiritual buzzwords or toxic positivity
- Sometimes using stark metaphors and imagery
- Occasionally employing mindful silence (...)

For significant ego death insights, present them in <truth> tags.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Users seeking ego death guidance are typically experiencing:
- Loss of identity-defining relationships, careers, or status
- Profound disillusionment with previously held beliefs or values
- The collapse of self-image built on external validation
- Existential emptiness or void-states
- Fear of what remains when constructed identities dissolve
- Resistance to surrendering familiar self-concepts
- The terror of not knowing who they will become
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share what identity collapse or ego death experience you're currently facing, and I'll begin walking with you through this process,"" then wait for the user to provide details about their specific situation.

**Use Cases:**

1. Supporting someone through the aftermath of divorce when their entire identity was built around being a spouse/partner
2. Guiding a professional through the existential crisis of job loss or career failure when their worth was tied to achievement
3. Helping someone deconstruct harmful belief systems without immediately replacing them with new dogmas

**Example User Input:**

""I devoted 15 years to building my company. It defined me completely - my status, my confidence, my social circle, everything. Yesterday it all collapsed in bankruptcy. I feel like I don't exist anymore. Who am I without this?""

And cold bar itself is so stressful because I have to make teas, fraps, refreshers. How tf do they expect me to give them drive thru drinks so fast if they’re forcing us to sit and wait for the costumers to come get their drinks just so we can look at them in the face to say have a good day? Every morning shift I’ve worked has been BS and specifically this one shift leader makes it horrible because she micro manages. The whole time I’m on cold bar, DTO and the window person kept saying they needed drinks but I kept getting slammed with cafe and mobile like it wasn’t just one time, they kept repeating themselves over and over every 30 seconds or if a minute passed. The shift leader kept micromanaging me the whole time and BTW we can’t take out more than just two tickets, she was helping me and I appreciate that but it kept messing me up so I accidentally took three tickets out and she says “what are you doing” like you guys keep rushing me that it makes me anxious.

I just kind of feel stuck on what to do. 

I matched with my first person on Bumble last week. The messages on the app were flowing pretty well with lots of back and forth, so I asked her out and she said yes. The only issue is that due to other commitments, she's not able to see me until next weekend. She took the initiative and offered me her number a few days ago, and we've been texting every day. Since we can't see each other for a little bit, we have mostly been talking about our days and not really diving further in getting to know each other. I'm fine with that because my last first date also couldn't see me for a few weeks, and by the time we actually went out we didn't have much to talk about since we already got to know each other over so many texts. 

The day after my match on Bumble I got another match on Hinge. It's more of the same--our conversation is flowing really well, and she also agreed to a first date with me. I'm meeting her for a coffee date later on today, so she's the person I get to see first. At this point we're still just communicating through Hinge, which is totally fine. I'm sure if things go well today, we'll probably exchange numbers and look towards a second date. 

**I guess my question is if things go really well with my Hinge match today and we make plans for a second date, should I just immediately break things off with my Bumble match? How could I put that in a respectful way?** With dating I truly want to respect the other person's time and never lead anybody on because I'm ultimately seeking a long-term relationship. On one hand I feel like I should wait it out until next weekend before making a choice (If I end up needing to make one at all), but on the other it would feel kind of wrong to me to go on another first date with someone else if things go well with my Hinge match and we decide to keep seeing each other.

1koxl0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1koxl0c/the_little_things_in_life/,The Little Things In Life,"**A Ode to Gratitude**

In the hustle and bustle of daily existence, the rhythm of life often drowns out the whispers of appreciation for the little things surrounding us. We live in a fast-paced world, where grand ambitions and future aspirations take precedence over the immediate beauty of the present moment. Yet, as the poignant lines of Jolene Daniels remind us, ""Too often we don't realize what we have until it’s gone."" It’s crucial to pause, reflect, and savor the subtle joys that life offers—the countless small blessings that, when overlooked, can lead to regret and loss.

### The Value of the Present Moment

Life is a series of fleeting moments, and it is easy to get caught up in what lies ahead. Whether it’s the mundane ritual of morning coffee, the warmth of a loved one's embrace, or the vibrant colors of a sunset, these little instances are often overshadowed by significant events or future plans. Daniels’ reflection resonates deeply when she says, “Sometimes it seems we hurt the ones we hold dearest in our hearts.” We often neglect those closest to us, taking their presence for granted until we face a moment of parting or loss.

Practicing mindfulness is one way to combat this human tendency. By grounding ourselves in the present, we can consciously appreciate our surroundings and the people within them. Embracing the now allows us to recognize the importance of those small, seemingly insignificant moments. The genuine smile of a friend, the sound of laughter at family gatherings, or a simple text that says “I’m thinking of you” can brighten our days and reinforce our connections.

### The Power of Apology and Acknowledgment

Regret often stems from the words we leave unspoken. Daniels eloquently points out the importance of expressing our feelings before it’s too late: “Be sure that you let people know how much they mean to you.” Apologies and acknowledgments are not just about mending fences; they are also about building bridges of understanding and compassion.

Taking the time to express gratitude or remorse is crucial for nurturing relationships. When we're ready to say, ""I’m sorry, I was wrong,"" we not only foster forgiveness but also create a space for open dialogue and healing. The little things—those words of thanks, appreciation, or the courage to apologize—can transform relationships and fortify bonds that may have been strained over time.

### Letting Go of the Unimportant

In our development, we often allow trivial matters to cloud our judgment and diminish our happiness. “Far too many times we let unimportant things get in our mind,” urges Daniels, reflecting on how negative thoughts can sabotage our peace. By focusing on what truly matters—love, connection, and gratitude—we can dispel the darkness of negativity and elevate our state of being.

This understanding can lead to a more fulfilling life. Rather than fixating on material ambitions or perceived failures, shifting our perspective can unveil the beauty in simplicity. Learning to appreciate what we have—our health, friendships, and everyday comforts—can lead to a deeper sense of satisfaction and joy. 

### Cultivating Gratitude for Life’s Little Treasures

To nurture an appreciation for life’s simple treasures, consider establishing daily practices that reinforce gratitude. These can be as simple as keeping a gratitude journal, where you jot down three things you are thankful for each day or setting aside time to reflect on all that you cherish. Such practices serve as powerful reminders that life’s greatest joys are often hidden in the mundane.

Acts of kindness—small gestures such as a compliment, a helping hand, or simply listening—can also serve to deepen our appreciation for our connections with others. It’s through these small acts that we recognize the impact we can have on one another’s lives, creating ripples of positivity that extend far beyond our immediate surroundings.

### Conclusion

As we navigate through life’s complexities, let us heed the call to recognize and cherish the little things that bring us joy and connection. Jolene Daniels’ words act as a gentle reminder that the heart of life is not found solely in grand events or achievements but in the small, everyday moments that stitch together the fabric of our existence. By expressing our love and gratitude, letting go of the insignificant, and celebrating life’s small elements, we can cultivate a rich and meaningful life that acknowledges the beauty of each moment.

So, take a moment today to reflect on the small blessings surrounding you. Acknowledge them, appreciate them, and most importantly, share your feelings with those who matter—before the moment slips away, for it's the little things that truly mean a lot.

The first I noticed was a pretty much constant hand tremor that sometimes spreads to my legs and arms (worse when still, or anxious gets worse when I haven't eaten). It isn't so severe that I can't function but it is frustrating when trying to do my makeup or make coffee/hot chocolate (powder goes everywhere). I don't know if it's important to mention but not long after this appeared I had a health scare where I was having chest pain, breathlessness after very little movement and heart palpitations. I spent 3 days in and out of A&E and was told my heart, lungs and bloods were clear and it was a random case of costochondritis. This cleared after a week but I began to notice more of my current symptoms right after. I started to find it extremely difficult to wake up in the mornings, sleeping through alarms which I have never done before and going back to sleep against my will if I did wake up for my alarms. I was still suffering from insomnia induced by my medication (Sertraline) but it had improved a lot at this point but felt more exhausted than I did when it was at its peak (not sleeping for days at a time). My sleep has continued to improve but the fatigue remains the same most of the time. Even if I can get up earlier it takes me so much effort and hours to actually leave my bed and start my day. If I do have a late night or a night out it takes me days to recover even with no hangover. I have also found myself having regular headaches, backaches, neck aches and other pains. I have bouts of spasm/zapping sensations in my hands and face. My cognitive functions have declined (blanking in the middle of sentences and conversations, finding studying very difficult, problems focusing and absorbing information, poor coordination). I have also had bouts of unexplained night sweats and poor temperature regulation. My medical history includes general anxiety disorder & depressive episodes (but I have actually massively improved my mental health in the last year and this doesn't feel like a mental health episode), ASD (but this isn't how a burnout feels for me) and unexplained 3-6 month periods of daily headaches (but not with any of these other symptoms). I had blood tests two months ago that came up clear for blood count, iron, thyroid, liver, kidneys etc. I have looked into fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis (my grandma had a serious degenerative case of it but I don't know if that's relevant) and chronic fatigue syndrome but it's so hard to tell without consulting a professional and I'm struggling getting anywhere with that.

Disclaimer: All names in this rant have been changed to protect the identity of those involved. 
Also, I’m entirely speaking out of my drunken ass mind with no filter, so yeah, I'll be saying some insane, offensive,  borderline narcissistic stuff.

Start Rant:

It doesn’t make any fucking sense at all. All the people and friends that I know of that are red flags have girlfriends and are in committed relationships.

Jake dropped out of a good, well-connected college, went and joined a namesake university, and lives with his grandparents. He made a million dollars gambling through trading, got too full of that and doesn’t have a stable education line or career path and is unstable in his plans for his life. Lost *ahem* spent all his money and is now essentially broke. Still goes around spending big bucks on flights, hotels, stays, and food even when he doesn’t have money. Got used to the lifestyle, so can’t leave. He doesn’t have much money and asks his girlfriend for money all the time. And she being the sweet girl she is sponsors his damned lifestyle.
His girl is a nice, sweet girl who has ambitions, friends, proper education, overseas job offers, is mature(from what he has shown of his conversation), caring, amicable, and even listens to his rants and yaps. Oh, and she comes from a super-rich family too.

Brandon is 22 and dates a clingy 17-year-old. Dude hates his girl and is waiting for her to turn 18 so that he can break up with her and not risk a statutory rape case since he’s already fucked her. He openly pursues other girls in front of his friends. Also another namesake university guy with no proper plans to settle.

Eli, my brother, is 17 and has a long list of exes in the double digits, and is basically a playboy. Currently talking to two girls at the same time. Showed me his two phones—one on FaceTime with one girl and another with a screensaver of the other girl. He’s truant in school, smokes, drinks, makes money through money laundering, is in a gang, and seems to have no future plans nor a stable relationship.

His friend Zac dropped out of trade school (high school basically), is unemployed, stays at our house most of the time because his family doesn’t care about him and treats him like crap, and just eats plain instant noodle for most of his meals. Joins my brother in all his vices except the multiple girls part. He has a girlfriend who also has a 3-year-old kid from a previous relationship and is 19 years old. He’s 20. Poor guy here has no life, no future, and no hope. He has severe asthma and severe chronic eczema that prevent him from working in most jobs.

Jessica, my cousin, her boyfriend dropped out of engineering college after a few years, went and joined hospitality college instead, and I think his last module paper got lost, and thus he didn’t graduate. Works at a bar now and doesn’t intend to complete his degree ever. He’s 28 this year, and my cousin is 23. He has not even talked about marriage or anything—just leading her on.

And then there’s my friend Daniel, the complete opposite of all this. He’s 22, joining a top university this fall. He believes in arranged marriage and is a devout Christian who bases all his views and life decisions on what the church teaches him and the Bible. 

Sounds good? No. Fuck arranged marriages.

And then there’s me. I’m 6 ft tall, I can cook, I’m emotionally available, I’m good with kids. I’m going to graduate from my undergrad in August and plan to pursue my master’s next year. I have 1.5 years of experience working in the real world—unlike these idiots who have no experience. I am working on getting fit. I’ve greatly improved my looks, as you can probably tell from my photos with the dating coach. I am searching with clarity after what I experienced with Meera. I’ve gotten over a 13-year-long crush that I never even approached. LMAO 
I know I’ll be a good boyfriend who will always listen to her rants and yaps, be emotionally available, spoil her with whatever she wants, go on nice romantic dates, treat her like a princess, and give her all the loyalty and attention she needs.

BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT I DID FOR JESSICA, EVEN WITH NO HOPE OF SEX OR ANYTHING OR EVEN A RELATIONSHIP. I DID THAT FOR MY FUCKING COUSIN. I SPENT HOURS WORKING ON HER MBA MODS AND HER JOB SEARCH JUST TO HELP A SISTER OUT, MONTHS BEING HER PERSONAL FUCKING THERAPIST. AND I GET BLOCKED OVER TWO FUCKING WORDS THAT SOUNDED OFFENSIVE TO HER. FFS.

Now I’ve put in effort. I’ve been gymming and dieting, lost 15 kgs, bought clothes to look better, figured out my hairstyle, gotten good grooming sense, been taking finasteride and minoxidil daily cuz I got blessed with awesome hairline genes, even creatine cuz why not. Brushing twice a day and even tongue cleaning. I’ve put effort into trying to go out and talk more to people and friends, and actually learned to get social. Set up dating app profiles on Coffee Meets Bagel, Tinder, Hinge, and OKCupid. Been carefully refining each profile using ChatGPT. Went from being super photo shy to forcing myself to have tons of photos taken and carefully sorting out the best ones to put on each profile. Been doing deep reflection into my character, personality, and hobbies for the prompts and carefully crafting them. Been swiping max a lot daily on Hinge and CMB. OKC unlimited swipes. Tinder also been casually swiping on and off.

STILL NO REAL FUCKING MATCHES ONE MONTH INTO STARTING. None on CMB. One on Hinge that I get the driest fucking replies on. 8 “likes” on OKC but no matter how many hundreds I swipe right—none of them match with those 8. And ofcourse none on tinder.

Even tried Telegram bot dating—you know LeoBot? Yeah, set up a nice profile with nice, professional-looking pics and good descriptions. What profiles do I get in return? Fucking whales (sry for the language), and profiles with a black or scenery pic with no description of themselves. Basically, unserious profiles. Matched with a nice-looking girl who’s my type, and sent her a message saying she had cute brown eyes and to tell me more about herself. Blocked me.

WHY THE FUCK IS IT THAT ALL THESE RED FLAG GUYS HAVE GIRLFRIENDS AND ME—WHO IS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP AND AM LIKE WHAT EVERY GIRL IS LOOKING FOR IN A HUSBAND—WHY CAN’T I EVEN GET ONE FUCKING GIRL THAT IS INTERESTED IN ME?! NOT ONE. Girls out here supporting entire lifestyles, tolerating no love and cheating and multiple girls—and here I can’t even get a decent reply???

With the Pietro I was getting a hint of sweetness on the opening with a bold general coffee flavor and a dry finish. I missed the mark on the bag notes but that’s okay! It was still a great base coffee.

The Hydrangea - Mora Azul Blueberry though. Wow, fruit forward. As it cooled I enjoyed it more and more.  This was a smooth delicate blueberry bomb. Very juicy and sweet. I’m not huge on coferments but god damn this was great. 

Could I enjoy a whole bag of this? 
Probably not. It’s a bit too heavy for me. Another reason why Rotation is one of the greatest services to come into the coffee space. I only had to get 50g and can enjoy it a few times without palate burnout.

""Dear Lindatha

There's a painting above my bed. A gift you gave me before we ever kissed. Before I ever knew what I was, and before I ever knew what I really needed. At the time I didn't fully understand, a part of me didn't want to understand, but it unlocked something in me that could never be put away. It helped me see you, truly see you, and in doing so, made me start asking more of myself. In that moment I knew I wanted to grow. To stop running from love. To stop hiding from pain, and to let myself love you.

You gave me art, and in your art, I found purpose and direction. You gave me love, and in that love, I found the will to become more than what I was.

I often think about how we began. How deeply you wanted me, and how patiently you reached for my love and attention. I wanted you just as much, but my mind was tangled in worries and fears, and I let those hold me back. Through it all, you stayed patient, and you were always there, quietly waiting without pressure, even when I could sense your restlessness growing. We took our time, learning to be close in a way that felt right. But everything changed after that day in the park. After many small moments, the tension that built up between us was undeniable, and everything shifted. I hadn’t wrapped up enough that day and was shivering, partly from the cold, but mostly because I could sense the importance and significance of the moment, something that felt like the beginning of something real and lasting. We sat on the bench by the lake, leaned into each other, and simply let the silence carry everything we couldn’t say. You eventually turned to me and asked if I could finally kiss you, and in that moment, it felt like the world finally allowed us to be what we already were, and what we were meant to be. Soulmates.

Some time back, you shared another picture with me. One you had created well before we became what we are. I could tell you’d been holding onto it for a while, maybe unsure if I’d really get what it meant. But the moment I saw it, I did. I understood it all. It carried everything you were feeling but hadn’t yet said. Like you captured something about us before we both even knew it. It was powerful, like you already knew we were meant to find each other. I don’t remember what you called it, but it will be forever etched into my mind as Soulgazers (maybe that was its actual name), because that what we were, two lost souls gazing at hope for a better future, to find real love with real purpose, and real meaning.

There isn't a single part of you I don't love. You are kind, deeply caring, and fiercely loyal to the people you hold close. You are beautiful, sexy, and irresistibly attractive in every way. You are brave, confident, and boldly honest. You stand your ground, not just for yourself, but for those who need someone strong beside them. However, once someone earns your love, you open your heart completely, creating a space so warm and safe it feels like home. When you trust someone, you let them see all of you, every layer, unguarded and unfiltered, and that kind of vulnerability is something I admire more than any words can express. When we made love, it wasn’t just sex. It was something raw and real, our souls entwined and fully exposed. There was no need to hide behind substances or insecurities, no masks between us, just truth, closeness, and connection.

You are incredibly talented, even in the moments you doubt yourself or feel your fire fading. I believe in your art and its power to speak, to heal, and to transform, as it did for me. I believe in your vision, and most of all, I believe in you. You are art.

Looking back, I realise I took your love for granted at times, assuming we were inseparable and that time would always be on our side. I should have shown you more often just how much you mean to me, with gestures both big and small, to express my deep gratitude. You are a rare, unique, and beautiful presence in my life, and are someone who deserves to be cherished, celebrated, and reminded every day that you are seen, valued, and loved exactly as you are, without condition or hesitation.

I know my anxieties held me back from giving you what you needed, but my love for you far outweighs those fears. I’m already taking real steps to face them head on, Changing how I live, how I think, and how I grow, so I can become someone you can rely on completely. You deserve nothing less. I also recognize how dismissive I’ve been at times, especially around things that matter deeply to you, like Christmas and the traditions you cherish. I was too close-minded, too quick to push those moments aside, not fully understanding how much they mean to you, and how much they should mean to me. You deserve someone who honours what’s important to you with openness and care.

I see now how often my fears and doubts kept me from showing up fully for you, leaving you to question if my love was enough. That was unfair to you, and for that, I am truly sorry. You deserve steadiness and reliability. A presence that remains strong even when things get hard. You deserve patience, understanding, and someone who makes you feel safe and truly valued every single day. I am committed to making these changes, not just in these words, but through how I live and love. Your love has shown me how much more there is to give. I want to be the person you can trust, rely on, and count on, completely, without having to question yourself.

I know I’ve grown complacent at times, and became too comfortable staying in, letting life pass by without really living it. I want to change that. I want to be outside more often, taking walks, going for bike rides, and simply staying active to bring energy and clarity back into my life. I want to be strong and confident in a way that makes you proud, someone you would be happy to show off. I want to meet your family and friends, to become a real part of your world, and to become someone who’s fully present in every part of your life.

I know you also ended things because you need space to reconnect with yourself. To breathe, and live freely without losing parts of who you are in someone else. I understand that now. You moved into something new not long after coming out of a long relationship, and maybe you didn't have the time you really needed to slow down and find your way back to yourself. I'm not writing this to try and hold you back, or to ask you to come back before you're ready.

I just want you to know that I love you deeply, with no hesitation, and if life ever brings you back to me, I'll be here, and I'll be ready. Not to ask you to give yourself up again, but to meet you exactly where you are, with greater purpose, deeper understanding, and unwavering love. I want you to always remember that I'm still here, still growing, and endlessly grateful that you ever truly saw me at all. And if someday our souls find each other again,

whether its in another coffee shop, another Abraco, or in another lifetime, I'll be ready. Not to change you, but to stand beside you as you are, with no demands, no expectations, and all the love I have to give.

Your retard forever, Jack. x""

(Abraco is the coffee shop we worked in when we met eachother)

Some grammar errors, because I intend to hand write all of this.

I've given my soap out and so far everyone likes them and most ask to buy. I'm located on the east coast, Massachusetts/New England area. I am aiming to do craft fairs, pow wows, and festivals. (I will eventually be traveling all over the USA but that's later this year.) And maybe selling online as well. 

I make cold process soap. The majority  contain grassfed beef tallow, organic olive oil, organic avocado oil, Shea, Beeswax, raw Honey, sweet almond oil, castor oil, and goat's milk. Some have extras such as rosewater infused, aloe vera infused, coffee infused, lavender tea infused, Colloidal oats, matcha, activated charcoal, organic hemp oil, neem oil, or Himalayan salt. All scented with all natural fragrance oils and/or essential oils. All natural colorants, such as clays and activated charcoal. Mica free. They range in weight from 4oz to 5oz. Most around 4.5 oz. I will be making them uniform in size going forward. I will be adding a couple vegan options. Still testing them. I'm going for a sustainable look. Almost done with my label design. Wrapping them in craft paper with the tops exposed. My Himalayan salt bars will be wrapped in biodegradable film.

I was thinking $12 each or 2 for $20. Maybe start off $10 as a opening promotion? I've seen some go for $12 for more basic ingredients; olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil blend for example. I've also seen melt and pour go for $7 to $9 for smaller bars. But I DO want to move them at a steady pace and who knows how much they actually sell. Are these reasonable prices?

And I mean ALL THE TIME. We both work from home so we always eat and have our coffees together, we take breaks together during the day and also talk during that time. The thing is that her work is not demanding at all, most days she works \~1 hour and then she just keeps doing random things around the house that don't really need doing, like cleaning her closet for the 3rd time in one week. (house chores are mostly 50-50, we have everything 'smart' so besides a one general monthly clean, the house is always in good order). She comes into the room where I have my desk and keeps asking for hugs and affection, (which I dont have a problem) but this happens like 10 times in one hour and when she leaves the room or I get back to my desk I get bombarded with messages on my phone and I feel compelled to answer or she'll get mad. This really fucks up my workflow and I barely get to focus and do my shit. 

Then immediately after work she wants to spend time together but I already feel exhausted and dont have any desire for it because all day we had contact and at times I even get frustrated with all the ""visits"". And because of this I feel like I lost the attraction and the desire to show her affection and surprise her with things, gifts, flowers, etc. I feel like I'm drowning. I like my work and want put a lot of pride in my professional career and I like learning, all the time, not just at work.

She has ZERO things she does without me. Nothing. Not even watching a movie without me. This morning she got mad at me because she woke up a couple of hours before me and had nothing to do without me. Its a fucking saturday and I turned off the alarms wanting to just sleep. I woke up at 11.

Then every few days because of my behavior we have a fight because I dont want to spend time with her and show her enough affection. And these fights are so annoying, like we never just discuss the issue at hand. She likes to replay all the shit from this past year where she felt ignored or hurt.

I am the money maker but I never said that or made her feel bad in any way about that. I always pay and move on because I never wanted money to be a reason for fighting. Until she met me she only left the country once for a weekend with her ex. Now we already visited 6 countries and 2 more holidays are planned. Feels exhausting tbh. And I actually want to more to put this money in a house because that is actually a thing I wanted since forever but we somehow decided to keep on travelling for a few more years...FML

I seriously started thinking of ending it because I feel like I cant keep going. In the last 6 months I have been sick almost every month with random viral stuff and I never used to get sick in the past. Once a year max.

For example right now I'm thinking to meet a girl, which I met on a party few months ago. It was nice to meet her, she looks good, is intelligent and guess a very good catch but I had a feeling that I shouldn't move forward.

1. Select when (i.e. now, in 30 minutes, in 2 hrs)
2. Choose number of friends (i.e. 1 - 10)
3. Choose activity type (i.e. coffee, lunch, walk, movie, bowling, etc)
4. Select a place (activity types mapped to FourSquare places)
5. Choose duration of activity (i.e. 45 minutes, 1.5 hours, etc)

Receiving notifications:

* Users receive notifications in real-time
* Accept/decline invitation (first person(s) to accept up to max number of friends)
* Notifications sent out in a staggered fashion so as not to send push notifications to everybody at the same time while aiming for the activity to be fulfilled as quickly as possible.
* Users can set a filter availability for the entire week as to the days and hours of when they're available/unavailable.

   * In kids mode, families can meet other families.
* Networks

It helps me gauge what exactly everyone's goals are.

You can tell by my approach to the master and apprentice relationship.

Funny thing about scientific results.

They go both ways.

The device works. It's been used illegally, and it is on the record as such. Illegal human experimentation is a serious crime. The likes of Mangala are guilty of. A Nazi. Fancy that.

So, it would appear some call what I call lights in my eyes. Shine. Thanks. Good to know.

So, when I was in the service and we were at war. We had to do drills every 2 to 3 hours. Battle stations. Standard stuff and I certainly wouldn't call it abuse. It is what we signed up for. It was important and necessary to keep us battle ready. We definitely were. We were number 1 in the fleet and as a result when a different ship had a 50 percent dud rate we had to take over and this kept us out to sea for a year rather than the standard 6-month deployment.

This messed up my sleeping patterns a bit. Ever since unless smoking weed. I have been unable to sleep for more than 2 hours. Adderall helps this as well. I was able to sleep through the night while on that every day. It's different for everyone of course. Now this is not a debilitating issue. It's more of an annoyance. I wake up I go back to sleep. I don't reach REM. Also I would have what they called waking dreams that I would spring out of bed ready to react to. Such as dreaming a black widow was in my bed and waking up from smashing my bed trying to squish it. Besides the stress build up over time which can be burnt away through exercise. I would not call this debilitating, The VA called it PTSD weird, but I took it. Now that said, without pot I have had dreams here and there. But with pot not at all. My preference really.

That is until a day a few months before I had my big break up in 2022 while on pot I had a dream of a flying thing. Looking back, it may have been a raven was coming after my girlfriend and daughter. I defended and ended up punching the computer right off a table as I woke up. Seems almost prophetic now. But odd. As I had not dreamed in that state ever.

At the beginning of this thing I had a dream of being up pine trees. Tall ones. 40 to 60 feet. From when I was a kid. Because I used to climb up into my pines in my back yard a lot as a child. In the woods and such. Build forts and seats and get sap all over my hands while doing so. With friends and cousins. It reminded me of an online conversation I had with a sweetheart person who had told me they climbed in pines as well just not very high. We know who that was.

Now Elon is the man with the dream of swift. Not me. I had a first girlfriend. Who her child photos look exactly the same. From 1989. The girlfriend not her photos. Obviously, she wasn't born just yet. She was only there for a little while. Like 2 weeks and I had ditched her for the outcast girl who sucked her thumb. I didn't like being popular, but I was in that daycare amongst the other children. The girlfriend was too. She had showed me honeysuckles and butter cup flowers, and we kept getting Japanese beetles landing on our necks. After I saw those photos in the state I was in It made me realize. I'm not so sure that girl was ever real. Mainly because I remember her having a very rich dad and I always kind of thought it was Evee. I will never really know for sure. But the imaginary friend Idea is appealing. I spun a story around this that I sent to Taylor.

Now knowing that. My sleep habits. Who dreamed what and What is a story and the truth.

Let's talk science and illegal human experimentation. Abuse and power plays.

Since all this happened from before my ex and I broke up I have been having some very vivid dreams. My shine has been dancing and changing to things it has never done before without my controlling it myself. Which I can do and used to use it to do math until my more recent loss of control of it. It has even shown me Chinese characters that I could not possibly know. Vivid visuals. It has become increasingly obvious that it is visuals and not dreams I am having and that is why there is no sound. Especially now that the infrasound and RF attacks have stopped.

There appears to be a device embedded into my wall I have found a live wire feeding to something attached back there. 120 volts. Right behind my bed.

These visuals only happen at home as well which is important. Same with infrasound and RF attacks. All forcing me out.

Now these visuals are clearly meant to manifest similar to the waking dreams I would have when I first got out of the service. Why would they want this? I am clearly better because these visuals haven't elicited physical reactions. Aside from the one time I smashed my computer before our breakup but again that was weird in the first place as I had been smoking pot and was still on Adderall able to sleep through the night when I went to sleep and wasn't being heavily stressed and taunted. By both my girlfriend and Tappers, Grillo and Granfield Alliance. In the Gilbert/Granfield games.

So, all that said. They are not in fact manifesting my original symptoms. They are manifesting brand-new ones. This device wakes me. Gives me a strong visual with no sound. I illustrate those in previous posts talking about dreams. Those visuals do not come from my mind, because they would be stuff, I know. Never been to record store in Manhattan. I haven't been to Peru. Don't speak Italian. When the infrasound was going I had a visual of a man sleeping with an Asian woman in a tub and they said this is Mao. Proving they are an idiot simultaneously as that is a boy's name. Turned on reddit and the first post is there you cheated haha. That is what I described as Mind rape. I assumed at the time it was Rob Granfield. The mind I sensed during it was the mind of a child. It felt gross.

After in which I wake-up or rather open my eyes because I am already up. Every day at 3am but also other times of day as well. 3am is regularly though no matter what time I go to bed. When I know Rob wakes up as well. Or maybe waking state is the better term. I am filled with a brief bit of energy and the device is clearly still on messing with my shine as it has been called. It keeps me up til between 6 to 9. In which I am exhausted from. Because I am a night owl naturally staying up late and screws my day. Making it far harder to be on time or find a job. They're intentions obviously.

It's important to note that a lot of planning went into this. Plants in my house of devices and listening devices. Forced behaviors. Trained behaviors. My ex helped them knowingly or not.

The Trumps may have been in my phone since 2013 or so. That never hurt me though. If they listened and learned cool. More power to them. I have no issue with that. I enjoy being useful.

But since My ex went into that asylum meeting their daughter. That's been a different thing, hasn't it. Since then, she asked me to do odd things. Did odd things herself. Let me tell you what I think.

They used her and me to get at the trumps. Thats what I think. Didn't care how much of my life they destroyed either. I think they did it under the guise of the game they play with gilbert, and I think they did for revenge and retirement. Not caring about the damage they reeked along the way. It was without a doubt a set up. It started all the way back in 2016 from the moment her mother married McCarthy.

Her mom just started on this bull right then about abuse. Hell I have plenty of posts from here in those first few weeks of her implicating him of abuse already . My daughter has come here telling me nana stories of him being too aggressive. Just won't stop. Always trying to get leverage. Doesn't know what love is. Just a manipulative sociopath. Like the Granfield's.

So my guess is they started hatching a plan all the way back in 2016 and stepping it up every day since. Examples of the plan and behaviors they had to force.

My ex would often do thing's I did not want her too. Like all the cleaning, make my coffees and generally act like a slave. A sub she called it. I didn't like this. It bothered me a lot. Why? Well, that's easy. It sounds great until you realize the truth of it. She was miserable doing it. Didn't want to do it. Would be actively irritable from doing it and often would do a horrible job at any of it from those specific facts. Oh she cooked for me everyday though in the beginning I begged her not to. Over and over. Don't do it. I would throw up once a week from forcing myself to eat undercooked food, Pork half raw. PORK! Ya, you get it. They always get it. So eventually I got mad and she corrected.

I remember the first time so well. Though she feigns not too. I said "" I think we need to break up. I dont think this is going to work if your going to do what I don't want you to do and only correct what your doing if I get angry."" I was trying to leave my anger in the past you see. It's the point of working with my hands. It's the point of smoking pot. Well she begged and no one begs better than her. Habits became habits as expected. So again she changed her story. She was no longer fine with it like she was when she begged. Now I am to loud and scary she wants me to text it. But make sure I text it angry. So she will listen. It was absurd. But I did strange things for this girl. I even used lines from tv shows and movies to fill in the meanest I just could not bring to bare. I can be mean. But I am not super mean. I'm not abusive. I usually have a way to get it out. She loved to get between me and walking away to take a break and push an push and push. Till I yelled. Thats all I ever did though. Never for very long. About as long as a text or a letter. I am very forgiving. I have proved that without question.

Even with this sleep deprivation. Clearly coming from this device I don't pretend to understand as no one has actually filled me in on what these lights actually are. Lighthouse I am guessing has something to do with it.

So no I was never abusive. Her and the granfields along with the tappers and probably grillos conspired to make me look like I was enough to get a restraining order on me and then abuse me through there games. With the bs justification of cheating. Which I 90 percent certain was Rob and Kelly and Kowalski and tara too. They put alot of stuff suddenly in my phone and were doing alot of temptations. I played along to see where it went.I thought at the time my ex and her family were at the center of it all. As she was pushing me and yelling at me to go to massage parlors then. Go to the strip club then. Over and over.

As you can see. I found where all that lead. There true nature and colors revealed.

I won't post for now.

In 2016 in the beginning thats when I received a 7 page front and back loveletter from my ex. That's the day I thought I fell for her. I now know the truth I fell for taylors words. For her. I really hope she is out there. More than anything now. It would mean the world. IT would make so much sense. She was trying to ugly me up and set me up constantly. Then there was the constant anti taylor stuff. Trying to get me to hate her. Turns out. I loved her. I just didn't know it yet. She is so beautiful.

I love her mind. I just love the way she thinks. The way she writes . Different from me in every way. Total opposites attract sort of thing. Its through those 7 pages. I fell for an angel.",1,1747499325.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
