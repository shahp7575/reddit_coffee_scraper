1gukp46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/1gukp46/landing_a_graduate_software_engineering_role_in/,Landing a Graduate Software Engineering role in 2025,"Hey everyone,

I am a CS student who graduated from the University of Auckland this year. I had plans to break into the UX field in New Zealand/Australia, but unfortunately, that didn't work out. Therefore, I plan to leverage my CS degree with 1+ year of SWE experience to land a graduate role in NZ or AUS in 2025.

I have heard that graduate roles are highly competitive due to the not-so-great job market and ever increasing CS graduates. Therefore, I would love to hear advice from graduates who have successfully landed a role in NZ and AUS this year or last year.

Here are my questions:

1. What do you think is the biggest thing you did that helped you land a graduate role? Was it doing projects, networking or crafting an outstanding resume?
2. Do I need to practice LC for technical interviews if I have no plans to work in big tech or HFT? I heard only Xero in NZ, and only companies like Atlassian, Canva and Optiver in Australia ask LC-type questions in their interviews.
3. What feedback can you provide on my resume? (I was not able to come up with impactful bullet points that I could write using the XYZ method because 1) I mainly worked on the front end, so I didn't work on any performance-related tickets that allowed me to write something like ""Reducing X deployment time to 2 minutes"", 2) I didn't know about the XYZ method, so I didn't actively ask my manager for tasks that will allow me to showcase my ability to deliver impact work to future employers and 3) I have no access to business data from my previous role such as how did my work ended up boosting conversion rates or sales.)
4. Is it a good idea to create a portfolio website and include projects that use tech stacks that are more common in NZ/AUS? I.e. React, C# and .NET? I wonder if this can make me a more attractive candidate since the tech stack I worked with in my last role and university was Vue and Angular with no backend tech.

Thanks a lot, and I would love to set up virtual coffee chats to hear your feedback and advice in more detail. Have a great day!

Listen, I have an affliction towards doing anything half-way. I painted a Baneblade for my IG before I even touched a Leman Russ or Rogal Dorn. So, like a crack addict between pay days, the Gladiator Lancer left me wanting more. Enter the Primaris Repulsor Executioner. I wanted to see what kind of quality was achievable within the constraints of a weekend, and write out the process for anyone curious. (I also have a pregnant wife and toddler who can't stand to be away from me, so this is definitely doable.)

The goal-

Have a model that's above tabletop standard complete by Sunday night.

  
Friday-

Bought the kit from my LGS on Friday during lunch. Got home and did family things until about 9pm, when the house got quiet. Assembly and adding details took me until about 11:45pm. Once the model was together, I used Tamiya putty to fill in body line gaps (because my exacto work is shakier than Helen Keller with a coffee). Left the putty to dry overnight.

  
Saturday-

  
This was a process between 9am and 10pm where I wasn't just sitting in the hobby hole all day. I was getting up every few minutes until the kid went down for a nap, and then finally down for the night. BUT a lot of progress was made. The goal was to finish all of my base coats and begin to work on the fun things.

1. Sand off my putty job that looked like termites got a taste of plastic. (45 min)

2. Prime with Vallejo black primer through the airbrush. (5 min)

3. Base coat dark green through the airbrush (5 min)

4. Zenithal with a light green (5 min)

5. Block in reds with brush. (60 min)

6. Block in Metallics with brush (30 min)

7. Highlight reds with brush. (45 min)

  
Didn't manage to get everything I had hoped for, done, but had a functional model.

  
Sunday-

  
The Lord's day is for cramming in everything else.....

  
Again, spent most of the day, but wanted to be able to call it done by 8pm.

1. Edge highlight the greens (omg never again) (180 min)

2. Paint books and purity seals. (30 min)

3. Wash silver with black wash. (10 min)

4. Block in browns with brush. (45 min)

5. Edge highlight browns. (20 min)

6. Paint lenses/ screen white. (15 min)

7. Apply transfers (micro sol stained my paint and I'm feeling vindictive). (45 Min)

8. Dry brush grav pieces with brown. (5 min)

9. Dry Brush grav pieces with highlight. (5 min)

10. Wash gold and flesh with brown/ red mixed wash. (10 min)

11. Apply judicious coat of pigment powder with dry brush (20 min)

12. Air brush yellow over lenses for cheap OSL look. (10 min)

13. Paint rim of base black and not even bother basing it because it's a tank and Gamers Grass is expensive. (2 min)

  
So yeah. Almost 13 hours for a ""nicer than tabletop look"". I'm well aware there are some spots that could be cleaned up, but that wasn't the intention of this. If I had taken my time, it would've been over the course of a week with better OSL, and cleaner edge highlights. I've been contemplating making YouTube videos for a while and wanted to play test a video idea sans the filming and editing.\` Anyway, hope someone finds value in this. I have my DA recipe down to an almost science and can crank ~~my hog~~  out a squad within 10 hours. If you have any feedback, please share (but my daddy left and my ego is fragile).

I am looking specifically for people who may be close to São Felix da Marinha, but I may be able to make a drive. 

Anyway, more about me...

I'm 22, currently going to college for Applied Psychology. I have a beautiful fiancée, and we've been together for about 4 years. I have two fur babies, cats, both loving boys. I like video games, baseball, drinks, hiking, exercising, and a lot of other things. I'm a pretty easy going person. That’s pretty much it. 

I'm not a big socialist, I'm more introverted, but I do need more friends considering that my soon to be wife has plenty.

\-I am both an ENFP/INFP \[Ambivert\]. My friends similarly agree that I'm: Caring, Kind, Funny, and Supportive. As well as my family who keep telling me that I should be a comedian, haha. I’m 5’3” SHORT curly dark brown hair, blue/green eyes, pale with freckles, black-framed glasses, Italian nose. I’d say I’m pretty average looking. I tried posting a photo a few times, but it would either erase all of this writing, or the picture wouldn’t appear. Because of this, I will share a photo privately.

\-My hobbies/interests: Writing, Reading, Painting, Video games, making and editing gaming videos for YT. I'm into superheroes. I love coffee. I'm a naturally curious person so you'll often find me doing biblical research. My love languages are all of them. Feel free to ask me anything.

\-I work with children of all ages. Either in daycare, or on my own personal time. Caring for human beings is my passion. I've been babysitting since I was 11. Whether that was my own siblings, or another family's child(ren). I've always wanted to help people no matter what my own life circumstances are. I believe God has gifted me with a sense of patience and compassion.

\-I grew up NonDenominational/Baptist. I tend to call myself a Believer in Christ OR a Born-Again Christian. Too many people can't figure out who I serve when I just call myself a ""Christian."" I believe that we are soldiers gearing up for a daily spiritual battle and that we can only fight that battle when we ask Christ for help every day! Jesus is 100% God and 100% Man. And you can't make compromises to sin, you must follow the biblical law. The Old Testament is equally as important as the New Testament. --- I got baptized when I was 12. During my upbringing there were a lot of issues in my family life/school life which led me down a dark road. Trauma at home, awfully bullied at school. There are things about my upbringing that I'd rather speak about, privately. I didn’t completely “find” Christ until around 13 because of the trials I went through. If I didn't know Jesus, I wouldn't be here. Praise the Lord! I am naturally an anxious person because of all of this. I also struggle with depression. My PTSD triggers would only be if someone shouts at me, or out of the blue. This includes jump scares (I am doing better).

\-Looking for: A husband. A Man of God -- NOT a “Christian Guy” (as the saying goes). I would like to have someone who has stronger faith than I do (Not saying that my faith is weak), as iron sharpens iron, so should we as people sharpen each other, and build each other up. I'd \*prefer\* a conservative right-wing male, but politics do not matter because JESUS is KING (I have dated two left-wing men in the past, and both weren't ideal nor were they in any agreement on the biblical aspects of life). Don't come at me in the comments.

\-I’d like someone who is compassionate, patient, humble, a great listener (I have a hard time expressing myself sometimes), brave, geeky (like me), passionate, full of love for all people, and pays attention to details. \*MUST WANT KIDS\* Waiting until marriage, too. I'm very stubborn about waiting until marriage, so if waiting is not your cup of tea, keep scrolling.

\-Age range: 23-29

\-Not sure about doing long distance. It takes a toll on my mental health. BUT I'm NOT against it. With the right person things can always work out! God's Will for our lives is superior to ours, so patience is easy for me. ANY questions, please leave them below and I will answer them. If any of this interests you OR describes you, reach out in private. 

Grazie! <3 \*\*\*I AM NOT IN A RUSH.\*\*\*

And then some more.  Ive returned repeatedly to this house. I tried oils the second order I did, but in the future I do not think I will get that pack.  I have now had the chance to try a few in both formats and generally speaking the edp has shown more complexity and longevity.  But i thought I'd share some more of my thoughts from this house as I slowly make my way towards trying the entire catalogue. Please see my previous first post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1f2ysp5/fant%C3%B4me_review_from_a_newbie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for more.  

The Fox Sisters
Spiced cardamom cake with orange zest and candied red currants, caramel cream, dragon’s blood resin, and flecks of vanilla bean.

This was good, but not like good good. The cardamom spices took over and that was a large part of what put it on my maybe list.  It was a nice spicy scent, just I wanted more.  Fortunately I gave this a second try as en edp instead of an oil.  The edp actually had the fruit at the front which made a rounder scent pulling the punch of the spice and brightening the whole thing up some.  I like it a lot better. 4/5

Morozko
Smooth peppermint, cracking birch, nutmeg, biting winter wind, cold vanilla, black pepper.

This is the smell of peppermint candies on the breath of someone outside in the winter.   It's bracing.  After a bit, it gets more medicial on me.  Reminded me of ointmentnor the Tigers balm my ex slathered on when they got congested.  Definitely cold.  I got to try this as a edp as well as an oil and the edp pulled much less medicine and more sweet on me.  4/5

Lorelei
Tart wild strawberries, basil, black narcissus, entangling seaweed, watery graves.

I am upset with how much I didn't like this.  I went hoping for strawberries and basil and they did not appear.  In either format.  The spray is.more balanced but still not it.  This scent is just so very, very floral.  1/5

Kyuu Kohi
A warm, tropical breeze, incense, roasted coffee, summer rain, and a drop of vanilla cream. 

I did like it.  Very incense heavy, but like the incense was burned in the room before the party you came to and has been out for a while now. I've only tried the oil so far, and I'd be interested to see if the edp would pull more of the notes for me.  As is, however, 3.5/5


Firebird
Smoldering embers, burning cloves, golden saffron, bright orange, soot on feathers, soft flame, a stolen apple.

I get a scent very similar to luna di miele, but without the honey.  You know, my favorite part of it.  It's a pleasant fruit and spice scent, but its also quite mild and subtle.  I don't really do subtle.  3/5

Stolas
Bluebells, an unburnt cedar offering, cool night air, lavender, soft owl feathers, blueberries, & a hint of dark chocolate.

I wanted so much to love you. I read review after review about how strong the chocolate and blueberries were.  I was so excited to get them.  I looked forward to them.  They were not present at all.  This is pure cedar.  Cedar, cedar, more cedar.  There is a hint at floral and some atmospheric air which i am impressed to see actually capture here, usually I consider that in a scent note to be filler.  But i am so disappointed in this.  I sincerely hope I'm able to try this again as an edp sometime and I get more of the rest of the notes beyond cedar.  2.5/5

Apsara
Juicy black figs, hibiscus nectar, smooth patchouli, iris, resinous woods, aged frankincense, benzoin, and spices. *Not vegan

I'm going to be real honest, this one was pretty not memorable. From my notes I said frankincense and floral.  A balanced not soapy scent, with the figs coming through more as time goes on.  But like, it did not leave an impression.  3/5

Namba
Salt water canals, motor oil, buzzing neon, melted vanilla ice cream.

Another one i tried as an oil that ended up very one note on me.  Nothing but salt water air.  2/5

Finist the Falcon
Bulgarian rose married with dewy Russian rose, swirled in strawberry, currant, & peach kissel with cream

This rose is incredibly overwhelming.  Its just rose.  No, just no.  Very perfumey.  1.5/5

Duende
Evokes the smell of being lost in a forest—with oakmoss, cedar, fir, resinous labdanum, benzoin, tree sap, wild violets, and lilac. 

I think I expected this to be less floral.  But it was mainly floral, with green, and maybe a bit of sweetness.  Mild soapiness.  This forest is most definitely in bloom all around.  3/5

Lymphae
Fresh musk, cool vanilla, a swift-running stream, Italian lilac, orange blossom, damp earth, and the ozone of spring thunderstorms

I hate this. Immediately scrubber.  You know when you went to your grandma's and she had the bathroom full of those mini decorative soaps shaped like flowers?  It smells like those.  So soapy. Very lilac.  0.25/5

Bune
Damp subterranean air, nagarmotha, smooth cave walls, davana, a cold marble altar, & glittering green dragon scales.

Okay, this smells like pickles.  Its a pickle brine.  It settles into an atmospheric cave but maintains the pickle.  I hate pickles.  1/5

Gion
Delicate ume (plum) blossom, rose-scented makeup powder, white tea, creamy honey, paper parasols. 

This is a powdery rose.  Or, I guess, a rose powder.  It is by far the best rose scent I've smelled so far in anything.   I get vintage vanity vibes from it.  I'd wear this.  3.5/5

Baba Yaga
Black and red musk, a smoldering cauldron, cracked bone, cardamom, hanging animal skins, burning mugwort.

I was very nervous/afraid of this scent. The description seemed like a lot.  It really works though.  It's like i finally found a perfume for ny inner witch I kept failing to shop for when I got into indies.  I had resigned myself to more of the kitchen witch subtle temptress scents, but nope, here's my girl ready to kidnap men to my hut and do dark magic.  Not an everyday scent my any means, but I like this muggy witchy scent when the mood strikes.  4/5

Olwyn
Magnolias, plush white lilies, night-blooming jasmine, and gardenias over rich, buttery vanilla, myrrh, benzoin, and a hint of orange blossom. *Not vegan

This was a scrubber for me.  Its floral, with a hint of vanilla.  It reminds me quite a bit of lymphae and its grandma soap, but not quite as bad.  1/5

Paimon
Hot sands, holy frankincense, sanctified myrrh, sun-bleached parchment, vanilla, black amber, coconut husk, a king's golden crown.

Okay, tell me I'm crazy, but i get Christmas vibes off of this?  Like I straight up think of the wisemen at the nativity when I smell it.  It's dry and warm and a resinous spicy.  It's pleasant but i wouldn't call it a standout. The coconut gets stronger as time goes on and really takes center stage on this.  3.5/5

Kinmokusei
Golden osmanthus in its full complexity—golden blossoms tinged with citrus, ripe apricot, juicy peach, tree sap, and deep, resinous amber.

I have been recommended this a couple of times but it was still like my third round of trying before this made it's way to me.  Everyone was right.  I loved it.  I am very fond of fruit scents.  It's kind of an alcoholic, floral peach.  It's on my fullsize eventually when my sample runs out list.  5/5

Madame d'Espérance
Sage laced with creamy jasmine, sensual red patchouli, frankincense, dusty cedar, a hint of rose, and intoxicating ambrette.

A surprise hit.  The sage and jasmine combo really does it for me.  It's spicy and herbal but it isn't warm.  It's intriguing and unlike anything else I have.  Definitely on my fullszie when the sample is gone list.  4.5/5

Not Dead, but Arisen
Freshly turned grave soil and spring greenery lie beneath uplifting orange and crisp yuzu.

This is very bitter.  1/5

Marya Morevna
Sharp steel, rare Siberian lotus, skin musk, ambrette, white Baltic amber, wild orchid, blood red beets

Ick.  This was a very earthy scent.  It reminded me a bit of Bune, with a hint of pickleness to it.  Not for me.  1.5/5",1,1731976891.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the experience; the vibe was fun; meeting roasters across was a treat; and the location outside one of the many Kawagoe temples was unique.

I wake up at 5:20am to shower and get ready for the day before my husband has to leave for work. Sometimes the baby needs to be fed in that time so I don't get to get myself ready. Toddler wakes up around 7am and then it's go go go. I have toys, usually a morning activity, and breakfast ready for him. He doesn't eat and then is cranky in a few hours. I have baby in a carrier so I can play with toddler but it's not 100% and my toddler is starting to get jealous of the baby. He just wants me to hold him, which I understand. It's not worth rocking the baby for 20 minutes to get him to sleep in the bassinet just for him to wake up in 5 minutes. 

I try to get to the playground or park but it's happened only once so far because I'm trying to time it so we can leave after I feed the baby, but he naps for so long that I get 1 opportunity and my toddler is usually needing to be fed or something so we just don't go anywhere. I have taken them to my and their doctor appointments and a play date and it takes all of my mental energy. I feel like I'm losing my memory because of how maxed out my brain is all day. 

My husband sleeps in the room with the baby and just brings him to me to nurse overnight. He also makes breakfast and coffee for me. He will take one or both kids after work but one or both cry for me and he either brings them to me or I feel guilty and take one. He also works from home on Fridays for the next 4 months which is really helpful but I'm scared of what'll happen after that. 

We have no family around to help, and I'm trying to find a babysitter but I asked everyone I know and there's no leads. We tried a lady I found online and she was good but gave me the creeps. I got ghosted by a few more before their first day. It's exhausting trying to find someone and I don't know if I'll ever be comfortable leaving such small kiddos with an internet stranger. We do have a house cleaner so I do minimal cleaning which is a huge blessing. We have food restrictions so I cook mostly every meal but I try to involve my toddler so at least it's something to do. 

I just feel so beyond drained and burned out and by the end of the day, and by the end of the week I'm like a shell of a person. I have PPD and just started Zoloft. I don't know if this feeling of overwhelm is because of the PPD or if I just am not cut out to be a SAHM. 

Another huge aspect of this is that I'm worried I'm failing both of my kids because I can't dedicate my full attention to either one.",4,1731976244.0,SAHP,1,1.0,False

My mother’s house is full of animals that I hate. I can’t stand them. The coffee maker is always full of cat fur and scabs because the cats are sick and they won’t listen to me when I say they’re fucking sick. We have a boxer mix and two danes, and I’m so fucking sick of the two greatdanes. One keeps jumping over the fucking gate and eating cat shit from the litter box. I hear yelling constantly. My mom is always angry and I can’t get a break from it, and when I’m at my dad’s I can’t be who I am. I have headmates that I’m attempting to get a diagnosis for, and my dad thinks I’m lying about them. They can’t be out when my father is around and he’s scared the fuck out of one of them already. My father’s house is calmed, but feels more caging because I can’t say anything without him bringing up his “degree” (which he doesn’t actually have on paper) in psychology. My therapy has even said she’s had cases of people like my dad thinking they know better because they had a psychology “degree”. I’m not heard by anybody, and I’m stuck here until my stepfather (my mom’s husband) hires people to build more to the house, or I finally move out. I don’t have money right now, but I wish I had my own place. I don’t have a safe space anymore and most days I want to get rid of the animals that caused it. I wish my parents would stop picking the dogs over my well being. They’ve known me for 18 years, and they’ve barely known these damn animals for less than a few months. They’re causing nothing but stress, and they’re already in a shitty home because this fucking trailer wasn’t meant for 9 cats, three dogs, and 6 people, and I can’t say anything because my mom is a stubborn woman and doesn’t think she needs to listen to me, and my father believes because he took psychology in college and the youtube “PsYcHoLoGiStS” say things like DID/OSDD are fake, than that means I’m a liar and it’s all in my goddamn head. I can’t even shower properly in my mother’s house anymore because I’m terrified of the dogs barking. I hate my goddamn housing. I’m trapped in both houses, and nobody wants to listen because “you’re not a real adult till you’re 25”. I’m so close to just saving up my money for whatever trailer or small apartment I can, or put myself into fucking debt just to escape the chaos and feeling of trapped. I’m so close to giving up handing over my body to my other headmates. The only reason I haven’t done that yet is because they plead either me not to leave because they love me. I understand there’s going to be questions about everything and even hate from lunatics who just don’t believe peoples’ brains can comprehend multiple inner voices and will try to white-knight or gatekeep labels because they have no other life but I don’t care.

So one day, she disappears which isn't like her. She's usually around at least once a day. Well a few days later, after lots of worrying, she hobbles back up onto the porch. My partner and I jump right in and get her inside. We get her to the vet and turns out she broke her hip somehow. The vet says she probably fell from something like a tree or balcony.
Long story short, we've been doing the best we can but sadly I'm just not able to afford for the care this cat needs, frankly. We've already sort of put ourselves in a tight spot with vet bills and there's a lot more needed.
We've been told that she likely has nerve damage in her spine because she has been unable to move her tail at all after about 6 weeks. The vet said she'll probably need it to be aputated but suggested waiting a several months. Ultimately, this animal isn't keeping me from buying new video games or from my morning coffees, instead, I'm legitimately not sure I would be able to keep paying my bills and afford my own food let alone her food if I keep getting further in debt with vet bills.
So what do I do? I can't just dump her back on the street, I can't afford to care for her, and I don't know where to take a car with so many issues. I want her to live her best life, it's just not with my I don't think, but I don't know where she would be able to get what she needs.

TL:DR I befriended a stray cat that got seriously injured. I'm not capable of getting the care she needs. I've already overextended myself with the care she's gotten so far (6-7 weeks). I want her to have a good life but I don't know where I can take her. I live in the US. Please help.",4,1731975998.0,cats,0,1.0,False
1guk7gy,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/,PSA for Pitcher and Baby Brezza Users: Toxins in Black Plastic,"There is a new study that indicates black plastic may be exposing us to harmful chemicals associated with hormonal and developmental impacts, including cancer.

I linked an article below from Wirecutter, but in a nutshell:
- Black plastic, which is notoriously difficult to make, is often made from recycled electronics 
- Those electronics often contain flame retardants and other chemicals
- Testing in a recent study shows those chemicals present in cooking utensils (and toys)
- The chemicals can leach out, especially when heated, which is why the article specifically calls out cooking utensils and coffee makers
- There’s no easy way to tell if your black plastic kitchen utensils contain these chemicals and it’s recommended to throw them out (do not recycle them) 

I use the Dr. Brown’s pitcher with a black plastic lid and mixer. I just ordered the blue version after reading about the concerns with black plastic.

I believe the Baby Brezza also has black plastic bits that come in contact with hot water. So I wanted to pass along the PSA.

I fear that I will have to give up adderall if I’m ever going to successfully stop drinking. The two have become linked. I have a diagnosis and adderall truly helps me function and think straight but it also increases my overall anxiety and it wears off right around craving time and it feels like I must drink in order to relax or hold a conversation socially. 

I also know that I use it, alcohol and coffee as a way to artificially change my “state”, which I’m never happy with. It’s also a crutch to help me get work done despite being hung over. 

But how do I go about kicking both adderall and alcohol at once? That feels impossible. 

Side note: how does one with adhd achieve the goal of quitting alcohol when I can’t continuously care about any goal? It lives with a large group of ever-rotating goals that I’m always stressed about but my mood changes and I suddenly forget how important one thing is and start prioritizing another thing.

I recently got back from an amazing trip to Hawaii, and I wanted to share my experience at Turtle Bay Resort since I've seen lots of questions about whether it's all-inclusive or not.

Let me clear this up right away - Turtle Bay Resort isn't technically all-inclusive, but honestly, that might be a good thing! While the resort doesn't include all meals and drinks in your stay, it offers something way better - freedom to explore and customize your vacation exactly how you want it.

During my stay, I discovered that the resort has five amazing restaurants on-site, but you're not locked into eating at them for every meal. You can choose to dine there or venture out to try local spots (the food trucks nearby are incredible!). The resort offers room-only rates, bed and breakfast packages, and other flexible options that let you plan your vacation your way.

What really made my stay special were the activities. The North Shore location is perfect for everything from surfing to snorkeling. I booked several tours through https://athometouch.com/hawaii and it was the best decision ever. They have tons of options for activities around the resort, and get this - you earn rewards for future trips!

The resort itself is stunning - we're talking oceanfront views, beautiful pools, and a golf course that'll make any golfer drool. The rooms were recently renovated and they're super comfortable. My ocean-view room had this amazing balcony where I could watch surfers in the morning while drinking my coffee.

Here's what you actually get at the resort:
- Access to all facilities (pools, beach, fitness center)
- WiFi
- Coffee maker in room
- Access to resort activities (some have additional fees)
- Parking (for a fee)

Pro tip: If you're planning activities (which you definitely should), check out https://athometouch.com/hawaii. They've got the best deals on tours and activities around the island, plus you earn rewards for your next adventure. I saved quite a bit by booking through them!

The best part about Turtle Bay not being all-inclusive is that you can really experience Hawaii like a local. You're not stuck at the resort all day - you can explore the North Shore, try different restaurants, and create your own adventure.

So while Turtle Bay Resort isn't all-inclusive, I actually think that's part of its charm. You get the luxury resort experience with the freedom to explore Hawaii on your own terms. Trust me, you won't miss the all-inclusive aspect one bit!

It’s roughly sized 7’ by 14’ and another 5’x8’ in the back that can be used as storage.  

I need advice. 
If I do just super high end coffee ($7-$10 / cup), pour over only etc., is there a market for that or do most people want espresso drinks?  I’m trying to stay away from buying $20k espresso machine.  ",1,1731975538.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False

I understand that tips functioned this way historically, but given how little wages have risen relative to the cost of living in recent decades, this feels like an antiquated stance to me.

For context - I have lived my whole life in the Northeast. I was taught at a young age that the vast majority of service workers make less than minimum wage, and the tipping system exists to compensate for this and enable service workers to make (at least closer to) a living wage. When I was in college, I pretty much always tipped 20% despite not having much to spare. Since I make a comfortable salary now, I tip 20-25%. I have always factored this amount into the projected cost of eating out and plan accordingly. 

In reading this sub, I was surprised to notice that the most common anti-tipping argument is not ""I can’t afford to pay 20% more"" but rather ""I take issue with people’s sense of entitlement to a 20% tip"" which feels like a fundamental disconnect from how I’ve always viewed the purpose of tipping. 

I’ll also add that, whether this makes me a hypocrite or not, I do find it easy to understand people’s frustration when they order a coffee and pastry at a grab-and-go place and are presented with a tip screen. I’m moreso perplexed by the POV of those who believe a 20% tip for restaurant table service needs to be earned through above-and-beyond customer service.

Personally, I feel like my ideal version of tipping culture would (1) require all businesses to pay service workers minimum wage, (2) in doing so, do away with the societal expectation to tip, and (3) optionally offer the ability to tip an additional amount if the service was truly exceptional.

Please do let me know if I’m making any unsupported assumptions in my reasoning here. I’d be grateful for any thoughtful responses from the other side! ",0,1731975330.0,tipping,13,0.27,False

I 22F have been dating my boyfriend 22M for almost 4 years. We live in different states and met online, traveling back and forth every month or so to see each other. I know the title of this post sounds horrible, and I feel horrible even typing that out, but please hear me out.

 We met in 2020 right after we both finished high school. I went straight to a university in my state to major in bachelors of nursing. He went to his local community college for a business associates. However, he didn’t take his school seriously at all and ended up taking 4 years to complete his degree, which put us both graduating at the same time with very different career levels. Finishing nursing school was tough for me, and i have always felt like he hasn’t taken what i do seriously and never acknowledges the hard work I had to put in to get there. He has frequently made comments suggesting that what I do isn’t all that hard and compared the amount of knowledge required for nursing to a coffee barista… Throughout our relationship I have religiously tried to find different paths for him to get him in the right direction for a career. I’ve done hours of research into what options he has to use his new degree, looking for different certifications he could easily aquire to add to his resume. Literally not a single one of my suggestions was considered for more than 5 seconds by him. And this goes into a whole other issue. The job he actually does have. 

He has worked at two different restaurants throughout our entire relationship. The first a sports bar, one that eventually led to multiple instances of micro-cheating by him (flirting, secret hangouts, regular texting). When i caught onto that he ended up quiting to work at an Italian restaurant. There, he met a girl who i had had suspicions about for months. I was constantly seeing her name in his likes and recent searches ect. He gaslit me for months until i ultimately found out he had admitted to her that he had feelings for her, i found 4,000 deleted messages between them…4,000... and that at the peak of my insanity from being gaslit, there was a phone call where i just broke, i screamed and cried begging for him to end it if there was someone else and he SWORE there wasn’t, well turns out, the girl was listening the entire time.I found out the day my grandma died and broke up with him that same day. I was stupid and heartbroken and grieving and still in love and wanted to give him a second (but not really second more like 10th) chance.

 I waited about a month for him to come back to me, all while he was blatantly ignoring me and clearly showing that he had no interest in getting back together with me while still telling me that he loved me and missed me. Turns out, that whole time he was actively trying to start a relationship with the girl from his work (who was in a whole relationship). He also slept with and/or went on dates with literally Every. Single. Girl. he had told me not to worry about. Anyways, the girl from his work had cheated on her bf with my then ex (WHO STILL HAD MY PICTURES HANGING ON HIS BEDROOM WALL AND ON HIS LOCKSCREEN when she came over to do shit with him… eventually she rejected him to try and fix things with her bf. And literally 3 days after that rejection my ex came crawling back to me BEGGING me to take him back. And i didnt, at first.

 After months of him acting straight manic, 10’s of calls every night, 10’s of video diaries he made for me, flying out to my state against my advice to try and win me back, and just sooo many phone calls of him sobbing, begging , pleading, and sacrificing everything to win me back. I’ve heard all the stories too, once a cheater always a cheater, love bombing, ect. But i did and do love him. And i took him back.

 It’s been a few months, he has been a really good boyfriend since then. He took me to Italy, buys me things, and sends all the words of affirmation. He does everything in his power to reassure me and it’s 100% clear that he doesn’t want to lose me again. But before we got back together i made it very clear that my standards had risen, i wasn’t okay with settling for someone who had no goals or plans for their future, and i have no interest in financially supporting any man who is fully capable of supporting themselves. I told him that i expect a plan from him, and it doesn’t have to be anything crazy, just some sort of plan to progress from the restaurant industry. I’ve given him months and there’s been literally zero progress. He bought a 2023 Camaro, now has a massive debt bc of that, has no savings, and literally no plan other than to move in with me and get another restaurant job here. I work so hard and have done it all while also being a caregiver to my dad who has a terminal illness. I have a plan, a savings, health insurance, a 401k. And that’s never something i try to rub in face, and frankly even if i did, i doubt he would even care bc he doesn’t find that type of stuff important. But when i reflect, i just always end up back at that same idea of feeling too good for him. I don’t know what to do, because in terms of being a good boyfriend and staying loyal he really has been 100% (and he prides himself on that, which kinda makes it lose its worth tbh). But in life, I’ve seen no progress. Please help me.

TL;DR My boyfriend has cheated on me and has no plan or goals for life and I feel like I could do better but i love him and think I maybe just can’t go through the pain that I associate with leaving him again. ",0,1731975295.0,relationshipadvice,6,0.33,False

1gujx10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gujx10/the_man_outside_my_window/,The Man Outside My Window,"2 days ago I noticed a man standing outside my apartment window. The first time I saw him, it was just a quick glance as I opened the curtains for my cat; she liked to sit on the window sill and watch the birds in the trees and the people down below.

The man stood across the courtyard with his back to me. I thought it was odd that he was just standing there facing the brick wall, but I just shrugged it off and went on with my day.

Later that night, my cat was still sitting at the window. She’d often spend hours there and would only leave to eat and use the litter box. I went over to pet her and noticed the man again. He was standing in the same exact spot, still staring at the wall. I tilted my head and wondered to myself if he had been standing there this whole time.

I watched him for several minutes, absentmindedly petting my cat; he didn’t move at all. An idea came to me and I felt like an idiot; *what if I’d just wasted my time staring at a mannequin.* I laughed and shook my head, feeling foolish.

Suddenly, my cat’s hair stiffened and she stood up, hissing. I glanced down, but by the time I did she’d already leapt off the window sill and ran into the bathroom.

“What’s gotten into you?” I asked.

I scowled at her before looking back outside. The man whom I’d thought was a mannequin was no longer staring at the wall. He had turned in the direction of my building and stood there, just as still as he had before. I couldn’t tell what he was looking at from this distance but he gave me the creeps. I quickly closed the curtains and went to bed.

By the morning my cat had left the bathroom and relentlessly purred against my face. I glanced down at my phone and saw the time.

“Shit,” I muttered. I’d accidentally slept in—and she was obviously hungry.

I quickly filled her bowl and changed into my work clothes before rushing out the door. I headed down the stairs toward the back entrance and was halfway across the courtyard when I remembered the strange man. I looked over and, to my relief, he was no longer standing there. The way he stood so eerily-still seemed so strange and inhuman to me, but I was just glad that he had moved along.

I made it to work on time but my manager asked me to stay late anyway. One of my coworkers called off and he wanted me to cover his shift. I didn’t want to but I begrudgingly agreed.

The work day was long and mentally draining. It was dark by the time I got back to the apartment. I crossed the empty courtyard and was reaching for the door handle when the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. A chill ran up my back and I had the weird feeling I was being watched. I glanced around and then instinctively looked to the spot where the man had stood—he wasn’t there.

I shrugged off the feeling and briskly made my way up the back stairs and into my apartment. The sound of both locks clicking into place put me more at ease but I still grabbed my old baseball bat from the closet and set it next to the couch—just in case.

I changed out of my work clothes and grabbed a six pack from the fridge, finally sitting down in front of the television. Beer and binging YouTube videos sounded like a good time after such a long day. I cracked open the first can and took several big swigs before my body finally started to relax. I pressed the power button on the remote and leaned back into the cushions, inevitably vegging out.

10 minutes passed before I noticed my cat sitting in the bathroom doorway. She stared out, focused on the closed curtains across the room.

“You wanna people watch?” I asked her.

I got up and pulled the curtains aside. She didn’t move—just continued to stare. I shrugged and sat back down, leaving the curtain open so she could jump up if she wanted to. I downed the rest of my first beer and grabbed a second.

By the time I’d finished the last beer in the pack, only an hour and half had passed. I was feeling pretty good by this point, but also pretty exhausted.

I walked into the bathroom and shooed the cat out, closing the door behind me. I positioned myself in front of the toilet and pulled down the front of my pants, letting loose into the bowl.

Outside the bathroom I could hear my cat hissing and meowing aggressively. I sighed and tried to hurry nature along.

“What’s the matter, Zoey?” I asked, quickly pulling up my pants and opening the bathroom door. My cat was underneath the coffee table staring at the window, hissing.

“What? You don’t like the window now?” I asked, walking over to it.

I reached for the curtain to close it but stopped dead in my tracks. Halfway across the courtyard was the man. He stood there perfectly still, but this time there was no mistaking it, he was staring directly at my window. My heart skipped a beat, and I waited, but he didn’t move, he just continued looking. Leering. There was something about his gaze that was deeply unsettling.

My heart was beating fast but the alcohol coursing through my veins turned some of the fear into anger. I reached for the frame and pulled up, opening the window, immediately leaning out to yell at him.

“Hey, fuckhead! What the hell is your—“ I stopped. The man was gone. I looked around all over but I couldn’t see him anywhere. The evening air blew across my face and I reached up and rubbed my forehead. A cold sweat coated my fingers and I shivered.

I pulled myself inside and stood up, confused. I was about to close the window, when I noticed the man standing out in the courtyard again. My heart sank and I slowly bent down.

Through the glass, the man was there, but once my eyes jumped over the window’s frame, the man disappeared. I moved my head up and down a few times, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. On the last movement, when I looked through the glass again, the man had jumped 10 feet closer to my apartment.

I stumbled back and fell on my ass; Zoey hissed again behind me. I scrambled to my feet and ran back to the window, the man was even closer now. He stood directly below, staring up at me. His eyes were wide open; he never blinked.

Not letting him out of my sight, I asked through the glass, “What the fuck do you want??”

The man didn’t move a muscle, but somehow, a smile slowly crept across his face—so slowly that I couldn’t be sure if he’d just been smiling the whole time.

I blinked, and the man was gone. I frantically craned my neck trying to see where he had disappeared to. A scary thought occurred to me and I quickly grabbed the baseball bat from the living room and unlocked my apartment door. I ran toward the back staircase of the building and when I turned the corner, my legs almost gave out.

The door at the top of the back staircase was open and thudding against something I couldn’t see. Gravity tried to pull it closed and it would stop and jerk open again.

I was terrified but the bat and beer combination gave me the courage to push forward.

“Ha ha, got me good. You can come out now,” I said, the fear clear in my voice. I held the bat tighter and inched closer.

I didn’t realize it right away but the hallway was uncharacteristically void of sound; no voices from the other tenants, no televisions, no nothing. The only sound I could hear was the door banging back and forth, and even that sounded dulled in the hallway.

 I stepped cautiously forward until I reached the doorway, but didn’t cross the threshold. My eyes scanned up and down the door and it’s hinges trying to figure out what it was caught on, but I found nothing. I extended the bat forward and pressed it against the door trying to stop it from banging.

The bat was violently ripped from my hand and went flying into the stairwell. I think I was in shock, as I stood there for several seconds, completely unable to move. The same thoughts repeated over and over in my head. *There’s nothing there… There’s nobody…*

I sprinted back to my apartment and pulled at the bottom window section, yanking it out and splintering the old wooden frame in the process. As I ran out through my apartment door holding the pane in front of me, I glimpsed a torso through the glass. I tripped and slammed into the opposite wall of the hallway; the old glass panel in my hands shattered all around me as I fell.

Glass shards littered the floor and my cat freaked out and ran down toward the front of the building.

I sat there on my ass terrified, surrounded by broken glass. A few feet away, I heard a crunch and the shards started to move. I was up and gone before I could even think.

I ran down the hall after my cat, picking her up along the way; I’d never run so fast in my entire life. Zoey whined in my arms as I circled around the outside of the building to get to my car in the back parking lot.

My tires peeled as I got out of there. Zoey sat on my passenger side floor, meowing fearfully. I didn’t stop driving until I’d reached my parent’s house a half hour away.

My mom and dad shared a worried look on their faces when they opened their door. I stood there, barefoot, with several cuts on my arms and feet. I had left my phone behind in the apartment so I wasn’t able to warn them I was coming.

I tried my best to explain without sounding absolutely insane. I told them that someone at the apartment was stalking me and I didn’t know who it was or what they wanted—that part was true. I recounted how I’d fled without closing my door and only managed to take Zoey with me. It helped sell the reality of the threat when I’d started to shake and stutter as I was retelling the story. I explained away the cuts by saying the window had popped out of it’s frame and I tripped over it as I ran. I had to lie to them. I couldn’t tell them what I really saw, because I didn’t know what I really saw—and they wouldn’t believe me anyway. I finished by telling my dad that I never wanted to go back to that place again. He saw the fear in my eyes and accepted my decision without much grief.

The following morning, I emailed the guy that rented me the apartment; he was pretty pissed about the broken window and me trying to end my lease early. My dad said he’d smooth things over with him while he was there packing up my stuff. I tried to talk him into hiring someone instead of going himself but he wouldn’t listen.

I’m currently sitting here in my parent’s living room; I’ve barely slept at all. I’m using my mom’s phone to text my dad every 10 minutes to check if he’s okay. My mom keeps trying to pull me away from the windows to get some sleep but I’m terrified that the man will follow my dad home.

I’ll never forget how he looked at me. I never want to see those eyes again.",1,1731975190.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

To be fair, I didn't even remember until his mom jogged my memory. Maybe I just want to get this off my chest, I don't know if it merits admitting I was there or he just wants to forget it.

My boyfriend and I went to elementary and middle school together. I was very popular because my older sister was incredibly popular. My sister, who was in the grade above me, brought me into a large, inter-grade clique of girls. Some of the girls were nice but wouldn't show it at school and some were downright rotten. My boyfriend (hopefully soon to be fiance) was not in the ""in crowd."" He was a grade below me and I didn't really know him (I knew of him.. we all did) - it was a big enough school that I didn't even know everyone in my own grade. Anyway, I was at his parent's place and I was looking through some middle school year book and saw a picture of him - he was the cutest, nerdiest little guy ever. He was small for his age - he grew to be a refrigerator size person but not then. He had a short cropped haircut, he wore a shirt tucked into pants with a belt and leather shoes. He carried a huge backpack full of extra books and won ""most likely to be a scientist"" award that year (BF is a 3rd year medical student, so not far off). He was the smart kid at an athletic school and I guess had rubbed one of my ""friends"" the wrong way.

Anyway, I saw the picture in the year book and instantly adored the picture. I asked my BF's mother if she had a similar photo and she did - she had taken a photo that morning and had a copy I could have. She found it and gave it to me so I could frame it. It's the most adorable thing you've ever seen. He's got a goofy grin, damp hair brushed to the side, and just this outfit that makes him look like he's 12 going on 84. I got it framed and put it in our bedroom. So, when my BF mother was giving me the photo, she told me that he caught hell that day, that his outfit was the source of some stress. I asked and apparently he had been eating lunch with the teacher working on an extra-credit. He got beaten up for ""being a nerd"" and a group of kids, including some girls, got in trouble for it. Here's the thing, I was one of those girls. I didn't throw a punch and I didn't actually physically assault him, but I was there. I had completely forgotten this.

My BF has an aptitude for learning languages and would eat lunch with our math & physics teacher who was Russian. They would eat lunch in the empty classroom and she'd teach him Russian and Polish. She was an older lady and adored giving a young kid a chance to learn Russian. Because he spent every free moment with her being tutored, he didn't really eat or consort with the other kids his own age, in part because he was really bright and loved to learn and in part because we ostracized him. I would say he was totally friendless, but was adored by the teachers. He caught a lot of hell during school - he was protected by the teachers and could do no wrong so when they weren't looking, he was a punching bag. Anyway, near the end of the school year, he won some academic excellence award, it was basically the award no one wanted because it made you look like such a nerd (in retrospect being a nerd was probably a lot better). As 'retribution' for the award, a girl and her BF were going to enact swift justice. She was going to throw his backpack into the girl's bathroom while her BF was going to knock him down and keep him from stopping her from throwing the backpack in there. Word spread and a group of people were loitering waiting for the prank.

It didn't go that way at all. The guy leaped on him knocking him off his feet and he hit his head on the floor, he was out cold. Panic ensued and we fled. The girl who was supposed to throw his backpack into the bathroom later admitted to everything and named everyone present. Her BF was expelled and she was severely punished. Everyone else had their parent's called and finished the school year in detention and started off the school year with a set of punishments.

My boyfriend transferred schools to a different district and I didn't see him again until 2nd year of university and we only started dating 4th year of university. My boyfriend rarely talks about that time, he knows we went to the same school, we were in different grades and that I probably disliked him like everyone else did. The thing is, he doesn't know I was present at the event that knocked him out. On one hand, I don't want to dredge up bad memories and force him to discuss a subject that may be really sore. I don't want to live with the guilt I started feeling. On yet another hand, I don't want him to find out, get really angry and dump me.

I don't know what to do, but for some reason, I feel guilt almost 15 years later. Should I say anything? Should I just go on like before?

tl;dr: BF was bullied at school that we used to attend. I was part of a group of people waiting for him to be humiliated but it wound-up with him getting injured/knocked out and transferring schools. He doesn't seem to remember I was there (and neither did I, actually) and I kind of don't want to tell him so that he doesn't get mad at me/dump me... but I feel really guilty.

I live in a red state in a rural town. I’m feeling bad because I may have panicked and bought things that I will need. 

My list is as follows:
1. Canister of coffee
2. 4 pack of chamomile tea (this helps alleviate anxiety for me)
3. A 12 pack of bar soap
4. 4 lbs of lentils
5. 9 lbs of beans I love to eat
6. Pack of period underwear
7. Menstrual cup
8. 5 lb bag of split peas
9. A big box of N95 masks
10. A wool blanket
11. 5 lbs of whole wheat flour

I didn’t buy anything I wouldn’t eat. I absolutely adore lentils, beans, and split peas. Also, I love making non-leavened whole wheat flatbread. The food items I bought will make a lot of meals and will last me. I actually eat the types of food I bought.

I menstruate, so I needed to make sure I have reusable period products. 

I got N95 masks to protect myself and my family.

The wool blanket will come in handy this winter.

The coffee and chamomile tea are comforting for me and they allow me to function.

I’m working on prepping my home with crafts, art supplies, books, and music. I’m going to probably buy $200 worth of books that I love because education is what I live for. I also love to write.

1gujpdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheStarPeople/comments/1gujpdh/psychic_protection_for_empaths/,Psychic protection for empaths,"8 powerful psychic protection techniques for empaths and highly sensitive people.

Psychic protection is a powerful tool for empaths and highly sensitive people. It can be used to block external influences and minimise sensory overload. As well as handing you the skills to keep your inner realm calm, clear and under your control.

Being an empath or a highly sensitive person is an incredibly gift. Your heightened empathy means you connect deeply with others, making you an incredibly supportive friend and effective communicator. Your sensitivity and intuition is unparalleled and often your creativity shines through. For many however these gifts can also be a double-edged sword.

Navigating life with super sensory and intuitive powers can be exhausting and overwhelming. It can even feel that life is not your own. Psychic protection enables you to change this by giving you the skills to take full control of your life experiences.

Here are my top eight suggestions on how you could use psychic protection to work with your super empathic powers in a more constructive and controlled way:

 

1. Pay attention

Empaths are constantly bombarded with energetic information. The question is are you noticing what this energetic information is telling you? Start paying attention to what you are picking up. Notice how people, clients, colleagues and spaces affect you, you can even start to note this down. Keeping a list of your thoughts and experiences might reveal patterns and give you valuable feedback.

Note down who gives you a headache, leaves you drained or gets stuck in your head. In contrast whose company is uplifting and bright? Which colleagues are great to work who are challenging to be around? Knowledge is power! If you can see who affects and how you can take appropriate action to support yourself.

 

2. Close off your body’s energy circuit

If you are with someone who drains or overwhelms you then close down your energy circuit. This prevents any energy exchanges taking place. You can do this by crossing or folding your arms in front of your tummy.  This shuts off your solar plexus – an important centre of energetic signals. Done casually with a smile no one will guess what you’re doing!

 

3. The Cloak of Protection

Creative visualisations are powerful tools in psychic protection. Where thought goes energy flows and visualisation exercises harness the power of intention both within you and with the universe.

Next time you need to protect your energy imagine pulling on a full-length cloak complete with hood. Picture the outside being darkest blue, the inside can be whatever you fancy. The inside lining can be multicoloured, your favourite colour, or even decorated with magic symbols. Notice the weight of the cloak as it falls from your shoulders and edge of the hood brushing your face. Your cloak provides a magical barrier between you and the outside world. No external energies can pass through it. Sense the power flowing through your cloak and how protected you feel.

This is a wonderful creative visualisation to use anywhere, anytime. You can even incorporate it into your daily routine pulling on your cloak as you leave your house.

4. Invoke your spirit animal

Spirit animals have been part of the shamanic traditions for thousands of years. Each animal is associated with different energies and specific qualities. Some of the most popular ones are:

Dragon
Tiger
Jaguar
Black panther
Wolf
Calling in a spirit animal is a very powerful practice.  You can begin by closing your eyes, breathing gently and stilling yourself. Set your intention asking for your chosen spirit animal to come forward to protect you.

Wait for your spirit animal to reveal itself. Enjoy observing every detail you can, their eyes, colouring and patterning, shape and size, how it moves, even how it breathes and what you can smell. Feel its presence, notice the unique energy and power of your spirit animal. Observe and respond to its interaction with you, feel its protective presence as it circles you and your energy field. Notice how you feel as it builds protective energies around you. Additionally you might like to express your gratitude to your spirit animal when they are done.

As you become more familiar with your spirit animal, you won’t need to close your eyes to call them in; you’ll effortlessly feel or sense their presence. I have sat in meetings with my black panther lying across my feet and if I am nervous he walks alongside me.

 

5. Crystals for psychic protection

For thousands of years crystals have been revered for their healing properties. The following crystals all offer various energetic protection. They can be worn, carried or or placed on your coffee table or desk:

Fluorite (psychic shield)
Jet (heals leaks in the aura)
Labradorite (useful when travelling)
Black Tourmaline (psychic shield and neutralises destructive energies)
Hematite (transforms negative energies)
Black obsidian (shields you from negativity)
Malachite (strengthens the aura)
Remember to cleanse your crystals regularly in a bowl of salt or brown rice, hard crystals can be washed in water. They can be left in the moonlight to cleanse and recharge.

6. Flower Essences fo psychic protection

Flower essences have been created to harness the unique vibration of plants, flowers, bushes and trees. The following essences have been created to provide psychic protection. When you use the sprays you might like to make a little ritual out of it. Pause, breathe, centre and connect and set your intention remembering that you can ask the universe to help you:

Sacred Energy Shielding Mist from Findhorn Flower Essences
Psychic Protection Protecting Room Mist from Findhorn Flower Essences
Calling in Angels Spray Mist by Alaskan Essences
Guardian Sacred Space Spray by Alaskan Essences
You can also get drops that go under your tongue:

Psychic Protection drops from Findhorn Flower Essences
Fringed Violet psychic protection by Australian Bush Flower Essences
Auric Protection Essence by Crystal Herbs
Wild Sage Essence by The South African Flower and Gem Essences
 

7. Smudging

Used by indigenous communities worldwide smudging is the practice that uses smoking herbs to purify and cleanse. Clinical research now supports the effectiveness of this practice revealing that smudging reduces airborne viruses, microbes and bacteria. Great for auric health as well as seasonal bugs! You can buy smudge sticks with us.

Before you begin you might like to pause, breathe and set your intention. Including a prayer asking the universe or your guardian angels to join you turns the process into a beautiful ritual. Next light the smudge stick, blow out the flames and waft the smoke over and around your body and head. Use an abalone shell or fire proof dish to catch any ash or debris. I have written a blog that goes into greater detail on how to smudge your house.

 

8. Grounding and earthing

Nature’s energy is a wholesome tonic to the mind, body and spirit. Next time you are in the natural world ask (with gratitude) for Mother Nature to heal you. Imagine her beautiful energies flooding up through your feet into your body. Picture this energy flowing into every cell and fibre of your mind, body and spirit transmuting your stress and negativity. Connecting to the Earth’s healing energy, commonly referred to as grounding or earthing, offers numerous benefits.

Additionally, you can ground yourself by walking barefoot in the natural world. Sitting up against a tree, placing your feet on grass and gardening all work as well. Doing this not only reduces stress but also energises and replenishes your spiritual body. Furthermore, the frequency of Earth’s energy stabilises and harmonises your body to its natural rhythm.

 

Conclusion

Psychic protection is crucial for empaths as it provides a powerful tool to shield themselves from external influences, manage sensory overload, and regain a sense of control and empowerment. It complements other practices like a healthy lifestyle, meditation, and setting boundaries, offering a comprehensive approach to navigating the challenges that come with heightened sensitivity.

1gujolx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1gujolx/contractions_at_30_weeks/,Contractions at 30 weeks,"Just curious to hear stories of how people have handled this. I went into the ER to get checked for some more than usual vaginal fluid. Turned out I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes for 10-40 seconds each. They checked my cervix twice for dilation and once with an ultra sound to see if my cervix was thinning. They also checked to see no amniotic fluid was leaking. None of that was happening so they sent me home. I went to see my midwife today and she monitored me again and the same thing with contractions but less frequently. But now I know what a contraction feels like and realize I’ve def had them previously so that’s a trip. She told me to relax, drink water, lay on my left side, take a warm bath, have one cup of coffee - all to slow or halt contractions and also offered to send me back over to the hospital but at this point I just wanna be resting at home. 

She advised for me to monitor the contractions and pay super close attention to them & go back to the hospital if they continue as they are. 

This is my first pregnancy so of course there’s a lot of fear and unknown but I do know that being with my midwife is night and day for my stress levels rather than at the hospital with multiple nurses and an ob that doesn’t pay much attention. Anyways I’m just curious how other people have dealt.

But nothing—nothing—compares to what happened in the summer of 2018.

It was the graveyard shift. The stillness of the night had a way of amplifying every sound, every shadow. Most nights were the usual mix of speeding drivers and DUI stops. That night started no differently.

I was stationed at my usual spot near mile marker 62, radar gun in hand, coffee thermos perched on the dash. The radio buzzed with routine chatter. Then, just as I was finishing my second cup of coffee, the radio chatted in.

“Any available units near Route 18, we have a 10-90.”

I was confused, I’d never heard that code before.

“HQ, this is Unit 504. What’s a 10-90?”

Silence.

“HQ?”

No response. Just static.

Seconds later, coordinates popped up on my patrol car’s computer. It was an isolated patch off the highway, deep in the woods. Uneasy, I radioed my supervisor.

“Hey, Sarge, HQ just paged me about a 10-90. What’s the protocol?”

His response was curt. “Ignore it. It wasn’t meant for you.”

“Seriously? They gave me coordinates—”

“Drop it, 504. Get back to work.”

I hesitated, but orders were orders. The night dragged on with routine stops. Around 3 a.m., exhaustion hit, so I pulled into a donut shop. Yeah, I know the stereotype, but sometimes you just need the sugar rush.

The shop was a dive—peeling paint, flickering neon sign—but it was open. Behind the counter stood a man so pale he looked like he’d been carved from marble. His fingers were unnaturally long, and he moved with a stiffness that gave me the creeps.

“What’ll it be?” His voice was raspy, like dead leaves rustling.

“Just coffee. And a couple of glazed.”

He slid my order across the counter without a word. His gaze lingered on me, unblinking, as if he were memorizing my face.

“Long night?” he asked, his lips curling into a faint, unnatural smile.

“Yeah. Graveyard shift. Never gets easier.”

He chuckled—a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl. “Be careful out there. You never know what might be lurking.”

I left in a hurry, the bell above the door jangling behind me. I was halfway to my car when the radio crackled again.

“Help me.”

The voice was faint, distorted, but unmistakably human.

I froze, my heart hammering.

“HQ, this is Unit 504. Did someone just broadcast a distress call?”

No response.

I tried my supervisor. Nothing.

Curiosity gnawed at me. Against my better judgment, I punched the coordinates into my GPS and set off.

The drive took me 45 minutes, deep into the highway forest. The road narrowed until it was barely more than a dirt path. My headlights cut through the thick darkness, revealing gnarled trees that seemed to close in around me.

When the GPS announced I’d arrived, I was in the middle of nowhere. I stepped out of the car, gun holstered, flashlight in hand. The silence was unnatural—not a single insect, not even the rustle of leaves.

I radioed again. “HQ, this is 504. I’m at the coordinates. What’s going on?”

Static.

I took a step forward. The ground was hard beneath my boots, but I couldn’t hear my own footsteps. The air felt heavy, oppressive.

Then, behind me, a twig snapped.

I spun around, flashlight beam slicing through the darkness. Nothing.

“Who’s there?” I called, unholstering my gun.

The radio crackled to life again.

“HELP ME.”

The voice was deafening, as if it were screaming directly into my skull. I dropped the radio, clutching my ears.

Before I could react, a heavy blow struck the back of my head, and everything went black.

I woke up tied to a tree. My hands and feet were bound with rough rope, my head throbbing. The air reeked of damp earth and something metallic—blood, maybe.

Three hooded figures stood before me, their faces obscured. They whispered among themselves, their voices low and guttural.

One stepped forward. “Why did you come here?”

“I... I got a call. A distress call,” I stammered.

“Why are you here?” the figure repeated, more forcefully.

“I was just doing my job! Look, killing me won’t do you any good. My team knows I’m out here. They’ll come looking—”

They whispered among themselves again, then one of them nodded.

“Let him go,” the leader said.

Another figure stepped forward, cutting my bonds. My legs were weak, but I managed to stand.

“Take your gun. Leave. Do not come back.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I grabbed my weapon and stumbled back toward my car. My head swam, and my limbs felt heavy, like I’d been drugged.

As I made my way down the path, figures began emerging from the shadows—dozens of them, their faces pale and featureless.

“Don’t come back,” they chanted in unison. “Don’t come back.”

I reached my car and sped out of there, not daring to look in the rearview mirror.

The next morning, I reported everything to my supervisor. He dismissed it as exhaustion-induced hallucinations and put me on paid leave. But I know what I saw.

Even now, years later, I can’t shake the feeling that they’re still watching me. I kept one of my radios as a memento of my time on the force. Sometimes, late at night, it crackles to life.

“Help me,” the voice whispers.

And sometimes... it calls my name.

Tonight, I’ve made up my mind. I’m going back. I don’t care what’s waiting for me in those woods. I need answers.

Wish me luck.

Ok so I wanted to talk about this thing that happened to me awhile back still kinda freaks me out. I'm a highschool baseball player. I mostly played pitcher. 

My school, let's call it Grant, was pumped up about a football game coming up. Apparently they used to be more a baseball oriented school but something happened and the baseball club was shut down. They recently reinstated it and our first game was in a couple days. So while everyone was focused on that next football play. I was more nervous about the baseball game. If we lost the season they could have a reason to shut down the baseball club again.no point in keeping a doomed team right? This year was our only chance to get it back fully.

So I decided one night to practice with my pitching at the old baseball field.The metal on the fence was a little rusted but I heard we were getting it remodeled next year… if we made it next year. 

I started focusing on angling my wrist just right where the catcher would be. I was Relatively tall and scrawny so I was perfect for the role of pitcher compared to the others of my team.


First couple of throws I was getting good velocity but I kept going. Too soon it was already dark out. I told myself if I couldn't find the ball after every throw I would quit for the night. My mom knew this game was important to me and said I could. 


The mist of the night made the grass dewy and my hands slippery. This last throw slipped from my hands behind me.

 As I picked the ball up I noticed someone sitting on the bleachers, a boy about my age, coffee colored skin with dreads and a baseball cap. He also had our white jersey on but had red mud on it. A baseball bat in between his feet. His eyes were a piercing white. I couldn't see the eye color because he was too far away. 

The lamp post  light next to him flickered.

“OH uh hey didn't see you there I was just getting some more practice in” I didn't recognize him but maybe because we had such a big team. 

He didn't say anything.

“Ok then… you're welcome to watch, I guess.” I say. an eerie feeling crawling in my spine.is it racist to be creeped out? No no some of my friends are black and they don't give me the heebie jeebies like this. Maybe I'm stereotyping?not all black people are saints either being human and all.

I throw another ball at the rusted fence. At the corner of my eye I see him standing at the tall fence with his bat on his shoulder. 

“You-” my voice cracked, “you want to be my batter?” I said 

He nods.
 
“Ok yeah we can do that” my unease subsided a little. 

He opens the gate door and walks over to the base. gets ready to swing. 
“Um hey you got some red mud on your bat don't you want to um.. wash it?” 

It's gotta be red mud. I thought the idea of it being anything else was too ludicrous of an idea. Too.. concerning.

When the guy doesn't move I say “Ok suit yourself” wind up my pitch and throw. His bat hits the ball and it goes flying in the air. 

“OH that was a good hit. I don't think I'll be able to find it.” A feeling in my skin told me not to turn away from the batter 

Suddenly I felt the ball in my hand. I Jumped freaked out letting it go. The ball fell on the ground and rolled a little. I bent down to pick it up. I… I'm sure I threw it. 

“I uh think I gotta go regardless.” my feet wouldn't move. Something screamed at me that I had to throw another ball or I would die. That taking my eyes off him was a bad idea. 

“Or I could do another pitch” I get ready to do a screwball pitch. I thought if I can get him to turn around I can get free. He has to turn around to grab the ball when it gets thrown past him right?

I put my middle and pointer finger at the top of the ball, putting my thumb on the bottom. I covered my grip with my other hand.

If I was going to trick him I would need to aim at his midsection. The screwball would then turn and hit away from where I aimed and he would miss the ball.

I windup lifting my leg, extend my arm and throw.

CRACK!

Something whizzed passed my face. was that the ball? How did he know I was throwing a screwball? how did he aim for my head as well. At this point I definitely knew something was off. But I had already been caught. I knew it in my gut.

The ball was in my hand again.

As I got ready to throw a fastball a thought crossed my mind. It was when we just were reinstating the baseball club. Sam was talking about some story of why the baseball club had been shut down. I didn't think much of it. but in this situation I really wished I had listened a little more.

CRACK!

The ball whizzed at my face. I barely dodged my head, the ball hitting the tip of my nose. Feeling the leather felt much more… dangerous than just a normal ball more like a razer clipping me. the tip of my nose stung like a saw blade just went by.

“Agh” I say startled and in pain. FUCK FUCK FUCK WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO! I thought. panicking a little.

The ball came back.

I got ready for a curveball. It started raining. Great, just great.  

Holding the ball close I lift my leg. A picture of the girl I liked crossed my mind. If I survived this I'll ask her out.

I breathed deeply in and slowly out. Trying to calm myself. I can't throw if I'm not in the right headspace. And right now messing up didn't feel like an option. 

The same Lamp post flickered on the bleachers. Everything but the rain and some birds could be heard. 

I windup the ball. My mom would miss me. Right?
 
I extended my hand as I was in the crouched position I here my name 

“Jermy” the ball slips from my fingers and I look to see Sam over by the fence “your mom told me to check on you it's past midnight dude”

I wip to look back at the batter noting I just fucked up. He was inches from my face, no irises just a white void. Blood splattered on his face.

“AHHH” I scream and fall on my ass in the mud. And the batter disappeared. It wasn't raining anymore, the lights weren't flickering.

I wasn't dead. I touched the tip of my nose, it was bleeding.

“Yo man you ok?”Sam asked he didn't look like he had been rained on and didn't seem to be bothered.

“Y-yeah” I got up and left with him going home 

Still remember the cold chill of the rain.


A couple weeks later I saw a picture of the last baseball club. That kid was in it. 

“Uh hey Sam you said there was a reason they shut down the  baseball club right? What was the story.”
 
“OH yeah man it was gruesome some player named jerad went mad and killed the other team before the game”he said “never caught him” he looks at me “why do you ask?”

Definitely some sweet tooth’s in here still but I’m excited to truly test them. Tell me your absolute faves from Sorce! Also, if you have a recs on any special scents I am truly thinking about blind buying when the time comes. I’m very intrigued by Dragonfly Wings. 

I purchased: 
1.) This is not a love spell (blueberry jam, violet, creeping ivy, lavender, star anise, vanilla)
2.) English Major (library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves)
3.) Falling Stars Cookie Butter version (black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo, Tonja bean absolute, vanilla bean) 
4.) Serpentine (ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, peru balsam, cedar, vanilla)
5.) A Party or Something (marigold, pistachio buttercream, yellow cake, white chocolate, iso E super, cashmeran) BRAVE of me considering this seems like it might be very gourmand lmao 🤣

I got it dialed in on my plastic V60 and really like the notes and sweetness. I’m using the newest James Hoffman V60 method with 15g in, and 250ml total water. Using 4.5 clicks on a ZP6 and with a water temp of 208-212F.

I got a Hario Switch this week after so many recommendations to try it out. I currently have only this bean to try and dial in and I’m not impressed so far. I’m also wasting my beans. But it’s useful because my V60 brew is a baseline I can compare it to. 

I’m using the Switch Coffee Chronicler method. 15g in aiming for a 1:16 so doing 240mL total water for a 50/50 pour. Grind size is the same. Water temp is the same.

The cups aren’t bad by any means, but I’m not able to get the really distinct fruit taste that I am in my V60. People said their v60 vs switch grind size is the same. And I’m not trying to change too many variables but the cups are very off. 

Any advice or tips? So far I’m leaning toward just using the V60 but I do like the potential versatility of the switch. ",4,1731974377.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1gujkqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1gujkqt/theres_something_in_the_water/,There's something in the water,"Today has been filled with so many god damn weirdos. 

First was a guy who used to stay with us before he got kicked out for smoking in the room. Guess he forgot that, because he tried to come back and didn't even try to pretend it wasn't his first time here. I reminded him he'd been kicked out, and he feigned ignorance.

Immediately after, a pair of fidgety junkies came in looking to check in. I actually initially thought they were with the first guy and trying to get a room with/for him. The guy said his phone was dying and he needed to charge it somewhere so he could transfer his money to the right card, but because we don't want jittery junkies hanging around the lobby we don't let non-guests charge their devices here. 

Meanwhile his girlfriend went to the bathroom to throw up. The sound of people getting sick makes me sick, but I managed to keep my lunch down. He tried and failed various methods of getting around hotel policy, before he decided to leave.

I had an hour or so of reprieve before the next junkie came in. She had a ten or so year old daughter in tow, which honestly just made me sad. Immediately she is arguing with me because the call center told her she could pay cash. The call center had indeed confirmed with me earlier that we accept cash for the rooms, but I had been very clear with the representative that we require a credit card for the security deposit.

The junkie lady insisted they didn't tell her that, which really isn't my problem even if it's true. We make the information available on the website. So she and her daughter walk to the bank to deposit her money, leaving all their luggage in the lobby. A little while later she came back, ready to check in except... She left her card in the ATM. She freaked out for a few minutes before they went back to the bank.

Apparently that bank wastes no time in shredding cards left in ATMs, because she called from the bank saying that her card had been shredded and they couldn't get her a new one right away. Possibly this was a ruse? I don't know. It doesn't matter. She asked if we could take a cashier's check, and no of course we can't it's 2024 not whatever year cashier's checks were a normal thing to use at a business. I don't know what year that is because in my 18 years of working, I have never encountered one.

She and her daughter came back to regroup and she offered me some ice cream that she said had been in her bags for 4 hours and I declined. Then she asked me about Quantity Inn, and that's not me making a funny name to bypass sub filters. She called it that. Then when I went to make coffee, I discovered that she had plugged her phone into an outlet very clearly marked ""for staff use only"" and had to ask her to unplug it. She said she didn't know and I pointed to the sticker that says ""for staff use only.""

At one point she tried to guilt trip me, saying they were fleeing domestic violence. I was apologetic, and offered to look up local resources to help people in her situation, but that's not what she wanted. She just wanted the rules to not apply to her. Shortly thereafter she mentioned they had just left a domestic violence shelter, and I found myself wondering if this was voluntary on her part. And I continued to feel bad for her kid. She seemed pretty bright though, and like she was making the best of a bad situation.

Then the lady who threw up in the bathroom earlier came back to throw up in the bathroom again. I didn't even realize they were still around, I'd been so busy. Her boyfriend came to try to check in again, was surprised at the price despite it not having changed, and decided to cancel his reservation. At first it seemed like these two groups might team up and leave together by the way they were talking to each other, but ultimately they parted ways. She tried to offer me more food, but I declined.

It's Monday, so as evening rolled around we got crazy busy with all the people checking in for the work week. As I got a regular checked in, a relatively normal looking man with a Minecraft creeper backpack walked through. He moved fast, like he was on a mission, and I greeted him as he walked through.  When he looked at me, I saw a wild look in his eye, and started suspecting maybe he wasn't a guest or planning on being one. Something was going on.

He made a beeline for the coffee and poured himself a cup before going in the bathroom. After he left the bathroom I heard him rummaging around the coffee station some more before he sat on the couch for a moment, drinking the coffee. I was a little concerned, honestly, because I just brewed that coffee so it must have been pretty hot. It didn't seem to bother him. He then rushed over to the desk so fast I leaned back, and looked over the stuff we have up on the desk.

We have a little Santa cactus who I call the gnome cactus when it's not winter time. I swear I thought he was reaching to full on grab it, instead he grabbed the little award next to it that celebrated the brand's 50th anniversary. He handed it to me and said I was being awarded for a job well done. Then he called me sir and corrected himself and apologized before leaving.

Once he was gone I realized he had both literally and figuratively taken all my spoons. I want to go home.",20,1731974289.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,6,0.95,False

I don’t want anything too fussy or expensive since it’s not something we have everyday. Is the AeroPress the right gadget? I’d like to be able to make the two drinks for us in one go (grande and venti size) And also what about the AeroPress XL? Or should I be looking at something else completely? We typically drink Cafe Bustelo but I’m open to other coffee if it tastes better. I’ve been buying premade iced coffee but I’m looking for something more cost effective and better tasting.

1gujemw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOR/comments/1gujemw/amh_059_age_36_successful_ers_and_thanks_to_the/,"AMH 0.59, age 36, successful ERs and thanks to the community ","Trigger: discussing ERs that resulted in euploid embryos 

Wanted to come on here and share my final update, as well as give a huge thank you to this community. I wasn’t quite sure how to navigate it when my doctor gave me the news that I had DOR, and am so grateful for the mods for this space.

I had tested my AMH and FSH 6 years ago through one of those mail in health checks. Back then, my FSH was 11 and my AMH was around 0.7. I mostly stuck my head in the sand about it, to be totally honest, and read the literature that that didn’t necessarily mean I couldn’t conceive now (which turned out to be true).

However, when we decided to get serious about IVF to bank embryos for the future our doctor very kindly but bluntly managed our expectations. My FSH across two ERs ranged from 3 to 9, and my AMH (tested once) was 0.59. She measured an AFC of 10 in our first appointment. She said typically for a 36 year old, she’d expect 1-2 rounds but I might be looking at 3-5 rounds or more to get 3 euploid embryos. This was stressful to hear as we naively figured going in that we were young enough that this should be a one shot deal, which is when I found this community and started learning much more about DOR.

We did two egg retrievals back to back that were very successful and I’m grateful to this community for giving us the right questions to ask and frame of mind to go forward. We used the standard antagonist protocol for 11 days for both with a dual trigger each time.

ER #1
- AFC: 8
- Eggs Retrieved: 6, 5 mature (I cried and steeled myself for no embryos)
- Eggs Fertilized: 5 (2 0PN)
- Day 6 Blasts: 4
- PGT: 3 euploid, 1 LLM


We could have stopped there but we had already gone straight into a back to back cycle before we got our PGT results and had anticipated only 1-2 euploid embryos so we kept going.

ER #2
- AFC: 6
- Eggs Retrieved: 5, 2 mature
- Eggs Fertilized: 5 (they matured all 3 immature ones in the lab and then fertilized them. All three fertilized though one was 1PN and one was 3PN)
- Day 6 blasts: 4 all graded 3BB
- PGT: 3 euploid (including that 3PN!), 1 aneuploid and not suitable for transfer 

That leaves us with 6 euploid embryos (and 1 LLM) an outcome well beyond what I thought was possible.

Some lessons:

- DOR isn’t a definitive signal of success or failure. The odds go in both directions! And that adage of quality over quantity totally feels true. 

- seems worth it to choose a place with a good lab. I’m so glad they kept and matured my immature eggs rather than discarding them, and similarly, kept tracking those 0PNs, 1PN and 3PN. Both the 0PN and 3PN resulted in euploid embryos for me. 

- I really appreciated my doctor telling it to me straight about the odds. It put the whole thing in better perspective when I would read in r/IVF or r/eggfreezing about cycles that yielded 20-30 eggs. After our first appointment, I kind of went in expecting failure so pleasant surprise was really nice.

- this is totally a crapshoot. There’s no advice I have about lifestyle mods beyond like, don’t do meth. This seems to be totally how your particular body responds. ER 1 I was pretty careful. ER 2 I accidentally got drunk at a work party because I forgot I was going home to inject myself. I kept drinking coffee the whole way through and continued my regime of occasionally exercising when I felt up to it. Feels like this is more about luck than anything lifestyle can really meaningfully change quickly 

- I really appreciate how kind and open everyone in this community has been. Finding people with similar stats was really comforting to me and I’m appreciative of everyone who cheered me on, answered my questions and listened to me vent. ",20,1731973828.0,DOR,8,1.0,False

i'm also concerned that the space is lacking color. there are accents of green throughout the house and a number of plants (the plants on the floor will be moved onto a side table) but i was worried about it looking too matchy matchy with too much green accents. any suggestions on color/size/pattern?

I have been some troubles at my work lately. I joined this business a few months ago and have been working as a young engineer. I am a person of colour and the only international person from South Asia at this workplace, where almost if not all are caucasians. Most people are super nice and have always been welcoming.
My work involves working with folks in the office and on the ground (crew members). 
I am usually asked to go and work from one of our work sites that has a lot of the crew members. 
In the last few months, i sensed that everytime i’d visit that place, folks would look at me in a weird way, but I never cared and still don’t. There are office rooms at the site, and I have been given a cubicle to work out of. 
Lately, i have noticed my things going missing i.e. my sun glasses or my work phone or even the wireless usb that connects to the mouse and keyboard from my laptop. I didn’t care much thinking it might be oversight at my end and that I am just forgetful. 

This past month, one of my tires on my car got damaged and i assumed that maybe just maybe this would be as a result of a puncture from a rock. But, this only happened after an uncomfortable talk with one of the site supervisors. I didn’t want to sound paranoid so I never brought it up to anyone.

Today, I went back to the site after a month to complete an important task. This task required me to document technical information on a paper. I took half a day to complete the work and returned to my cubicle mid afternoon and left things on the desk. I left for 5 minutes to grab some coffee to find out upon coming back that the document was gone. 

I tried looking for it and backtracked all my steps to find it but couldn’t. I always make copies of my work as in write it in my log book so I wasn’t really bummed about losing my work. Fast forward I complete my work and get up to go to my car and upon arriving to my car I find the tire has been again damaged and is flat!

I am really starting to worry about my safety at this work place and the constant damage to my  property or missing things.

I guess this is more of a rant. I think I just want to get it off my chest and tell someone even if it's quite boring. 

For context, I'm in my late 20s, have a stable friend circle and love to do a lot activities with different friends. 

One friend, let's call her Nina, is really kind and nice to hang out with, and we did a lot. For a year she has been under a lot of stress job wise (some self made tbh, because she dosnt set boundaries - we all had many talks about this and everyone is telling her the same thing and is offering help, well but she doesn't). 

To my issue, she cancels often last minute on events (like the morning of a friends birthday we made spa reservations), says she will send something (last Sunday it was a recepie we talked about) and would let me know if I should get her a card for an even I absolutely want to go to too. This is important cause I invitet some friends which were together at out hang out on last Sunday too, and I get tickets cheaper. So I normally get them for all of us. She said she'd get back to me the next days. I messaged her to ask and she said she will get back to me soon. We'll yesterday I decided to book for me and the people saying yes and I or she could just get the ticket herself then if some are still available. We'll now it's sold, no tickets for anyone. Now I'm mad at myself. Mad at waiting for an unreliable person. She if 30 and can not stand by her word. 

I get that sometimes you forget stuff, forget to send things, have a migraine, feel like shit on a weekend. Normally I don't really care cause we all have the same job and it's a lot to juggle private and work live. 
But on the other hand I see her making time to hand out with another friend for lunch or go for coffee. 
I guess being friends with me is more of a bother to her than benefit. It fucking hurts and is so frustrating. Like, stop saying yes to every think and promising a thousand times to do something, to not just do it. I'm fed up. 

So well, this is my rant, being mad at myself for waiting for others to get their shit together, for putting in the same amount of effort into a friendship, for her to care. I think not getting tickets to something I care about (she knows), when I could have, made me realise that this small instances just accumulated and made me actually sad/mad without realising.

We still will work and meet on friends gatherings. Any advice on how to react? How to deal with my feelings? Or do I need to just get it over with cause I'm making more out of this as it is? ",1,1731973125.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False
1guj4t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1guj4t1/the_coffee_and_the_simulation/,The coffee and the simulation. ,"

I realized this was a simulation around 2000. A that time I traveled every 2 week from the city I was living to another city where I worked,  also having other long trips to other cities too mainly in the south of Chile. I used to buy coffee in the bus station in the cold winter and then I started to pay atention and  realize something very strange. I was completely overwhelmed by surprise when I realize the coffee vendor was the same. Same vendor in different city. Same face different clothes and obviously a different life. My mind was completely struck. I spent days trying figure out how it was possible and I came to the realization that same people is being  reproduced in different cities in large formats.  I kept searching information and I found some startling discoveries about physical appeareance, face expression that were strangely coherent in some people without having any DNA link.  
So It came to my mind that it all was some kind of Big Game.

Those topics were always fascinating to me, So I kept investigating. Some years later  I found that people were talking about N.P.C non playable characters living in this world: An interisting concept too.
Then I thought If there is some high  inteligence behind the creation of this simulation maybe it was running similar programs in diferent locations for concept of fast creation. so there must be a chance to find the same people doing something relatively similar in other cities.

 I thought that maybe it  usually works this way in cities that are not close enough so it is less probability to spot the repetition.  

 There Must be someone like me or you living in city nearby.
I have been reading and listening to other people minds and I found fascinating that people in other parts of the world have similar experiences and thoughts, 
I have used psichodelics and learning more about this world and everything tells me that we are in a simulation.

 Well this is my personal experience. 
Normal things can turn into an epiphany from one second to the next if we pay close attention.
So stay in the present moment. 
Self-inquiry yourself,
Meditate and keep your mind open.
And you are gonna start to find some glitches in the matrix very close to you. 

And most important;
 Enjoy  your coffee in the next bus station.

Action Item Monday!


🟡Low engagement - Visit, or get lunch or coffee with a friend who is a safe person. No pressure to talk politics. Just enjoy the company of a good human or three. Join your local Buy Nothing, Mutual Aid, or Freecycle community.


🟢Medium engagement - Find and put your elected official's phone numbers and websites into your phone. Subscribe to at least 2-3 mailing lists for groups like Indivisible, Democracy Docket, Chop Wood, Carry Water (Jessica Craven). Consider if your contributions will be time, energy, money, information, goods, or services.


🔵High engagement - *Call the House Ethics Committee at 202-225-7103 and tell them to release the Gaetz Report.*
Call your senators and tell them not to yield their power on executive branch appointments. Insist on background checks and refusing recess appointments.


🌟Bonus items - Tell the house of reps:
- NO on HR9495, specifically because it yields unacceptable executive power to label not-for-profit agencies as terrorist organizations. The bit about American hostages should be its own bill, not a rider with this POS.
Tell the senate:
- YES on S4973 - The No Kings Act, which would remove the immunity SCOTUS gave #45 (we do not speak his name).
- YES on S 2074, which would shield reporters from disclosure of their sources of information, except when necessary to prevent violence.

For me, I’m all over calling the Ethics committee to release that Gaetz report!!!

The last 3 days I have drank organic matcha with zero sugar. (I know annoying tiktok trend). I drink it with skim milk and only need about 350 ml. Before this I’d go through anti-caffeine strikes and experiment with types of coffees or hot chocolate to satisfy my morning wake up craving. Drinking ceremonial grade matcha is going to replace my morning treat for getting out of bed. It makes my energy levels stable whilst still giving me that extra boost lasting through the end of the day. I also sleep better and feel like I can perform on 7 hours of sleep (in case I come home late from exercise) which for me, I can relax about my quantity of sleep as quality overrides! Coffee definitely worsens my VSS no matter when I drink it and decaf seems to make it a bit worse too. 

Here are some points AI was able to provide as matcha as an example of the importance of being aware what we put into our bodies. In defence of AI use I feel it is mostly textbook highschool science that would probably not include misinformation! I hope this encourages you to change your coffee order!! (and get thinking about other indulgences you consume or surround yourself with)

Matcha may benefit brain hyperexcitability through its unique combination of nutrients and bioactive compounds.

1. L-Theanine for Calming Effects

Matcha contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. It works by:

	•	Increasing alpha brain waves, associated with a relaxed yet alert state.

	•	Modulating neurotransmitters like GABA, serotonin, and dopamine, which can help reduce brain hyperactivity and overstimulation. 

2. Packed with Antioxidants
	
Matcha is rich in catechins, particularly EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which:
	•	Neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation  that cause oxidative stress, which may contribute to neurological disorders and hyper-excitability of the brain. 
	•	Protect cellular structures and DNA from damage, slowing the aging process and combating chronic disease. 

Free radicals can cause mutations in DNA. Reducing oxidative stress minimizes the risk of errors that lead to aging or disease.

In the intracellular space, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation can overwhelm detox pathways. Nutrients like chlorophyll support the detoxification of reactive molecules, improving intracellular homeostasis.

Sources of Free Radicals

Free radicals can originate from:
	1.	Internal Sources:
	•	Mitochondrial energy production.
	•	Inflammatory responses.
	•	Enzyme activity in normal cellular processes.
	2.	External Sources:
	•	Pollution.
	•	Tobacco smoke.
	•	Radiation (e.g., UV).
	•	Industrial chemicals.

Protecting Cellular Structures:

Free radicals are unstable molecules with unpaired electrons. These molecules are highly reactive and seek stability by interacting with nearby molecules, potentially causing oxidative damage to cells, proteins, lipids, and DNA. They are a natural byproduct of cellular metabolism but can become harmful in excess. (note: Personally post VSS I feel more sensitive to them)

	•	Free radicals can damage lipid membranes, disrupting the integrity of cells and organelles like the mitochondria. Antioxidants (e.g., EGCG in matcha or chlorophyll) neutralize free radicals, preserving cellular stability.

	2.	Enhancing Intracellular Signaling:
	•	Excess oxidative stress interferes with cell signaling pathways. Controlling free radicals helps maintain proper communication within and between cells.

The combination of L-theanine and EGCG in matcha:
	•	Improves focus and reduces stress, protecting against cognitive decline and age-related brain disorders.
	•	May promote neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons), aiding brain health as you age.

3. Caffeine + L-Theanine Synergy

The small amount of caffeine in matcha, combined with L-theanine, provides:
	•	Sustained focus without the jittery side effects, potentially stabilizing overactive neural pathways .

4. Neuroprotective Properties

Studies suggest that EGCG may protect neurons from damage and promote brain plasticity, which could benefit those with conditions linked to hyperexcitability.

 Brain Aging Protection

	•	The combination of L-theanine and EGCG in matcha:
	•	Improves focus and reduces stress, protecting against cognitive decline and age-related brain disorders.
	•	May promote neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons), aiding brain health as you age.

6. Detoxification

	•	Matcha contains chlorophyll, which aids in detoxifying the body and keeping it clean at a cellular level, enhancing overall health

What is Chlorophyll?

Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. 

What Contains Chlorophyll?

Chlorophyll is present in all green plants and vegetables, including:
	•	Leafy greens: Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard.
	•	Herbs: Parsley, cilantro, and wheatgrass.
	•	Algae: Spirulina and chlorella.
	•	Other green vegetables: Broccoli, beans, and peas.

Chlorophyll supplements are also available in liquid or tablet forms, often labeled as “chlorophyllin” (a water-soluble derivative).

Does Chlorophyll Help Brain Hyperexcitability?

There’s no direct evidence linking chlorophyll to reducing brain hyperexcitability. However, its properties may provide indirect benefits:

	1.	Antioxidant Activity:
	•	Chlorophyll neutralizes free radicals and reduces oxidative stress, which could support overall brain health.

	2.	Anti-Inflammatory Effects:
	•	By reducing inflammation, chlorophyll might help with conditions that exacerbate brain excitability.

	3.	Detoxification:
	•	Chlorophyll aids in detoxifying heavy metals and other toxins that may affect brain function.

	4.	Alkalinizing Effect:
	•	It may help balance body pH, potentially improving neurological health indirectly.

Considerations

	•	Dosage: Too much caffeine could worsen hyperexcitability, so moderation is key (1–2 cups daily).
	•	Medical Advice: While matcha supports general brain health, consult a healthcare provider for targeted treatments.

• Reducing exposure to toxins and engaging in regular physical activity with a supportive overall protects cellular health.

Free radical control is crucial for preventing diseases, supporting brain function, and maintaining intracellular stability.

I hope this motivates someone to crosscheck lifestyle choices to better not only their VSS but all of their health, including mental. 

Now I will post & ghost because I cannot cope with the insidious amount of hate speech while managing a sensitive chronic illness. Protect yourself from the negativity, anything you think your brain believes is real. Reduce that stress. ",1,1731973031.0,visualsnow,0,0.67,False

* The footing on the hike is not the greatest - lots of loose, bigger rock for a lot of the trail. Also some really fine sand in places.
* Depending on the day, there can be winds and shade so at this time of the year there is a decent fluctuation of temps. Layering options definitely helped here. Last 1.5 miles back up to Hilltop it started snowing and there was wind and I was okay with a long sleeve thin dryfit shirt because of the climb.
* I had seen people mentioning getting to Mooney and the ladders. Maybe I didn't research enough but didn't realize that it is via ferrata hiking and there are steep wet footholds to go down first and you have to hang on to chains to get down. I actually enjoyed this, but could easily see someone who isn't prepared freezing up. Remember, three points of contact when going down/up - two hands on a chain/ladder and at least a foot. Gloves with grip will help!
* If going to Beaver after Mooney, don't wear water shoes until after you get down to Mooney. So glad I had my trail shoes for the descent down. Once you get to the bottom of Mooney you can put on water shoes. I kept them on until I got back to ascend Mooney and then swapped back out for trail shoes.
* Highly recommend wearing neoprene socks/booties under water shoes if hiking from Mooney to Beaver. It prevents small rocks and sand from rubbing and causing blisters.
* Just had a small backpacking stove and light kettle for cooking since all meals were dehydrated and used for coffee and hot chocolate.
* We filtered the spring water with a gravity filter but many people drank straight from the spring and didn't have a problem.
* Temps probably got down to low 30s. I had a 20 degree rated back and slept in thermals and was fine.
* Night hike to Havasupai Falls was awesome with a full moon.
* Hiked in with 3.5 liters of water and it was more than I needed this time of year (I'm sure you'll need all of that in the summer). I hiked out with probably 2 liters and was fine. Always better having more but that weight adds up.
* First night they allowed fires, second night had higher winds so they didn't allow.

Overall it was worth all the hassles. The hike from Mooney to Beaver was awesome and highly recommend.

With Black Friday sales in the Netherlands, I’ve narrowed my choices down to two espresso machines: the **De'Longhi Dedica Style EC685.BK** (€150 on Amazon) and the **Sage Bambino** (not plus) (€230 at Coolblue). I’d love your advice!

# A bit about me:

* **Location**: Netherlands
* **Preferred drink types**: Just espresso (not into milk drinks).
* **Frequency**: I plan to make 2 shots per day (atleast ;)).
* **Space**: I live in a small studio apartment (20m²), so compact machines like these are ideal.
* **Experience level**: I have some experience pulling shots, but only on commercial machines where all the settings were pre-dialed in. At home, this would be my first espresso machine.
* **Budget**: I’m a student, so budget is a factor.

# Current Setup:

I currently have an AeroPress and a drip coffee machine. I also recently bought a manual grinder from AliExpress called the “Manual Coffee Grinder CNC Stainless Steel.” It can grind very fine (powder-like) as well as coarse. I love buying fresh beans, as I just recently bought my first beans, not from the supermarket, from Wakuli.

# Why these two machines?

* **De'Longhi Dedica (EC685.BK)**: €150, compact, and affordable.
* **Sage Bambino**: €230, also compact, with better reviews on temperature control and shot quality. It's the black truffle edition, so it has a plastic housing instead of a stainless steel one.

# Considerations:

I’ve read that:

* **De'Longhi Dedica**: May not last long (some users report only 2-3 years), and struggles with quality.
* **Sage Bambino**: Shots can be a bit cooler, and some users say it vibrates enough to knock cups off the drip tray.

# My plan:

I definitely want to get tools that make a better shot, such as a non-pressurized filter, water screen etc. So I’d like a machine that can work well with one. I’m leaning towards the Delonghi, since the cost of the tools stacks up too, but if the bambino lasts longer then I don’t mind paying a bit more. 

Does anyone have experience with these machines or recommendations based on my setup? Are the issues mentioned in reviews common, or are they outliers? Any advice for someone in my situation would be greatly appreciated!

1guiwwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1guiwwr/layout_sofa_size_and_overall_design/,"Layout, sofa size and overall design","Hi everyone! I’m shopping for a new sofa ($3,000 budget) and would love some layout advice for my living room. I’ve attached a layout picture with dimensions and a few current photos from different angles.

I have a [sofa chaise](https://couchpotatoes.com/products/soco-reversible-chaise-sofa) in mind with dimensions of 95” in length, 60” wide on the chaise side, and 47” on the normal side. You will see some pictures where I tried to emulate the space the new couch would take if it faced the wall... I don't hate it but it really leaves very little space for a coffee table and TV stand. I haven't tried to do the same emulation while facing the fireplace but I think I might have to push the new couch' shortest side against the wall in order to have enough walking space between the couch and the kitchen bar (which btw we don't use for meals, it's more like a shelf)

  
The reason I like that couch is because it has plenty of space for me and my girlfriend to lay down for movie night, which we do often. Up until now one of us would lie on the bean bag while the other would lie on the couch. We lounged on it at the showroom and it felt great being able to lie down close. Two issues I see with this couch are: size (might be too big for my living room) and also we are fiends who eat our meals in front of the tv and this couch has a higher seat height and smaller space for our coffee table.

I’m trying to figure out:

1. Am I getting too much sofa or if there’s a better placement option for the sofa.
2. Color recs for the sofa. I was thinking off white or dark green.
3. Recommendations for a new coffee table.
4. How to declutter and optimize the space, as I plan to get rid of a bean bag and a couple of ottomans.
5. Any design input is welcomed. Curtains, end tables, lighting. I don't have a set budget for that so I will be adding things here and there every week or so.
6. Additionally, I currently have my desk in the living room, but I have no problem relocating it to make the space more cohesive.

I 22F have been dating my boyfriend 22M for almost 4 years. We live in different states and met online, traveling back and forth every month or so to see each other. I know the title of this post sounds horrible, and I feel horrible even typing that out, but please hear me out.

 We met in 2020 right after we both finished high school. I went straight to a university in my state to major in bachelors of nursing. He went to his local community college for a business associates. However, he didn’t take his school seriously at all and ended up taking 4 years to complete his degree, which put us both graduating at the same time with very different career levels. Finishing nursing school was tough for me, and i have always felt like he hasn’t taken what i do seriously and never acknowledges the hard work I had to put in to get there. He has frequently made comments suggesting that what I do isn’t all that hard and compared the amount of knowledge required for nursing to a coffee barista… Throughout our relationship I have religiously tried to find different paths for him to get him in the right direction for a career. I’ve done hours of research into what options he has to use his new degree, looking for different certifications he could easily aquire to add to his resume. Literally not a single one of my suggestions was considered for more than 5 seconds by him. And this goes into a whole other issue. The job he actually does have. 

He has worked at two different restaurants throughout our entire relationship. The first a sports bar, one that eventually led to multiple instances of micro-cheating by him (flirting, secret hangouts, regular texting). When i caught onto that he ended up quiting to work at an Italian restaurant. There, he met a girl who i had had suspicions about for months. I was constantly seeing her name in his likes and recent searches ect. He gaslit me for months until i ultimately found out he had admitted to her that he had feelings for her, i found 4,000 deleted messages between them…4,000... and that at the peak of my insanity from being gaslit, there was a phone call where i just broke, i screamed and cried begging for him to end it if there was someone else and he SWORE there wasn’t, well turns out, the girl was listening the entire time.I found out the day my grandma died and broke up with him that same day. I was stupid and heartbroken and grieving and still in love and wanted to give him a second (but not really second more like 10th) chance.

 I waited about a month for him to come back to me, all while he was blatantly ignoring me and clearly showing that he had not interest in getting back together with me while still telling me that he loved me and missed me. Turns out, that whole time he was actively trying to start a relationship with the girl from his work (who was in a whole relationship). He also slept with and/or went on dates with literally Every. Single. Girl. he had told me not to worry about. Anyways, the girl from his work had cheated on her bf with my then ex (WHO STILL HAD MY PICTURES HANGING ON HIS BEDROOM WALL AND ON HIS LOCKSCREEN when she came over to do shit with him… eventually she rejected him to try and fix things with her bf. And literally 3 days after that rejection my ex came crawling back to me BEGGING me to take him back. And i didnt, at first.

 After months of him acting straight manic, 10’s of calls every night, 10’s of video diaries he made for me, flying out to my state against my advice to try and win me back, and just sooo many phone calls of him sobbing, begging , pleading, and sacrificing everything to win me back. I’ve heard all the stories too, once a cheater always a cheater, love bombing, ect. But i did and do love him. And i took him back.

 It’s been a few months, he has been a really good boyfriend sense then. He took me to Italy, buys me things, and sends all the words of affirmation. He does everything in his power to reassure me and it’s 100% clear that he doesn’t want to lose me again. But before we got back together i made it very clear that my standards had risen, i wasn’t okay with settling for someone who had no goals or plans for their future, and i have no interest in financially supporting any man who is fully capable of supporting themselves. I told him that i expect a plan from him, and it doesn’t have to be anything crazy, just some sort of plan to progress from the restaurant industry. I’ve given him months and there’s been literally zero progress. He bought a 2023 Camaro, now has a massive debt bc of that, has no savings, and literally no plan other than to move in with me and get another restaurant job here. I work so hard and have done it all while also being a caregiver to my dad who has a terminal illness. I have a plan, a savings, health insurance, a 401k. And that’s never something i try to rub in face, and frankly even if i did, i doubt he would even care bc he doesn’t find that type of stuff important. But when i reflect, i just always end up back at that same idea of feeling too good for him. I don’t know what to do, because in terms of being a good boyfriend and staying loyal he really has been 100% (and he prides himself on that, which kinda makes it lose its worth tbh). But in life, I’ve seen no progress. Please help me.

TL;DR My boyfriend has cheated on me and has no plan or goals for life and I feel like I could do better but i love him and think I maybe just can’t go through the pain that I associate with leaving him again. ",1,1731972477.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False
1guiv9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1guiv9i/fiancé_not_married_yet/,Fiancé not married yet,"Me (M) and my finance (F) i’ve been having a bit of a  rough patch lately.

It’s been about a year since we moved in together and it’s been really tough on my end since I’ve had to do literally everything. When I mean everything I mean, cook clean, and all the house duties including paying for everything. Luckily I’m able to do this because I work from home and every few minutes. I’ll just do a dish or I’ll sweep the floor or something like that. 

The reason why our life is like this is because she has a herniated disc and if she does too much her back will. This is temporary so I’m OK with it. Kind of since I know that she’s in law school so just waiting that out. 

It’s really tough on me though and it’s really tough on her because she’s in pain almost daily. If she does too much, then her back will flare up, and sometimes it gets to the point where she can’t even walk. I help her with every task I can which is kinda overwhelming as you can tell.

Because of all of this, though I get yelled at a lot though and insulted if I even say anything in response. I get told “I’m not a man” or looked down on since she assumes I’m just “cleaning up after myself” since I’m the only one home. Today she yelled at me because i wasn’t answering the phone cuz i was at work and when I told her I was at work (she knows I am) she goes “you could’ve said that” (I didn’t use my lunch break to drop her coffee off at school). I basically told her hey I’m not a servant like I only have 30 minutes of break and I also have to clean up the house a bit. She got mad at that which is understandable but she told me to “go fuck myself” and “I’m just used to my mom picking up after me” so I bring up that I do everything in the house including rent….

Arguments like this happen to us a lot…. Things don’t deescalate she ends up threatening to go stay at her moms to which I don’t care.

Her mom helps out a lot sometimes she drops off food and she will see the house not clean cuz I haven’t gotten to it that early and she will start helping which I have to force her to stop.

Since she’s in pain a lot unless we are sitting down and we are doing something very relaxing I don’t get the women I fell in love with back. It wasn’t always like this it’s been about 2 years now with this issue. 

I don’t mind doing all these things I know it’s temporary and I have found somewhat of a routine by cutting down my gym days, but it’s just like I don’t know if I feel respected and it’s so frustrating.

I don’t consider this MY house but maybe I should?

Am I in the wrong here?

I’m not sure if I am really not acting like a man. I know how easy it is to let anger get the best of me and I just want to be a good partner. 

I have never stated all of this to ANYONE before. I have to her but if I said it like with honesty above I would probably get yelled at again.

If you’re down to support me (and maybe snag some fun content along the way), hit me up on Telegram! 💬 Link’s in my bio—it’s where all the good vibes live. 💋

A little about me? I’m 100% Asian, and I love embracing my roots while exploring everything the world has to offer. 🌏 Food is my love language—seriously, nothing makes me happier than finding the perfect bowl of ramen or a cute dessert café. 🍜🍰 I’m always on the hunt for new spots to try, so if you’re a foodie too, we’ll totally click!

When I’m not eating my way through life, I’m a total sucker for fitness. 💪 Morning gym sessions with my favorite playlist blasting? Yes, please. It’s my way of staying strong and keeping those endorphins up. But let’s be real—life’s all about balance, so you’ll definitely find me indulging in bubble tea or pizza after. 🧋🍕

Oh, and I love exploring! Whether it’s a hidden bookshop, a scenic park, or just wandering aimlessly through the city, I’m always down for an adventure. 📚🌿 At home, you’ll find me curled up with a good K-drama or a mystery novel, sipping on iced coffee (because hot coffee? Nah, not my thing). ☕

I’m also super into fashion! My style’s always a mix of cute and edgy—I love pairing oversized hoodies with combat boots or dressing up in something sleek for no reason at all. 👗✨

So that’s me—just a girl juggling dreams, vibes, and a lot of bubble tea. Let’s connect, vibe, and make life a little sweeter together! 😘",1,1731972395.0,u_minigirlpeach,0,1.0,True

1guitzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1guitzv/recently_got_in_touch_with_my_ex_after_2_years/,recently got in touch with my ex after 2 years but he has a gf,"When i (female) was 16, i had a boyfriend (17). We dated for 5 and a half months in 2021 (mid april to the end of september), although we spent like a month apart cause we broke up in august, but then got back together. For me, he was the best relationship i’ve ever been in, he’s the only man i’ve ever been in LOVE with. We got into a lot of fights but we were kids so i now see that as stupid fights and overall it was a great relationship. He ended up breaking up with me over the phone shortly after he went to university. I figured he met a lot of girls (he’s handsome and funny af) and started partying so he didn’t want to be with me anymore, which i completely get, since he went to study 3 hours and a half away from where we live and he didn’t have a car back then or even a licence. I blocked him on everything cause i was on my last year of high school and wanted to focus on studying. Also i had just met a new friend group and just wanted to have fun to get over it. It wasn’t hard for me because the one month we had spent apart before was horrible and i had already processed a lot of that pain. Not long after that break up, i messaged him to ask him how he was doing and followed him again (he followed me back) and we would talk sometimes during summer of 2022. Since then, we never spoke again. I went to university too (a different one, although closer to his than before) and went on with my life. However, moving forward to november 2024, now he’s 21 and i’m almost 20, last saturday (today is monday) something happened that made two of my friends (females) and me start talking about relationships and stuff, so i talked about him. Suddenly, i found myself feeling nervous when i talked about him and feeling my heart sinking when i looked at the videos i have with him that i was showing my friends. That night i couldn’t sleep at all so at like 5:30 am (already sunday) i followed him on instagram (i stopped following again very long ago cause he almost never posted anything and when he did they were political stuff and we never talked so i decided to unfollow him) and then i messaged him. I said “hii // i hope it doesn’t bother you that i texted you, today i’ve been thinking about you a lot because of something and i just wanted to know how you’re doing and what’s up with you // if it doesn’t bother you of course”. He replied that Sunday morning that i made him so happy by texting him and that it doesn’t bother him at all. We talked on Sunday but not too much cause we were both busy. He asked about my family, I asked about mine, he said he has so much stuff to tell me and he told me he went through a rough patch so i told him he could talk to me if he needed anything to which he replied “thanks blondie 🫶” which is how he would call me when we were together. Today I asked him why he’s going to the university he used to study in (he left and started studying again back home) and he said he was going to see his friends and his gf who is from there. When i read that my heart sunk real deep, i think i didn’t (or didn’t want to) realise that i still have sole feelings for him and was hoping to reconnect and maybe see each other and see what happens? idk… The thing is he told me he’s been with his gf officially since February but non-officially since shortly after he broke up with me. Now that i’ve discovered that what i miss is him and not just being in a relationship like that i wanted to start talking and maybe start over but if he has a gf that’s going to be impossible. However, i feel like we never really got (at least not me) real closure and i thought maybe i could send him a really long text that i wrote in a few weeks when we’ve talked more cause i’m feeling a bit anxious and i’m thinking a lot about him and idk, i’d like to know what’s going to happen with this situation to see if i should keep talking to him or move forward but i need to know. I’ll ask chatgpt to translate (i’m spanish) the full text and i’ll paste it here. Let me know what you would do in this situation, if you would talk to him about this, if not, if you would add or delete anything from the text… idk but please help me i’m confused 😭

here it is:

Hello, XXXX.

I wanted to write this because I feel it’s necessary for me to tell you, otherwise I won’t be able to move on and find peace. Perhaps it’s a bit selfish of me, and I apologize if this confuses you or makes you overthink, but over these years I’ve learned to consider myself my top priority, and I believe it will be good for me to say this.

Over the years, I’ve thought of you on several occasions, just as I remember other people who have been important to me at different times in my life—nothing strange or special. However, the other day, while talking about you, I felt a squeeze in my heart when I realized you were no longer in my life and remembered all the good times we shared, even the bad ones. Even more so when I found videos of us hugging or kissing, which I hadn’t seen in over three years.

Since that day—the day I decided to reach out to you—I’ve tried to talk to you as I would with any friend I hadn’t spoken to in a long time. I simply wanted to reconnect and leave it at that, but as much as it pains me to admit it, I couldn’t.

When you told me you had a girlfriend, I felt something break inside me because perhaps I hadn’t processed it, and I hadn’t realized that I had feelings for you that had been hidden for a long time.

I promise that at no point have I wanted to flirt with you or anything like that, especially knowing you have a girlfriend, because I will always respect the fact that you’re in a relationship and I would never try to change that, out of respect for both you and her. However, I can’t ignore the fact that I feel something for you.

I’ve considered the possibility that maybe it’s just nostalgia for the good times we had and not for you as a person, or maybe I miss being in a fun, carefree relationship like the one we had that summer when we were finally free from studying, spending time walking along the beach, chatting, laughing a lot, among other things…

I’ve truly enjoyed talking to you again, but it’s also made me realize that I miss you. I miss your personality, your jokes, spending time with you, making plans, gossiping, hanging out with your brothers… What I thought was nostalgia for being in a nice relationship—a feeling that would come up every few months and then fade without causing much distress—turns out to be many unresolved feelings I still have for you.

We didn’t end on bad terms; I understand why you broke up with me when you went to university, whether it was because of your current girlfriend, the distance, or simply because you stopped liking me. However, I still feel like we never had a proper closure.

I’m not asking you to get back together or leave your girlfriend for me—not at all. I suppose you’re happy with her, and I’m not expecting you to change anything about that. When I first reached out to you, my intention was just to chat for a few days, catch up, and simply become friends again, but I didn’t realize at the time that what I was really looking for was another chance to get to know each other and see what might happen.

I understand that, being in a relationship, staying friends with your ex might not be something you or your girlfriend are comfortable with, and I can understand if, after reading this sort of confession, you decide to cut off contact with me completely. Still, I’d like to hear how you feel about all of this first. I’d also like to ask you directly why you broke up with me, because I never really understood it and would at least like to have that closure to move on.

Honestly, I don’t really know what I’m expecting by telling you all this because I’m not sure what will be worse for me—getting a painful answer or getting no answer at all. I’m sorry if this causes any issues in your relationship, but I needed to say it.

When I was telling you what I said to my friends about you, I wasn’t entirely honest. I left out how you’re the only one I’ve truly fallen in love with. I haven’t felt as happy with anyone else as I did with you, and I never felt that way before you either. For me, despite our differences or the silly arguments we had as kids back then, you’re the only one I’ve felt I could truly talk to about absolutely anything. You’re the only one who listened to me and made me feel heard. You’re the only one who made me reflect on topics I’d never considered. The only one I could really debate with—about politics, relationships, experiences, or any of the countless things we talked about—and the only one who genuinely made me question my views on life.

For me, you have been and will always be a very important person. You might be “The One That Got Away,” and I’ll always regret losing you and every time I messed up with you. There’s no one I’ve met who is as special as you or who has made me feel my emotions so intensely. I don’t know if it’s a matter of personality or just that unexplainable flutter in your heart you get with certain people.

As I’ve already said, I understand that you’re happy with the person you’re with and that you’re not going to give me a chance to get to know each other again and see what might develop, even though what I really want is to see you again and give you one of those hugs that made the world stop.

I needed to say this and get it off my chest, so I’m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable, but I’ve had my mind spinning for a while now, completely occupied with thoughts of you, and I couldn’t bear feeling confused anymore or the heartbreak I feel every time I see a picture of you.

If you could answer the questions I’ve asked, I would appreciate it, but I understand if you don’t.

I’m sorry for the long message and everything, but I hope we can at least be friends again, even if it’s just to have a coffee. Take as much time as you need to respond and process all of this—I’m in no rush. Also, if there’s anything you want to ask me or something you don’t understand, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’d like to get everything out in the open, and since I’m quite certain you’re probably not going to give me a chance to try again, at the very least, if you don’t want to be friends either, I’d like to finally have personal closure with these feelings.

And well, for everything you’ve done for me at some point—both when we were together and now for reading all of this—thank you. You will always be very important to me, no matter what you decide. ",1,1731972306.0,Advice,20,0.67,False

 It’s been a few months, he has been a really good boyfriend since then. He took me to Italy, buys me things, and sends all the words of affirmation. He does everything in his power to reassure me and it’s 100% clear that he doesn’t want to lose me again. But before we got back together i made it very clear that my standards had risen, i wasn’t okay with settling for someone who had no goals or plans for their future, and i have no interest in financially supporting any man who is fully capable of supporting themselves. I told him that i expect a plan from him, and it doesn’t have to be anything crazy, just some sort of plan to progress from the restaurant industry. I’ve given him months and there’s been literally zero progress. He bought a 2023 Camaro, now has a massive debt bc of that, has no savings, and literally no plan other than to move in with me and get another restaurant job here. I work so hard and have done it all while also being a caregiver to my dad who has a terminal illness. I have a plan, a savings, health insurance, a 401k. And that’s never something i try to rub in face, and frankly even if i did, i doubt he would even care bc he doesn’t find that type of stuff important. But when i reflect, i just always end up back at that same idea of feeling too good for him. I don’t know what to do, because in terms of being a good boyfriend and staying loyal he really has been 100% (and he prides himself on that, which kinda makes it lose its worth tbh). But in life, I’ve seen no progress. Please help me.

TL;DR My boyfriend has cheated on me and has no plan or goals for life and I feel like I could do better but i love him and think I maybe just can’t go through the pain that I associate with leaving him again. ",0,1731972164.0,relationships,14,0.42,False

The past 4 years have been a pretty tough time. Covid happened, I took care of my terminally ill parent who had been diagnosed with brain cancer, and I have spent a lot of time alone.

I just started working at an Amazon warehouse. I do not enjoy the job at all, but they hired me with my 4 year gap in employment, have decent pay, and have a pretty solid schedule that gives me the daytime to do what I want.

I have a lot of issues going on and it all feels overwhelming.

First, I have spent a lot of time alone. After my parent passed, I became extremely depressed. I would spend days inside, ordering food, and watching tv and playing video games. Between the covid lockdowns and this depressed period, I have become very comfortable being alone and doing nothing all day. Even after getting out of my depressive period, working out, moving around friends, etc, I still find myself wasting days without doing anything worth doing. I will wake up, drink some coffee, and spend the day watching movies/tv, playing video games, and browsing reddit. A good day is when I go to the gym for a few hours or hang out with friends, but those things have become so inconsistent. My isolation has also destroyed my social skills. In social situations, I find that I am very quiet and reserved and have no energy. This is very different than who I used to be before covid.

Second, I have no idea what the hell to do for a career. Before covid, I bounced around entry level job to entry level job. Nothing really stuck for me and I found work boring. I lived for the weekends when I could go out with my friends, go explore, go do anything else. During covid, I was able to collect unemployment for a while. When my parent passed, they left me a little bit of money. I wanted to use that money to set myself up for a career. Instead, it has been slowly going towards frivolous things. I have a few roommates, so rent has been very cheap. My biggest expenditure has been take out. I still have enough to live on for at least a year, which is great, but I constantly have to fight myself to go to work. It is so hard to go to my Amazon job knowing that I don't ""need"" the money right now. I tell myself the job will be good to get back into working shape and that Amazon has decent opportunities as far as promotions and education benefits, but I am a seasonal employee and don't know if I can stand to be there long enough to become full time.

Third, I have no interests, direction, or idea of what I want. All of the bad habits I picked up during covid meet all of my needs. Food, shelter, distraction, etc are all taken care of. There is no external pressure to do anything and my internal drive has been lacking.

I don't know what the hell to do. I don't know if something is wrong with me or if I am just in a slump. I am hoping for better days, yet I know that I need to go out and work for them, I just don't know what I want or how to figure that out.",1,1731971340.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

I walked to the Universal Coney Island. It was just a few blocks away from my apartment complex. My neck was still damp from the cool shower. In my eagerness to see Marie, I had thrown on a pair of black jeans and a black button up. I was also wearing the leather jacket she had given me as a gift. I was supposed to meet her for coffee, and then we had to conduct some business on behalf of her family at a local nightclub. 

It was not unusual for Marie to be late. I thought of what she could possibly be doing and almost decided against leaving a voice message: 

“Hey, Marie, it’s William. Called you. Anyway, I’m at the place I thought I finally convinced you to try. Guess I was wrong. Return my call when you get this message.” 

I opened the glass door leading into the vestibule and saw a young girl waiting by the counter. We exchanged glances. That was all it took for my primitive side to take over... my vampire side.

Her perfume was intoxicating. The faint aroma of jasmine and wildflower made my fangs stiff. 

She turned around once she had noticed my shadow and asked, “Do I know you from somewhere?” 

“Do I seem familiar?”

“No. Can you please—""

“Did I startle you.” 

“You didn’t.”

“Even better.”

“Excuse me?”

“I couldn’t stop myself... from talking to you, of course.”

She scanned my eyes for deception. “Well, if you want to get to know me, you could start by buying me something to eat.” 

“Whatever you desire.” 

“Whatever I desire, huh?” 

I waved my hand towards the counter, and added, “I’d be a fool not to.”

“I like the way you put it,” she smiled, placing a finger to her lips as she thought about my offer. “Hmm. Well, can I have—wait, let me think. Okay, an order of nachos and a milkshake, I suppose.”

The Arabian guy behind the counter asked, “Is that it?”

“Wait. Do you want something?” she asked me.

“Medium, double-double.” 

She clasped my hand when it reached her waist and gently tugged it away. When she looked up at me, her look was one of surprise. My boldness was her curiosity, and so she softly spoke, “You haven’t even told me your name.”

“Are names really important?”

“You can’t be serious.” 

“William, what’s yours?”

“Juliet,” she smirked back.

“It suits you,” I kindly told her. 

“Thank you for the compliment.” 

“Okay. You guys can have a seat. The waitress will bring your food to you when it’s done,” the Arabian guy insisted.

Juliet was wearing a scarlet gown that had a pleated waistline. My primitive side wanted nothing more than to ravage her in that vacant restaurant. I wanted to give in to my nature so bad but... *No! Not here. Not now.* 

She turned to me and smiled. I had been in my feelings for so long. I hadn’t even noticed that she had left my presence and took a seat at the table nearest the exit. I wonder how long she had been watching me review her with my eyes. Meh. What does it matter? She’ll be dead soon...

Juliet took a seat upon the opposite side. And when I sat down across from her, she said, “A menu, waiter, couches. What kind of Coney Island is this?”

“It’s more like a restaurant, you like it?” 

“It’s homey. Look at all the silly pictures!” 

“You’re right. It is very homely.” 

“What’s your name? I didn’t catch it the first time.”

“William. William Chosen.” 

“What is that Italian, or wait, Greek maybe? Well, anyways, my name is Juliet Lansing. Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.”

“Bond?”

“Yeah. ‘Mr. William. William Chosen.’”

“Why would you—""

“I’m just teasing.”

“Interesting. I guess.”

“Strange last name by the way.”

“If you only knew.”

“Why? What’s so funny?”

“Nothing. Nothing at all.”

“Pfft. The name fits.”

The reason why I was smirking was because I knew the origin of my last name. It was just that I couldn’t tell her that it was the surname given to a vampire of pureblood decent. I wouldn’t tell her in a million years something that sounded so outlandish. And besides, I had other plans for her.

“You know, you’ve been grinning ever since we sat down.” 

“It’s nothing really. I’m curious, where are you coming from dressed like that this time of the night?”

“It’s not even late. Anyways? To answer your question. I went over to Wayne State and turned in my application for next semester. Then I talked to one of the guidance counselors about financial aid. After that I stayed at the library until closing. Had to brush up on my history and stuff since that is what I’m going to be majoring in, well, African and Native American studies, actually.”

“How old are you, Juliet?” 

“Eighteen, and you?” 

“Twenty-two.”

“Let me see your license.”

“You don’t believe me?” 

“I just want to see it.” 

“I don’t have it.”

She glanced at my Rolex. “That’s odd?” 

I smirked. “No it’s not.” 

“Well. You shouldn’t walk around the city without an ID. It isn’t safe. Or smart. Something bad could happen to you.” 

“It’s funny you say that...” I murmured as I looked down at the carpeted floor. Magically, the colorful patterns had become interesting. Maybe not. Maybe it was the sudden guilt and shame that consumed me. At that moment I knew I wasn’t going to slay her. I wanted something more, but what that was I didn’t know. Something about her reminded me of my last victim, Lisa.

*Why did I kill her? Why?!*

“Are you okay, you look upset?”

I slid my hands through my hair. “Long story.”

“What do you want from me?”

“It’s funny you ask.” 

“Why is it funny.”

“You’d never guess.”

“Well, the answer’s no. I’m not going back to your place, so don’t even bother asking.”

“Why? Are you afraid?”

“I’m looking for something long term.” 

“You get asked quite frequently I assume?” 

She huffed. “Yeah. I’m getting tired of saying the same thing over and over. Why can’t the guy I’m looking for just—” 

“Okay, so which one of you folks had the coffee?” the waitress asked, breaking Juliet’s train of thought.

“I had the coffee, she has the other stuff,” I told her.

“Darn, I probably should’ve ordered more since he’s buying,” she jokingly shared with the waitress. 

She smiled while placing her food upon the table. “Here you go, sugar, take care of yourself.”

“You should probably just pour the salsa over your nachos.”

“Is that the logical thing to do?” she asked me.

“Yeah. It is.”

“Then too bad,” she said before dipping a chip into the container. “Maybe I’ll change my mind if you answer my question.”

“What was your question?”

“You know.” 

“I don’t.”

“What do you want?”

“Well, I wouldn’t mind taking you back to my apartment but—” 

“I already told you no?”

“Right…”

“So… do you have a car?” she inquired.

I stole a sip from my mug. “Yes.”

“Interesting, where do you work?”

“I do a lot of things here and there.”

“Things? Huh.”

“Yeah… things…”

“Like what.”

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“A lot of things.”

“Oh my God.”

“I know I’m being vague. But in my line of work, you have to be.”

“Oh yeah? Why’s that.”

“You can’t let people get too close.”

Juliet frowned. “Whatever. You’re probably a fraud.”

“Believe what you desire.”

“Look, I’m sorry. It’s late. I-I have to go.”

I grabbed her hand when she stood. “I want to see you again?”

“I don’t know you’re kinda creepy?”

“How so?”

“With most guys I can tell what they’re after, but with you it’s different. It’s like I know but I don’t.” 

“Here, I’ll give you my number. You can decide from there,” I said before jotting it down upon the nearest napkin. 

“Okay. I *might* call you.”

“Wait, will you be okay getting home?” 

“I’ll be just fine. Thanks for the food.”

She said goodbye, leaving me here to reflect upon my inaction. After letting out a deep sigh, I mumbled, “Why did I let her escape?” 

Disappointed in myself, I looked at my Rolex to see it was only 8:00 pm. “It’s getting late, huh,” I mumbled her excuse aloud just to see if it didn’t sound as ridiculous if I said it. Maybe shame was a good feeling. Maybe it was the thing I deserved for what I did to Lisa’s beautiful soul. I brought my hands to my face and relived the moment I sunk my fangs into her neck. 

“Come on, William, snap out of it. What would Marie say if she walked in and saw you like this?” 

“Need a refill, honey?”

“Um, no thanks.”

“Everything alright? You look a bit flustered.”

“I’ll figure it out.” 

“Suit yourself.” 

The waitress grabbed my empty mug. She looked to be about forty but hid her age well with makeup and decorum. Her apron was soiled in old food and coffee stains. She didn’t look too bad from the back, but was she good enough to *kill* was the question? Let’s see. I could wait for her to leave work, which should probably be very soon by the looks of it. Yeah. That’s it. I could easily follow her home and impale my fangs deep inside her neck. I wonder how good her blood tastes. I’ve never been with an older... eh… What was I thinking? Liten to me, rambling about like some desperate thief in the night without a light. Who’s next on my bucket list? The kind old granny at my apartment complex?

I slammed the money on the table and barged out the door. Oh, and just for my rapacious stupidity, I made sure to leave a forty-dollar tip for the hardworking waitress I fancied murdering. 

The cool, night air hit my face and flowed down my body. The relaxing sensation almost pulled me out of my warped frame of mind. I reached into my pocket for a cigarette. In the city I felt free. It’s funny. This abandoned street reminded me so much of my abandoned dreams.",0,1731971115.0,vampires,1,0.5,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I'm considering buying the Everyday Backpack, but I'm torn between the 20L and 30L sizes. I'm looking for some advice from those who have used either (or both) of these backpacks. Here’s a bit about my situation and what I plan to carry:

1. Daily Commute: I’d carry a laptop up to 15” in size (shopping for what would work best for me), a Fujifilm mirrorless camera, a couple of lenses, a water bottle, a coffee tumbler, and a lunch bag.  I figure my photo gear can sit in the Flex fold dividers and the lunch bag I can load in from the top (it seals so spillage wouldn’t be an issue, but I’m not opposed to keeping it on the bottom instead).

2. Photo Shoots: For photography gigs, I’d pack my Fujifilm, a full-frame DSLR (Canon 5D Mark II, looking at getting a used Mark IV), lenses for both, and some accessories (straps, memory cards, batteries, speedlites, etc.).  I don’t have any giant lenses for either camera.

I am leaning toward the 20L due to its smaller size and lighter weight, but I am worried about the capacity, especially for photo shoots when I’m loaded out, and I’m unsure about the bulkiness of the 30L, especially when crammed in on the subway. Can anyone share their experiences with either the 20L or 30L model or both? Any insight on which size would better suit my needs would be greatly appreciated.

Are ergonomic mice worth it? This question has been swirling around in my head ever since I experienced some pretty serious discomfort from my regular mouse. You know how it is. Hours spent on the computer can lead to aching wrists and sore fingers, like I’ve been wrestling with a porcupine. So, I decided to dive deep into the world of ergonomic mice. Join me as I share my personal experiences, insights, and a few giggles along the way, exploring if these fancy gadgets can really make a difference for our little hands.
  
  
## The Struggle is Real: My Personal Pain Point

Let me tell you, I’ve never thought much about mice. The computer kind, I mean—not the squeaky ones that raid the pantry. For years, I used whatever cheap, plastic clicker came with my setup, blissfully unaware of the ticking time bomb under my palm. Then, one day, my hand started throwing a tantrum. It wasn’t subtle, either. First, a dull ache in my wrist. Then, a full-blown rebellion where my fingers stiffened up as if auditioning for a zombie flick. 

At first, I ignored it. I thought, _Oh, I just need to shake it out!_ So, there I was, waving my hand around like I was conducting a tiny orchestra. But the pain wasn’t so easily fooled. It crept up into my forearm, turning every click into a cringe-worthy chore. My trusty mouse had morphed into a tiny, cruel dictator, and I wasn’t about to let it win. 

The worst part? It wasn’t just about the pain. My productivity took a nosedive. Clicking through emails became a task of Herculean proportions. Don’t even get me started on video games—I had to tap out mid-match more times than I’d like to admit. The final straw? Dropping my coffee mug because my hand was too numb to grip it. That, my friend, was my _rock bottom._ 

And yet, I still didn’t jump straight to ergonomic solutions. I tried DIY fixes—wrapping my wrist in a sock for ""support"" (pro tip: don’t). My denial was strong, but my hand was stronger—stronger at making me miserable, that is.

## What Even is an Ergonomic Mouse?

What even is an ergonomic mouse? Oh, let me tell you—it’s not some futuristic gadget designed to make you feel out of touch with tech trends. Nope, it’s more like a thoughtful redesign of the humble computer mouse, created with one goal in mind: keeping your hand from feeling like it’s auditioning for a hand cramp competition. You know that achy, stiff feeling you get after a long day of clicking and scrolling? That’s what these mice are supposed to help with. 

Unlike your standard mouse, which often forces your hand into a claw-like shape (seriously, who decided that was comfortable?), ergonomic mice are all about natural positions. Imagine shaking someone’s hand. That’s the posture they’re going for—a handshake, not a wrestling grip. Some look like small towers, others are shaped like big, friendly pebbles. The design encourages your wrist to stay straight and your fingers to relax, instead of pinching like you’re holding onto a slippery soap bar. 

Here’s a funny way to think about it: regular mice are like those hard wooden chairs at a budget diner—functional, sure, but you wouldn’t call them comfy. An ergonomic mouse? That’s the plush armchair of the mouse world, built for lounging while you work. Or at least, for avoiding a trip to the chiropractor.

## The Science Behind the Comfort

Let’s get nerdy for a second—because I like knowing _why_ things work. When I first heard about ergonomic mice being “better for your wrist,” I thought, “Okay, sounds fancy, but what’s the catch?” Turns out, there’s a mountain of research behind the design. No marketing gimmicks—just plain old science. 

So, here’s the deal: our hands weren’t exactly built for the traditional flat mouse most of us have been gripping like our lives depend on it. When your hand is forced into that palm-down, claw-like position, it can compress nerves, strain tendons, and over time, lead to repetitive stress injuries (hello, carpal tunnel). Studies suggest that keeping your hand in a more neutral position—like a handshake—reduces this strain significantly. That’s the whole philosophy behind ergonomic mice. 

I found this research from Cornell University, which showed that using a vertical mouse, for instance, can decrease wrist pronation. Fancy word, but all it means is less twisty, weird angles for your wrist. Less twisty equals less ouchy. Another study in _The Journal of Occupational Health_ noted that people who switched to ergonomic mice reported reduced hand and arm discomfort after just a few weeks. Pretty convincing, right?

Now, I’m not saying it’s magic or that it’ll instantly cure your wrist woes, but the science backs it up: less strain = happier hands. And hey, happier hands mean more guilt-free scrolling, right?

## Trying Out the Ergonomic Mouse: A Test Run

Trying out an ergonomic mouse for the first time was a bit like meeting a new friend who just happens to have a very weird handshake. I mean, I knew it was supposed to be better for me, but initially, it felt… awkward. Imagine trying to use a spoon with your non-dominant hand—it just didn’t feel quite right.

The first thing I noticed was how my hand naturally hovered over the mouse. I had to consciously fight the urge to grip it like I was holding on for dear life. My old, traditional mouse? I’d clench that thing like I was playing a high-stakes game of _Whac-A-Mole_. But this ergonomic one had a curve that encouraged a more relaxed hold. Almost like it was telling me, ""Chill out, buddy, I got this."" 

Now, don't get me wrong—there was a bit of a learning curve (pun intended). The buttons felt like they were in different places, and I kept mis-clicking, but within an hour or so, I started to adjust. And boy, when I did, it was like my hand sent me a thank-you note. The constant ache I used to feel after a long day at the computer? That didn’t show up. I was surprised. Could it be that something this simple was the solution to all my hand pain?

It’s funny how something as small as a mouse could make such a big difference.

## Price Tag vs. Health Benefits

Price tags can be sneaky little devils, can’t they? You’re shopping for something as simple as a mouse, and suddenly—bam! You’re staring at a price that makes you wonder if the thing doubles as a spaceship controller. That’s exactly how I felt the first time I looked up ergonomic mice. “Fifty bucks for a mouse?!” I muttered, glancing at my trusty-but-cramped $10 option sitting on my desk. But then I started doing the math—not with a calculator, just with my aching wrist.

Here’s the thing: that dull, persistent ache in your hand? It doesn’t come with a price tag, but let me tell you, it _costs_. Productivity drops, Netflix binging becomes awkward (how do you pause with a claw?), and don’t even get me started on the endless Googling of “early signs of carpal tunnel.” The health benefits of an ergonomic mouse? Huge. These mice are shaped to fit your hand like a glove—or maybe more like a friendly potato—encouraging a natural grip and reducing strain.

Now, let’s talk options because not all ergonomic mice require a second mortgage. I found a gem for under $30 that was surprisingly comfy. It wasn’t as fancy as some premium models, but it still made a world of difference. So, is it worth it? If your health matters more than your daily coffee run budget, I’d say, absolutely. Would you spend a few extra bucks to keep your body happy? Seems like a no-brainer to me.

## Making the Switch: Tips for Your New Mouse

Switching to an ergonomic mouse is like upgrading your life in tiny, delightful ways. But let’s be real—it’s not as simple as tossing your old mouse into a drawer and calling it a day. You’ve spent years training your hand muscles to love (or tolerate) the flat, awkward shape of a traditional mouse. Now, you’re asking those same muscles to unlearn bad habits. That’s like teaching an old dog to dance ballet. Possible? Sure. Effortless? Not quite.

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/are-ergonomic-mouse-worth-it> 

Here’s what worked for me when I made the leap. First, give your hand time to adjust. Use the ergonomic mouse for short bursts initially, maybe 20-30 minutes at a stretch. It’s like breaking in new shoes—your hand needs to find its groove. Trust me, if you dive in full throttle, your hand might rebel. Mine staged a mini protest in the form of mild soreness.

Placement is key, too. Make sure your mouse and keyboard sit at the same height, and your arm stays at a relaxed angle. An adjustable desk or wrist support pad can work wonders here. Oh, and don’t forget to tweak your sensitivity settings! I made the mistake of leaving mine at warp speed, and it felt like playing a video game on expert mode.

Lastly, don’t skimp on other ergonomic accessories. A good chair, a desk at the right height, and even an anti-fatigue mat if you stand—these all add up to a happier you. Try it out, and tell me if your hands send you a thank-you note!

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, the question 'Are ergonomic mice worth it?' isn’t just about whether they look cool or come in fun colors. It’s about how they can change your gaming and working life. My own journey showed me that the right mouse can mean the difference between feeling like a champ or dealing with nagging pain. If you’re spending countless hours clicking away, investing in an ergonomic mouse might be one of the best decisions you make. So, go ahead—give your hands a breather! Because, as I’ve learned, our hands deserve a little TLC and who wouldn’t want more comfort during those long gaming nights or late-night study sessions?",1,1731970911.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

1guib8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1guib8c/usa_accidentally_hit_a_mcdonalds_drive_through/,(USA) Accidentally hit a McDonalds drive through sign and now facing a $9400 bill,"My friend hit a  McDonalds drive through screen with a rental moving truck in October in Massachusetts. He had to pull up as close as possible to the speaker to hear the McDonald employee (the speaker or their mic was defective and he could barely hear them speak) to get a cup of coffee via the app. Unfortunately pulling his rental trailer on his rental truck hit the single screen sign and shattered the glass screen. However the screen itself continued to function. He left his information with the McDonalds franchise, and almost a month later they are coming to him now with a $9400 to replace the screen. Yes he made a poor decision driving a rental truck with trailer through a drive through.

He was told in another subreddit that these Coates outdoor units have a warranty for screen burn, and he asked the HR person handling the case with the McDonalds corporation that owned the franchise, if she could check into the warranty to cover the damage, but she just filed the ticket with corporate and now they are going the route of replacing it with a new unit, and even brand new stand that wasn't damaged. The screen itself had burn in from heat exposure prior to the screen shattering, and the edges were brown from that.  The screen itself is around $5000 and they are adding close to another $5000 is charges for the new stand, new warranty, new speaker.  He feels like he is being taking advantage of.  He even asked the company which owns this location along with 20 other locations in Massachusetts about paying for their insurance deductible but they say their insurance deductible starts at $10k and this replacement is right below that.

Do you think there is anyway to talk to Corporate to get a discount on the replacement? He is a long standing customer, and taking a $10k hit out of pocket is very tough at the moment. Also his personal vehicle insurance won't cover rental moving trucks, and he is 99% sure his rental truck damage insurance won't cover this.

This is a franchise location which is part of a smaller management company which owns 21 locations in Massachusetts.

Here is a photo of the damaged screen:

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  DITO prices FOO at ₱1.05/share...** **DITO CME** [DITO 1.79 ▼6.3%; 592% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=c03cb5e2ed6773ceabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] disclosed its follow-on offering’s (FOO) price at ₱1.05/share, which caused the PSE to halt trading in DITO’s stock for an hour to allow the public to consume the news. DITO will sell 1,953,500,000 primary shares to the public through the FOO. The revisited offer period will run from November 20 through November 26, and the FOO shares will list on December 6. At the time of the announcement, the FOO price was at a 45% discount to DITO’s market price of ₱1.91/share, but represents a 5% premium over the amount paid by **Summit Telco** last year when it acquired 3.3 billion common shares at ₱1.00/share. DITO’s management team has been authorized by its board to negotiate the price and timing of the sale of up to 9 billion common shares to Summit Telco in a deal that would cede control of the company from **Dennis Uy’s Udenna** to the mysterious Summit Telco.
>    - ***MB:*** At the time of DITO’s sale to Summit Telco in 2023, DITO inferred that it may have sold shares to Summit Telco at a price that was even cheaper than ₱1.00/share, but was prevented from doing so by the ₱1.00/share par value of its common shares. DITO justified that price by pointing to its negative per-share book value, which at the time was -₱2.21/share. According to DITO’s Q3 Quarterly Report, its current per-share book value is now even worse, at -₱3.08, and yet we’re supposed to eat a 5% premium? I can’t see this offering as anything other than a cynical way to (potentially) monetize whatever goodwill exists in this stock before Dennis Uy loses control to Summit. And speaking of the potential deal with Summit, since we don’t know the price of those 9 billion shares yet, there’s always the chance that FOO buyers could be absolutely rug-pulled by yet another sale to Summit at par. Same book, different chapter for this group.

>- **[UPDATE]  Top Line defers IPO until Q1/25...** **Top Line Business Development** [TOP] [[link](https://topline.ph/2024/11/18/top-line-moves-ipo-to-q1-2025-accommodates-potential-institutional-investors-new/)] was scheduled to price its IPO yesterday, which was tentatively slated to list on December 12, but instead notified that its ownership group has elected to “adjust [its] IPO timetable” to allow potential investors to “secure internal approvals to participate in the IPO.” TOP said that it was “happy” with the reception it received from its “engagement with qualified institutional buyers” during the IPO process, but said that the delay will allow it to include its year-to-date (9M) financial performance data in its prospectus, “which would demonstrate [TOP’s] consistent growth trajectory”.
>    - ***MB:*** There are a lot of moving pieces in an IPO. I don’t have any special inside info to comment on TOP’s institutional investors needing more time to obtain internal clearances, but that sort of delay is relatively common in the institutional investing world. Private and public funds take meetings all the time on potential investments, but most require some formal approval process with an internal group (usually called an “Investment Committee”) that can result in delays as the usual logistics challenges come up, like getting five powerful people to be in the same room at the same time to hear the presentation. So I could see a situation where a fund showed late interest in getting involved, but couldn’t commit before the scheduled IPO, so TOP delayed the IPO to allow that fund (or group of funds in similar positions) to participate. I could see that. I could also see the owners wanting to push the deal off into a time where the PSEi isn’t melting before our very eyes, too. The PSEi has dropped over 7% since this IPO was approved at the end of October. Maybe everyone just wants a chance for all the uncertainty to work its way out of the system first before getting something done that can’t be undid?

>- **[Q3]  COL Financial Q3 commissions up 41% y/y...** **COL Financial** [COL 1.76 ▲0.6%; 13% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4c865ee94ab9fba2abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] reported a Q3 net income of ₱166 million, up 30% y/y from its Q3/23 net income of ₱128 million, thanks to a 24% increase in comprehensive revenues led by a 41% y/y increase in commissions to ₱110 million (up from ₱78 million). The **Lee Family’s** discount brokerage saw its revenues additionally boosted by higher interest income (+13% y/y) that the company earns on client deposits. On a 9M basis, COL reported a 3.3% jump in user accounts to 548,285 thanks to “active social media campaigns, investment webinars... participation in financial forums, and targeted email campaigns.”
>    - ***MB:*** COL’s Q3 results are basically derivative of the PSEi’s 13% move from 6,411 on July 1 to 7,272 on September 31. Volumes were significantly higher, and for brokerages like COL that earn through activity, anything like a bull market that breaks through psychological barriers and gets a lot of attention from mainstream news outlets will help the bottom-line. In COL’s case, it helps the bottom-line twice by encouraging greater trading volumes and also attracting new investors to the market. Those new investors open up accounts and deposit money, which COL then takes and deposits elsewhere to earn interest for itself. I thought it was very interesting to see COL reaping the rewards of its user acquisition efforts. It feels like COL now recognizes that it is in a fight to retain its position as the dominant discount brokerage now that we have several startups like **DragonFi** and **Luna** competing for the small-timer’s attention, and several platform-based digital trading options on the precipice of being fully formed, like **GStocks** and **Maya Stocks**. The competition is good, and this response by COL is probably a welcome change for its shareholders

I am currently wearing a fair amount of “cotton t shirts/Henley shirts that come in a 6 pack” because they are cheap and my employer considers them business casual. (Previous work was work from home so I am building a wardrobe.)

Inevitably, 1/3 - 1/2 of these shirts are a light gray or white that I am not confident wearing. (Look, if I spill coffee on a navy Henley no one notices.) I am considering investing in some Rit dye and making this collection of unworn shirts some shade of blue or green and expanding my wardrobe by 1/3 overnight. 

Are there any particular considerations I should take into account? This will be very different than turning yarrow into a delicate yellow-green for a lace shawl and I don’t think my previous experience is going to help me at all.

I’ve been exploring the world of espresso and am currently looking for a manual grinder. My goal is to find a model that delivers a grind quality comparable to high-end electric grinders but with the obvious trade-off of manual effort.

I understand that manual grinders often excel in portability and affordability, but I’m specifically interested in whether there are any models on the market capable of delivering consistent and precise results for espresso brewing. Are there manual grinders that can match or even rival the performance of expensive electric ones?

If you have experience with such models, I’d love to hear your recommendations or insights into the pros and cons of using them for espresso.

However, when I first took the radiator out of the box, I heard a lot of bubbling air as I moved it.

After a couple of weeks, the pump has become louder and it sounds like it's sucking air. When I run the pump at maximum speed to test it, the air sucking sound becomes even more apparent. For the sake of clarity: Yes, the pump is mounted below the radiator.

Is there supposed to be air in the radiator and is the faintly coffee grinder sound in addition to the normal pump/VRAM cooler sound normal?",1,1731970639.0,arcticcooling,1,1.0,False

1gui6p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tjcrew/comments/1gui6p1/hold_the_cone_box_blurb_blunder/,Hold the Cone Box Blurb Blunder,"Just started as a crewmember at TJ's a few months ago. This is going to seem extremely petty but as a part-time writing tutor I can't help but be a little annoyed by the text on the [Hold the Cone boxes](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/chocolate-chip-hold-the-cone-062834), especially since Trader Joe's marketing copy is typically pretty solid. The template for the box blurb is:

 
""8 mini \[cone flavor\] cones filled with \[ice cream flavor\] ice cream & \[coating flavor\] coating""

  
It's obvious from the nature of the product that this is *supposed* to mean that the ice cream is covered in coating, but the wording makes it sound as though the coating is on the *inside* of the cone: ""cones filled with ice cream ***& coating***"".

To add to the confusion, I found a [picture](https://old.reddit.com/r/traderjoes/comments/1bvvinr/the\_hold\_the\_cone\_mini\_cones\_are\_so\_good\_they/) posted on this subreddit of the ""Coffee Bean"" flavor, and that flavor's box doesn't feature this imprecise wording; it says:

""8 mini chocolate cones filled with coffee bean ice cream & ***topped with*** chocolatey coating""

  
What happened? All of the Hold the Cone boxes at my Trader Joe's feature the first, more amateurish blurb; was this a recent change? Why was it made? No other changes seem to have been made to the design of the box, save to make the wording of the blurb less accurate. Obviously this doesn't ultimately matter that much; it's not like most customers will even study the blurb close enough to notice this. But most TJ's products are covered in text that people won't necessarily see, and it's usually quite competently written; why is this the anomaly?",0,1731970577.0,tjcrew,9,0.29,False

1gui3yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1gui3yf/genital_electrolysis_tips_and_tricks/,Genital Electrolysis Tips and Tricks,"Hi everyone! 

I know there are a ton of posts like this out there, but I just wanted to add some of my recommendations after having started electrolysis pre-surgery. (in no particular order)

1. Take two extra strength tylenol (1000mg total) about an hour before the appointment. I just got generic acetaminophen from CVS, much cheaper than the name brand. I also recommend taking some Ibuprofen before and after the appointment to help with swelling and pain to a certain extent. My first session, I went in without anything on board and it ended up being a really painful experience.

2. Buy some over-the-counter numbing cream (5% lidocaine) and apply it right before you leave for your appointment, or 20 minutes before, whichever is longer. Use cling film to cover the area so you don't get it on your clothes. I have to take the bus to my appointments and was really worried the first time about sounding crinkly on the bus, so I ended up wiping the cream off before I left, and it basically did nothing because of that. Once you have underwear and pants on, there is minimal to no crinkling, and even if there is some, it's so worth it. I've also heard a few people mention EMLA numbing cream, however you have to get a prescription for this in the US. If you can get it though, it has multiple kinds of medication to extend the length of the effects compared to just lidocaine. 

3. For your first session, please for the love of god schedule a short session. Being stupid, I scheduled my first session for four hours. I made it three before I had to tap out, but I wouldn't recommend this length unless the place you go offers local sedation (not just numbing cream). 30 minutes would probably be a good start, and then you can work your way up from there. I'm doing 1.5 hour sessions now once or twice a week, and it's much more manageable. 

4. Don't drink caffeine for 24 hours before your appointment. I saw this online and thought it really wouldn't have much of an impact, so I drank coffee a few hours before my first appointment. I can't say that it was the sole reason for this happening, but my legs were twitching much stronger during the electric current than when I avoided caffeine. Again, could be caused by a lot of other factors, but I don't think it would hurt to avoid it. 

5. Bring something to do while you're sitting. I like to listen to music/podcasts, so I bring earbuds and have them at a low enough volume that I can hear my electrologist if they need me to reposition or anything else. I also recommend a stress ball for the more painful areas, preferably a foam one that won't pop because you might be squeezing pretty hard. 

  
All of this is personal to each person, so if something doesn't work for you, adjust it as needed. I've just found that these things really made it a much more bearable experience. I also don't want to scare anyone by saying that it's painful, but for me, it was much more painful (without numbing cream and meds) than resources online said it would be (everything said it would be like a rubber band snap or pinch, but it feels more like a deep burning to me, I'm not sure exactly how to describe it). With meds and numbing cream though, it was a lot more tolerable, and I sat for the 1.5 hour session with minimal issues. I thought going into my first session that I could handle it because I've gotten a tattoo and I was totally fine for that, but this is definitely a different sensation than a tattoo (and obviously in a more sensitive area). 

Good luck! ",5,1731970381.0,trans,1,0.86,False
