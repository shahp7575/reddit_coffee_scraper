It’s crazy to think that 12 months ago I could only dream of the life I now lead. But here I am sitting in my office having walked the 30-minute commute to work, sipping on coffee.  I’ll attend a few meetings, I’ll pop to the cafe to grab a sandwich. I’ll go home and on the way I’ll get a few groceries. My girlfriend and I discovered Slow Horses last night, so we’ll probably continue watching that. 

Tomorrow will be very similar. 

It’s a fairly mundane life, but I’m so happy to living it. I’m so grateful to everyone in my life, as well as here for helping me find my courage, but also to myself for pushing myself through it all. 

It’s been a wild and intense year, but I’d have to say probably the best of my life. Despite the fears I’ve had to face. Despite the tears and difficulties. Despite feeling close to collapse as I’m just exhausted. It’s been wonderful. 

I know next year will bring more challenges, but that’s ok. 

I hope you’re all doing well! Have a wonderful holiday period wherever you are ❤️❤️❤️",1,1734516614.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

Confused if she’s micro-cheating/cheating or merely just too immature. Or am I wrong?

Context: 

I'm 22 and my girlfriend is 19. I know switching accounts is a bit immature, but she somehow got me to agree to it. When I opened her account, I saw that she's talking to his ex, asking him to grab a coffee with her and their friend. When I asked her about it, she said she's just playing around with him because their friend 'joked' with her ex and told him that my girlfriend wanted to grab a coffee with him, and she just went along with it.

In a different scenario, we were watching something together online, and she was streaming on Discord. She wanted to show me something on TikTok, and I started feeling like something was off. I told her to tap on her inbox because I wanted to see who was messaging her.
When she did, I saw that she was talking to her classmate, sharing TikTok videos and whatnot, while she rarely sends me anything like that. I asked her why they were sending videos to each other, and she defended herself by saying, 'There's nothing wrong with it.' Then I asked her what she would do if she caught me sending TikTok videos to another girl, and she said she'd be mad, but later apologized.

1hgyi18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hgyi18/question_re_gout_and_viagra_usage/,"Question re Gout, and Viagra usage.
","Hello, my name is Mike. I am using a throwaway account.

I know it's a lengthy post, but I wanted to leave nothing necessary out.

First, here is my health background before I ask my question.

I am Scottish, male, living in Scotland. My current age is 40. I'm Caucasian, I'm in reasonably good health, generally. I take no drugs other than a prescription drug listed below. I drink alcohol rarely (just special occasions). I smoke nothing. Although I smoked hand rolled tobacco from 18 to 27. I am a moderate coffee drinker (about 5 cups per day).

I used to be almost (by UK medical definitions) class 2 obese (my BMI was 34.9). I was about 44 KG / 100 lbs overweight. But I have lost virtually all the excess weight since May 2023. My current BMI is 23.5.

I have been suffering from gout in my ankle and big toes, occasionally, since my early 30s, likely caused by my former lifestyle and excess weight. I have been taking allopurinol, daily, since 2019.

Now to the details relating to my enquiry.

I've spent most of my adult years single and uninterested in dating. I was sexually active in my teen years, but from my early 20s, I have been dealing with depression, social anxiety, and other issues and didn't feel the need to be intimate with other people. That's actually changed recently, I've been taking better care of myself and I feel more confident.

As a consequence, I've also had an unexpected boost to my libido. I have become more confident as a person, in recent years. But still, talking to new people sometimes feels like trying to play *jengo* with my words. I don't stutter, but it's not easy to talk with someone new, beyond a greeting.

Recently, I met someone online, and we decided to meet up in real life to have sex (with protection). Which I enjoyed and don't regret the meeting. However, physically, not everything was working as it should. I managed to get an erection until during the intercourse. Suffice to say, I left feeling ashamed of myself, although she was extremely friendly and understanding about it all. Everything was fine until early on in penetration, then junior decided to take his ball and go home. I'm not sure why it happened, my anxiety seemed to have gone quiet by that point.

I don't think the issue is a physical one, but mental. I have no difficulty, generally, with getting and keeping an erection. It was probably my nerves. That day I had been pretty nervous (because I had been celibate for so long), I was also physically tired because I had been walking, rushing around, trying to find her apartment for a good 45 minutes. It wasn't the easiest place to find.

It is also possible that it was nutritional based? I have been living on a restricted diet until I feel I have my weight down to healthy. Generally, I consume around 1700 kcals per day. I have read that's not the healthiest way to lose weight, counting calories. But that and walking 12,000 steps a day has been my routine.

The day of the meet up, I had eaten a protein bar and a sandwich. I was too anxious to eat anything more.

I walked away from the experience, convincing myself I'd never try again, but eventually came around to the idea of giving myself another chance.

I've been thinking about purchasing some **Viagra connect** for the occasion. I don't really feel comfortable talking to my GP (UK primary care / family doctor) about this. I know they deal with this and more every day, but it's still awkward, and I want to avoid it when I can. They also tend to be very busy. 

 I don't expect Viagra to be a permanent solution, but maybe to get past the initial mental block of the first time. I have no other health conditions such as high blood pressure or heart disease, to my knowledge. 

**The main point for this post is regarding Viagra and gout (or my medication: allopurinol). I've read that it can cause gout. But I am not sure if they're talking about the condition, which I already have. Or an episode. Or something else. I am already being treated for gout, and it's quite rare I have any flare-ups these days. Especially post weight loss.**

1hgyhfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/1hgyhfv/suspendhibernation_and_resume_issues_on_intel_nuc/,Suspend/Hibernation and resume issues on Intel NUC,"Hi everyone,



I'm an happy OpenBSD7.6 user on all of my laptops (3 ThinkPad); on these devices, everything works out of the box, including suspend/resume (and hibernation).



I'd love to replace Debian wiht OpenBSD7.6 on my 'desktop', an Intel NUC i7 (video chipset: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-U GT3e \[Iris Plus Graphics 655\] (rev 01)).



The installation works perfectly as well as the system is pretty stable and working well -including suspend/hibernation and resume- from the text console. Please note, from a ‘text console’.



The issue with suspend/resume start when using the X environment (just the plain and standard xorg + fvwm window manager); when resuming, the system is back to xenodm that is just stuck (nothing happen if I try to type username / password as well as the UI seems frozen).



Switching to console (ctrl-alt-f1), I can see that the system is still alive and working well with no apparent issues (or error message in the X, xenodm and xsession logs); restarting xenodm, I can actually login again into X (not ideal, as I’ve lost my previous working session).



So I though.. it must be related to xenodm. And so I have disabled xenodm and start X with the startx command but the issue remain; this time, at resume, instead of seeing the X environment I can only see the text console; if I press any button on my keyboard, I see all sorts of non-sense character appear on screen.



So I though... it must be related to the X environment.



I’ve tested the following:



\- Switching from DRI2 to DRI3 - same behaviour

\- Disabling the Video card power saving features - same behavior

\- Writing a ‘resume’ script (/etc/apm) to reset X (I know, this would not be a solution as I would lose the X session I was working on making the entire thing of suspend / resume useless) - regardless, same behaviour

\- Disabling the i915 chipset in /etc/boot.conf - same behaviour

\- Remove the latest firmware installed by fw\_update for inteldrm - same behaviour

\- Installed OpenBSD7.5 - same behaviour



The only test I’ve not yet executed is to load the Vesa driver; I’m reluctant to execute that as I would defintely not use the system in Vesa mode (slow and low resolution)



Does anyone have any idea of further tests or things to check? I’ve at the moment exausted all the ideas...



I know that it’s debateble to want to use suspend/resume on a desktop but I find this feature really really useful in many circumstances... as I have more or less the same workflow on my laptops, I’d love to use my desktop in the same way.



Thanks in advance to anyone willing to offer some help and support

Striker has 50 uses at 100% condition. Wood Matches have a 5% bonus fire starting chance vs Fire Striker at 15%. Its better to light a torch to start a fire anyway so fire bonus chance doesn't matter as much especially at higher fire starting skill levels. So an equivalent trade would be a 4x trade = 20 plants and 12 fir firewood for 48 matches. Weight compared is .10kg vs .32kg at 48 matches.  Wood Matches seems like a much better trade. Fire striker is not worth it imo. Maple saplings are quite valuable and trading with them needs yield a high value return.

Red Flare burns 5 real minutes vs Marine Flare at 75 real seconds. The difference? Marine flare lowers morale for timberwolves IF it lands close to them. You have to do this multiple times within 75 seconds, so you have to wander over and you know pick up the flare and not get bitten in the process. Even if they were the same cost you're better off getting a red flare and using it exclusively. They function the same. Marine flares aren't worth it imo.

This is an interesting one. I haven't come across this for trade but the caffeine pills supposedly reduce fatigue for 4 hours instead of coffee at 60 minutes. I'm not sure what the Initial Fatigue Reduction and Fatigue Loss rate is, but 5 pills weights the same as 1 cup of coffee. Of course you don't get 100 calorie's, recover 30% thirst or a warming up benefit. But it seems very competitive and an easier/cheaper trade value, resources wise, than a tin of coffee. Keep in mind 4 plants could mean just 4 rosehips! If anyone has more info about the pills please share and I'll update the post.

The reduction in car batteries requirements from 3 to 1 is welcomed. But the cougar hide wrap is a direct upgrade that means you can harvest the wrap for the hide and re-craft if need be. You can also craft the cougar knife which is a direct upgrade to the hunting knife. This of course means you'd need the cougar enabled and to actually kill it, but only once. (Sounds like some people have cougar in game regardless if you disabled it or not haha). The wolfskin pants vs deerskin pants are about equal so I skipped it.

Not listed in the wiki but I've seen regular wool mittens trade for 1L Fuel and 5 Birch Bark. Patterned Wool Mittens have the exact same stats but trade for twice as much. (The Blue Patterned looks the exact same!) Skip.

Here we have the same issue. Although not listed on the wiki I believe regular Wool Socks trade for half. In any case Climbing Socks cost only 2 more rabbit pelts and offer twice the warmth at 1c. Any inner clothing is also protected from damage so its worth the investment.

You're better off killing the cougar and making the cougar knife on any difficulty. Or simply beach-combing/exploring for a hunting knife on Stalker and below. Its suppose to make harvesting quicker (at 10% faster?) but also weights .75kg vs Hunting knife at .5kg. The cougar knife is better in a struggle too making it the best self-defense option now.

The Bunker Rifle only weights 1.5kg but loses 4% condition each shot! You're better off getting Vaughn's Rifle at 3kg and 2% condition lost per shot which is easy enough to find if lower weight trade off is what your after. Pair Vaughn's rifle with the rifle holster and it'll weight 1.5kg vs the Bunker Rifle at .75kg in the holster! (Unloaded stats, Below level 5). Is it worth 5 potential bows? I don't think so, unless you live in bleak inlet or blackrock and can repair it all the time at the milling machine.

A few notable good value trades that are easy enough to obtain I'll mention:

Old Mill Flour

Hatchet

Quality Tools

Wool Toque

Wool Shirt

Wool Longjohns

Mukluks - (Alittle expensive but best boots for stalker or below)

Bushcraft Bow Blueprint Card - This bow is a direct upgrade and sounds quite powerful. 25% more damage than the Survival Bow and More durability (1-2% condition loss per shot). It does cost 5x Cured Maple Sapling however. The most notable thing about this bow is it only requires 2x Green Birch Saplings (non cured)! Not maple saplings! 

These are all bad trade values comparatively. Based on trade values I've seen in game/from the wiki. Let me know what you think and what I've missed.

1hgybue,https://www.reddit.com/r/ereader/comments/1hgybue/open_alternatives_for_kindle_as_i_lost_my_love/,"""Open"" alternatives for kindle as I lost my love for the closed amazon echosystem","Hey folks, just a little about me: I've been using a Kindle for around 14 years now, always sticking to the Paperwhite models. I've had two in total—one got scratched, so I replaced it with the 10th gen Paperwhite, which I'm still using today. I used to be an avid reader, especially on Kindle, but lately, time has been tight. I manage about 8-10 books a year now, a mix of Kindle, paperback, and audiobooks. Gone are the days of keeping my Kindle in my pocket, reading while waiting for the bus or sipping coffee. Now it sits on a shelf for months until I find a book to read on it, then it makes a brief stay on my nightstand before being shelved again when I'm done.

I do think Amazon shares some of the blame for my waning interest in Kindle. My first Kindle was a game-changer—it felt like the best purchase I’d ever made. It was affordable (especially as a student), and books were often cheap or free. Sure, it was tied to Amazon’s ecosystem, but I could sideload books, which was a big deal since Kindle wasn't officially available in my country. As someone who values open software, that bothered me a bit, but not enough to switch to something else back then.

These days, though, the restrictions are harder to ignore. I recently lost all my sideloaded books after a software update—books I’d gathered over the years with no backups elsewhere. Amazon's cloud backup is great for books bought through them, but it doesn't help with the ones I actually want to keep. And the Kindle library itself? It's frustrating that I can’t organize my collection properly, like creating folders.

Anyway, enough of my venting. Here’s my question for those of you who are still keeping tabs on the e-reader scene: Is there a good alternative out there? Here’s what I’m looking for, and what I don’t really care about. I’m even open to jailbreaking if it offers a better solution and saves me from buying a new device.

What I want in my device:

But I was very bad at engineering and technology, math and physics. I am Roman Catholic. When I was younger, I watched a lot of Regular Show, Uncle Grandpa, Yugioh and Kakegurui and Harry Potter.

1hgy9bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1hgy9bd/overcoming_call_reluctance/,Overcoming Call Reluctance,"I know anyone here involved in cold call has had **call reluctance**. That moment where the call list is staring you in the face, but suddenly everything else becomes “urgent” – checking emails, making coffee, even scrolling Instagram. It’s normal to feel hesitant or even scared, but it doesn’t have to stop you.   
  
With the right mindset and tools, you can turn that hesitation into action. Here’s how:

# 1. Understand Why Call Reluctance Happens

First off, let’s tackle **why** we feel this way. The big one? **Fear of rejection.** It’s hardwired into us. Back in caveman days, rejection meant isolation, and isolation meant death. That’s not our reality anymore, but our brains still freak out when we hear “no.”

Then there’s **lack of preparation**. If you don’t know your pitch or product, that uncertainty fuels anxiety. And let’s not forget **perfectionism** – waiting for the “perfect time” or the “perfect call” leads to procrastination. Spoiler alert: there’s no such thing as perfect.

# 2. Reframe Rejection

This is a game-changer. A “no” isn’t personal – it’s progress. Every rejection is feedback. It’s data. The more calls you make, the closer you get to a “yes.”

Adopt the mantra: **“I don’t fail, I learn.”** This mindset is something I teach my son, and it applies to everything in life. You’re not your results. You’re not your sales numbers. You’re the one showing up and improving every day. That’s what counts.

# 3. Preparation = Confidence

Confidence doesn’t come out of thin air. It’s built through preparation.

* **Master your pitch:** Write it down, say it out loud, make it second nature.
* **Anticipate objections:** Know the common ones and practice responses.
* **Research your prospect:** The more you know, the smoother the conversation feels.

Roleplay with colleagues or friends. Trust me, failing in practice is way better than freezing on a live call.

# 4. Build a Pre-Call Routine

Success starts before you even pick up the phone.

* **Move your body:** Quick walk, push-ups, whatever gets the blood flowing.
* **Affirmations:** Pump yourself up with phrases like “I’m here to help,” or my personal favorite, “I’m the king of the world!” (Okay, maybe keep that one in your head.)
* **Visualization:** Picture the call going smoothly, the prospect saying “yes,” and the sale closing.

Pro athletes use these techniques for a reason – they work.

# 5. Shift Your Focus from You to Them

A huge mindset shift: **It’s not about you.** Your prospect won’t remember you in 5 minutes. The call is about them – their problems, their needs, and how you can help.

Ask yourself:

* What value am I bringing to this person?
* How can I make their day or business better?

When you’re focused on serving instead of selling, the pressure fades.

# 6. Break the Cycle of Hesitation

Hesitation is fear’s best friend. The longer you wait to dial, the scarier it feels. Try this:

* **3-2-1-Go:** Count backward, hit “dial,” and commit to the first 30 seconds. Once you start, momentum takes over.

Fear thrives on inaction, so punch it in the face by taking immediate action.

# 7. Celebrate Small Wins

Confidence grows with progress, not perfection. Set achievable goals:

* “I’ll make 10 calls today, no matter what.”
* “I’ll handle 3 objections smoothly.”

Track every win, no matter how small. Did someone stay on the line longer? Did you overcome an objection? That’s a win.

# Final Thoughts

Call reluctance is normal, but it doesn’t have to own you. Reframe rejection. Prepare like a pro. Build routines that hype you up. And remember – it’s not about you; it’s about them.

Looking for advice, mainly about whether I should persevere or return my z10. 

My husband and I are predominantly black coffee drinkers and I recently replaced Delonghi primadonna with the Z10. I also have an oracle touch which mainly gets used for guests who want milky coffees and the occasional espresso for me. I thought the Jura could essentially replace both machines giving decent espressos and milky drinks even if not quite to the standard of the oracle. 

 I’ve been really disappointed at both the quality of espresso and the milk foam texture in comparison to the oracle, so have decided to keep it for those. 

However, the kicker is that I don’t find the americanos particularly great from the Jura either so am now thinking of purchasing a Fellow Aiden for morning filter coffee - but that then means 3 chunky coffee machines out on work bench (and while my husband is a patient man, I’m not sure how he’d like this as someone who does not enjoy clutter!). It would essentially be used for guests who milk based coffees when I don’t have time for oracle. 

I’ve tried on the usual (different beans, dialling in according to James Hoffman video, changing temp/grind size/volumes, etc) but to say I’m underwhelmed is an understatement. Anything else I should try before I look into returning?",1,1734514713.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

I've had two in total—one got scratched, so I replaced it with the 10th gen Paperwhite, which I'm still using today. I used to be an avid reader, especially on Kindle, but lately, time has been tight. I manage about 8-10 books a year now, a mix of Kindle, paperback, and audiobooks. Gone are the days of keeping my Kindle in my pocket, reading while waiting for the bus or sipping coffee. Now it sits on a shelf for months until I find a book to read on it, then it makes a brief stay on my nightstand before being shelved again when I'm done.

I do think Amazon shares some of the blame for my waning interest in Kindle. My first Kindle was a game-changer—it felt like the best purchase I’d ever made. It was affordable (especially as a student), and books were often cheap or free. Sure, it was tied to Amazon’s ecosystem, but I could sideload books, which was a big deal since Kindle wasn't officially available in my country. As someone who values open software, that bothered me a bit, but not enough to switch to something else back then.

These days, though, the restrictions are harder to ignore. I recently lost all my sideloaded books after a software update—books I’d gathered over the years with no backups elsewhere. Amazon's cloud backup is great for books bought through them, but it doesn't help with the ones I actually want to keep. And the Kindle library itself? It's frustrating that I can’t organize my collection properly, like creating folders.

Anyway, enough of my venting. Here’s my question for those of you who are still keeping tabs on the e-reader scene: Is there a good alternative out there? Here’s what I’m looking for, and what I don’t really care about. I’m even open to jailbreaking if it offers a better solution and saves me from buying a new device.

What I want in my device:

* Don't delete the books I load.
* Cloud backup is nice, but if that’s too much to ask, at least give me the ability to build a solution with my own service (Google Drive, OneDrive, or my own server).

Earlier in the day I hadn’t had much aside from an afternoon bagel. Even before I finished the meal I could feel things weren’t exactly feeling right.

We were down for a planning-to-move visit recently and I tested out the various cycle routes (north, south and west), but never got around to the Worcestor quiet street to Linwood pool section, or the east at all tbh

I've been cycling to work for about 15 years in Auckland, Vancouver and Amsterdam and cycle my 5yo on my (electric) longtail to school every day before heading to the office in Auckland CBD, my version of cycling is ""pleasurable and slow"". Current commute is Grafton to Wynyard Quarter along a mix of bus lanes, separated cycleways, stretches of 'busy' roads I'm comfortable with, parks and shared spaces. I'm not opposed to (slow and polite!) footpath riding where required, especially with the little one if that opens up any options!

Christchurch roads are very different to Auckland (so wide, so flat) that it makes it difficult to anticipate which roads are going to be busy with impatient drivers and which aren't, so specific routes/sections I'd be keen for insight on are:

* Worcestor Street from Woodham to Linwood - looks plenty wide for cars to pass, but is it chaos at peak hours? People from Shirley are driving down Gloucester instead surely?
* Is there a good (or least bad)  place to cross Linwood ave?
   * At worcester it looks.... weird
   * Gloucester right turn off Linwood ave at light/ped phases seem ok?
   * Does a long bike fit in the little pedestrian islands at Tancred/England?
* What is the best connection overall to the Worcestor quiet street at England Street?
* Is the section of Worcestor between Fitzgerald and Latimer Square quiet or a deathtrap?
* Realistic option to take the north side of the Avon (river road) and riding the quiet route to Victoria Square?
* Is Woodham -> Avonside -> Kilmore is as much of a deathtrap as it looks?
* Does anyone cycle the length of Linwood generally and have thoughts? e.g. getting to the Pool or (shudder) the Mall

Bonus question - any favourite (short) weekend rides that end at a really nice coffee shop? LIttle Pom's looks like a good one, but wondering about hidden gems accessible via the red zone/river.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your overall health and well-being. Understanding how much water you should be drinking daily can dramatically affect your physical and mental state. Here are ten reasons that make knowing this information essential for a healthier life.

### 1. Regulates Bodily Functions

Your body is about 60% water, and maintaining this balance helps regulate essential bodily functions. These include digestion, circulation, and even temperature control. By knowing how much water you should be drinking, you can ensure that these processes run smoothly.

### 2. Boosts Energy Levels

Feeling fatigued or sluggish? It could be due to dehydration. Water plays a vital role in transporting nutrients to your cells. When you're properly hydrated, you boost your energy levels and improve your overall performance.

### 3. Aids Digestion

Drinking enough water aids in the digestive process. It helps break down food so that your body can absorb nutrients more efficiently. Proper hydration can also prevent constipation. Make it a habit to drink enough water, especially during meals, to support a healthy digestive system.

### 4. Supports Weight Management

Wondering how to manage your weight effectively? Water can be your best friend. Sometimes, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger, leading us to eat when we really just need a drink. Staying hydrated helps control your appetite and can even enhance your metabolism.

### 5. Enhances Skin Health

Your skin is the largest organ in your body and is also highly dependent on hydration. Drinking enough water can improve your skin's elasticity, reduce fine lines, and give you a healthy glow. If you want to maintain youthful and vibrant skin, understanding your water needs is imperative.

### 6. Improves Cognitive Function

Did you know that hydration affects your brain function? Studies show that even mild dehydration can impair your mood, concentration, and overall cognitive performance. Staying hydrated keeps your mind sharp and enhances your ability to think clearly.

### 7. Promotes Healthy Joints

Your joints require lubrication to function correctly. Water acts as a lubricant for your joints, preventing injuries and discomfort. Understanding how much water you should be drinking daily can help keep your joints healthy and pain-free, especially if you are active.

### 8. Regulates Body Temperature

Water plays a crucial role in regulating your body temperature. During physical activities or hot weather, staying hydrated helps reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses. Knowing how much water to consume can help you maintain a stable body temperature, allowing you to perform at your best.

### 9. Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys are essential for filtering waste from your blood. Drinking enough water ensures that they work efficiently. Proper hydration helps prevent kidney stones and urinary tract infections.

The Role of Hydration in Maintaining Energy Levels
--------------------------------------------------

When it comes to feeling energized throughout your day, hydration plays a crucial role that many often overlook. You may be wondering how much water you should be drinking to keep your energy levels high. Staying well-hydrated can significantly affect your performance at work, during exercise, and even in your daily activities. By keeping your body well-hydrated, you can enhance both physical and mental functioning.

So why is hydration key to maintaining energy levels? Let’s explore the various ways in which drinking enough water makes a difference.

### 1. Regulating Body Temperature

Water aids in regulating body temperature. When you’re hydrated, your body's ability to cool down through sweating improves, preventing fatigue caused by overheating.

### 2. Supporting Cellular Function

Every cell in your body requires water to function efficiently. When you're hydrated, nutrients flow better in and out of cells, leading to optimal energy production and reducing fatigue.

### 3. Enhancing Brain Function

Your brain is highly sensitive to dehydration. Even mild dehydration can impair your focus, increase fatigue, and hinder your cognitive abilities. Drinking enough water maintains sharpness and clarity, which is essential for effective daily functioning.

### 4. Improving Digestion

Water is essential for digestion and nutrient absorption. Adequate hydration prevents constipation and ensures that essential nutrients reach your body’s cells, providing the energy you need. When your digestive system is functioning smoothly, you feel less sluggish.

### 5. Boosting Metabolism

Studies show that drinking water can temporarily boost your metabolism, helping your body to burn calories more efficiently. When you're hydrated, your body is more capable of performing metabolic functions that convert food into energy, leading to increased vitality.

### 6. Reducing Feelings of Hunger

Often, feelings of hunger are misinterpreted signals your body sends when it's actually dehydrated. By drinking enough water, you can reduce unwanted snacking caused by hunger pangs, allowing you to maintain sustained energy levels throughout the day without unnecessary caloric intake.

### 7. Enhancing Physical Performance

Hydration is particularly crucial for those who are active. Not only does water help in preventing cramps and injuries, but it also allows you to perform better in workouts, leading to a boost in energy levels. Studies suggest that being even slightly dehydrated can result in noticeable declines in physical performance.

### 8. Proper Nutrient Transfer

Water is necessary for the transportation of nutrients in your bloodstream. A lack of hydration can influence the distribution of vitamins and minerals, leading to feelings of fatigue. Ensuring proper hydration supports nutrient delivery, thus enhancing energy levels.

### 9. Managing Stress

Dehydration can amplify stress levels. When you’re stressed, your body requires more hydration to manage the hormones released in response to stress. Drinking enough water can help mitigate feelings of anxiety and improve overall mood, contributing to higher energy levels.

### 10. Supporting Joint Health

Water lubricates your joints, keeping them functioning well. Joint discomfort can lead to a feeling of lethargy, as it may reduce your willingness to move and be active. By maintaining sufficient hydration, you can support joint health, making you feel more energetic and eager to engage in physical activities.

More water into your daily routine doesn’t have to be daunting. Here are a few tips:

- Carry a reusable water bottle to track your intake.

Remember, the right amount of water can lead you to a brighter, more energetic day.

How Water Intake Affects Your Skin and Appearance
-------------------------------------------------

Drinking enough water is crucial, not just for overall health but also for your skin and appearance. Let’s explore how proper hydration can positively influence your skin, making you look and feel radiant.

### The Role of Hydration in Skin Health

Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it thrives on hydration. When you drink water, it helps maintain skin elasticity and keeps the skin barrier intact. This aids in preventing dryness and flakiness, which can make your skin appear aged and dull.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### How Water Affects Your Complexion

Staying properly hydrated can enhance your complexion significantly. Here are a few ways water supports a glowing skin:

- **Reduces Inflammation:** Water helps to flush out toxins that contribute to inflammation. This reduction can lead to fewer breakouts and a more even skin tone.
- **Boosts Blood Circulation:** Proper hydration improves blood flow, delivering essential nutrients to skin cells. This results in a vibrant and healthy appearance.
- **Maintains pH Balance:** Hydration helps balance the skin's pH levels, promoting smoother skin and fewer blemishes.

### Combatting Signs of Aging

As you age, your skin loses elasticity and moisture. Consuming adequate water can slow down this natural process. Water hydrates the skin from the inside out, helping to minimize fine lines and wrinkles. When you are well-hydrated, your skin reflects light better and appears plumper, giving you a youthful glow.

### Improves Skin Conditions

Many skin conditions can be exacerbated by dehydration. Drinking water daily can help alleviate symptoms related to:

- **Dry Skin:** Insufficient hydration leads to dryness. By increasing your water intake, your skin can retain moisture better.
- **Psoriasis and Eczema:** These conditions can be worsened by dryness. Hydration is key to keeping the skin barrier functioning normally.
- **Acne:** Staying hydrated can help reduce excess oil production, lowering your chances of breakouts.

### Boosting Skin's Elasticity

Water is essential for maintaining skin elasticity. When you’re adequately hydrated, your skin retains its firmness, resulting in a more toned and lifted look. In contrast, dehydration can lead to sagging and a lack of structure in the skin.

### Getting that Dewy Look

Many people aspire to have dewy skin. Drinking enough water enhances your skin’s natural glow. When your skin cells are properly hydrated, they reflect light more effectively, resulting in a fresh, dewy complexion.

### Hydration and Lifestyle Factors

While drinking enough water is crucial, factors such as diet and environmental conditions also play a role in skin health. Here’s how they interact with hydration:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Diet:** fruits and vegetables with high water content can enhance your hydration levels. Foods like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon are excellent options.
- **Weather:** Cold or hot weather can impact your skin’s hydration. In winter, heated indoor air can dry out your skin. Make sure to drink water consistently in all climates.
- **Exercise:** Physical activity causes you to lose water through sweat. It’s vital to replenish that lost fluid by drinking more water.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Now that you know how water intake affects your skin, here are some practical tips to boost your hydration:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a reusable bottle handy reminds you to take sips throughout the day.
- **Set Daily Goals:** Aim for a specific amount of water daily. A common guideline is about 8-10 glasses, but your needs might vary.
- **Infuse Water:** If plain water isn’t enticing enough, try adding slices of your favorite fruits or herbs.

These habits into your daily routine not only enhances your hydration but also leads to healthier, more beautiful skin. So, remember: every sip counts toward maintaining that radiant glow!

Common Myths About Water Consumption Debunked
---------------------------------------------

Water is essential to our health, but many myths surround how much we should drink daily and the effects of hydration. Understanding these common misconceptions can help you make informed choices about your water consumption.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Drinking Eight Glasses a Day is a Must

One of the most prevalent myths is the notion that everyone needs to drink eight glasses of water each day. This recommendation is a general guideline and doesn’t take individual differences into account. Factors like age, gender, activity level, and climate can significantly influence your hydration needs. If you engage in physical activities or live in a hot climate, you may need more water, while sedentary individuals might require less.

### Thirst is a Sign of Dehydration

Many believe that feeling thirsty means you are already dehydrated. In reality, thirst is your body’s natural signal that it needs hydration. While it’s important to drink water throughout the day, waiting until you're thirsty isn’t inherently a bad thing. Just make sure to listen to your body, especially during exercise or hot conditions.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### All Beverages Count Towards Hydration

Some assume that only water counts toward their daily hydration. While water is indeed the best choice for hydration, other beverages do contribute to your fluid intake. Herbal teas, milk, and even coffee can help you stay hydrated. However, sugary or alcoholic drinks may dehydrate you, so it’s wise to moderate these.

### Clear Urine Means You Are Perfectly Hydrated

Another common belief is that clear urine is the only indicator of proper hydration. While light yellow urine does indicate good hydration, clear urine might mean you are over-hydrated. The ideal is to aim for a light pale yellow color, as this suggests a balanced hydration level. Regularly monitoring your urine color can help you adjust your water intake accordingly.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Drinking More Water Will Always Boost Your Energy

It’s often thought that drinking excessive amounts of water will provide an energy boost. While staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy levels, overconsumption can have the opposite effect by diluting essential electrolytes and leading to potential health issues. The key is finding balance; drink enough water to feel energized, but don’t overdo it.

### Water Intake Doesn’t Change with Weather

Many people believe their hydration needs remain constant throughout the year. In warmer months or during hot weather, your body loses more fluids through sweat. Therefore, your water consumption should increase in warmer conditions to prevent dehydration. Stay mindful of your body’s signals and increase your intake as needed.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Sports Drinks Are Always Necessary for Hydration

Sports drinks are marketed as excellent sources for hydration, leading some to believe they are essential after exercise. However, if you engage in light to moderate activity, plain water is usually sufficient. Sports drinks contain sugars and electrolytes that may only be necessary for intense workouts or prolonged activities lasting over an hour. For everyday hydration, water is typically the best choice.

### Drinking Water Before Meals Will Sabotage Your Appetite

Some people worry that drinking water before meals can reduce their appetite and hinder digestion. In fact, drinking water before a meal can help you feel fuller and assist with portion control. Staying hydrated aids digestion and may even enhance nutrient absorption. Feel free to sip water before meals without worry.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### You Can’t Overhydrate

Although it’s important to drink enough water, many believe that overhydration is a myth. In reality, too much water can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, where sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low. This underscores why it’s important to hydrate according to your body’s needs rather than adhering to rigid guidelines.

### Water Doesn’t Have Any Impact on Your Skin

A misconception persists that water consumption has no effect on skin health. Staying hydrated plays a role in maintaining skin elasticity and moisture. Proper hydration can contribute to a healthy, glowing complexion, although it isn’t a substitute for a good skincare routine.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
By dispelling these common myths, you can better understand how much water you should be drinking daily and its impact on your overall health. Listen to your body, adjust your intake as needed, and enjoy the many benefits of staying properly hydrated.

Tips for Increasing Your Daily Water Intake Effortlessly
--------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is important for your overall health. If you’re wondering how you can drink more water each day without turning it into a chore, here are some practical tips that can help you effortlessly increase your daily water intake.

### Set Reminders

Sometimes, life gets busy, and you might forget to drink water. Setting reminders on your phone or using apps designed to track water intake can be beneficial. You can schedule alerts every hour to remind you to take a sip. This little change can significantly boost your hydration levels.

### Carry a Water Bottle

Make it a habit to carry a reusable water bottle wherever you go. When you have water within arm’s reach, you’re more likely to sip throughout the day. Choose a bottle with measurements so you can track how much you’ve consumed. Some people find that they drink more when they can see their progress.

### Infuse Your Water

If plain water doesn’t excite you, try infusing it with fruits, herbs, or vegetables. Here are some refreshing combinations:

### Use a Straw

Believe it or not, using a straw can make drinking water more enjoyable. Many people find that they drink more water when they use a straw because it requires less effort. It can also make sipping feel more like a casual activity rather than a chore.

### Join a Challenge

Participating in a hydration challenge is a fun way to motivate yourself and others. You can join online groups or social media communities where people encourage each other to meet their daily water intake goals. This adds an element of accountability and support.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Set Goals

Setting specific, measurable goals can help motivate you to drink more water. For example, aim for 8 glasses a day or an equivalent amount, based on your weight and activity level. Writing these goals down can act as a reminder and create a sense of accomplishment as you reach them.

Implementing these tips can drastically improve your water intake. Remember, the key to staying hydrated is to make drinking water a seamless part of your everyday life. You’ll soon discover how much better you feel when your body gets the hydration it needs.

### Conclusion

Making sure you drink enough water each day is vital for your overall health and well-being. Understanding ""how much water should I be drinking a day"" helps set the foundation for a healthier lifestyle.

1hgxzk9,https://i.redd.it/5l9ejo8esk7e1.jpeg,6 weeks rest for manhattan coffees not enough? ,"I just opened a bag of Letty Bermudez from MCR that was roasted on the 4th of nov. it was good and all and I got the tasting notes of peach candy. However there was an underlying flavor of roast. Like when you brew a light roast  that was roasted a few days ago. I recon it still needs rest but only because I’m comparing it with the Pepe Jijon coffee from Manhattan that I allowed to rest for 8 weeks and it was night and day difference from 3w to 8w when did a blind tasting. The 8w cup was very smooth and sweet while the 3w had a bitter and roast underlying taste in the finish. Maybe I’m just picky I don’t know. However I guess I should allow the Letty B to rest for more? I figure since it went through an advanced fermentation it needs longer than the Pepe Jijon that was just washed.  

A friend of mine who is a micro roaster  mentioned to me that manhattan used a Typhoon roaster and that they roast at crazy high constant temp for a very short time which in his opinion means they need a rest period of 5-7 w minimum due to that. That would explain the vast difference in taste I experience from the Pepe coffee. Anyhow, anyone else experienced this? I know that some of you rest manhattan for 2-4 weeks and there is nothing wrong with that. I’m not sure there is a right or wrong here.",4,1734513915.0,pourover,12,1.0,False

1hgxrcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/uaelaw/comments/1hgxrcb/spotting_bad_lawyers/,Spotting Bad Lawyers!!!,"Alright, so here's the deal. Debt collection is one of those jobs that *technically* involves lawyers, but let’s be real – it’s not the purest form of legal work. It’s like when you’re at a party and someone says, “Yeah, I’m a lawyer,” but when you ask what kind of law they do, they say, “Debt collection.” Cue the awkward silence. 🙄

**Free Consultations? You Get What You Pay For**  
They offer you a *free* consultation, which sounds great at first. But, uh, here's the thing: the average lawyer makes around AED 75k a month. So if a lawyer is *willing to chit-chat for free*, good luck with that. Either they’re so rich they don’t need to charge, or they’re really just practicing their elevator pitch. 

**Experience? They’re Definitely “Experienced”**  
They tell you they’ve been “working in the Legal Industry” for 15 years, but when you ask them to explain, they say, “I just really like making people uncomfortable about their bounced cheques and jail times.” Classic..” Classic.

**When You Ask for Clarity... They Get Sketchy**  
You try to ask a simple question like, “What exactly are the steps for resolving this issue?” and they respond with, “Listen, I don’t really do *details*... I just get things done.” Oh boy, time to run.

**Retainer Agreement? Nah, We’re Good**  
You ask for a formal agreement, and they tell you, “Yeah, we’re cool. Just pay me, and we’ll shake hands.” Meanwhile, you’re thinking, “I thought we were at a law office, not a bad 90s sitcom.”

**“I Can GUARANTEE This Is Gonna Work!”**  
They promise you'll definitely win your case... because apparently they have a crystal ball. They also guarantee you'll get your money back, and hey, if not, they’ll help you “find a new line of work!” Uh, yeah, that’s *not* how the law works.

**Fast-Action Lawyers Who “Jump” Right In**  
You tell them you have a small issue, and next thing you know, they’re calling the respondent  *before you’ve even finished your coffee*. “I’m just gonna handle it. Don’t worry about it!” Uh... okay, buddy, you’re not getting a 50% commission on this, are you?

If any of these sound familiar, you might be dealing with a debt collection lawyer who’s less “lawyer” and more “guy who files bounced cheques for a living.” Just be careful – there’s nothing worse than realizing your lawyer is a “collectible” himself. 😅

1hgxr6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1hgxr6k/i_knew_there_was_something_off_about_my_new/,I knew there was something off about my new employer but I didn’t expect this,"The first time I saw the Bluefin Diner, it was exactly the kind of place I expected to find in a wasteland like this. Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",1,1734512771.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",2,1734512736.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home.

There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",2,1734512710.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints.

I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints.

I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the lake.",2,1734512671.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1hgxq6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1hgxq6g/i_knew_there_was_something_off_about_my_new/,I knew there was something off about my new employer but I didn’t expect this,"The first time I saw the Bluefin Diner, it was exactly the kind of place I expected to find in a wasteland like this. Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror.

A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come.

1hgxpvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1hgxpvd/the_night_shift_at_bluefin_diner/,The Night Shift at Bluefin Diner,"The first time I saw the Bluefin Diner, it was exactly the kind of place I expected to find in a wasteland like this. Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",2,1734512524.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner.

The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read:

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",2,1734512492.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror.

Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).",2,1734512459.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1hgxo21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hgxo21/i_knew_there_was_something_off_about_my_new/,I knew there was something off about my new employer but I didn’t expect this,"The first time I saw the Bluefin Diner, it was exactly the kind of place I expected to find in a wasteland like this. Route 66 stretched ahead like a ribbon of asphalt through the barren desert, the air shimmering with heat under the relentless afternoon sun. The road seemed endless, with nothing but barren land and the occasional cactus breaking the monotony. It was the kind of desolation that made you feel small, insignificant, just another speck in the vastness of the universe.

I’d been on the move for weeks, drifting from town to town, with nothing but my old duffel bag and a sense of hollowness that had settled in my chest like a stone. After losing my job and falling out with the few friends I had, it felt like there was nothing left for me anywhere. The nights were the hardest-sleepless hours spent staring at motel ceilings, wondering if I would ever find a place where I belonged. I had no family to turn to, and each new town was just another place to pass through, another attempt to escape the emptiness inside. I have no family, no friends, and no place to call home. The kind of person who could disappear without a trace, and no one would even notice. It was as if I was a ghost already, drifting aimlessly, waiting for anything to give me a reason to stay.

When I pulled into the parking lot, there wasn’t a soul in sight … just a faded sign hanging by a single rusty chain that read 'Help Wanted' and an old gas pump out front that looked like it hadn’t worked in decades. The diner itself looked like it had been forgotten by time, the paint peeling, the windows dusty and streaked. It was a relic of a bygone era, a place that seemed to exist out of sheer stubbornness.

I paused for a moment, staring at the sign. Maybe this was what I needed. I had nowhere else to go, no direction, just a longing for a place to belong, even if just for a few nights. The thought of having something to do, even if it was just washing dishes or sweeping floors, was enough to make me consider it. I pushed the thought away, taking a deep breath, and made my way inside, the bell above the door chiming softly as I stepped inside.

The dim interior was a mix of peeling wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and flickering neon lights that cast eerie shadows across the empty booths. The air was thick with the smell of grease and old coffee, a mix that clung to my senses, making my stomach turn slightly. A single man stood behind the counter, his face lined and weathered, with hollow eyes that seemed to look right through me. He was the owner, though he never bothered to tell me his name.

I hesitated for a moment before making my way to a booth in the corner. I slid into the cracked vinyl seat, the material sticking to my skin as I settled in. The owner watched me, his expression unreadable, his hollow eyes following my every move as if sizing me up.

After a moment, he shuffled over, a notepad in hand. ""What'll it be?"" he asked, his voice gruff, his tone making it clear he wasn't interested in small talk.

I glanced at the faded menu lying on the table, the pages yellowed with age and stained with coffee rings. There wasn't much to choose from, and everything looked like it had been there since the place first opened. ""Just a coffee, please,"" I replied, offering a small, tentative smile, though I doubted it would make any difference.

He nodded, turning away without a word. I watched as he moved behind the counter, the sound of the coffee machine breaking the silence. It felt strange, almost surreal, sitting there in the empty diner, the hum of the old refrigerator the only other noise. The neon sign outside flickered, casting brief flashes of red and blue across the room, adding to the sense of unease that seemed to permeate the place.

He returned a moment later, setting the chipped mug in front of me. I wrapped my hands around it, savoring the warmth, even if the coffee itself tasted burnt and bitter. It was something tangible, something to hold on to in the unsettling quiet of the diner.

""Thanks,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. He gave a curt nod, his eyes lingering on me for a moment longer before he turned away, his footsteps echoing across the empty floor as he retreated behind the counter. I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, even when his back was turned.

I cleared my throat, pointing towards the sign outside. ""You hiring?"" I asked, my voice sounding smaller than I intended, the words barely carrying across the empty room.

He looked at me for a moment, his gaze weighing on me, then nodded slowly, as if the decision wasn’t really his to make, as if he was resigned to whatever fate had brought me here.

""Need a job?"" he asked, his voice flat and devoid of any warmth, like he had heard the same request a hundred times before and knew how it would end.

I nodded. The truth was, I needed money-enough to get me out of this place, to the next town, and maybe a little further. He didn’t ask any questions, didn’t want to know where I was from or what had brought me here. He just nodded back, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, like he understood more than he was letting on.

“Ok. You'll start tonight,” he muttered, his voice carrying a hint of something I couldn't quite place-was it pity, or maybe just indifference?

He hesitated for a moment, then gestured for me to follow him. “Let me show you around,” he said, his voice still gruff but with a hint of resignation, as if he knew that neither of us had much of a choice in the matter.

I got up from the booth, the seat creaking as I stood, and followed him through the diner. He moved slowly, pointing out the essentials with a practiced efficiency, his voice a monotonous drone as he spoke. “The counter, where you'll be serving. Coffee machine-temperamental, but it works if you treat it right. Kitchen's back here,” he said, pushing open the swinging door to reveal a grimy room filled with old pots and pans. His words were clipped, like he was simply going through the motions.

There was a weariness to him, an exhaustion that seemed to seep into every word he spoke. He showed me the storage room, the restrooms, and even the back exit, his explanations brief and to the point. There was no warmth in his words, no attempt to make me feel at ease. Just the basics, like he’d done this before, like he knew I wouldn't be here long.

After a while, he turned back to the front, pausing by the door. “That’s about it. Good luck, kid,” he said, his hollow eyes meeting mine for a brief moment. There was something in his gaze, something unsaid, but before I could make sense of it, he grabbed his coat from behind the counter and walked out, the door closing with a jingle of the bell.

I watched him disappear into the night, something about the way he’d said those words making my skin prickle. There was an emptiness in the diner now, a void that seemed to expand in his absence. But I ignored it. I needed this. I needed something to keep me grounded, even if it was just for a little while.

I walked around the diner, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the cracked vinyl booths, and the flickering neon lights that cast an eerie glow over everything. There was something unsettling about the place, something that felt… wrong, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was just the isolation, the sense of being completely cut off from the rest of the world.

I went to the kitchen in the back, a grimy little room filled with pots and pans that had seen better days. The air was thick with the scent of stale grease and something metallic, and I could hear the faint drip of water echoing from a leaking pipe. The floor creaked under my weight, and every surface seemed to carry a layer of grime that spoke of years of neglect. There was a window above the sink, looking out over the parking lot and beyond that, a lake. It was the only thing that broke the monotony of the desert, a dark, still body of water that seemed to go on forever.

I settled in behind the counter, a cup of lukewarm coffee in front of me as I tried to stay awake. The hours dragged on, the silence pressing in on me, until I heard it : a soft, haunting melody, drifting through the air.

At first, I thought it might have been the wind, but as the sound grew clearer, I realized it wasn't natural. There was a rhythm to it, an eerie beauty that seemed almost deliberate. It tugged at something inside me, urging me to move, to follow. I frowned, looking around, but there was no one else in the diner. The sound seemed to be coming from outside, from the direction of the lake. I glanced out the window, catching a glimpse of the dark water. The lake lay still, its surface unnaturally smooth, reflecting the pale light of the moon. It looked almost lifeless, an expanse of inky black that seemed to swallow all light and sound. There was something about it that made my skin crawl, a sense of wrongness that I couldn't quite shake.

I shook my head, trying to ignore it, but the melody grew louder, more insistent, until I found myself standing up, my feet moving almost as if they had a mind of their own. It was as if the sound was pulling me, dragging me towards the door, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step outside and find its source. I walked to the door, my hand reaching for the handle, when something caught my eye . A crumpled note, stuffed inside the lining of one of the cracked vinyl booth seats, the tear just big enough to hide it.

The paper was creased, torn at the edges, and in scrawled handwriting, it read: 

Do not, under any circumstances, go near the lake.

If you see wet footprints leading from the lake to the diner, clean them immediately with hot water.

If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work.

The diner lights must remain dim but never off.

I looked back at the door, the melody still calling to me, but I forced myself to step back, to sit down. I couldn’t explain it, but something about the note felt true.

The note was unsigned, but I felt a chill run down my spine as I read it. The old man hadn’t mentioned any of this. As I looked at the stains, the smudges of dark red that could only be blood, I felt something twist inside me … a sense that this wasn’t just some elaborate joke.

As dawn broke, I saw the owner return, his hollow eyes glancing at me without a word. He looked more tired than before, his gaze lingering on me for a moment longer than seemed necessary. He didn’t ask if I’d heard anything, didn’t seem to care how my shift went.

I watched him for a moment, wondering what secrets lay behind those tired eyes, before returning to my car to tried and get some sleep. Exhaustion weighed heavy on me, but sleep was elusive. When I finally dozed off, I dreamed I was drowning in the nearby lake, the dark water wrapping around me, pulling me under while the haunting melody echoed all around, muffled and relentless. I jolted awake, my heart pounding, the fear lingering even as I tried to shake it off. It wasn't much, but it was all I had-a few hours of uneasy rest before the next night began.

I found an old, half-stale sandwich that tasted like cardboard, and washed it down with a cup of coffee so bitter it almost made me gag. I forced it down anyway, needing the energy.

The next night was different.

I was wiping down the counter, the old man gone home for the night, leaving me alone in the dimly lit diner. The air was thick, the oppressive silence broken only by the faint buzz of the flickering neon sign outside. It was almost one in the morning, and the road outside was empty . Nothing but darkness stretching into oblivion.

The hum of the old refrigerator seemed to grow louder in the quiet, a low, unsettling drone that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. I could hear the occasional creak of the building settling, the soft rustle of something brushing against the outside walls , maybe the wind, or maybe something else. The air felt colder now, the chill creeping in, making me shiver.

I decided to take a break from the unnerving quiet and clean the restrooms. I grabbed a rag and some cleaning supplies and made my way to the back. The restrooms were just as grimy as the rest of the diner, the tiles cracked and stained, the mirror above the sink coated in a layer of grime that made my reflection look ghostly. I scrubbed at the sink and wiped down the counters, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that seemed to be pressing in on me. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, each drop seeming louder than the last.

When I finally finished, I took a deep breath and made my way back to the front of the diner. But as soon as I stepped out of the restroom, my heart froze. There, on the floor, were wet footprints. I dropped the rag I was holding, the sound of it hitting the ground barely registering in my ears. The footprints led from the door, across the diner floor, and toward the counter where I stood. They were elongated, almost human but not quite, with webbed impressions that suggested something unnatural. My heart pounded as I backed away, my eyes tracing the eerie shape, each step seeming deliberate, as if whatever made them had been searching for me.

I remembered the second rule : clean them immediately with hot water. My heart pounded in my chest as I rushed to the back, my footsteps echoing through the empty diner. I fumbled with the bucket, my hands trembling as I turned on the tap, the hot water rushing out and steaming up in the cold air of the kitchen. Every second felt like an eternity, the feeling of something closing in on me growing stronger. I could almost sense eyes watching, waiting. I filled the bucket to the brim, the hot water scalding my hands as I picked it up, my grip shaky.

As I hurried back to the front, my nerves got the best of me. I stumbled, the bucket slipping from my grip, hot water sloshing over the sides and splashing across the floor. Panic surged through me, my breath catching in my throat as I scrambled to pick it up. The scalding water burned my hands, but I barely felt the pain . My only focus was on those wet footprints. They were growing darker, spreading across the floor like an ink stain, each print more defined, more deliberate. It was as if whatever had made them was gaining strength, its presence becoming more real, more solid.

I grabbed the rag, my hands trembling as I dipped it into the bucket and began scrubbing at the prints. The hot water steamed as it hit the floor, the vapor rising around me like a fog. I swore I heard something-a hiss, low and menacing, like the sound of steam escaping from a valve. It was followed by a whisper, faint but unmistakable, as if something was speaking to me, taunting me.

I scrubbed harder, my breath coming in ragged gasps, the fear clawing at my insides. The footprints slowly began to fade, the dark impressions dissolving under the hot water, but the feeling of being watched only grew stronger. My eyes darted to the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing-only darkness and my own reflection, pale and terrified. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me. I spun around, my heart in my throat, but there was nothing there … only the empty diner, silent and still.

I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me, refusing to let go. It was as if the darkness itself was alive, pressing in on me, waiting for me to slip up, to make a mistake. By the time I was done, the diner felt colder, the air heavy and oppressive, the silence almost deafening. I set the bucket down, my hands aching from the burns, and took a step back, staring at the floor. The footprints were gone, but the sense of unease remained, an invisible weight pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. Something wrong was going on here and I knew this wasn't the last time I would see something like this.

I glanced at the windows, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but there was nothing …just darkness and my own reflection, pale and frightened. For a brief moment, I thought I saw movement in the reflection, a flicker of something shifting behind me, but when I turned, there was nothing there. I forced myself to breathe, to calm down, but the fear lingered, gnawing at me.

When the owner came in to begin his shift, I told him about the strange things that had been happening : the footprints, the whispers, the movement in the reflection. He listened with an expression that seemed almost indifferent, his eyes tired and hollow. When I finished, he let out a long sigh and shook his head.

""You’re just tired,"" he said dismissively, his voice flat. ""Working nights can mess with your mind. You start imagining things, seeing things that aren't there."" He gave me a half-hearted smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""Get some rest. You'll feel better.""

His response left me feeling uneasy, like he knew more than he was letting on. There was something in the way he spoke, the way he avoided my gaze, that made my skin crawl. But I nodded, forcing a smile, pretending to believe him. Deep down, I knew what I had experienced wasn't just in my head. Something was wrong with this place, and he knew it.

I told him that I was only staying for this night and expected to get paid tomorrow morning so I could leave. He gave me a strange look, then smirked, his eyes cold. ""Sure, kid,"" he said, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. ""Tonight will be your last night."" I tried to rest during the day, catching whatever sleep I could. It wasn't much…if someone could even call it sleep but it was just enough to get me through the final night.

The following night brought a darker, heavier atmosphere to the diner. Shadows pooled in every corner, stretching long across the floors, as if something unseen was lurking within them. I held my breath, the silence thick, waiting for the familiar yet dreadful sounds that had haunted my nights here. Suddenly, the jukebox crackled to life without warning, spilling out a warped, haunting melody that didn’t belong in this world. The song was unrecognizable, distorted-echoed off the walls, grating against my mind like nails on a chalkboard. I rushed toward it, fingers fumbling over the buttons, desperate to shut it off. But the buttons wouldn't respond, as if they were locked in place. No matter what I did, the music only grew louder, more chaotic, each dissonant note stabbing through my head, making it impossible to think. It was as if the jukebox itself was alive, feeding off my fear.

Then, I heard it...

It started soft, almost like a gentle brush against the glass, but I knew better. I knew it meant that something was out there : something dangerous, something that had found me and wasn't going to leave until it got what it wanted. The scraping grew louder, more insistent, and with each drag of a nail against the windowpane, I could feel the weight of something… waiting. Rule three echoed in my mind: If you hear scratching on the windows, keep your eyes on your work. Swallowing hard, I forced myself to stare at the counter, at the dishes I was drying, moving my hands in a mindless rhythm to keep myself grounded. My pulse thundered in my ears, but I kept my gaze fixed, my fingers clutching the plates tightly as though they were my lifeline. The scratching continued, scraping deeper into the glass with each pass, filling the silence with a maddening rhythm.

The jukebox went quiet just as abruptly as it had started, and the scratching stopped. The diner fell silent, but I knew the danger hadn’t passed. I let out a slow, shaky breath, my heart still racing. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

A figure stood by the window. Tall and gaunt, with matted hair falling over a face that was half-hidden in shadow, except for its eyes. Those eyes gleamed through the glass, piercing, like they could see straight through me. Its lips curved into a cruel smile, revealing teeth jagged and sharp, too sharp, as if they were meant to tear through something soft and fragile.

My hands trembled as I clutched the counter, fighting the urge to look, to meet those eyes. But I could feel it calling me, its voice slithering into my mind like a twisted lullaby, a hum that carried with it the weight of everything I’d tried to escape. The creature knew me. It whispered my name, my secrets, my regrets, each word laced with venom, each syllable pulling me closer to the breaking point.

Just as I felt myself slipping, the door burst open, slamming against the wall with a force that snapped me back to reality. The old man stood there, his eyes wild, his face twisted in terror. He looked at me, and in that moment, I saw more fear in him than I had ever seen in anyone. His voice trembled as he spoke.

""Sorry, kid,"" he whispered, his words thick with guilt. ""You weren't supposed to make it this far.""

Before I could react, he strode toward the window, his hands shaking as he reached for the latch. My heart sank, fear twisting in my gut as I realized what was happening. He was letting it inside. A thousand thoughts raced through my mind : Why was he doing this, and what would happen if he succeeded? The sense of betrayal and desperation made my pulse quicken, and I felt utterly powerless, my feet glued to the floor as the horror unfolded in front of me.

As the old man’s trembling fingers fumbled with the latch, the creature’s grin widened, its sharp teeth glinting as though it could already taste what was to come. I took a step back, dread coiling in my gut, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t move, my legs frozen in place as the man turned back to me, his face hollow and filled with a strange mix of desperation and surrender.

""I didn’t want this,"" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, as if trying to convince himself more than me. ""But I had no choice. It keeps her satisfied and it keeps me safe.” He swallowed, his voice dropping to a ragged whisper. “But it’s never enough.”

The horror of his words crashed over me. I was just one more in a long line of sacrifices, lured here to save his miserable life. The disgust was overwhelming, but there was no time to think. Behind him, the creature’s fingers curled over the window frame, long and dripping with a dark, murky substance that trailed down the glass like ink.

A rush of panic surged through me. I had to stop him, to prevent whatever horror was clawing its way into the diner. Desperate, I charged at the old man, my body colliding with his as I tried to stop him from opening the window. He grunted, his eyes flashing with a wild fury as he shoved me back. ""You don't understand!"" he shouted, his voice cracking, filled with both fear and anger. He lunged at me, his hands outstretched, trying to pin me down for the creature that was now moving steadily towards us.

We struggled, our bodies crashing into tables and chairs, the metal legs scraping loudly against the floor. His hands wrapped around my wrists, his strength surprising for someone who looked so frail. I could feel his nails digging into my skin, his breath hot and ragged against my face. My heart thundered in my chest as I glanced over his shoulder. The creature was inside now, its twisted form moving with a sickening fluidity, its pale skin glistening, its mouth stretched wide, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth.

With a surge of adrenaline, I twisted my body, managing to free one hand. My fingers scrambled across the counter until they closed around something cold and metallic : a kitchen knife. Without thinking, I plunged it into the old man's side. He let out a choked gasp, his grip loosening as his eyes widened in shock and pain. I pushed him away from me, his body stumbling backward, directly towards the creature.

The creature's eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger as it reached out, its long, wet fingers wrapping around the old man's shoulders. He barely had time to scream before the creature sank its teeth into his neck, the sharp fangs tearing through flesh with a sickening crunch.

His body went rigid, his eyes wide with terror as the creature dragged him down, its teeth still embedded in his neck.

I could see the blood trailing behind them, dark and slick, leaving a gruesome path as it pulled him closer to the open window. His screams echoed through the diner, a desperate, haunting sound that sent shivers down my spine. His eyes locked onto mine one last time, filled with a pleading, terrified look, but there was nothing I could do. He was beyond saving.

They reached the window, and with a final, jerking motion, the creature dragged him into the shadows outside. The old man’s screams were cut off abruptly, leaving only the sound of the creature’s rasping breath and the faint crunch of his body being pulled over the gravel outside. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. My heart hammered as I listened to the horrible, wet sounds fading into the distance.

Without looking back, I turned and ran, my footsteps pounding against the linoleum as I burst through the front door and into the cool night air.

Outside, the world was still and silent, a stark contrast to the chaos I had left behind. The cold air bit into my skin, grounding me as I staggered forward, trying to shake the horrifying images from my mind.

I kept walking, my steps unsteady, my heart still pounding. I started the car and floored it. I had survived, but I knew I would never be the same. Her whispers would always be there, a reminder of what I had faced, of the darkness that lurked just beyond the surface of the [lake](https://www.youtube.com/@HerScreams).

1hgxn8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solasmancers/comments/1hgxn8q/rook_and_the_team_have_no_right_to_judge_solas/,Rook and the Team Have No Right to Judge Solas,"I came across this great [Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/feathersandblue/769781998204190721/so-full-disclosure-i-havent-been-a-solas-fan?source=share) that perfectly articulates something that’s been bothering me for a long time. Like many of us, I feel the companions’ dialogue does Solas a massive injustice—especially during the Regret Murals scenes.

Yes, Solas has done bad things and continues to do them, but the game hyper-focuses on his failures without acknowledging the centuries he’s spent at war, the countless people he’s saved, and the friends he’s lost.

Here’s a snippet from the post:

>""**Only sadly, infuriatingly, in the end, that fallen hero’s ending is put into the hands of a protagonist who judges him from the perspective of someone who has never even stumbled – not because they are wiser, braver, or kinder.** No, just because the writers were gracious – or cowardly? – enough to never let them fail.

>**The game gives Rook a moral high ground which isn’t earned in the slightest because Rook never had to walk even a quarter of a mile in Solas’s shoes.** They don’t know what they would have done in his stead, they have no idea what it actually means to see the sorry shape the world is in and know that it was your hands that shaped it. And even where Rook might actually be culpable – the interruption of Solas’s ritual that freed the remaining Evanuris – anyone is quick to assure Rook that it wasn’t their fault.

>Whatever regrets Rook carries, they’re born from self-doubt and trauma response. Survivor’s guilt, mostly. When compared to Solas’s immense guilt, Rook’s regrets are, for lack of a better term, insignificant. That Rook manages to face them doesn’t mean that they are more truthful or emotionally mature, it just means that Rook’s story is a tale for children and Solas’s is not.

>It’s not that I’m necessarily opposed to the idea that the player decides Solas’s fate through their actions. It’s the injustice of it all that bothers me: The player is led through a game that provides a safe space for their character, one that is devoid of any interpersonal conflict and any ethical quandary. Rooks succeeds through kindness and heroism and taking their companions on team bonding exercises.

>**As if Solas could have won the war against the Evanuris if he’d taken the time to take his companions on coffee dates.""**

I think this really nails the issue: the game sets Solas up as this immensely complex and tragic figure but hands his fate to a protagonist who is never truly challenged or given the chance to understand him on a deeper level.

I highly encourage you all to read the full post—it's worth it. ",29,1734512276.0,Solasmancers,11,0.85,False

1hgxjy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hgxjy7/satan_drones_from_beyond/,Satan Drones from Beyond,"I'd heard about all these drones flying around all over the place. Some people thought they were UFO's. I saw a few of the videos and pictures on the internet, but they just looked like planes to me. Little did I know that I'd soon find out something about those drones. Something evil.

That was about a week ago I guess. It's still going on supposedly, but it was only a few days into the whole affair when I was whisked into the story myself. I'd forgotten all about the news story by then to be honest. I was just sitting there one morning drinking my coffee at the kitchen table and playing Angry Birds on my laptop when I felt a strange sensation in the pit of my stomach.

It felt like that tingling feeling you get in your gut when you go down a drop on a roller-coaster. Only there was no logical reason for it. I thought maybe the coffee was bad so I dumped it out. I use milk as a creamer so I opened up the milk jug and gave the contents a sniff. Didn't smell bad.

Then I heard something. It was a deep vibrating tone. So deep it was barely noticeable but it seemed to cause the spot in my tummy where that feeling was to tremble. I walked around the kitchen a little bit and on one side of the room it seemed to be stronger.

I peeked out the kitchen window there, and above some tall bushes next to the window was something black that looked like a metal pole that might be part of some kind of lawn equipment. I couldn't see what it was attached to because the bush was in the way.

""Oh, that damn Perry Goodmyer,"" I said out loud, ""he's always trimming and edging his dang lawn. Think I'll have a word with him.""

When I opened the front door of the house and stepped outside, the tone and the sensation got a bit stronger. I closed the door behind me and trounced across the grass and rounded the corner of the house to get a look at Perry's latest contraption.

I was expecting some kind of wood chipper for branches but when I saw what was there I stopped dead in my tracks and just stared for a moment, stunned into suspended confusion.

It was black in color all over. It had metal poles of some kind protruding out and bending around it's exterior. It wasn't obvious what they were for. It's over all appearance reminded me of a bug, only this thing was the size of an SUV. Just like they said on the News. It's body was squarish or more like a rectangular block with all sorts of fins and strange indentations all around it. And it was hovering about three feet off the ground.

The grass just under it was vibrating. You could see it moving. The deep tone was loud and permeated everything. Even my bones felt like they were shaking to the frequency.

But see, the thing is I don't think it was actually a machine at all. It seemed more to me to be mimicking what a machine might look like. There was nothing on it that seemed to have a function. No windows or cameras or antenna. No wings or propellers, or exhaust ports. It was like a floating power transformer but with all kinds of extra junk randomly attached to it.

That wasn't really why I came to believe it wasn't a machine though. It was the feeling it gave off. It literally emitted an emotion and an intent. It was just as strong and obvious that that was what it was doing as the tone was obvious. It was literally broadcasting it's conscious state of mind to everything around it.

It was gut wrenching. The feeling I mean. It was a mixture of total malevolence, total lack of compassion, and a feeling of certain and absolute doom. The thing was an abomination. It was unholy and it knew it.

All I wanted to do was flee, but I was paralyzed in terror and mortification. I couldn't even scream. I just stood there in total dis-empowered helplessness.

It intended me to approach it but I didn't want to. It demanded I walk up to it and touch a small flat area on the side facing me. I started to step forward just to appease it and get some relief from it's incessant psychic demand.

It was buzzing like an old fashioned space heater and the sound was both frightening and sickening. The air felt like static electricity as I got closer. I noticed goose bumps across my arm as I reached out for it. With a gut full of dread I made contact with only the tips of my index and middle fingers.

At that moment and in a single moment, everything seemed to drop away. It's hard to describe. It was like my mind fell downwards through my body, turning me inside out as it did. The world seemed to turn upside down but I knew I was still standing upright and still with my hand on the damned thing.

There were some spiny things on it above where I was touching it which opened up into a circular gaping wound. That's right. Wound. Instead of a hatch or window opening, it presented the same function to me as an injury. I could tell it did so for the sole purpose of disturbing me.

Inside it showed me a vision of horrific suffering. A display of small animals lay inside it's belly. All alive but grotesquely injured. They writhed in pain and strained at getting out. The poor things reached out to me with their paws in desperate hope for salvation. And I wanted to save them. I tried to force myself to thrust my arm into the opening and rescue as many as I could. I pushed hard to move my limbs to do this but they would not budge.

Tears were streaming down my face. I could feel them. Hot air bellowed out of the thing scorching my face like summer day's sun. I strained even harder to move. I had to save at least one of these little guys.

Just as I broke the spell and my arm flung in towards the animals, a large metal device of some kind rotated from the side and brought an anvil sized block of metal down into them, smashing their bodies into a bloody mess before my eyes.

The thing did this just to sicken me. To demoralize me.

I was shaking in fear and absolute terror. Was I next?

Whatever sent this thing was the embodiment of evil. An evil so complete that it had no desire for it's own benefit, like a thief, or even a rapist might have. No, it wasn't out for it's own gain. It's only purpose was to cause harm and suffering. But not merely physical pain, it was more interested in inflicting psychological and emotional pain. It was built specifically to do just that.

I sensed it's satisfaction at my internal response and it began to lift into the air. I fell to the ground and watched it ascend, now utterly bawling my eyes out.

""Don't you ever come back here!"" I shouted between sobs. ""Don't you ever come back, you bastard!""

It rose way up into the sky and then headed Northward until it disappeared behind some trees and I could no longer see it.

I recently saw a video talking about which types had the highest of each stat but I found it unfair since some types (Dragon) had much higher BST compared to others (Bug).

This method gets the percentage of each stat based on the total BST of the Pokémon so types with higher BST wouldn't get a clear advantage. The formula for is very simple:

    Stat Distribution Percentage = (Stat ÷ BST) * 100

Here is the link to the entire spreadsheet where I mapped out all of the Pokémons:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SCVPMH51jEw2EQrcfheN08QQtHhz47ze/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110236286713156336072&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SCVPMH51jEw2EQrcfheN08QQtHhz47ze/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110236286713156336072&rtpof=true&sd=true)



Included in the calculation:

* base forms
* mega evolutions (and primal forms)
* regional variants (even if the stat distribution is the same)
* forms that change type distribution (i.e., giratina altered & origin forms, thundurus incarnate & therian forms, aegislash shield & blade forms)
* forms that change typing (i.e., rotom forms, meloetta aria & pirouette)
* gendered differences (i.e., basculegion, oinkologne)

Not included in the calculation:

* forms that only change moves/movesets (i.e., morpeko, keldeo)
* Gigantamax forms
* forms that only change appearance (i.e, cherrim)
* variations with no real affect on stats (i.e., spinda, unown, gastrodon)
* arceus and silvally variants



# Placements

**1. HP**

Taking top spot for HP goes to Normal with its family having an average of 18.79% of their stats dedicated to HP. This might just be getting skewed a lot by the Blissey line but it is what it is. Second in ground which makes sense since the Earth is quite resilient. Dead last is Ghost (which might be also skewed by Shedinja) and surprisingly Steel. I guess that high defense meant there wasn't a lot of room for health.  


**2. Attack**

To absolutely nobody's surprise, Fighting takes the top spot with fighting Pokémon having an average of 22.54% of their stats allotted to the Attack stat. Other types near the top are the more ""rough types"" such as Rock, Steel, and Dark. On the other hand, Fairy and Psychic are at the bottom which makes sense since both of those types are more magical (Special).

  
**3. Defense**

This one honestly surprised me. Number one is NOT Steel type but is instead Rock type. I guess Metals like Mercury can technically be malleable but still, this one as a surprise. What isn't a surprise is Flying being dead last since birds aren't really known for their strong bones.

  
**4. Special Attack**

Psychic is first (pretend to be shocked) with Fire and Electric coming next (pretend to be even more shocked). This one is honestly pretty straight forward as the types at the bottom are the more rough, physical types (Rock, Fighting, Ground).

  
**5. Special Defense**

Fairy and Psychic take the top spots with Grass right after. Once again, nobody is surprised. And once again, nobody will be surprised to know that Fighting and Ground have the lowers Special Defense. Although, Dark being bottom 3 is quite shocking since I thought there'd be more specially bulky Dark types to deal with Psychic types.

  
**6. Speed**

I genuinely though Electric would take this one but surprisingly, birds are faster than lighting. Normal being third is quite impressive since there's not a lot of Normal Pokémon that I could look at and say ""yeah, that's fast"". And of course, Rock and Steel at the Bottom.



# Average Placements

Aside from getting the average of each stat, I also decided to get the average of where each type placed in each stat to find which type had the most consistent type distributions across the board. The formula was simply:

`Average Placement = Summation of Each Stat Distribution ÷ 6`

**Top 5:**

1. Ice
2. Dragon
3. Normal
4. Water
5. Poison

Ice being number one is quite a feat considering how bad the type is. It's lowest placement is Speed at 13 and has the 3rd best HP distribution yet very mid defenses (8 & 9). If this type didn't die just from a gust of wind, Ice could be a decently good wall but alas, Game Freak hates the cold.

Dragon and Water being up here is not surprising but Normal and Poison did catch me off guard. With how low Normal type's defense is (17th out of 18th), I thought it would be a lot less lower but I guess the other stats were good enough to carry it to 3rd place. Poison is pretty much average across the board which just tells me that Poison type Pokémons have no real archetype to them and they can just be whatever they want (fast, bulky, offensive, defensive, etc.).

  
**Bottom 5:**

1. Flying
2. Electric
3. Steel
4. Rock
5. Fire

The types here are not that surprising except for Fire, since the top 4 all have very polarizing stats. Flying and Electric both have amazing speed but Flying has poor defense and Electric has awful attack, HP, and special defense stats. Aside from speed and special attack, the Electric type is actually quite bad which makes sense since Electric has never been a bulky or physical type.

Rock and Steel also make sense since, aside from their defense and maybe attack, everything else is quite bad.

Fire surprisingly is pretty bad at distributing its stats. Aside from their really high special attack, there isn't much going on for fire types. Their defenses are bad, their physical attack is mid, and their speed is good but not great.

  
Overall this does show the basic type trends that we all know (Rock and Steel being bulky, Psychic and Fire being good Special Attackers, Electric and Flying being fast, Dragon being good at everything, etc.). But there were a couple of outliers I did not expect like Ice being good at everything and Bug having pretty good defenses (relative to their BST, of course).



# Mid-ness

Aside from averages, I also wanted to determine the ""mid-ness"" of each type, All I did was get the placement of each stat and get the absolute value of the stat minus the mean (9.5). The lower the value meant that the more ""mid"" the type was. The formula was like so:

`Mid-ness Level = Summation of | Stat Placement - Mean (9.5) |`

Using this formula, I have determined that the most mid type in Pokémon is...



>!The Poison Type! with a mid-ness level of only 13, beating out Dragon by only 2 points (15). If your favorite type is Poison, then congratulations because you have the most average taste among Pokémon fans. Enjoy your room temperature coffee and lukewarm showers.!<

  
I hope you all enjoyed reading this and viewing the document. I might have missed a couple of things when calculating since I did try and do this in like 2 days so if I did an oopsie then my bad. I am once again begging Game Freak to buff the Ice type... please...",6,1734511260.0,pokemon,0,1.0,False

As someone who's always searching for unique experiences, this off-road volcanic expedition absolutely blew my mind.

Let me paint you a picture: Imagine yourself behind the wheel of a powerful buggy, cruising through otherworldly volcanic landscapes that look straight out of a sci-fi movie. That's exactly what I experienced during this epic 2-3 hour guided tour in northern Lanzarote.

The tour started with a quick safety briefing and gear setup. They provided everything - windbreakers, goggles, the works. Our guide was this awesome local dude who spoke perfect English (they also do tours in Spanish, French, and Catalan if that's your thing).

Here's what made this tour stand out: We weren't just following boring paved roads. We went full off-road mode through ancient lava fields and quarries. The highlight was definitely reaching Peñas del Chache, the highest point on the island. The views were absolutely insane - you could see the entire volcanic landscape stretching out below us.

The buggies themselves are super fun to drive. Even though I'd never driven one before, I got the hang of it pretty quickly. Just keep in mind you need to be at least 20 years old with 2+ years of driving experience if you want to take the wheel. If you're riding as a passenger, you just need to be tall enough (4'4"" or 135cm).

Our group was small (max 10 people) which made it feel really personal. The guide knew all the best spots for photos and shared fascinating stories about the volcanic history of the island. They even offer a photo/video package if you want to capture the memories without worrying about your phone flying out of your pocket!

If you're planning to visit Lanzarote, you absolutely have to check this out. I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/Lanzarote and the whole process was super smooth. The price is $136 which, trust me, is totally worth it for such a unique experience.

Quick heads up though - it's not suitable if you're pregnant or have back problems. Also, don't forget to bring your original driver's license if you plan to drive!

The recent reviews (4.8/5) don't lie - this tour is the real deal. Even when we had some cloudy weather, it actually made the volcanic landscape look even more dramatic and mysterious.

Why 3 parts Rejuvenators?  
To have constant hp and ap regen, more ap regen means more shots in vats with our heavy weapons such as a plasma caster when combined with the vats optimized (less vats cost -25%) This also means we have to spam slightly less coffee to constantly fire the weapons like the gatling plasma in boss fights as a bonus while having good passive healing making you very tanky with 15 Hp + Ap a second.

Why 2 Parts Limit Breaking?  
To reduce the Luck needed to able to vats crit every other shot, This gives you 3 slots to put in some 4 star effects that affect you and the team

1hgxag9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hgxag9/how_to_create_a_minimalist_home_with_functional/,How to Create a Minimalist Home with Functional Furniture,"Minimalism is more than just a design trend—it’s a lifestyle that celebrates simplicity, functionality, and intentional living. Creating a minimalist home involves carefully selecting furniture that balances aesthetics with utility. By incorporating functional and versatile pieces like a [round coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/coffee-tables-side-tables/round-coffee-tables), durable [outdoor garden furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor), and sleek [bar stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), you can design a space that is both stylish and purposeful.

Here’s how to achieve a minimalist look for your home while keeping functionality at the forefront.

# 1. Start with Decluttering

The foundation of minimalism is simplicity, so start by decluttering your space. Remove items that don’t serve a purpose or add value to your life. Once you’ve pared down your belongings, you can focus on selecting furniture that complements your minimalist vision.

# 2. Choose Functional Furniture Pieces

In a minimalist home, every furniture item should have a purpose. Opt for pieces that are both practical and visually appealing.

# Round Coffee Table

A **round coffee table** is a perfect choice for minimalist living rooms. Its soft edges create a sense of flow, while its compact design saves space. Look for tables with built-in storage to keep clutter out of sight, enhancing the clean and open aesthetic.

# Bar Stools for Multi-Use Areas

Sleek and functional **bar stools** are an excellent addition to a minimalist kitchen or dining area. They’re perfect for casual seating and can easily tuck under counters to save space. For residents of Dubai, there’s a wide range of [bar stools Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) that offer modern, minimalist designs in neutral tones like black, white, or gray.

# Outdoor Garden Furniture

Minimalism extends beyond your indoor spaces. Select simple and durable **outdoor garden furniture** that complements the clean lines of your home. Weather-resistant materials like metal, teak, or rattan are ideal for creating an elegant, minimalist outdoor retreat.

# 3. Focus on Neutral Colors and Materials

Minimalist homes typically feature a neutral color palette, emphasizing whites, grays, blacks, and natural tones. Choose furniture that aligns with these shades to create a harmonious look.

* **Round Coffee Table**: Opt for designs in light wood, white marble, or matte finishes for a modern vibe.
* **Bar Stools**: Choose metal or wood finishes in neutral tones for a sleek, understated aesthetic.
* **Outdoor Garden Furniture**: Stick to natural materials like teak or powder-coated metal in neutral shades to maintain a cohesive minimalist look.

# 4. Maximize Versatility

Functional furniture should adapt to your needs, especially in a minimalist home where every piece counts.

* **Convertible Bar Stools**: Adjustable-height **bar stools** are ideal for kitchens, counters, and dining areas with varying heights.
* **Multi-Use Tables**: A **round coffee table** with hidden storage or a lift-top design can double as a workspace or dining surface.
* **Modular Outdoor Furniture**: Look for **outdoor garden furniture** that can be rearranged or expanded to accommodate different uses, such as lounging, dining, or entertaining.

# 5. Embrace Open Spaces

Minimalism thrives on open, uncluttered spaces. Arrange your furniture to enhance flow and ensure every piece contributes to the overall functionality of the room.

* In the living room, keep your **round coffee table** centered and surrounded by seating to anchor the space without overwhelming it.
* Use **bar stools** to maintain an open feel in the kitchen by avoiding bulky dining chairs.
* For outdoor areas, arrange **garden furniture** to create a serene, spacious environment.

# 6. Invest in Quality Over Quantity

Minimalism encourages you to invest in fewer, high-quality pieces that stand the test of time. This applies to everything from your **bar stools** to your **outdoor garden furniture**. Durable materials, timeless designs, and craftsmanship should be your focus when choosing minimalist furniture.

# 7. Add Subtle Accents

While minimalism emphasizes simplicity, a few well-chosen accents can add character to your space. Consider these tips:

* Use soft textures like throw pillows or rugs to complement your **round coffee table**.
* Add a single statement piece, like a sleek vase or a minimalist light fixture, to your dining area with **bar stools**.
* Incorporate greenery to soften the look of your **outdoor garden furniture** and bring a touch of nature to your minimalist retreat.

# Final Thoughts

Creating a minimalist home with functional furniture is about prioritizing quality, versatility, and simplicity. Whether you’re incorporating a **round coffee table** for your living room, stylish **bar stools in Dubai** for your kitchen, or sleek **outdoor garden furniture** for your patio, each piece should serve a purpose and elevate your space.

By following these tips, you can design a home that embodies the principles of minimalism—clean, purposeful, and serene—without sacrificing style. Take the first step toward a clutter-free lifestyle and enjoy the beauty of simplicity!",1,1734510525.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

It's compact, but still has enough space inside to cook a small plate or reheat leftovers. I like that it has 10 power levels, so I can adjust the cooking time and power depending on what I'm making. For example, I can use low power to melt chocolate or high power to quickly reheat my coffee. I also appreciate the 6 quick-cook buttons for common foods like popcorn, pizza, and potatoes. These buttons are helpful for my daughter because she can use them easily and doesn't need to set the time and power herself.

[**View on BakingReview**](https://bakingreview.com/hamilton-beach-0-9-cu-ft-900w-microwave-oven/)

I bought the Hamilton Beach 0.9 cu.ft. 900W Microwave Oven in June. I needed a new microwave because my old one was getting very old and was starting to make strange noises. I did some research online and read many reviews of different microwave ovens. I was looking for a microwave that was affordable, easy to use, and had good features. I also wanted a microwave that was not too big, as my kitchen is not very large. After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase the Hamilton Beach 0.9 cu.ft. 900W Microwave Oven.

One of the things I love about the Hamilton Beach 0.9 cu.ft. 900W Microwave Oven is that it is very easy to clean. The inside of the microwave is made of stainless steel, which makes it easy to wipe clean. I also like that the turntable is removable, so I can easily clean underneath it. I have also used this microwave to cook some simple meals, such as popcorn and frozen dinners. It cooks food evenly and quickly. I am very happy with my purchase of the Hamilton Beach 0.9 cu.ft. 900W Microwave Oven. I think it is a great value for the price.

This is where **rugs** become essential. With the right [rugs and carpets](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), you can visually separate spaces while adding warmth, texture, and style to your home. Whether you’re furnishing a modern apartment or a sprawling villa, here’s how to use **rugs** to transform your open-plan layout, including tips on finding the perfect [rugs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) or [rugs UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs).

# 1. Define Living Areas with Large Rugs

In open-plan homes, a **large rug** can anchor your living room, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Place all your seating—such as sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables—on the rug to define the boundaries of the living space.

# Tips for Choosing the Right Rug:

* Choose a rug that complements your furniture and decor. Neutral tones or bold patterns can both work depending on your style.
* For a contemporary vibe, consider a [circle rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) as a centerpiece. Its soft curves add contrast to the angular shapes of furniture.

# 2. Use Rugs to Highlight Dining Areas

Adding a rug beneath your dining table can make the dining area feel distinct from the rest of the space. This works particularly well in open kitchens that flow into living areas.

# Key Considerations:

* Ensure the rug is large enough to accommodate the table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out.
* Opt for durable, stain-resistant **rugs and carpets** that can handle spills and frequent use.

# 3. Create Pathways with Runners

In expansive open-plan homes, runners can be used to guide movement and define pathways. They visually connect different areas, such as the living room to the kitchen or hallway.

# Pro Tip:

Look for runners with vibrant patterns to add energy and personality to transitional spaces. For a cohesive look, choose a runner that complements the main **rugs in the UAE** used in other parts of your home.

# 4. Separate Work and Relaxation Zones

With the rise of remote work, many open-plan homes now feature workspaces. A **circle rug** or a small rectangular rug can define this area without requiring physical barriers like screens or dividers.

# Design Ideas:

* Place a **rug** under your desk and chair to create a designated work zone.
* Choose muted or neutral tones for a professional yet stylish look.

# 5. Enhance Outdoor Areas with Rugs

Don’t forget that **rugs in Dubai** are also perfect for outdoor spaces. Use them to define seating or dining areas on your balcony, patio, or garden.

# Choosing Outdoor Rugs:

* Look for weather-resistant materials like polypropylene, which can withstand the UAE’s heat and occasional sandstorms.
* A bold-patterned **circle rug** can add visual interest to a neutral outdoor setup.

# 6. Layer Rugs for Added Texture

Layering rugs is a trendy way to add depth and dimension to your space while reinforcing functional zones. Place a smaller **circle rug** over a larger rectangular rug to draw attention to specific furniture pieces, such as a coffee table or a reading nook.

# Layering Tips:

* Mix and match textures, such as a jute rug with a soft wool one.
* Stick to a cohesive color palette to avoid visual clutter.

# 7. Choose Rugs That Reflect Your Style

Whether you’re shopping for **rugs in Dubai** or elsewhere, the right choice will depend on your personal taste and the overall theme of your home. Here are some popular options:

* **Modern Designs:** Geometric patterns or monochromatic tones for a sleek and contemporary look.
* **Traditional Styles:** Persian or Oriental **rugs and carpets** add a timeless elegance to any space.
* **Bohemian Vibes:** Layered and textured **circle rugs** or colorful vintage designs bring warmth and character.

# 8. Practical Tips for Buying Rugs in Dubai and UAE

When shopping for **rugs in Dubai** or across the **UAE**, keep these tips in mind:

* **Size Matters:** Measure your space carefully to ensure the rug fits perfectly.
* **Material Selection:** Choose materials based on the area’s foot traffic. Wool or synthetic blends work well for high-traffic zones, while silk rugs are best for low-traffic areas.
* **Easy Maintenance:** Opt for washable or easy-to-clean rugs, especially in homes with kids or pets.

# Final Thoughts

Rugs are more than just floor coverings; they’re powerful design tools that help define spaces in open-plan homes. Whether you’re looking to enhance a living area with a statement piece, add charm to a dining space, or create a cozy nook, there’s a rug to suit every need. Explore the wide variety of **rugs in Dubai** and **rugs UAE** to find the perfect match for your home.

From elegant **circle rugs** to versatile outdoor options, rugs and carpets can bring style, comfort, and functionality to your open-plan living spaces. Define your home’s personality with the perfect rug today!",1,1734510112.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Since I was quite skeptical at first and Reddit actually convinced me to start taking it, I figured I would share my experience here.

I'm a 29 years old female, never had taken any meds before.

Before I started on the meds, I was going through a phase with a lot of crying, very low energy/motivation for anything really. Life seemed pretty uninspiring to me and I had trouble being proactive in implementing positive changes in my life. I also had recurring suicidal thoughts and a lot of anxiety

My psychiatrist recommended Wellbutrin.

I know this isn't the case for everybody but I actually felt a difference very rapidly, maybe day 2 or 3. At first it simply was that I wasn't crying as much, had more control over emotions. The first 3 weeks, I had very (!) low quality sleep, and I almost stopped taking the meds because of that. But my psychiatrist convinced me to stick with it, and it actually got better. At first I completely cut down on caffeine, and gradually started having a normal coffee in the morning again. I used to drink coffee up until 3pm but I now figured I have to stick to one in the morning to have normal sleep.

Generally speaking, I feel like Wellbutrin helped me to have more energy, which in turn made me capable of exercising again, being interested in things, socializing etc. It's obviously no miracle solution, but my wellbeing has definitely improved. It's changed my outlook on things, and gave me the extra push to put things in motion so to speak. I feel more in control of my life and my emotions. I still have moments of anxiety, but they are definitely more manageable than before.

Also, I haven't lost or gained weight, and my sex drive actually got better. But this could just be a side effect of having more energy.

I do have autism (I think, but I definitely was diagnosed with ADHD as a child) and depression, but I was struggling with it for at least 5 years and signs of insomnia only appeared last year. 

For context, I'm originally from Russia but due to the war and me being part ukrainian I moved to Turkey with my mom in December of 2022 and then in July of 2023 we moved to Georgia (the country). I had to work various jobs here - low income barista ($10 for 10 hours), janitor in a hotel, etc. The hardest one was being an admin in a hotel. I had 16 hour long night shift 3-4 times a week and one 24 hour long shift 1 time a week. It was going on for a month until i quit. Now I'm working as a barista/manager in a good coffee shop and I also have a side gig as a designer. So it's about 45 hours a week with a $600 monthly income. Not a lot here in Georgia but I manage. 

Back to the point. Sorry, got carried away. So, I'm a late bird. Although I have to wake up at 8-10 AM if I want to get everything done, I usually stay up until 2 AM. I mean, I used to, I moved to a new apartment and started going to bed at 11 PM, 1 AM max. On day offs I can play videogames or watch stuff until early morning, but I usually don't sleep naturally more than 6 hours so I used to manage my sleep schedule. But lately I've been waking up at 2-4 AM and not being able to get back to sleep for 2 or more hours. 

The worst was yesterday. It was my girlfriend's birthday and we're long distant (she lives in Russia now and is in a Uni so we're waiting until she graduates, which is a year and a half away). I'm hour later so her 11 PM is my 00 AM. We talked a bit after she came home from her birthday party and I went to bed. I fell asleep pretty quickly some time around 1 AM but woke up at 4 AM. I remember receiving a notification from my friend not long after, some time around 4:06. I tried sleeping but I just laid for an hour. I then scrolled my phone for about 20 minutes to tire myself but it didn't work. So I laid in my bed until 7 AM and then said fuck it and made myself some breakfast and went playing Marvel Rivals before work. The shift was a disaster, I was falling asleep constantly (I even had a mark from my sweater on my forehead lmao) but I managed to close my shift and go home as usual. I played a little bit with my friend and fell asleep almost instantly at midnight and sleeped through the night without even moving. I woke up at nine-something AM. I did wake up at 4 AM again but fell asleep almost instantly. 

So, there's that. Any tips on how I actually get myself sleeping? It's actally so funny, I'm constanty sleepy. Even now ",1,1734509870.0,insomnia,0,0.66,False

Kanina lang po pina-access ng operator pod. Hindi ko lang po magets kung pano gamitin. Sched ko po is 9am-6pm and naka training po ako. Ang sabi po yung coffee button po ang icclick every trainings and breaks. 


Bago po ba mag 6pm kailangan po mai-stop na yung time then select activity before my shift ends? kase po kusa po sya nagccheckout pagdating ng 6pm. 

Upon checking sa operator pod na site, yung oras ko po na nakalaan sa training ay napasama sa break kase hindi ko na po sya iniistop pagpatak ng 6pm.",0,1734509725.0,Accenture_PH,0,0.5,False
