1pmqjua,https://i.redd.it/w72e8e4qt87g1.png,How to Create a Cozy Winter Collage with Audio Player Floating Using Nano Banana Pro? Prompt Below!,"I’ve been testing how far **Nano Banana Pro** can go with **strict reference adherence** while still producing something that feels spontaneous, cozy, and *real* — not like a polished AI studio render.

The goal here was to create a **winter editorial multi-panel collage** that looks like it was casually captured on an iPhone, while keeping the subject’s **face 100% identical** to the reference photo across every frame.

}  
}""

To push the realism further, I added:

* Soft snowfall with slight motion blur
* Subtle analog grain
* A **minimal Spotify, Apple Music–style mini player overlay** floating across the collage to anchor the holiday mood

This setup is great for:

* Editorial posters
* Seasonal social content
* Lifestyle-style AI photography
* Testing face-lock reliability under real-world conditions

If anyone wants, you can share:

* A **summer version** of this layout
* A **single-shot variant** instead of collage
* Or a **harder face-lock config** for production use

1pmqjms,https://www.reddit.com/r/chatbot/comments/1pmqjms/best_character_ai_alternative/,best character ai alternative?,"Hi, I know this is something that gets asked all the time, but I am looking for something specific and am just exhausted by trying platform after platform only to get disappointed. 

I've been using character ai for quite a long time. There are things I really like about it and would like the possible alternative to offer as well:   
Accessible both on desktop and phone  
Seamlessly portrays side characters  
Occasional surprise in form of a new side character or an unexpected event happening  
Tight scene pacing (aka won't move from waking up to finishing coffee in one reply)  
  
However, the reasons I am looking for an alternative are:  
I am just exhausted of the weak memory. I have cai+, but it still feels like the bot forgets things after a few messages and loses continuity.  
The character won't stay in properly in character no matter how strong is the definition. It slips into clichés and tropes all the time.   
Filter. I generally have no issue with NSFW on character ai, but sometimes it fires up and it's just annoying. 

Basically, what I am looking for is reasonably priced platform that has the ""good"" parts of character ai, but does better in terms of memory, character consistency and has no filter. 

What I am trying to do is roleplay with my favourite fictional character, I will create him myself, I don't need a platform with huge library of characters or anything. I just wanna do an immersive roleplay that's not filtered and feels true to him. If anyone knows of a platform that would offer this, it would be amazing and I'd be grateful forever.

Posting your stupid face, for stupid people to see, to talk about your stupid opinions/experiences......and then you complain of being cyber-bullied, having nudes leaked, or being doxxed.

Same with criminal behavior. If you're innocent, those to whom you defend yourself should be your (trusted) family, employer, and legal council. 

Even if you claim to be innocent, yet actions prove otherwise, shut your mouth. (That DoorDash perverted freak-poop is being made an example of, and I love it. She'll get her prison flowers. Those inmates will looooovvvve her.) The right to remain silent is powerful. Use it.

Do yourselves a favor, and don't post your lives on social media. 

Don't post your children AT ALL!!!!!!! 

Don't post your relationship drama, like a little dog you are, instead of being an adult and talking to him/her.

Also, stop going online to complain that someone found you attractive, or that this person didn't do more than a coffee date, or that your actions won't allow him/her to take you seriously. You're an adult; act like one. 

Even before the rise of the Internet, people would explain themselves on television, on radio podcasts, or in books, or in person (the latter being for thousands of years). Interesting. ",1,1765750214.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1pmqhwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1pmqhwd/hector_and_quinn_a_sunrise_squabble/,Hector and Quinn - A Sunrise Squabble,"here's a short scene i jotted down to get rid of the writer's block. yeaaah i'm kinda glad my adhd isn't gluing me to the shackles anymore. this is a completely unrefined, 'one-shotted' attempt by the way, and since i feel like i happen to write very lengthy/clunky sentences every one in a while, do let me know 😅 word count is about 700, so it's still very much lengthy....

It's a little after 4:00 AM. Hector sits at the steering wheel in the navi. He's got dark circles under his eyes, and not just the ones that appear on his face normally. Still, he can hear footsteps somewhere on deck. Quinn is humming a tune to himself, brewing a pot of coffee. Then, he knocks against Hector's door before waltzing in.

""You're awake, Hector."" The sailor scoffs, ""Well, I ain't asleep, that's for sure."" Despite his snarky answer, Quinn can't say he expected any less and simply rolls his eyes, ""You should be, though. I bet you didn't sleep the whole night again.""

""What are you, my dad? Go back to your cabin, ya worrywart."" Quinn sighs, shutting the navi door carefully before explaining, ""No, Hector, I'm not going anywhere until you atleast admit you're tired."" Hector glares at him incredulously, still steering the wheel with practiced ease. ""The hell's the point of that, anyway? You're wasting your time, Quinn."" Still, he leans against the closed door, taking another puff of his pipe. ""It's actually incredibly crucial. You see, a lot of people tend to ignore the lack of sleep in their routine, due to many factors like worries regarding it or distracting them from rest, as well as a general struggle with chronic insomnia or falling out of one's usual sleeping schedule. Still, the most common factor for declining quality sleep seems to be duty. Did you know over a third of the entire population struggles with keeping their circadian rhythm balanced? Not to mention---""

""You're killin' me with all that rambling, Socrates"", Hector snaps, ""quit it. I'm a grown man, yeah? Think I can decide for myself when I'll hit the hay"", but Quinn swiftly interrupts him, ""That's not the point. The point is that you're denying you're tired, and that's why you won't let yourself go and rest. It's extremely important you listen to your body's cues, otherwise you'll pass out in the middle of nowhere without even realizing it."" Hector shoots him a glare again, this one less accusatory and more acknowledging. He can't deny he'd love to take the world's longest nap right now, but that would mean letting Quinn win the argument. Troubled, he contemplates how to further debate him on this matter, before dropping his head on the steering wheel, face buried in his arms. ""Fine. You win. I'm dead beat, is that what you wanted to hear?"", he admits in defeat, voice muffled and slow. Quinn spins the chair next to Hector, setting a tall cup of coffee on the table in front of them. Sitting down in the chair he just spun, he gently sets his pipe down in front of him to sip his coffee. ""Get back up, you stupid ox. I'm not done yet.""

After some quiet grumbling, Hector does as he says, raising his head from his arms again, albeit with great restraint. Pulling his sailor's cap up once more, the steaming mug on the table catches his eye, as well as Quinn's expectant gaze. Carefully, Hector grabs it by the handle and takes a tentative whiff of the comforting hot beverage, taking it to his lips. With an amused smile, Quinn advises: ""How about once you're done drinking that, you go ahead and sleep once you're tired?"" Hector grits his teeth, ready to argue back and resist, but can't find the energy nor motivation to do it. He mutters a simple 'alright' and leaves it be. Quinn doesn't respond much verbally either, just nods in approval as he sets his coffee cup down for another hit of his equally steaming pipe. And so, the two of them sit silently in the navi for roughly ten minutes or so, taking in the sight of the rising sun.

""You must have lovely views of the dawn from here"", Quinn claims as he watches the blue sky and sea get hit by bright rays of golden sunlight. Hector hums gruffly in agreement, still very much groggy, but warming up to Quinn's presence once again. ""Guess so"", is his only response, whilst he steals a secretive glance at the composed smoker sitting beside him. Soon, the commotion on deck slowly begins to stir.",1,1765750105.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a platform called **Meentd**, designed specifically for **local communities**, starting with **Milano**. It’s already built, but before pushing it further, I really want honest outside opinions.

The idea is simple: instead of swiping profiles, people connect by posting or browsing **queries** — short posts that say what you want to do.

Examples:

* “Coffee in Milano this afternoon”
* “Looking for a tennis partner this weekend”
* “Anyone up for board games tonight?”
* “Going to a concert in the city, want company?”

Users can:

* browse local queries,
* search for something specific, or
* post their own query and see who’s interested.

Profiles are verified, and the focus is on clarity and real-life interaction rather than endless chatting.

What I’d genuinely like to understand:

* Does this feel useful for a city like Milano?
* What would make *you* actually use something like this?
* What would turn you off immediately?
* Is there something important missing?

I’m not here to promote anything — I’m genuinely looking for feedback before taking this further.

Of course the quality of green input makes a big difference on final product, but many importers for home roasting have had great quality green coffee.

My mom (and dad) and I have never really seen eye to eye. In my eyes, their version of parenting is controlling and manipulative but I’ll get into that later.

I realize I’m not a golden child/person. I’ve made many mistakes, one of these being a life long habit of compulsive lying (only to my parents might I add). Growing up, punishment was more common than help. If I lied? Punished. told the truth for something bad? Grounded. Stayed up late? Grounded. Lots of corporal punished too (physical). 

Growing up this way and having parents who wanted me to do things their exact way and perfect the first time around really taught me to lie to protect myself. It’s gotten so bad that sometimes I create elaborate stories and believe them just so I don’t have to tell them the truth even if it’s a small thing. 

I’ve been struggling with depression and bipolar disorder and medicated for both since I was 19, but still struggle with lying. I hate it. Because it seeps into other areas of my life too.

Well fast forward to this year, made a lot of mistakes like losing my job in April, which costed me my apartment and my parents allowed me to move back in. I’ve accumulated a lot of debt, and working to pay it back. I was even on unemployment for awhile. 

Ever since moving back home my patterns returned, I lie, lack of a schedule are the main two. I’ve had two temp jobs in retail environment that didn’t work out, and since then my mom has been majorly mad at me.

I’ve been open with them about my difficulties including my want to change at this age and I constantly get threatened with “Get out of my house, you’ll be homeless, etc” on top of that, since I haven’t worked much in 7 months, I am repeatedly called a loser. 

Recently, after my seasonal employment ended at the retail job, I lied to my mom saying I still had a job, fearing getting kicked out and homeless. She blew up at me, threatened to change the locks while I was at church and the gut punch : “You’re a massive loser, waste of a human being, and you’re hopeless” since that day (last week) my parents haven’t said a word to me. Luckily I’m still living here, but they act like I don’t exist, I’m always in my room looking for a job or gaming with friends (Have had 3 interviews already!) and my mom only communicates through text. 

I realize I may seem lazy, but I’m trying to find a job that pays my debt and starts my career but now I’ve come to terms with even if I have to take a job at a coffee shop I’ll do it.

I guess my overall question is, is this relationship even worth saving? Or is this something I’ll deal with till I have enough to move out again? My mom says it’s all my fault that I’ve caused too much damage.

I appreciate all the advice I get!

TL;DR: My mom won’t speak to me, is verbally dismissive and I struggle with my day to day, is this a relationship worth saving?

1pmq5f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1pmq5f5/flying_with_airborne_reactivity/,Flying with airborne reactivity?,"Unfortunately in the past 5 years my lifelong dairy allergy has become airborne. So far, I have reacted from standing in a Starbucks, from my exs roomate cooking eggs and pouring milk into the pan while I was asleep on the couch, from someone sitting next to me with a steaming hot coffee with milk based creamer in the office, and from a hot pizza being eaten behind me in a line at a fair… so it’s basically just when things are hot. I do my best to avoid going anywhere anymore where there is hot food actively cooking (restaurants, street fairs, etc) but one problem I am not sure how to handle anymore is airplanes.

I have always flown Southwest, which is great because they don’t serve food and have open seating, which allows me to move if there’s an issue. Southwest doesn’t announce or create a buffer zone for my dairy allergy like they do with nuts. They usually just ask if I have my EpiPens and tell me they can’t ask others not to eat things. Whatever, I don’t mind because I just notify people near me and wear a medical face mask for extra safety. 

I always notify the people sitting next to me, the row in front of me, as well as the row behind me. I just ask they not order creamer in their coffee or hot chocolate if they’re sitting by me, and ask if they have any hot dairy products. Usually the answer is no, and if they want coffee they have always just moved to another seat willingly. The only time i’ve really run into hot food issues is on Hawaii flights because people often bring the mini pizzas from the terminal onboard, but I just get up and move seats. 

Unfortunately, Southwest is now doing assigned seating. I am at a loss of what to do. I know assigned seating is normal, but I have only flown Southwest since developing this airborne reactivity. 

My question is, how do you guys handle it? Have you ever been forced to sit next to someone with your allergen? Does it help to call the airline before? Do you wear a specialized mask instead of a regular one? Any tips would be appreciated. ",1,1765749230.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False

Now she lives in the UK but needs to move to Australia. She’s worried about things like visas, finding a flat, and especially making sure all her stuff gets there safely.

She’s been in her current place for years, so she has some big things she really cares about, like her sofa, desk, and a nice coffee machine. She also has smaller sentimental things, like books, photos, and a few gadgets. She’s not sure if she should ship everything or just sell it all and start over.

We’ve been looking into international moving companies, like [Simpsons](https://www.simpsons-uk.com/removals-to-australia) and they seem good for handling big items. But the quotes we’re getting are all over the place, so she’s not sure what a fair price is.

So… how did you handle moving valuable or sentimental items across the ocean? Did you bother shipping them, or just sell and replace? How much did it cost? Any companies you’d recommend (or avoid)? Trying to figure out if she’s overthinking it or if it’s genuinely a lot to sort.

1pmq2tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Heartpalpitations/comments/1pmq2tj/help_i_am_desperate_after_2_years/,Help!! I am desperate after 2 years,"Hello everyone,
I’m a 23-year-old male. I’m not obese, but I’m also not particularly fit – just an average guy who likes playing video games.

I’ve been struggling with heart palpitations for about two years now. When it all started, I had two part-time jobs and was studying at university. I don’t think I was extremely stressed, maybe just a bit sleep-deprived. It began with what felt like a panic attack and dizziness while I was driving. It scared the hell out of me. I went straight to the ER, but of course, everything came back normal.

Since then, I experience palpitations almost every day. Usually it’s anywhere from 1 to 5 strong beats or skipped/extra beats in my chest. On bad days, it can be around 15–20. After each episode, I get a strong adrenaline rush and intense fear. Ever since that first panic attack, my life has changed completely.

Over time, I also started experiencing other symptoms. I get muscle twitches, dizziness, constipation followed by diarrhea, and various other issues that seem to rotate – one week it’s one thing, the next week it’s something else. The only symptom that stays constant are the palpitations.

After that first panic attack, I quit one of my jobs, stopped using nicotine for about six months (I try to avoid it even now, although I noticed it doesn’t really make a difference – I still get palpitations whether I use nicotine or not), started exercising more, and stopped going out. Basically, I developed severe health anxiety, and honestly, it has completely messed up my life. I can’t enjoy anything anymore. It even damaged my relationship because I became so fixated on my health and on myself.

I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks at all. I only drink alcohol a few times a month, and even then it’s just one small beer with friends – I never get drunk. Still, even after that one beer, I notice more palpitations than usual.

Over the past two years, I’ve seen almost every doctor imaginable. I’ve had blood tests done four times – always normal. I’ve had 5–6 ECGs. I’ve seen two cardiologists, one year apart. Both gave me a 24-hour Holter monitor, did heart ultrasounds, and physical exams. Everything was normal. If anything was slightly off, they told me it wasn’t life-threatening and that it was “just anxiety.”

What confuses me is that there are periods when the symptoms almost completely disappear. For example, when I was on vacation, I barely had any palpitations at all. Also, after my relationship ended, during the first week after the breakup, I didn’t have a single palpitation and I felt physically very, very good. But after that, they slowly came back again.

I also visited a gastroenterologist and even had an endoscopy to check if it could be related to digestion or food – again, nothing wrong.

Despite all this, I still feel terrible. The symptoms haven’t really gotten worse over these two years, but they haven’t improved either. I take magnesium (strong one) daily, B-complex vitamins and i started to take omega plus too like two weeks ago, i stay well hydrated, try to eat healthy, and I sleep at least 7-8 hours every night. I do those breathing exercises when i need to calm down. Nothing helps. The palpitations are still there.

I’m exhausted and desperate. It feels like my life is on pause, and doctors can’t help me because it’s always dismissed as “just anxiety.”

So thats my storry, i dont fear for my life so much as i used to…if it was dangerous they would have found it untill now OR i wouldnt be here anymore. But that doesnt change the fact that i feel like shit, and it is taking every bit of my energy and happines. 

So … yea if u guys have some tips or ideas how i can try to get rid of them or about anything about this i will be very greatfull and i will definitely try it. I just want to be young and free again and i want to enjoy my life without the constant fear from those palpitations. ",1,1765749045.0,Heartpalpitations,1,1.0,False

1pmpxj1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmpxj1,It started with refurbishing my 20 yo iRiver H10… and kind of spiralled from there!,"I’m a pretty nostalgic, melancholy kinda guy, this hobby has just made me feel great.

It all started when…

I bought a FiiO CD player recently and enjoyed the experience way more than I expected — sitting outside in the garden, listening to full albums again, no streaming, no skipping every 20 seconds. That got me thinking about portable music, so I went digging in the loft to find my old iRiver MP3 player from the early 2000s.

Found it… dead.

No charge, and of course the proprietary charging/data lead was long gone. After some searching, I ended up buying another iRiver H10 on eBay purely so I could get the cable and revive my original one.

Turns out that one was dead too.

Both batteries were completely gone — which sent me down the next rabbit hole. Replacement batteries for the slim 5GB/6GB H10 models don’t exist anymore, so I started researching lithium-polymer cells, sizes, protection circuits, capacities, and how the original batteries were constructed.

After a lot of trial, measuring, and careful surgery, I rebuilt the battery in my own unit with a modern Li-Po cell… and it worked. Fully revived!

It had music on it that I had not listened to for around 17 years, it’s beautiful.

Then I did the same to the eBay one. New battery internals, replaced failing components, firmware update — suddenly I had two fully working 20-year-old MP3 players.

That’s when it properly spiralled.

My Mate use to have one and remembered it just as fondly, it didn’t feel right that this beautiful - well built device would go into history relatively forgotten :( 

So I started picking up more H10s, refreshing batteries, replacing capacitors, cleaning them up, restoring screen frames that have deteriorate, and bringing them back to life. Somewhere along the way I realised I’d accidentally found a hobby that scratches that melancholy itch.

I now daily drive my one, it comes out at work when I need to focus, when I’m walking to sites, I put it on, when I go and have a coffee it sits pride of place on the table next to my magazine, the phone stays in my pocket. 

No streaming, no notifications, just albums loaded from CDs onto a mechanical hard drive that quietly whirrs when it boots. And honestly? It sounds great. The old iRiver EQ and SRS WOW processing still holds up surprisingly well.

And another note, I installed iRiver Plus on a windows 11 laptop from a CD-ROM, and it just worked! No issues, no out of date warnings like my Mac would do. And the 2005 UI of that software is just class! 

There’s something really satisfying about keeping this kind of tech alive — devices that were well engineered, purpose-built, and never meant to be disposable. It feels like preserving a small, forgotten chapter of digital music history.

Anyone else daily driving their old MP3 player… maybe you remember these?

Lots of love,

J

Before I start, this will be a long post, so grab a coffee and strap in if you're ready for some light (heavy) reading.

Let's start with the who's, what's, when's, where's and Why's.

Who: you and as many buddies as you like.
What: a gametype aimed at creating a fun game that everyone will enjoy.
When: I mean, thats up to you guys.
Where: come on man, same as above.

Why: Ah, the big one. Why? Because my i have 2 buddies who are always up for playing and we want to play together but have no official way to do so (triumph and treachery aside which didnt land well with us) we also have even more takers from time to time and wanted to accommodate! So, we made our own rules and have refined them over many games.

What you need:

- a board/table that is at least 5x4ft. This is preference, but if the board is too small it goes without saying, you may end up all blitzing turn 1.

-  whiteboard for scoring or your usual metho if it can accommodate multiple players. Also helps because for this, we will use our own battle tactics which no app will have.

- Time. It goes without saying these games will take longer. We usually start deploying around 10AM, start the game around 10:30 ish and dont finish until 4pm. Thats with 3 players, a 4th will push us to 5pm but we also only do 4 round.

The rules, lets jump in.

We stick to GW ruling as much as we can, so if in doubt, check what would happen in a normal game if possible, otherwise, roll for it!

Setup:

Hopefully you have 4 people but if not and do 3 often like us, we create a huge line in the shape of a Y in the middle of the board to create three territories and jiggle it until each opponent is 18"" away from eachother. This can mean turn 1 strikes, but they tend to be risky.

We normally use the standard GW scoring. 5 points for holding an objective, 2 points for holding 2 and 1 point for holding more than all other opponents.

Objectives/terrain. We switch this up every single game. The gametype itself will be what we call the ""gimmick"" and dictate one group of battle tactics (all players use the same battle tactics) one of which is aimed at the gimmick, and the other at general play.

Battle tactics:

2 groups as per GW rules, worth 5 points each. We usually keep the same 3 for group 1 and have the second group be based around the gimmick for that battle. Usual group below:

- deal damage to 2 opponents this turn (through any abilities)

- take part in melee combat with at least two opponents this turn.

- destroy two units, each belonging to a different enemy player.

This group we've found mostly stops the biggest issue 3 way, someone getting ganged up on. If you aren't actively trying to score the tactics (and therefore attacking multiple opponents, you simply wont win)

If you're having issues creating gameplans with gimmicks, feel free to hit me up!

Deployment:

Same as GW for this, no exceptions. If players tie when rolling for Deployment, they re-roll as they usually would until order is decided.

Once deployment is over, the player who finished dropping their army first will choose their place in turn order, followed by the person who finished deploying 2nd and so on. So if there are 4 players, player 1 finished 1st, they would choose whether to go 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th in the first battle round.

Taking turns and sequencing:

The longest and biggest changes we've made.

All players start with 4cp+ for each additibal player (so 3 way means 5cp) 

The active player takes their turn as normal and may target any player with their abilities.
All opponents may also use commands at their appropriate times during opponents turns. For example, player 1 is active, so players 2 &3 would both be able to use covering fire to shoot player 1 during the shooting phase.

This may seem problematic, however, CP is a scarce resource when playing with multiple players, and as above, you'll only have 5 in 3 way and 6 in 4 way. We also ruled that each subsequent time you use a specific command in a round, it will cost you +1CP with the exception of all out attack and defense (you may need these)

For example its round 1, player 2 may use covering fire against player 1, but should they choose to then use it during player 3's turn it will cost them 2cp meaning they've spent 3 total out of their 5/6. There are a lot of options to weigh up here.

Now, abilities. This is where it may get confusing so I'll try to be as precise as I can.

As above, the active player may target anyone with any ability, if you have a huge AOE ability, go for it.

However inactive players, may only target the active player with their abilities, with the exception of passive abilities (stick with me)

For example, player 1 is in combat with both players 2&3 with a single unit. Player 2&3 may only target player 1 during this combat, as they are the active player and any other abilities (such as rampages) may only target the active player also.

However, passive abilities are considered to be ""always on"" for example, if a unit has an ability that reduces ward saves within 6"" around them, it will hit all players, as it is a ""passive"" ability.

This may buff/debuff some things, but we've found it to be very fair amongst our pretty large array of armies.

Now, there is one exception to this rule, recursion abilities. We found these are already strong enough in the main game, and wpuld be wordlse if allowed to run rampant each turn (potentially) in multiplayer.

Abilites that heal in your own turn play as normal. Abilities that activate in your opponents turn, such as ""end of any turn"" like on clanrats, will only activate, if that unit has taken damage during that turn.

This means said clanrats cant get taken down to 1 model, retreat in their turn and sit there for possibly 4 more turns safe and getting back d3 models each time with no problem.

Again this may buff/debuff some units to a degree, but we've found it to be fair, and prioritising allowing armies to use their tools was paramount.

Notes:

I think that covers it for the most part, anything else i remember or answers to questions any of you may have i can pop in a comment or edit. Please reach out if you have any questions or even suggestions!

Edit:

- We sometimes weave the underdog mechanic in to the battleplan, but we do always give the player in last ""underdog"" +1cp at the start of the round.

- Some examples of gimmicks for the game include an arena in the center that only infantry heroes may enter (tactics based on the arena) and an ability table that is rolled on at the start of every round to mess with or help people's armies (tactics based around objective play). We've also had matches with edges closing in, destroying units ""camping"" forcing much closer fights and a goblin jumping around the map needing to be caught. If you want to try them hit me up.

- forgive the spelling error in the title, can't seem to change it!

Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this “piece of paradise” was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‘utopia’. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. 

Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise. 
30 Years Later 

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. 

When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since. 

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.
 Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.  

~The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry~


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. 

Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere. Today was no different. After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

 “You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure. 

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts “LEROY JENKINS!” As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.                

“Alright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished”, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. “It was all Noah’s idea” Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. 

“Hey! Throw me right under the bus, why don’t you?” 

Noah exclaims while laughing. “Sorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she’s the gymnast here. I’m pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.”  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven’s Quarry was dead silent.

 “So what do you guys wanna do first?” Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed. 

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry. 

“You coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan” Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‘who can hold their breath the longest’, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. “Can it possibly get better than this?” Shaun says with a cheesed grin. “I would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.” 
 
The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from. 

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven’s Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun’s head. “You already know what we have to do guys” 

“Absolutely not”, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. “We need to get out of here now.”

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‘s, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven’s Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups’s parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles’ heel. 


“I don’t think this is such a good idea”, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. “It’ll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.” Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn’t come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the surface, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. “Oh my god” Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying.

 “We have to go get sumbody”, Noah says while splashing around frantically. “No one’ll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves” Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. 

Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. “What the hell?”, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more. 

MMMMMMRRR- 

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. “H-Hello” he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone “it just sounds like…water.” Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. “What the fuck? NOAH!”, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely. 

“C’mon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!” Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‘s breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent. 

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he’s sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That’s what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

 Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. 

Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more. 


MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR- 

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call. 

“HELLO?” Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?” Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was — Shaun
. 
“Charlie…I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here, man”. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie’s ankles. “W-what!” As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above. 

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning. 

“HELP!” exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last “HE-“ before being fully submerged in Craven’s Quarry. Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again. 

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry. 

He takes out his radio and makes a call. 

“Hey boss, it’s Jerry. I just started my shift here at Craven’s for the day and uh…. I think it happened again.”

It's midnight when I return from the  Bolivia House banquet once the King is satisfied. 

I don't have my left leg yet, or my right arm. 

I'm still missing my fingers and toes, and my eye is rewriting itself. 

But my show is on TV.

I've been waiting for it all day, anticipating the newest episode like my own personal drug. So, dragging my two hundred and third body through the front door of Sam’s old house, I revel in a semblance of home. 

It's not home, though. Home is gone, and Sam’s house is all I have. I ignore Poppy’s body crumpled on the carpet. There's always a fresh bottle of coke in the refrigerator. I crack it open, taking a long sip. 

Despite the ugly smear of blood drenching the walls, the ceiling, and me, glueing my clothes to my flesh and my hair to the back of my neck, I can't help but smile. 

Laughter bubbles in my throat as my favorite show comes on. 

It's black and white, but so is everything else. The room around me is monochrome and wrong, but also right. 

There are too many doors and yet not enough. The TV flickers in and out of existence, and the floor prickles with static. 

Outside, the sky is a swirling mass of black and white. I look down at myself, at my own flickering outline devoid of features. 

When I find my reflection in the hollowed-out splinters of the TV screen, I see the void where my face should be—a gaping pool of oblivion with teeth. 

However, I don't feel anything, only a sweet, euphoric numbness slowly taking me over. 

The Bolivia House residents tell me to keep smiling and laughing. 

“Can we come out now?”

Hanna is still behind the curtain. I strictly told her to stay behind there no matter what. She's getting so big. Almost a month old, and Hanna is so grown up. 

Her small face peeks out, moonlit eyes illuminating the otherwise haunting black and white blanketing us. “Is it… safe to come out?”

“No, stupid head!” Jem grumbles from behind the other curtain. When the little boy risks a peek at me, his mouth is smeared scarlet, flecks of dried entrails stuck to his chin. 

Jem’s eyes widen and he leaps back behind the curtain. “We can't come out because of the bad people looking for us. We have to stay very still.”

""That's right."" I smile widely, my eyes flickering to the television screen. 

I ignore the children's faces. Even Lena, who refuses to come out from behind the curtain, only communicating with me through frightened squeaks. Their voices fade in and out of existence, and I crank up the volume to my favorite show. 

The scene begins on a roof. The main character struggles to maintain her balance, throwing out her arms. 

The girl has no appearance, no face, existing more as a silhouette. She crouches to a sitting position, sliding down to where another figure sits. 

It's a guy, sitting comfortably with his legs to his chest, a notepad and pen beside him. 

The first thing she sees is the light emanating from him, illuminating the night sky that is too black. 

There are no stars, no streetlights. Just peaceful oblivion. 

The boy has dark tousled hair, a pair of raybans sitting on top of his curls. 

His skin is made of static, and he's wearing the tatters of a shirt and jeans. 

When he turns around, his eyes, sharp and piercing, are filled with moonlight, reflecting a cold, almost otherworldly glow. 

I pause on him for a moment, drinking in eyes that are still human, still filled with emotion, even if the ethereal light splintering through his skin suggests otherwise. A scowl twists on his lips, defining the sharp angles of his face. 

He twists back around, pivoting his feet. “Urgh. Kaz told you.”

“Kaz is high as fuck right now.” The girl says, plonking herself beside him.

She offers him a beer, and he shakes his head, averting his gaze and subtly shifting away from her. 

She notices, but doesn't say anything. Instead, she cracks open the beer and gulps it down with a smile. “I can get pretty much anything out of him when he's toasted, and yes, he may have let slip that you like your midnight broods on the roof.”

“Brood?” The guy shifts further away from her again. “I'm not brooding. I'm thinking.” 

“Kaz said you would say that. In that exact tone.”

His lip quirks slightly, and it looks like he might laugh, before turning away. “Asshole.”

She sighs, hugging her legs to her chest. “Rowan.”

He stretches his legs out. “No, I haven't translated it yet.” He rubs his temples. “The words are hurting my head.”

“That's not what I wanted to talk about.”

He shuffles away from her. “Well, I've got nothing to say.”

I await her words, my heart jumping around in my chest. 

“I killed you,” she says softly, and I rewind it over and over again just to hear those words. Just to see the slightest flicker in his expression, the twist in his lips. Rowan doesn't look at her, his gaze caught in oblivion. 

Maybe he's subconsciously searching for the moon, because she's inside his head, entangled in his thoughts. 

But he is listening, and that's enough.

“I killed you under the influence, and I can't apologize because sorry doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem genuine,” she exhales a breath. 

“But if I could go back? If I could not be a coward and stay with you? Die the way I was supposed to, and be sacrificed to a fucking werewolf-worshipping cult? I would.”

He still doesn't look at her, and I see the moment he breaks apart, and yet somehow holds it together. I see his shuddering hands going to his lap, his fingers twisting together and apart. 

“Do you know what's funny?” he says, his voice cracking. “I really did think that you weren't going to run away. But when they killed Imogen, and then Kaz,” this time he does move away, significantly so, forcing himself further away from her. 

He looks so vulnerable, so small, but she keeps her distance this time. I can tell from the way she twists her body, the palms of her hands primed into fists, that she's ready to run away again. 

“When Kaz died on my shoulder, I heard his last breaths.” Rowan whispers. “I felt him go limp, his blood was all over me, and I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't fucking comprehend the idea of dying with him.”

He’s crying. 

His voice is tangled and muffled and he's shaking, tears rolling down his cheeks, tears that reflect the eerie glow of moonlight still swimming in his eyes, drowning the last lingering humanity he's fighting to hold onto. “But you still ran.” 

He buries his head in his knees, and she finds herself backing away slowly. “Kaz was fucking dead. Imogen had a knife through her head and was bleeding out. She was suffering. They were both fucking suffering, and that's all I can see.” 

Rowan’s laugh is twisted and wrong, and when he lifts his head, his eyes are one of a monster. “She makes me watch it. Over and over again. She forces me to watch you turn your back and run, while they suffer.” 

He starts towards her slowly, prowling like an animal, leaning closer and closer, until moonlight is all she can see. 

“I fucking hate you, Nin.” He says, his lips curving into a spiteful smile. “Not because of what you did to me, and not even for leaving us. I get it, you were under the influence. You didn't mean to plunge a knife through my skull, because the moon was in your head, right?” 

He laughs and his breath tickles her face, and I can still feel it, tracing my fingers over my own lips. 

“You didn't even look at them.” He retracted back in a flinch, like he was disgusted. Rowan gets to his feet, and Nin doesn't move. “You didn't look at me.” He continued in a snarl. “You turned away.”

“Rowan.” Her voice is surprisingly cold, and she follows him, standing up and taking a step towards him. This time, she doesn't stumble or use her arms to balance herself. It's my favorite part, and I grab the TV remote and pause it.

Hanna peeks behind the curtain again, her gaze flicking to the TV. I press a finger to my lips and she nods, diving back into obscurity. 

Onscreen, Rowan stays stubbornly still, his eyes narrowing. He's becoming more and more animal-like as the days go by and he doesn't eat. When she reaches out and grabs his hand, entangling their fingers together, his skin is almost static. 

Nin squeezes his wrist and he makes a face like a petulant child, but he doesn't pull away. “Has it ever crossed your mind that maybe she's doing it on purpose?”

His lip curls, but he doesn't say anything.

“You're right,” Nin says. “I did turn away, and I did want to run. I'm not going to lie to you and say I wasn't a coward.” When his expression twists, she continues before he can spout something sarcastic.

“But wouldn't you have done the same?” she whispered. “Tell me, right now, that if you were in my place and forced to watch your friends murdered right in front of you— someone you really fucking cared about—” her voice choked up.

“Do you honestly think the natural human reaction to *that* is to stay and have the same fate?” She stepped closer, and his expression hardens. 

“You said it yourself. Humans are selfish,” Nin says. “And I was a selfish human who couldn't watch my friends die. The woman who killed me said I would suffer for what I did, and *you* are my punishment.” She laughs, and so do I, mimicking her words. 

“That night, she commented on our relationship, airing out our…” Nin curls her lip. 

“Our distaste for each other.” When Rowan lets out a snort, she shoves him.

“She preyed on that,” Nin says and lowers her voice. “The private thoughts and feelings we had for each other. You thought I was selfish, and I thought you were a pretentious asshole—”

“Thanks.”

“That's what she's been doing. She took those initial feelings and twisted them. She's in your head, Rowan! She can puppeteer you anytime she likes, turning you into a bloodthirsty monster, or half werewolf, or whatever the fuck you are—”

“I'm not a werewolf.” He rolls his eyes. “We agreed on ‘moon afflicted creature.’”

Nin’s mouth twitches into a smile. “You ripped apart half of the town council.”

“Yes, as a *moon afflicted creature.*”

“You're in denial.” she says, her voice hardening. 

“I'm not in denial.” 

“Kaz is fine with being called a werewolf.”

 “Of course he is, the guy loves fantasy!”

“Yes.” She says. “But it's not fantasy. You're definitely changing under a full moon.”

Rowan is quick with a rebuttal, because of course he is. “Werewolves run on all fours and howl at the moon. Do *I* howl at the moon?” 

“I've seen you on all fours.”

He scrunches up his face, and she can't resist a laugh. “Yes.” He hisses in exasperation. “But do I pledge my undead doggy allegiance to the moon by sitting there and howling at the sky all night long?”

“Not… yet.”

His expression mirrored one of a wounded puppy. Ironic. “What do you mean *not yet*?”

She sighs. “ You, Kaz, and Imogen are the *origin* of a werewolf, a human being sacrificed to the moon whether that be willingly or not, with the ability to shift their flesh to one of a monstrous dog-like beast.”

“Yeah, but I can't do that.” He mutters stubbornly.

“You're stalling, Rowan.”

“So what if I am?” His expression twists. He’s building walls again, but she's used to it. “I'm not a werewolf. I'm a moon afflicted creature. I don't need your half-assed explanation you pulled from Kaz’s laptop.”

Nin folds her arms. “This is what I don't like about you. You have to be right about everything, and it drives me fucking crazy.”

He steps closer to her. “Oh, so you *do* hate me?”

Something contorts in her eyes, and my stomach twists. “You think I'm a childish, entitled brat, so yes, I’m not a fan of you.”

His lips tug into a smirk. “Because you *are*?”

“Well, you're obsessed with being right!” she spits back. “You're a pretentious, know-it-all  asshole who hides behind sarcasm because you're afraid of getting hurt.”

“Ouch.”

“See, that's what I mean!”

Rowan inclines his head. “I don't have to be right about *everything, Nin.*”

I can see the struggle on Nin’s face, and I can feel it too, a sudden suffocating sensation creeping up our throat and taking hold. “You thought you were right about the moon rising,” she says, and something snaps inside me. 

I reach for the remote to turn it off, but my fingers aren't fully formed yet. So, Nin continues while I panic. “And you were wrong.”

Her words twist my gut, and I can feel it again, even if I’m used to it, even if it's become part of me, I can feel the razor sharp sting of teeth tearing into my guts, phantom fingers clawing into my flesh. 

“You said you were safe, that moonlight couldn't get inside your head. You *said* you could block it out.”

I jump to my feet and try to switch off the TV by the outlet.

But the outlet was fried a long time ago.

“You *said* you would be okay.” Nin’s voice breaks into a sob on screen, and I'm crying too, suffocating, drowning in her tears. She shoves him back. 

Suddenly, he's on his knees in front of her–in front of me– his head tipped back. His eyes are so bright. I can see the ghost of something adorning his curls, something slicing into the flesh of his forehead. 

Color ignites to life amongst monochrome black and white, but I can only see thick rivulets of red beading down his face mixing with otherworldly moonlight. 

“You left me.” She all but laughs, breaking into hysterical giggles. 

“All three of you left me alone, and I don't know what to do. My head hurts, and I'm hungry, I'm so fucking hungry and you're not here. It's so fucking dark, and I need you to get a hold of yourself. I need the three of you to come home, all right?” 

She gulps in sobs. “It doesn't matter what you've done, or what she's made you do—I need you to come back.”

Her hands rip at her hair, and I don't even feel the sting of my fingernails digging into my scalp. I don't feel my static ponytail being torn out, strand by strand.

I find the remote on the floor and stab rewind with my index, my heart in my throat.

I press play, and everything is okay again. Everything is fine.

That night, I left as soon as Rowan Beck uttered the words, “You turned away.”

I left him on the roof, and I didn't turn back. I didn't think I had to.

But now I can change that. 

Onscreen, Nin laughs, and I watch Rowan’s expression crumple, his resolve splintering. 

“The moon has been filling your head with bullshit, brainwashing you into believing that running away and being scared isn't a natural human reaction—yes, I killed you, and you have every right to hate me.” She takes a steady breath, “But you have also been brutally killing and *eating* me to survive.”

He laughs, but it's surprisingly warm, like his old self. “Oh, wow. That's cold.”

“It's true.” 

“Yes, well, I *have* to eat you. If not, she'll punish me. You didn't *have* to kill me.”

“That's still eating me.” She says. “Also, like you, I had the moon singing in my head.”

Rowan cocks a brow. “Sooo, you're saying we’re even?”

She sighs. “I'm saying there's a time and a place to be an asshole and despise me.” 

I mimic her words. 

“When we figure out *what* you guys are, and what's happening to you, and why we can replicate, you're free to shut me out of your life and never talk to me again. Which I will understand, because I, you know, brutally murdered you and turned you into…this.”

Something lights up in his eyes, and he laughs. I’m aware I'm copying him word for word, reveling in his warm smile and the flecks of dancing orange in his eyes. 

He steps closer to her. “Oh, I'm a *this* now? You've skimmed right past werewolf and moon afflicted creature, straight to calling me *this*?”

“No.” Nin shrugs and prods at the light spiderwebbing across his cheek, delving her fingers into spilling moonlight that is surprisingly cold. 

She traces it all the way to his right eye, and he watches her, unblinking. “Whatever *this* weird shit is. How do you even do that with your face?”

“It's literally just my face,” he murmurs, wafting her hand away. “Can you stop touching me?”

“I don't hate you,” She says. “Yes, you're insufferable and hard to live with and yes, at one point I did want to push you into a ravine.” She paused. “I'm not saying I agree with the whole eating me thing, but I don't hate you for being forced against your will to eat me to survive.”

Rowan purses his lips, but he's hiding a smile.

“I'm not doiiiing this,” he says in a sing-song, and turns away from her. “Goodnight.”

Nin slumps back down, comfortably lying on her back. “Now who's running away?”

Rowan doesn't respond, but he does join her after a moment, slowly reclining his body into a lying-down position. His eyes stay on the sky, but occasionally flicker to her, curious, before quickly averting his gaze.

Neither of them speak, and Rowan is still keeping his distance, but the two of them are comfortable. I press pause, leaning back into the warm leather of the couch with a smile. The screen disappears in a blur of static, and I'm left staring dazedly at the hollowed-out skeleton of Sam’s TV.

“The End.” I say with a smile, and rewind it all the way back to the beginning. 

*Present*. 

Marlow State Library was divided into two distinct sections. The study area was filled with rows of desks and shelves with every book imaginable. 

Rustic walls and old-fashioned paintings clashed with the more modern aesthetic of vending machines and personal computer spaces with multiple screens. 

In contrast, the relaxation corner offered a cozy atmosphere with bean bags slumped around a flickering fireplace and ancient, patterned couches evoking the charm of dark academia novels. 

Ever since the sky had turned permanently black, I had found solace in researching moon afflictions.

Whatever my housemates were, and what this cult was planning, we had to be ready for it. I downloaded a program that was supposed to live-track the moon’s cycle, which was unpredictable. 

In Rowan Beck’s words, she had ""turned off the fucking sun.” 

So, the town was unsurprisingly freaking out. Still, being in the library was better than being at home. It was like living with three bratty teenagers. 

Rowan wanted nothing to do with me, transforming into a 23-year-old man-child, and Imogen was keeping her distance, ashamed, now I knew what she was. 

Kaz was only himself when he was high. Otherwise, he locked himself in his room and smoked weed until he was so toasted, he came knocking on *my door*. 

I don't know why he was surprised I didn't want to play Smash with him at 2 a.m. when he was both moon drunk *and* high.

If there's one thing Bolivia House residents lack, it's communication. 

It was a cloudy night, thankfully. But I wasn't putting my trust in the weather. If the moon wanted to, she could push through, and judging from the dim glow on the horizon, she was planning something. 

There was a small group of students on the other side of the library that had caught my attention. Maya Carlisle and her friends were slumped in the beanbags by the fire, Maya ranting about *devils* to her friends. 

Over the last few days, I had come to realize the moon had an effect on the students, turning them from level headed adults, to paranoid (and gullible) pre-teens. 

I had a bad feeling she wasn't talking about the satanic kind of devils. Maya was definitely a townie, and judging from her tone of voice, she knew my housemates’ kidnappers. 

Who we turned into plant killer. 

“Hey, Nin.”

Maya’s voice cut through my thoughts. 

I lifted my head, fashioning a smile. “Yeah?” 

Neither Maya, nor her group of friends, were smiling back. 

“You're friends with Sam Fuller, right?” 

I swallowed. “I used to be.”

“Did you know Sam wrote an article exposing his ex-boyfriend for being a devil?” Maya’s lips twisted in disgust, “And now he's coincidentally disappeared?”

“Devil?” one of her friends repeated in a snort.

Maya nodded, perching herself in one of the boy's laps. “Four legged beasts that once ruled this town in like, an eternal darkness.”

The guy laughed nervously. “Sooo, werewolves?”

I started to get up to escape, but Maya was already on my tail. “So, *what's* the deal with your housemates?” She asked, her voice a little too loud, and a little too high pitched. “You're not friends with those freaks, right? Imogen Prairie? You mean the slut who slept around freshman year.”

Her words sliced through me like the blunt edge of a knife. 

“Did you hear what she whispered to Chad at Abigail’s party? The fucking freak said she wanted to *taste* him.” 

The guy snorted. “Sounds like she knows how to party.”

Their loud chatter cut off when the library doors opened. 

There was no dramatic entrance, no loud bang.

And yet every gaze was suddenly on the two figures that strolled in. The first word that came to mind was *over-exposed.*

When they didn't eat, my friends were static outlines. However, when they *did* eat? 

At that moment, past feelings vanished. I always saw them as my older (and annoying) brothers. But I could feel the moon’s song inside me, digging around in my brain and forcing me to *look* at them. 

At *him.* 

Under the influence myself, I drank in every piece of them, my gaze drawn to every detail. Torso. Lips. Nose. Eyes. 

Every movement. 

Kaz's slight smirk as he whispered something, and Rowan's grumbled response. The freckles on their cheeks, Rowan's sharp jawline.

Somehow, the moon had scrubbed away every flaw, creating a new, otherworldly version of them. The light gave them an unearthly aura, and in my spinning thoughts, I found myself dizzy and almost giggly, like a child.

It was like my brain had been reduced to mush. 

Normally, they wouldn't attract such attention, but under the full moon, they were beacons. She was ensuring that—showing them off.

I couldn’t tell if it was the glasses hiding their moonlit eyes or the aura enhancing their simple jeans and sweatshirts. 

Rowan’s tousled hair peeked from under a beanie, while Kaz's shaggy locks were hidden beneath his hood. 

I couldn’t look away. I couldn't move or think. They were like Sirens, drawing the breath from my lungs and the voice from my throat.

It hit me when Rowan’s lips formed a smile, and across the room, one of Maya's friends jumped up, swaying, her expression blank, her smile wide.

They *were* sirens.

Though the spell didn't last long. 

After a moment of being enraptured by the light, I was released from the hold, able to breathe again. I blinked myself out of the trance, resisting the urge to drag them away. They were oblivious to their audience, speaking in murmurs, heads together in deep conversation. 

*Moon drunk.* 

Kaz laughed, which was alarming.

He never laughed in public. 

He'd sooner bury himself in the ground.

The carefree laugh, head thrown back, with no self-awareness?

Yeah. Definitely moon drunk.

I didn’t realize I was still gaping at them, locked into a dead eyed stare, when Rowan was suddenly standing directly in front of me, waving his hands in my face.

“Yo.” My housemate clicked his fingers impatiently when I failed to respond. 

“Nin, are you having a stroke?”

Behind them, the bewitched girl blinked, embarrassed, darting back to her friends. 

I found my voice. “What was *that?*”

Kaz chuckled next to him, slipping off his raybans and placing them on his head. He nudged Rowan. “Jeez. She's like our Mom.”

He leaned close, almost tipping over. “Don't worry! We’re in complete control.”

""You're moon tipsy."" I hissed. ""Where's Imogen?"" 

“She's doing Imogen things.” Kaz replied. He prodded my laptop screen. ""What are you working on?”

How Kaz thought I was going to believe he wasn't under the influence when he could barely speak through childish giggles was a mystery. “It’s tracking the moon,” I said impatiently, “Which is rising in under an hour, and both of you are exposed."" 

I shook my head. ""No. You're *already* exposed, and you left Imogen at home?” 

Risking a glance at Maya across the room, who was glaring daggers into Rowan’s back, I swallowed frustration building in my throat. “You two are either moon drunk or stupid.""

I stabbed the screen of my laptop. “The moon could rise at any moment. Do you remember the last time it did?” 

I caught Rowan’s eyes when he slipped off his Ray-Bans, an ethereal light glittering around his iris. 

“Café de *Nin*?” I emphasized my name, and Rowan laughed. Loudly. The librarian motioned for him to be quiet. 

“Aww! She thinks some foreign program can help us.” Rowan  reached across the table and ruffled my hair. “Adorable! It’s almost like she feels guilty for leaving us to die.”

When Kaz elbowed him, he mockingly  cleared his throat. “In, uhh, all seriousness! We are in control. Since it's only a teensy bit of moonlight, it's just like being high, and we are completely and totally..."" 

Rowan burst out laughing, setting Kaz off too, the two of them howling like two hyenas. It was like looking after children. 

Rowan caught me by surprise, wrapping his arms around me, snuggling into my shoulder. Rowan wasn't a hugger, so his spontaneous act of affection was odd, to say the least.

“We’re fine.” He whisper-snorted into my chest. “We are always one thousand steps ahead of her.”
 
Kaz, with the biggest grin on his face, nodded. ""You were the one who exposed us.” 

“I was trying to get away from you after finding you eating my mutilated corpse.” I said dryly. 

Rowan stepped back, folding his arms. “You still exposed us. Also!” He leaned close, his lips finding the bridge of my ear, his tone splintering into ice. His mood swings needed to be studied. “Need I remind you, that you, yes *you*, murdered us and left us for dead to a psycho cult.”

“The moon can rise and fall whenever she wants to right now, and you two are just winging it?""

The two of them grinned like little kids, nudging each other. 

“Maybe.”

Rowan took a seat, his knee knocking against mine. 

I tried my best to ignore him playing jenga with my books. “Do either of you realize you're giving off a Siren effect right now?” 

“So, we look good?” Rowan paused in murdering my notes, sending me a pensive look.

“You look like two overexposed polaroids.”

""I'll take that as a compliment!"" He noticed my wary glance, tightening his fingers around the flask. “Thirsty?” Rowan flashed me a grin with a little too many teeth. 

I could glimpse the shadow of the moon’s light slowly blooming behind his eyes. 

“It’s amazing what you can do when you blend up the human intestine.” He pointed at himself, “I'm more of a bone type of guy, but Kaz *loves* your large intestine. They're like gourmet sausages for him.”

I could feel myself retracting back in my chair, my toes curling, barf searing my throat.

My housemates must have seen my expression, the two of them sharing a look. 

The kind of look your little brothers have when they’ve just put a whoopie cushion under your seat.  “I'm kidding.” Rowan said, his smile widening. “It's coffee, Nin.”

His lips curved around the rim, ""Or *is* it?"" 

“Behave.” Kaz threw on his jacket, and once again, just his movements were drawing attention from strangers. 

“I'm going to head to the town meeting before the moon rises. I’ll pick up some pizza on the way home and we can play board games.” He patted Rowan on the head. “Don't kill each other!”

Before either of us could reply, Kaz left us in an awkward silence. 

I turned my attention to my laptop, Rowan burying his head in his arms. 

“Did you translate what was carved into my ceiling?” I asked. 

He nodded, pulling out his notebook. “The Kings and Queen must be crowned to be complete.”

I followed the ancient scribbles with my pen. “Like, turn royals into werewolves?”

Rowan’s lip curled. “Do not say that word.”

“What? *Werewolves*?”

He didn't get a chance to reply before thick beads of crimson red were trickling down his face, tracing jagged paths over too-pale skin. I blinked rapidly, my heart pounding. But it wasn’t blood.

When I lurched back in my chair, my vision cleared. Maya Carlisle was standing behind my housemate, pouring half a bottle of water over his head. Rowan was soaked, his hair plastered to his head, but he didn’t show any visible reaction except blinking water out of his eyes. 

Maya’s dark gaze met mine. “Did you know the human body is 60% water? The moon affects the tides, so it must have an effect on water, too. I heard that water from the river can reveal town devils hiding in plain sight.”

When I couldn’t speak, Rowan turned to the girl. He didn’t look pissed. If anything, he was amused.

""I’m sorry, *Devils*?"" Spitting out water, my housemate wiped his face with the sleeves of his jacket. “Enlighten me on your clear psychotic break, Maya.” 

He started to take off his glasses, and I kicked him under the table.

Maya dropped the bottle. “You don’t sound like you’re up to date with the lore, Beck.” She said. “Devils. People without shadows.” 

She got close to him, far too close for comfort, “People who can transform into beasts.” I caught his fingernails digging into the desk, something inhuman flickering in his expression he was trying to keep neutral.

Instead of giving into the moon, he shot her a grin. “Are you *hitting* on me, Maya?”

Maya’s expression contorted with disgust. “I’m not falling for your games.” She spat. “You transformed into a monstrous devil and murdered Sam Fuller and those missing students and townies didn't you?”

Rowan frowned, pulling off his glasses. “Missing students? What are you talking about?”

Maya's friends dragged her away before she could elaborate. 

I handed him my jacket to dry himself. “Ignore her. The moon is making everyone crazy.”

Rowan groaned, running a hand through damp curls. “The townies are talking about Devils. Which means some of them are stupid enough to believe our kidnappers. If people start talking, we'll be suspects, and if they start sniffing around…”

""The town council,"" I said. ""Who are also six feet under in our yard.""

""Weeee should probably go."" Rowan’s gaze flashed to the blinds. ""She’ll be making her move soon.""

His phone vibrated. ""It's Immie,"" he murmured, frowning at the screen.

Rowan was staring at his phone for way longer than necessary, and it reminded me of that look—the certain dazed look he got under the full moon's influence when his gaze caught something reflective. 

I opened my mouth to speak, to snap him out of it, before he lifted his head, his brown eyes wide and frenzied. 

His hair was still damp, strands glued to his forehead. ""Apparently, they're rounding up freshmen.” he jumped to his feet, his eyes growing progressively darker. Rowan had a strange grace, despite clearly panicking. 

He tucked the chair under the table before power-walking to the exit, nodding a silent goodbye to the librarian.

I followed, my heart diving into my throat. We were out the door in a single breath, with Rowan taking two steps at a time down the stairway, tugging his hood up. ""We're fucked,"" he said in a hiss. ""It's the Salem witch trials all over again, except yes, we uh, are definitely guilty for, you know...""

""Focus, Rowan,"" I said. ""What's the plan?""

“I… have no idea. They've been luring us since the town meeting announcement, and Kaz just walked directly into a trap.”

""They know about you?""

He walked backwards, fixing his raybans on the crown of his head. 

""Somehow! I'm guessing this isn't the first time our cult friends have used out-of-towners as sacrificial lambs, and my guess is this time they actually succeeded.”  He stumbled, and I grabbed him, helping him up. Rowan shoved me away, his lip curling in disgust. 

“Hands off,” he spat. “I can walk on my own.” When he swiped my hand off his shoulder, I backed off. “Anyway. The town is following a protocol set in place for this kind of shit. Which means they know about the moon and her converting freshen into werewolves, as well as the cannibalism.” 

He bounded toward the exit doors. “You said that group of psychopaths called us devils. Just like Maya Carlisle. Which means it's only a matter of time before—""

When his phone slipped from his grasp and shattered on the ground, I ran straight past him. Rowan was a klutz, after all.

But then he… stopped, skidding to a halt. 

The automatic door was open, leading out of the college's reception, but my housemate stood on the threshold, perfectly still. At first, I thought we had been cornered, that townies had figured out where we were. But Rowan didn't look scared or threatened.

Instead, his head was tipped back, his half-lidded eyes gracing the harvest moon which had risen earlier than I thought, taking over the sky, bathing everything below, including my housemate's face, in milky white light.

For a moment, I was transfixed by him. 

Rowan Beck, a devil (werewolf) in plain sight.

Just like Maya said.

The moon loomed over us, casting her glow on my housemate, revealing his lack of shadow, and filling his eyes with that light I was all too familiar with by now. 

Unlike last time, it was fast. 

No longer slow, bleeding into him—it drowned him, giving him no time to breathe, to fight her breaking into his mind. Before I could hesitate, I grabbed him, pulling him out of the allure, and he stumbled into my arms, light as a feather. 

""Fuck,"" I thought. ""Rowan,"" I said, trying to swallow my panic. The possibility of him lunging at me and ripping out my throat lingered at the back of my mind, but I stood my ground despite every instinct inside me telling me to get away. When he started forward, I grabbed his sleeve. 

His eyes found nothing, oblivion, except the illuminated sky above us. 

His gaze was distant, like he was being pulled by invisible strings. “Snap out of it,” I said shakily. I shoved him, and he didn't move, only swaying to the left, his eyes glued to the sky. “Remember what you said? If you don’t push her out, *that’s* what’s going to happen.” 

He ignored me, pushing past, like the moon herself was leading him away. I yanked my jacket out of my bag and handed it to him, my hands trembling.

“Use this as a blindfold. You need to get out of the moonlight.”

He didn't move, didn't blink, his eyes swimming with her. 

""Are you still looking for Sam?"" His voice was strangely melodic.

“What?”

“Sam.”

Under the moon's influence, his smile was cruel and I could believe the cult woman's words. 

That he was her soldier, a monster of her making, every piece of him shattering and coming apart, and entwining to become the beast she envisioned. 

Rowan’s head tipped unnaturally onto his shoulder, his voice hypnotising. ""Your friend who tortured us when you were supposed to be protecting us.” 

I took a step back, and then another, adrenaline kicking my body into overdrive.

She was speaking *through* him.

“Sam has nothing to do with me,” I managed to choke out.

Rowan backed me into the wall, his mouth splitting into a grin. “There you go again,” he sang, his voice was almost a melody, a song bleeding into my skull, numbing my thoughts. “Lying to save your own skin.” 

His arm whipped out, his hand wrapping around my neck, claw-like fingernails piercing my throat. But I couldn’t move.

Something in his eyes was new; that ethereal light I was used to was spreading and filling his pupils. His skin was splintering again, moonlight leaking out—but not because he was starving.

She was doing this to him, breaking him apart right in front of me, tearing into flesh until bright red pooled, mixing with her startling allure. He laughed like a child, beads of moonlight trickling down his chin.

“You are a fool.”

Black spots speckled my vision as I fought for precious breath. The world around me blurred and dimmed, the edges of my consciousness slipping away. I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t reply, choking on my own sobs.

I don’t remember him snapping my neck, but I do remember waking up, curled into a ball, foggy because I have no memories of those copies of myself. 

The copies ripped apart. This time, there are no gaps in my brain, no shadows in my memories. 

I remember still being half static when he dragged me into the dark. 

Under the full moon, I lay on my back while my housemate tore into me slowly, so he knew I’d feel everything. Every pinch of his teeth piercing my flesh, his fingers snapping my bones. Once. Twice. 

Three times. 

I had only ever had nightmares of feeling it. 

I had never felt the sensation before—of being eaten alive. 

Dying, over and over and over again, just for his satisfaction.

It was the kind of pain, the kind of mental agony, that made me beg for a quick death. 

Being rolled onto my back so I could see the glistening cavern of nothing, static struggling to make up from what was missing, what was caught between his teeth, slithering strands of red drenched in moonlight seeping around me in a halo. 

Until death choked me back out.

When I did come back, I was in the Bolivia House basement, forced into a bowing position. 

The stark orange glow of candlelight felt warm, almost comforting. 

Until I lifted my head, and saw my best friend’s decapitated head pierced on a wooden stake. Sam’s body had been laid out in front of me, surrounded by fruit and berries, glasses of wine and strips of meat.

“Eat.”

The old woman stood behind me, her voice soothing. 

Bolivia House's basement was filled with cave-like markings of four legged beasts. “You must eat before the  coronation, child.” The woman's words filled my head, and before I could stop myself, I was reaching out and grabbing fistfulls of fruit, cramming them into my mouth. 

I couldn't stop myself, my hands were no longer mine, grasping for Sam’s body, and– I stopped for a moment, my mind clearing. Sam’s torso had been perfectly laid out as a meal, like a pig at a buffet. 

But shuffling closer, choking on berries filling my mouth, I could have sworn I saw numbers carved into his neck. 

*1,567.*

“Eat.”

I blinked, and under her dazzling light, I did. 

I stuffed my face until my mouth was full of my best friend, and I was choking on him, trying to drown his taste with bitter tasting wine. 

I was yanked to my feet when Sam’s bones peeked through raw strips of flesh. 

I don't remember screaming or crying, just smiling. 

I was so happy.

Because I was going to be their *stomach*. 

“Kneel.” 

The woman's voice wasn't directed at me, but I still did, my body flopping to the ground, my limbs were no longer mine. 

Imogen knelt first, her smile dream-like, moonlit eyes unblinking and inhuman. 

When a crown of entwined human bone was forced onto halo hair, the moon bathing her face and drowning her eyes, that last glimmer of my best friend splintered, hollowing her out completely. 

Kaz was next, dropping to his knees and allowing the woman to adorn his curls with splintered bone. He didn't look at me or Sam, or anyone. 

Kaz Delacroix was gone, surrendering himself, mind, body and soul, to the light filling his eyes and contorting his mind into one of a starving, mindless–

King. 

The words carved into my ceiling grazed the back of my mind, delayed and blurry. 

*”The Kings and Queen must be crowned to be complete.”* 

My dazed eyes found the carvings on the wall. 

When Rowan joined the others, kneeling next to Kaz, the lights flickered out. 

I remember it in flashes. 

Rowan bowed his head, and what was left of Sam’s skull adorns his dark curls.

I remember his eyes flickering out, just like that. 

Everything that was him… gone, replaced with mesmerising, horrifying light.

The woman and her friends were screaming, crying, laughing in delight. 

“A new age begins!” She shrieked, her voice slamming into me. 

Above us, the moon turned blood red, casting a hellish glow. 

I remember Rowan’s growing maniacal grin, his skin rippling, his face contorting under bleeding moonlight bathing his face. 

The ground rumbled, my vision blurred, color turning to monochrome nothing, and my world as I knew it came to an end…

Discovered specific keyword gaps. For example, people were searching for “coffee gift boxes for new dads.” I made a simple page for it and it brought in more sales than my main homepage for a few weeks.  
  
Set up behavior-based email flows. If someone browsed a product but didn’t buy, they got a friendly reminder or small offer later. Super easy setup and it brought in waaay more conversions.

1pmps73,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pmps73/the_phone_at_the_bottom_of_cravens_quarry/,The Phone At the Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry,"Cutoff from the outside world, sat Mulligan’s Valley, a small rural town in McKinney, Texas. Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this “piece of paradise” was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‘utopia’. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy
. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan’s Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you’d think that they’d lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise. 
30 Years Later 

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan’s Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven’s Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there’s been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since. 

Mulligan‘s dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.
 Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b’s and c’s in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.  

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven’s Quarry


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie’s room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. “How can you possibly sleep through that?” She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, “I can’t, but usually there isn’t a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up”.  “I set that for 8:15, it’s spring break, why do this to me?” Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. “Blame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn’t skip today.” Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere. Today was no different. After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie’s best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. “WATCHU DOIN’ IN THERE?” Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic “ha ha” before opening the window to let Shaun in.

 “You almost ready?” Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. “Tracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.” “Yeah, give me one sec”, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure. 

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven’s Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts “LEROY JENKINS!” As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.                

“Alright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished”, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. “It was all Noah’s idea” Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. “Hey! Throw me right under the bus, why don’t you?” Noah exclaims while laughing. “Sorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she’s the gymnast here. I’m pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.”  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven’s Quarry was dead silent. “So what do you guys wanna do first?” Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed. 

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry. 

“You coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan” Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‘who can hold their breath the longest’, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. “Can it possibly get better than this?” Shaun says with a cheesed grin. “I would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.” 
 
The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from. 

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven’s Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun’s head. “You already know what we have to do guys” 

“Absolutely not”, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. “We need to get out of here now.”

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‘s, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven’s Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups’s parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles’ heel. 


“I don’t think this is such a good idea”, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. “It’ll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.” Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn’t come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the surface, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. “Oh my god” Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying.
 “We have to go get sumbody”, Noah says while splashing around frantically. “No one’ll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves” Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. 
Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. “What the hell?”, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more. 

MMMMMMRRR- 

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. “H-Hello” he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone “it just sounds like…water.” Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. “What the fuck? NOAH!”, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely. 

“C’mon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!” Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‘s breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent. 

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he’s sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That’s what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

 Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more. 


MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR- 

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call. 

“HELLO?” Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. “WHO THE HELL IS THIS?” Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was — Shaun
. 
“Charlie…I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here, man”. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie’s ankles. “W-what!” As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above. 

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning. 

“HELP!” exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last “HE-“ before being fully submerged in Craven’s Quarry. Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again. 

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry. 

He takes out his radio and makes a call. 

“Hey boss, it’s Jerry. I just started my shift here at Craven’s for the day and uh…. I think it happened again.”

1pmprlk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmprlk,"Sundays meals. Tasmania, Australia.","I'm still here, and still here. (Like a fly you won't get rid of for a while.)

Breakfast was (EXPENSIVE, especially the gluten free one????!) granola. For those who aren't Australian, Carman's is the bougie stuff. You KNOW it'll be a 10/10. This is where the hospital budget must have gone to. 
I'm still feeling pretty gross, so I'm thankful that the feeds are tapering up to giving me all the nutrition that I need. 

Feeling icky doesn't stop me from wandering down to the hospital cafe (literally directly below my ward so I don't have to go to far 💜) and getting a real latte and brownie 7/10 for flavour, but 10/10 to be able to get off the ward and pretend to be average. Although afterwards I did notice that they also sell those Byron Bay cookies, and I've never had one before so that might be what I choose today if I'm up to it. (Today's Monday now, I just fell asleep before I could post yesterday) 

Lunch was zucchini slice, mixed vegetables, one of those mini packs of sandwiches (that I saved for later just incase) and this strange looking pudding thing(?) everything and even the other patients meals smelt too strong and I had to go sit in the hallway because I felt like I was going to puke. I'm not even going to rate it because I literally just took a picture for y'all and ran away.

Dinner was Irish stew 5/10. I don't have much to say here. Maybe my tastebuds are oversensitive or something because it feels like everything I put in my mouth is too vibrant (for lack of a better word) I stole the plain cheese and egg salad sandwich from the mini-pack and put the tomato and ham ones into the pack in the picture because hospital tomato is not very fun at all. The cup is just instant coffee, so it gets. 6/10 because even though it was awful, coffee is coffee. 

Hope you're all having a better time than I am.

I was worried! She said that she wanted to go and see her manager at the office but when she called the office they said her manager won't be working so she came back home right away and never left our building! I said but I know you were not at our building and you were in front of home depot! Then she said well yeah I didn't want to tell you this because I wanted to surprise you for our anniversary so that's why I went too early to buy some stuff and carboards to make you a handcraft! (Even though she never made a single handcraft in her life), I was so stupid and I thought she's telling the truth, later that night I had to wake up around 11pm because I had to go to work and work overnight, so she woke me up, she packed my food, I was still a bit sleepy so she helped me with my suit, then she took me to my workplace and we had coffee together and conversation about going on a trip, then she said she has headache and left, before she leaves she told me that she will come and pick me up in the morning, after 3-4 hours later around 5am, she sent me a text while I was at work and said: hey I'm leaving you, don't try to contact me and have a good life!

1pmpqw5,https://i.redd.it/jajptb3vm47g1.png,Ginkgo Biloba: The Ancient Tree of Memory,"Ginkgo biloba, also known as the **maidenhair tree**, is one of the oldest tree species on Earth, dating back over **200 million years**. Native to **China**, its fan-shaped leaves have been used in **traditional medicine** for centuries to support **circulation, memory, and longevity**. Today, ginkgo is one of the **most studied herbal supplements**. Its leaf extract, especially the standardized form **EGb 761**, contains natural **flavonoids and terpenoids** that act as **antioxidants** and help **improve blood flow**. Because of this, ginkgo is often taken to support **brain and heart health**.





# Positive Health Effects (The ""Why"")

# Memory Support

Decades of research show it  **improves blood flow to the brain**, **protects nerve cells**, and **reduces oxidative stress**—factors that support mental clarity and focus.

Standardized ginkgo extract **(typically 120–240 mg daily)** may **improve memory, attention, and processing speed**, both in healthy adults and those with **mild cognitive impairment**. In people with dementia, including **Alzheimer’s disease**, long-term use has been shown to **slow cognitive decline** and help stabilize symptoms, though it does not prevent the disease.



# Anxiety and Mood Balance

Ginkgo biloba may help **reduce anxiety and support emotional balance**. Clinical studies show that taking it for several weeks can **slightly reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety**. Researchers believe ginkgo works by **improving blood flow to the brain** and **influencing neurotransmitters** like **serotonin and dopamine**, which affect mood and stress response. Some studies also suggest it may help ease the **sexual side effects of antidepressants (SSRIs)**.



# Improved Blood Circulation

It helps **improve blood flow throughout the body** by relaxing and widening blood vessels—a process called **vasodilation**. This effect comes from its **terpene compounds** (like *ginkgolides* and *bilobalide*), which support healthy circulation in both the brain and the extremities**, enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery**.

Research shows that ginkgo can **reduce leg pain and increase walking distance** in people with **poor circulation** or **peripheral artery disease**. It may also support **heart health** by helping lower blood pressure and improving the function of blood vessel walls.



# Antioxidant

It helps protect the body from **oxidative stress**, a major factor in aging and chronic disease. Its **flavonoid compounds**, such as **quercetin** and **kaempferol**, work by **neutralizing free radicals** and **reducing inflammation**, helping protect brain cells and blood vessels from damage.

It also supports **mitochondrial function**—the tiny energy centers inside our cells. By shielding them from oxidative damage, Ginkgo helps maintain **cellular energy.**



# Vision and Hearing

Ginkgo biloba may support **eye** and **ear** health by improving **microcirculation** and providing **antioxidant** protection; studies suggest it can help blood flow to the optic nerve and may slow vision loss in **glaucoma** and **age‑related macular degeneration**, while evidence for **tinnitus** is mixed and strongest when the cause is poor circulation, so consult a healthcare professional before trying it.



# Possible Negative Effects (The ""What to Avoid"")

Ginkgo biloba can cause serious problems for some people: it raises **bleeding** risk and interacts with **blood thinners** (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel) so stop it at least two weeks before surgery; it can trigger **seizures** in people with epilepsy (raw seeds contain the neurotoxin ginkgotoxin), may cause **low blood pressure**, and commonly causes mild **dizziness, headache, or stomach upset**; it can interact with **antidepressants (SSRIs), anticonvulsants, and diabetes medicines**, its long‑term safety isn’t well studied, and it should be avoided during **pregnancy**, by those with bleeding disorders, and used with caution in **older adults**—consult a healthcare professional before taking it.

Never eat **raw ginkgo seeds** — they contain **toxic** ginkgotoxin and cyanogenic glycosides that can cause severe reactions including convulsions.



# When to consume

Take ginkgo in the **morning or early afternoon** for cognitive or energy benefits, always **with a meal** to improve absorption and cut stomach upset; consistency matters more than exact timing, avoid taking it late in the day if it makes you feel alert. Clinical studies have used standardized leaf extracts safely for **up to 6 years**.



# How to consume

Ginkgo is best taken as a **standardized leaf extract** (look for 24% flavonoid glycosides and 6% terpene lactones, often labeled EGb 761) in **capsule or tablet** form for consistent effects; typical doses are **120–240 mg per day**, often split into 2–3 doses (for cognitive decline some studies use 40 mg three times daily), start low to test tolerance, take with meals for better absorption and less stomach upset, and avoid raw leaves or seeds.



# Synergistic Nootropic Combinations

Pair Ginkgo with **Panax ginseng** for a nootropic boost; ginkgo improves blood flow while ginseng adds mental energy and endurance, together supporting **memory, focus, and clearer thinking.**

Combine Ginkgo with a high‑quality **omega‑3 (fish oil)** so Ginkgo improves circulation while omega‑3s provide the building blocks for healthy brain cells, supporting **long‑term cognitive health.**

Stack Ginkgo with **vinpocetine** to enhance cerebral blood flow and add targeted neuroprotection; this mix can help concentration and reaction time by improving oxygen delivery and **reducing inflammation in the brain.**

Use Ginkgo alongside **citicoline** and **acetyl‑L‑carnitine (ALCAR)** to support **acetylcholine production and brain energy;** Ginkgo helps release neurotransmitters while citicoline/ALCAR supply raw materials for memory and focus.

Combine Ginkgo with **beetroot juice** to amplify **vasodilation**; the pair improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain and body for **better performance and stamina**.

Pair Ginkgo with **ashwagandha** so Ginkgo supports circulation and cognitive function while ashwagandha lowers stress hormones and protects against stress‑related memory decline, creating balanced, **long‑term brain support**.

Add **magnesium, zinc, and B vitamins** to a Ginkgo regimen to correct nutrient gaps that hinder brain function; these micronutrients support energy, nerve health, and vascular protection, making Ginkgo’s benefits more sustainable.

Mix Ginkgo with **L‑theanine** to promote relaxed alertness; Ginkgo improves focus and blood flow while L‑theanine smooths anxiety and boosts **calm concentration** for clearer, steadier thinking.



# Ginkgo Powder Tracking

To get the most out of Ginkgo Beloba, consistency is key. Use the [Vitamin app](https://apple.co/42OdSEx) developed by [Martspec to log doses](https://martspec.com/vitamin), set reminders, and track your intake. [https://apple.co/42OdSEx](https://apple.co/42OdSEx)



# How to make Ginkgo Powder:

Dry and clean the leaves first: rinse fresh ginkgo leaves, pat dry, then air‑dry in a warm, shaded place or use a dehydrator at low heat until fully crisp. Remove any stems and crush the dried leaves by hand so they break into smaller pieces before further processing.

To make powdered leaf: grind fully dried leaves in a spice grinder, coffee mill, or high‑speed blender until you get a fine powder. Sift if you want a finer texture, then store the powder in an airtight, dark container in a cool, dry place. Use small amounts (start with 250–500 mg) because whole‑leaf powder is less concentrated than standardized extracts.



# How to make Ginkgo Extract:

To make a simple tincture (alcohol extract): place chopped dried leaves in a clean glass jar and cover with 40–80% alcohol (vodka) at a ratio of about 1 part dried leaf to 5–8 parts alcohol by weight/volume (common household measure: \~1 cup dried leaf : 2–4 cups vodka). Seal, shake daily, and let sit in a cool, dark place for 4–6 weeks. Strain through cheesecloth, bottle the liquid in dark glass bottles, label with date, and store away from light. Typical dosing of homemade tincture varies; standardized products are easier to dose reliably.

The extract or tincture is a concentrated (compared to powder) liquid that pulls out the active flavonoids and terpenoids for stronger, easier dosing.",1,1765748232.0,u_Antique_Way_3813,0,1.0,False

I tried a few “creative” methods at first:

* Stuck it in a drawer labeled “Important Stuff” (because genius logic)
* Took a photo and emailed it to myself (hackers loved me)
* Wrote it down on paper… and spilled coffee on it

After these disasters, I realized: your seed phrase needs to survive **fire, water, and human error**. Offline, durable storage is the key. Some people use metal plates, some try NFC cards, some bury it in a safe… the method doesn’t matter as much as **making sure it can survive everything life throws at it**.

Curious how other people handle this — any creative (safe!) methods out there?",1,1765748160.0,u_LoudAd3467,0,1.0,False

A hollow in the bed I feel.

I hear your laugh in someone’s call
A faded photograph upon the wall.

We built a world in whispers, deep and low,
Now I don’t miss you and that’s how I know.

This is how a fire dies,
Not with rage, but in soft sighs.
Just the quiet dimming of the light within your eyes.

We were a symphony, now just an echo in the hall
This is how a fire dies: no sound, no spark at all.

Your coffee cup sits by the sink,
A half-read book of poems in faded ink.

I wear your shirt to feel the chill,
The space you left, time cannot fill.

And every “maybe” that we held so tight
Has turned to dust and vanished in the night.

I lit a candle for the “us” that’s gone,
Watched the wax run toward the dawn.

All the words we didn’t say
Are just ghosts that drift away.

No more battles left to win
Just the silence settling in.

So goodbye in slow motion, frame by frame,
A love that once was wildfire, now just a name.

And if you ever wonder how it ends,
It’s not with breaking  just with bends,
Until the light goes out.

My mom had a total knee replacement about 5 days ago. For the past week, my brother and I have been providing 24-hour care, taking turns being with her. She’s doing well overall and can safely use her walker, get in and out of bed, and move around the house.

The one thing she still really struggles with is carrying items while using the walker, especially things like a plate of food or a cup of coffee. She does have a small bag attached to the walker, but it’s not very practical for hot drinks or meals.

Starting tomorrow, my brother and I both have to return to work, so she’ll be on her own during the day. I’m trying to problem-solve now to make sure she can eat and drink safely without risking a fall or spill.

For those of you who’ve been through this:

	•	How did you carry meals or drinks while using a walker?

	•	Are there specific walker accessories or hacks that worked well?

	•	Any tips for managing hot drinks safely?

Thank you so much in advance — I really appreciate any advice or ideas from people who’ve actually lived this.",2,1765748010.0,Kneereplacement,6,1.0,False

Well, I am finally getting zoned in to making good pour over cups! I got the K-Ultra grinder and finally forced myself to commit to a single recipe that I found from a YouTuber, which I feel is a common ""good starting point"" recipe.  It's basically... V60 method, standard filter (not slow), 96 C, 15g coffee, 5 even pours of 50g, with total water of 250g... low agitation (only stirring on the bloom), and drawdown time is usually between 3-3:30.  I also prepared a couple jugs of ""coffee"" water with around 90-100 TDS (using TWW product). 

Grinder was set around 0.8.0 at first, but brews were definitely under-extracted and left a ""dry mouth"" experience. I am not great at the taste/detection stuff to help direct my next brew, but I was able to detect the dry mouth for sure and that dropped my grinder down to 0.6.5 and then I even tried 0.6.0 and I could definitely taste the bitter notes dominating and so that was good for me to experience/learn. So I finalized around 0.6.3 and got some amazing cups. Once I had that great experience, I started playing around a bit with the doses for each pour to pull out different notes from this coffee bag. I'm able to pickup the win (sauvingnon blanc) and one brew had more fruity notes that was REALLY exciting. I want to get that fruity note really stronger cuz that's what I love but without losing too much body.  

My question is, how to get those stronger fruity notes? Any advice here would be much appreciated.  Here's a few recent brews I tried (variances on the dose per pour):

Brew 1:  40/40/70/50/50  
Notes: More wine, smooth, clean, amazing

Brew 2: 40/90/40/50/30  
Notes: Not good; felt more acidic but not balanced at all

Brew 3: 50/40/60/50/50  
Notes: Fruitiness finally shines from the cup; good balance/body, but I feel it can be drawn out even more.. 

Thanks in advance! :)

My time in Varanasi is almost over, lived here for a year and 3 months and will be living for 2-3 more months ig, but that's it, I will finally be leaving this place without making any friends good enough to rely on, if get into a trouble at let's say mid night or something, but made enough acquaintances who will happily host me if I ever come to this city again...
These last months are gonna be emotional for me... Hated a lot of things about this place especially the Gandagi, but this was my first time living on my own and I made some really nice memories too...
I will miss sitting at the balcony of the pizzeria cafe at assi Ghat, earphones plugged in, listening to some heavy metal or radiohead songs, I never in my life had any love for chai, but omg banaras ki chai with those biscuits... Those small outlets of cold coffee, soda, mohito, I would visit regularly and how they would recognise me and make a special one for me... Ughhh gonna miss them ...
This was the first place where people know me as ""XYZ "" and not the son or grandson of ""zyx""...
But this is life, even though I just wanted to run away the first day I shifted to this place, this one is still gonna stay with me forever ( especially because I fell in love for the first time, while living here and got my heart broken too, here only ) 

Soo many sweet and sour memories...

But one this is for sure, this is the beginning.
I have always dreamed of roaming around, cities to cities, countries to countries and when I will write about my life or when someone will look into how my life's been with even the slightest of interest, they will always find Varanasi as the beginning of the journey.

I may leave this place but a small portion of my heart will always stay here, and hopefully I will make more memories in these upcoming 2-3 months ✨✨✌🏾",6,1765747945.0,varanasi,1,1.0,False

Arrive in Santiago 
-holiday inn hotel is right next to airport. Walkable. $169 to rent during the day for sleep/shower. Right outside terminal 1 which is where the LATAM Flight to Punta Arenas is. 
Stay at hotel plaza in Punta arenas. $111 for two with breakfast included. $15, 22 min uber from the airport. Easy peasy. 
Walk to bus station (in town) - 9 min walk
Bus to PN 
Container hotel is 2 minute walk to/from bus station. Highly recommend. 
Fill water bladder with 2L so you can just get going once off the shuttle (the rest of your water you can get at the campsites/refugios for free)
Take 7 am bus PN to TDP entrance. 2 hrs. Free WiFi 
$5 shuttle to welcome center. USD used. The rest of the trip was ApplePay/credit card. 
Short hike to central. 
Start at central. Drop bags. ~10:30 am 
Hike to mirador del Torres - lunch at Chileno on the way up. Stopped on the way back for a beer. 
Arrived back around 8 pm. Sleep at central - very nice Refugio for food. Free welcome drink.
Next morning. Hike to Frances (10 miles). Stop at Cuernos for rest and snack/lunch
2.2 miles from Cuernos to Frances. Along the shore. Very windy. 
Frances 2 nights? 
Mirador britanico (can drop bags at camping italiano if going all the way to Paine grande. This would be a long day) 
Frances had great elevated tents. Dinner was great (salmon, veggies, salad, dessert) free welcome drink.
Following day: Hike to Paine grande ~8 miles. Food is cafeteria style. Ok. No welcome drink. 
Next day: Hike up to grey glacier.
Next day take catamaran to pudeto
Pudeto to PN
Container hotel x1 night 
Recommend Santolla restaurant in Puerto Natales - scallops with pil pil sauce and the king crab tapas were great! Recommend having a Chilean poach sour too :) 
Bus to PUQ to start the long trek home

Rain pants (I had marmot brand)
Waterproof Outdoor Research coat - highly recommend, bought for this hike and it really kept me dry 
Universal outlet plug if you’re coming from the US
Waterproof shoes
Trekking poles
Buff, gloves, I had chargeable hand warmers too
Raincover for bag 
Camp sets come with a big pillow. No pillow case. My sleeping bag liner had pillow case attached. - recommend a liner! They even sell fleece lined ones but mine wasn’t and I was not too cold at night 
Bring eye mask -daylight in December from 5:30a-10p
Don’t really need jet boil or fuel (each Refugio has free hot water and regular drinking water) 
If getting fuel, recommend rental natales ($5 for small one) 
Beanie
Sunglasses
Sunscreen 
Towel
Shampoo/conditioner - they have body wash provided but I brought my own 
Chapstick/moisturizer!!! 
Ibuprofen 
Zyrtec
Tissues 
Liquid iv packs
Collapsible day pack
Snackssss
Single use pour over coffee (tons of tea provided at hotels and Refugio’s/campsites just snag extras there) 
Collapsible cup
Silverware (spork) 

Box lunches aren’t amazing - sandwich (usually ham and cheese), protein bar, electrolytes, nut mix 

Breakfast is ok. Bread, cereal, eggs/hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese

Highly recommend central food - sold out otherwise we would have done the sit down dinner there. Frances was great dinner as well. ",12,1765747866.0,Patagonia,7,1.0,False

Opinions?,"Hi guys, considering buying a new keyboard and am looking for a low-profile/small form factor that is as close to the old chiclet keys you used to get on things like the Razer Deathstalker Chroma (my favourite gaming keyboard in a long line of gaming keyboards) as possible.

I'm after a very short travel distance/response on the key presses and *silent* or as close to silent as possible switches. For the sake of comparison, after my Deathstalker died to it's final coffee spill I bought a Razer Huntsman V2 Analog, and whilst I like the light-based switches and the pressure sensitivity gimmick I almost never use it, it's far too clunky, big and noisy as all heck. Not a fan of mechanical keyboards and much prefered the low-profile chiclet keys with minimal noise.

I've been doing my homework and reading other posts on this subreddit and have narrowed it down to a Keychron but two models look *about right* and I was wondering what other peoples' experiences have been with them. Of the two I think I prefer *the look* of the K17 Pro, and there's only $20 difference between them, but wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything. I take it I would want the red switches for the quietest key and shortest travel distance?",1,1765747605.0,keyboards,0,1.0,False

I think I drank 5-12 shots of vodka every day last week and honestly probably the week before that. I’ve had so many day ones, as we all have, and I haven’t seen a day two in months. I don’t think I’ve been sober for more than a month at a time since I was 25 or 26. I’m 34 now and starting to worry about my health—both physical and mental.

I just opened up to my mother and she revealed that she and my father (who passed away a week and a half ago) had been worried about my drinking.

It’s embarrassing and I’m sad it’s partially taken his death and me reading about liver damage to get me serious about this but wherever we start (or restart) is the right place I guess!

I’m going to make a serious attempt to make 90 meetings in 90 days. Whether that’s SMART or AA-I’m open to your perspectives and suggestions though I do prefer women only groups.

1pmpcjq,https://i.redd.it/3vrs09y2l87g1.jpeg,How to hide fresh bruises on hips/thighs/stomach/neck? Panicking lol.,"Hey everyone, I (18M) need some urgent advice on body makeup/concealing bruises. I know how to do basic concealer on my face for acne or whatever, but I’ve never had to cover stuff on my body before, especially a lot of it.

I’ve got some pretty dark bruises on my stomach, hips, and thighs—hand/finger shaped ones mostly, plus a couple on my lower neck/upper chest that are harder to hide. They’re fresh (like 2 days old) so still purple-ish with some yellowing edges. My parents are coming over tomorrow for a holiday visit and I really can’t let them see these even accidentally. I’ll be wearing a hoodie and sweats obviously, but when we play games we sit around the coffee table on the floor sometimes, or I might stretch or whatever and things could shift. I just... don’t want any questions.

My boyfriend and I were rough the other night (he gets carried away sometimes, I said stop but he didn’t hear me or something idk, it’s fine now), and I didn’t realize how bad the marks would be. We’re both guys if that matters for product recs. Budget isn’t an issue.

What’s the best full-coverage body foundation or concealer that won’t rub off on clothes or sheets? Something waterproof/sweatproof would be good too. How do I color match when it’s bruises not skin tone? Any setting sprays or powders that actually lock it in for hours? Tips for blending on neck without looking cakey?

I’m kinda freaking out because my parents are super observant and I don’t want to ruin the visit. Please help, anything is appreciated. Thanks.",0,1765747239.0,MakeupAddiction,41,0.37,False

1pmpb5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pmpb5i/make_a_move_or_give_up/,Make a move or give up?,"I have a major crush on my next door neighbor I never see. Its been almost 2 years.

I left a card/candy outside his door to say hi when I first moved in and he knocked a day later with chocolates for me and we had a nice chat. When I invited him in for a coffee he declined and said another time.

I see him on the apps (tinder/Hinge). When we pass each other in the car we always wave. I have only met him outside once and we had a nice but brief chat. I know others describe him as shy and unassuming. 

Once on Hinge after he paid someone to paint his garden fence which inspired me to do mine he changed a prompt to he was 'looking for someone who liked painting garden fences'. I was wondering was it a hint to me and then he changed the prompt a day later to a generic one.

I wanted something to happen irl so I never swiped. A few months ago I got the idea to ask him for help moving something. He was very helpful but I think in my head I got too nervous and became shy.  He led the conversation and I feel so bad all the things I could have said I did not and we just did kind of awkward small talk and then he left as soon as he helped but was nice and said to ask him anytime for help. 

I requested to follow him on social media (instagram) and he took a month to add me back. My friends say leaving the card outside his door, asking for help and the instagram follow is showing enough interest that he would know I am into him. Are they right? 

I am thinking of liking him on Hinge as he would be notified and then I have my move. But I keep thinking like I am just next door and will that make it awkward if he does not like me back. I keep trying to accidently on purpose bump into him but it never works.

Will I swipe? Or just leave him alone? I assume even if he is shy he would have found a way if he wanted to?

1pmp9zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pmp9zt/im_out_of_fucks_to_give/,I’m out of fucks to give…,"I’ve been married for 17 years. We have two daughters together, and I’ve been the sole financial provider for our entire marriage.

I have never cheated never once. My wife, however, has cheated at least six different times.

The first time it happened, I was ready to end the marriage. I told her I couldn’t live with it. She begged me to stay and said she’d do anything to keep our family together. At the time, I believed the only way I could get past her affairs (including gangbangs) was if we had a threesome. She agreed. We did it, and honestly, it did nothing for me.

Looking back, I can own that choice. I was young, emotionally unprepared, and lacked the tools to handle betrayal in a healthy way. I thought it would help me move on. It didn’t.

Around that same period, I was working as a delivery driver delivering milk to coffee shops. At one stop, there was a woman who opened the shop each morning. We talked casually nothing inappropriate. Over the course of about a year, I realized I had developed feelings for her. I never touched her, never kissed her, never told her how I felt. One day, I gave her my number, thinking naively that I could have someone to confide in.

She texted me, and I told her I was exhausted from my wife yelling at me and cheating. Her response was, “We shouldn’t talk anymore.” At the time, I thought that was strange. Later, I realized she likely had feelings for me and was setting a boundary. That was it end of contact.

My wife found out and was furious. I understand why—but to this day, she treats that situation as if it were equivalent to her sleeping with half a dozen people behind my back. It wasn’t. There was no physical relationship, no emotional affair by intention just a lonely, immature man looking for kindness.

She still brings that woman up as if she were “the love of my life.” She wasn’t. She was simply someone who treated me decently.

My wife cheated again after that. When I discovered it, I left the apartment with our four-year-old daughter to go to the grocery store. My wife threatened to call the police and accuse me of kidnapping if I didn’t return immediately. I was about 24 years old and had no idea how to handle that situation, so I went back.

Her father was there. He told me to “go to my room,” lifted his shirt to show me his gun, and intimidated me into compliance. I went to the room and called the police myself.

When they arrived, they interviewed everyone. When they spoke to me, I asked if they could remove my wife and her father from the apartment. They said they couldn’t because they were “guests of my wife.” They asked me if I had grabbed or hit her. I said no because I hadn’t.

Despite that, I was handcuffed, put into a police car, and spent the weekend in jail.

I had never even had a parking ticket before that.

They claimed I had grabbed her and hurt her something that never happened. I was eventually released but forced to attend one year of anger management classes. Every week, I paid $50 to sit in a room full of convicted criminals. It was humiliating and degrading. I grew up in a stable home, never had issues with authority, and never had anger problems.

That experience completely shattered my worldview.

I didn’t get to see my daughter for a month. When I finally did, I completely broke down. Eventually, my wife and I got back together not because things were healthy, but because I couldn’t stand being a weekend-only father. I also couldn’t afford child support. My wife refuses to work, so financially, I would have been destroyed.

We have two daughters, and I am extremely close to them. I’ve considered divorce several times but haven’t been able to pull the trigger. I love my kids too much. I refuse to be a weekend dad. I refuse to give half my income to someone who has abused me emotionally and psychologically.

I’m a forgiving person but I’m running out of reasons to stay.

My wife behaves as though only her needs matter. I’ve spent years studying psychology just trying to understand how someone can behave this way. To me, it’s painfully obvious she has borderline personality disorder. She will never seek treatment or accept responsibility. Everything is always someone else’s fault.

She brings up the threesomes constantly. I understand they weren’t healthy but they never would have happened if she hadn’t cheated and lied in the first place. Younger me handled things poorly. I should have ended the marriage then.

I love her but her behavior is killing me.

I’m patient, strong willed, and have solid morals. But I’m exhausted. I want love and respect. When I communicate my needs, she refuses them, gets angry, gaslights me into feeling guilty, or performs them out of spite and claims everything is fine.

Her last affair was 4–5 years ago, but the damage didn’t disappear. I don’t hate myself I just can’t fully let my guard down with someone capable of that level of betrayal.

She’s still a stay-at-home mom and complains constantly. I view it as a privilege. She has the option to work or not work I don’t care, as long as she contributes in some way. She asks for more money that I don’t have. When I suggest working, she claims she can’t because of the kids. I’ve offered solutions: the bus, flexible remote work, me helping. That makes her angry because it exposes the excuse.

My issue isn’t whether she works.

My issue is that she walks around portraying herself as a victim and an angel while blaming me for everything wrong in her life.

I bought us a house. I got her a car and maintain it. I give her massages multiple times a week. I’m attentive in bed. I’m funny, kind, and deeply involved with my daughters. I love my family.

All I asked was for more intimacy because it’s been declining. She says she wants to be valued for more than sex, which I understand. I don’t want to be treated like a wallet either. But sex matters to me. I don’t want an expensive roommate I want a wife. She is the only person I’m allowed to be sexual with. That comes with responsibility.

I would never force her into anything but I refuse to live in a sexless marriage while we’re both healthy. I even asked if I could use a simple toy. She was furious about that.

She gets angry daily. She expects me to “just know” what she wants after 17 years. I’m not a mind reader. I also have ADHD I genuinely cannot see clutter the way she does. I need structure and schedules. She refuses to help create them, then criticizes me for failing to meet expectations she never communicated.

Nothing I do is fast enough, good enough, or on her timeline.

Even when I try to connect like taking her to a bakery she dismisses my conversations, interrupts me with texts, or tells me she doesn’t care about what I’m saying. When I flirt playfully, she belittles me in public. I rarely feel embarrassed—but being treated like that by my wife made me feel small.

She picks fights daily over trivial things. She walked out of a movie because she thought an actress was too attractive. Meanwhile, I’m not drawn to strangers or appearances I care about connection and chemistry.

I want laughter, curiosity, exploration, shared experiences. She wants seriousness and validation but can’t flirt or laugh. I give romance dates, flowers, letters, drives but I get nothing in return.

I’m never told I’m attractive. Never complimented. Never pursued. I feel like a chore.

Years of trying have worn me down. Every attempt to communicate ends in anger, cherry-picked internet “evidence,” or advice from her bitter, enabling mother.

I don’t know how to proceed anymore.

She believes being a stay-at-home mom is the hardest job in the world. She obsesses over aging, resents younger women, and is clearly still affected by being left for someone younger by one of the men she cheated with. She wants Botox, money I don’t have.

I’m supporting a family of four alone in this economy.

I have holes in my socks.

At some point, I have to matter too.

1pmp71m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1pmp71m/trip_recap/,Trip Recap,"I just returned from La Fortuna/Manuel Antonio and thought I’d give a little recap. There were 5 of us (myself, my wife—we’re both 35, my brother—32, my mother and father—early 60’s). 

We rented a Land Cruiser from National with full insurance for 11 days that cost us just under $1,400. I did all the driving and it was nowhere near as bad as I had prepared for based on some of the things I had read. Sure, it’s different from the states, but if you’ve spent any time driving through any mountainous terrain, you’ll be fine. The main differences: less lighting on the roads (many with no lighting), less markings on the roads, few guardrails, one-way bridges, and more blind spots than you might be used to; in busy towns with traffic, it’s kind of an every man is in his own type thing, but people tend to look out for one another. The one thing to note is lots of people and dogs on the roads at all hours and most tend to walk with the flow of traffic, so be mindful! We got slightly delayed and had to drive through heavy fog, rain, and 2 hours of darkness, which was fine with exercised caution.

First half of the trip: La Fortuna. Where we stayed: Ti-Fakara Lodge. We were greeted by the kindest, smiling faces who spoke perfect English, and were more than accommodating. We had breakfast there every morning, and had dinner there one night. Fantastic food/service—highly recommend the tuna for dinner. The rooms were quaint and clean. The property is located walking distance to La Fortuna Waterfall and is part of a birding oasis and preserve. Every morning the staff feed the birds and there is an abundance of wildlife. They also offer a night tour which is included in the stay; on ours we saw many frogs and a sloth! There is a nice pool with a view of the volcano. We hated to say goodbye and missed Ti-Fakara very much after checking into our new lodging in Manuel Antonio (more on that later).

What we did in La Fortuna: La Fortuna Waterfall—beautiful but touristy, steps all the way that weren’t too difficult/slippery. We went early to avoid crowds but it filled up very fast. Zip Lining with Sky Adventures—awesome experience with awesome people working there; it was our first time and we loved it. Coffee/chocolate tour at North Fields—fun relaxing morning that was easy going and informative. Our guide was fantastic and funny. It felt a tad touristy, and honestly could have been a little shorter. With that being said, we have a new love and respect for coffee and have already begun making ours differently at home! The Springs Resort and Spa at Arenal—we got day passes (2 days were included but we only went once) and had a fantastic relaxing day filled with (too much) drinking, and we ordered a couple small bites from the bar. Great activity for those wanting to just hangout and have a couple drinks and not worry about a thing. If we had an extra day or two in La Fortuna we would have gone the second day. Walking around town/checking out a local market—the locals are fantastic, kind people who are so excited to just say hello. We were able to get a couple souvenirs from the market and some awesome street food there as well. 

We found a hike around the corner on private land—El Bosque de Tío Victor Hiking Trails—which was a highlight for us. We had the entire trail to ourselves with multiple small waterfalls and private swimming holes. It is challenging and not for those who want stairs/paved paths. There were times when we had to grab ahold of roots to get up steep embankments, and they provide walking sticks which you absolutely must have to get through the trails. Highly recommended for those that want to explore away from crowds and like a more difficult hike. 

Highlights of where we dined: Travesía—great place for meat lovers—the meals for 2 are plenty for a group of 4! Restaurant Abuela Luisita—we all had something different, super good, one of our favorite meals of the trip (get the beef tongue); this place was explained to us by the server as dishes based on traditional Costa Rican dishes. 

Manuel Antonio. The drive says 4 hours… more like 6 after 2 quick stops and traffic. There was a difficult road through the mountains that was the steepest I had ever driven, but just go slow in a low gear and it’s a piece of cake. 

Where we stayed: Gaia Hotel and Nature Reserve. The people were nice, but we instantly missed everyone in La Fortuna, who just felt more genuine and down to earth. The hotel is a little dated and the rooms weren’t as quaint; the pool areas were small, though there are beautiful views overlooking Manuel Antonio Beach. Also note there is a steep incline that we walked many times but there is a golf cart shuttle that operates 24/7. The restaurant here has amazing sunset views, though the food was hit or miss with us. There is a sushi chef, which I would recommend. We had breakfast there a couple times, but it was also hit or miss. Important to note: there is a shuttle that operates every hour from the hotel to the beach and the entrance of the national park, and everyone has a concierge who will help with any questions/reservations/rides via WhatsApp, which was extremely helpful—the best part of our stay was José, our concierge who went above and beyond and made our stay special.

What we did in Manuel Antonio: shuttle to the beach. We had José help us and get us into contact with Paluca who had chairs and umbrellas waiting for us. Paluca was the sweetest older man who grew up there and set us up with a bar that we could order drinks and food from. Fantastic day at the beach, which was smaller than I expected, but not crowded at all. Guided tour at the national park—hot day filled with about 20 wildlife sightings, most notably an Ant Eater! The beaches were beautiful but packed. Spent a couple hours exploring and hitting the beach before walking out to hit a local restaurant on the beach. Brisa Elegante sunset cruise—one of everyone’s favorite days. Dinner and drinks and basically a private giant sail boat, only about 10 others on there with us, and we were told they book up to 46. The staff on the boat, the food, and the private cove they anchor in for swimming and dinner was perfect. 

Playa Linda Beach. We escaped the crowds and found a local beach that hardly anyone was at. Beautiful place for a picnic and drinks. We also saw people with grills. You park in the tress right before the sand. 

NAUYACA WATERFALL NATURE PARK. Highlight of the trip for us. There are 2 companies. Use this one and pay the extra $10 to have transportation from their club house to the waterfall. This company has the left side of the waterfall that gives you access to the top of the waterfall and a private swimming hole. Breathtaking! We were the only people there for half an our and then only a few others showed up. At the bottom, there were about 30 people, but nothing like the crowds at La Fortuna Waterfall. We also got to hit a couple of their difficult hikes on the property.

Food Highlights: Falafel Bar. Emilio’s Cafe. Mangata—everyone’s favorite meal of the trip. Soda Sanchez.

The people of Costa Rica were so beautiful and kind and helpful. The country itself is breathtaking and there’s something new to be in awe of around every corner. 

Now we’re trying to figure out how to move there (haha, we wish).

We cannot wait to return and explore the rest of this amazing country.

In a way at least it felt appropriate, since what else is today about? I sat on a white couch looking at the television screen and next to me sat a man. Imagine this. A man is sitting there on the white couch looking at a screen in a room that has two people in it. But only one appears to be alive. My father, a strange man, sometimes filled with all the warmth the world could offer, sometimes as cold as a brick of Ice. I could never tell when the tides would shift. A duality—a juxtaposition that feels like the backbone of today’s society. Or perhaps that’s only my perception. He sat and stared at that screen like he knew that if he looked at me it would be for the last time. He never really knew his way with words and perhaps neither do I. I went to a funeral once of nobody I really knew at all, but my heart broke as the grave singers sang the song that was once sung at my grandmother's funeral. I never knew the man. Not really. But I cried when I saw her heart breaking. Just standing there existing without him. She never really even knew my name. But that's not what this writing wants to be about is it? No. This is about writing the truth about how difficult it is to stay alive in this world. Not even by the literal definition of the word...or maybe it is. I don’t know. Do you? What is truth if not the act of asking? To stay alive and coherent in the world that practices its functionality on tearing apart everything that doesn't conform to its radical dictating disposition of uniformity. Did I confuse you with my language? My apologies. I will not conform. Is what I wrote on that couch whilst I sat next to my father, filled with a sense of dread over what was coming my way. The desperation set itself upfront and turned my mind into a chamber filled with dense smoke, one that might come about when one sets the world on fire. My mind was clouded, nothing able to penetrate the haze. The positive outlook I once carried on my chest was gone somewhere in there deep amongst the smoke. I no longer was. I will not conform is what I wrote as I stood at the dawn of a tomorrow that has yet to come and might never will. Should I kill myself or make a cup of coffee? I was caught. My mind racing back and forth attempting to find a better, more elusive definition of either yes or no. Something that wouldn't cry aloud the desperation I felt but something that would give me a chance to be held and pulled out of the trench I've been in for the past millennia it feels like. She smiled gently and asked me to say it again. The first silence. The barrel was now between my temples. Is it really about climbing out or was it about pulling them in? The second silence. My hand trembled, the trigger felt lighter than it should. What does your rational mind propose? The third silence. Nothing. Who needs a happy ending these days? I just needed company. I said. I just needed company. I say this with the need to tell you the truth. No lies shall fill these pages, but maybe I’ll obstruct. I will. But do not blame me if it is not the truth you'd like to be written. Should I be worried? She spoke in a calm but rather determined voice that hid a layer that pleaded with me to lie and say no. Her eyes trembled, pulling away ever so slightly. Her body prepared for an advance from the enemy. Even her calm voice carried a hidden terror and pleaded for me to lie and say no. That held onto the hope that I'd vanish, be erased right in front of her, dissipate into nothingness like I never was real in the first place. Lie and say no! Like this conversation never happened. It was just a fleeting thought, a mistake born from a fractured mind— it will be gone as quickly as it came. She knew that it was her societal obligation to ask, she wanted to be something today's society is not by asking that question although she knew deep beneath the very surface of her skin, she indeed was society. Are you? She didn't want to be but indeed she was. And that's the truth. Maybe just maybe she thought she could con herself and become something more with that question even though she didn't want the real answer. I could see it in her eyes. And so, I spoke calmly and told the truth. I asked; Should I kill myself, or make a cup of coffee? Silence. That's not what happened. I told her that I've been shot and I needed assistance. Silence. That's not what happened. I said I need this to stop bleeding please help. Silence. That's not what happened. I said no. That's what happened. I lied. But I told the truth she wanted to hear, and I read it like a script. It was written in her eyes. It is time for me to go. And I was ready. I had nothing left to do so I said when can I leave? Will you tell me when I can leave? And so suddenly the question came about. If I couldn't make my life meaningful, could I make my death? I wasn't able to bring good when I was alive amongst all of the lost but could I do it when I finally gave space to the people that by now needed it way more than they needed me. Perhaps the last of it isn’t true. But it’s what I choose to believe. I thought about the people who might take my space – I took some time before deciding. I thought about all of the lost souls, the ones that would breathe easier without me. But maybe that wasn’t the answer—maybe it never was. Perhaps the only redemption lies in staying, in being a witness. I don’t know. Do you? She asked for space in her eyes and I read each letter, each word with the precision on might look at an old Van Gogh painting. I read the pages that she tried to tear out. It was written well enough I suppose. Truthful. That’s more than most can manage these days. To hear the truth—or speak it—is a rarity. So, I asked if I should kill myself or make a cup of coffee? Was it the heat, the routine, the bitter simplicity of it that kept me here? To ask whether I should live or die was to assume there was a choice. The coffee didn’t care whether I drank it. It brewed anyway—indifferent, unconcerned and in a way oblivious. In its bitterness and heat, it became a mirror, reminding me that even futility has its rituals. Should I be worried? She spoke softly. And I responded with the only truth I could. No. I smiled—a fragile, distorted thing—and thought, 'What a strange day to make a cup of coffee.'

We're excited to announce an AMA with former VICE journalists and longtime media strategists Beckett Mufson and Imran Hafiz.   

Beckett & Imran have written [a guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEtN6V22Wr\_A2XsHncjuMOZobATCxQGf/view) to speaking with Zionists about Palestine that applies the latest advice from behavioral scientists, movement organizers, and anti-Zionist thinkers *specifically to holiday gatherings*.
  
Their body of work has appeared in *The New York Times, Forbes, The Christian Science Monitor, Mic, The Mirror, National Public Radio,* and *BBC Radio*, among others.   
  
They also run a worker-owned creative agency, [The Auxiliary](https://www.theaux.agency), and are involved in multiple Palestinian liberation organizations in Austin, TX.
  
**The AMA will be tomorrow, Monday at 11 CST/noon EST to share the strategies they’ve developed.** 
  
**Here’s a bit of background info about our guests:**

[**Imran Hafiz**](https://www.instagram.com/dhan_draper/?hl=en)

> Imran is a writer, filmmaker, educator, and civil rights activist who became the youngest recipient in history of the City of Phoenix’s Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “Living the Dream” Award, honoring individuals who embody Dr. King’s philosophy through sustained commitment to social justice and human relations. He is also the co-author of the pioneering, award-winning book The American Muslim Teenager’s Handbook, the first mainstream guide created for and by American Muslim youth, published by Simon & Schuster.

Hi!  I recently graduated with my master's in clinical mental health counseling and am waiting for my ALC application to finish processing.  I plan on starting my own practice and I have a mentor helping me work out all the kinks with that (yes, this is legal as an ALC as long as I am under his supervision 2 hours per week), but in the meantime, I'm looking for a part time job for 6 months to a year, and I'm getting fed up with Indeed and Glassdoor: they're full of ghost jobs and these weird AI interview things.

Anyway, here's a summary of my resume and what I'm looking for.

**Desired hours:** 20-30 hours/week.  Might consider full-time if needed.

**Shift:** Any, but afternoon, evening, or overnight is preferred.  Willing to work first shift if I have to.

**Minimum pay:** I need $2500 per month to cover all my bills, so about $20 per hour at 30 hours per week.

Another big thing is I want something as independent as possible.  The less coworker interaction, the better: I work best alone. I'm a little autistic, so navigating corporate politics has always been the biggest challenge of any job I've had. The actual ""work"" part has always been a piece of cake: I love to work and can quickly become good at pretty much anything, except socializing in unstructured situations lacking clear roles and rules. 

.....

**Degrees:** master's in clinical mental health counseling, bachelor's in psychology

**Work history:** 6 months as a counseling intern (required for my degree), 3 years as a mental health case manager, 1 year in a restaurant kitchen.  Otherwise, I've been dog walking and flipping stuff from thrift shops on eBay on the side.

**Skills/abilities** (besides those directly related to my work history): 

Very fast learner, substantially above average IQ.  E.g., I haven't made a B for a class average since middle school, all the way through my master's degree.

Basic/intermediate plumbing, construction, and electrical knowledge (remodeled my kitchen, built a fence, replaced switches and light fixtures around the house, etc.)

In very good physical shape: does 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise daily and has been lifting casually for over a year (e.g., I chest press with two 80 lb dumbbells for 36 reps, and the smallest dumbbells I use for any workout is 50 lbs, so I could meet the strength requirements for pretty much any job).  I'm 240 lbs, about 20% body fat, so suitable for security or package delivery jobs.

Gardening

Organizing/sorting things in general

Documentation/any task involving boring paperwork or navigating bureaucracy 

Driving: 7 years clean accident record, have driven to and from New Hampshire from here twice without issue.  But I do not have any sort of special license.  Was in 2 minor wrecks as a teenager when I first got my license, neither of which caused any injury to anyone involved 

Pet care/dog walking

Cleaning (no professional experience, but my home is spotless).

Advanced cooking (pretty much anything except Gordon Ramsay level stuff: I eat nearly every meal in), and intermediate baking (cookies, cakes, brownies, pies, etc.)

.....

100% clean criminal record.

No substance use whatsoever, not even a drop of alcohol ever.  (Only exception is my morning coffee)

Never been fired, and never had a manager not beg me to stay upon putting in my notice at a job. 

.....

Any suggestions?  I'm open to pretty much anything that would be able to cover my bills, even stuff outside of my field, but the big caveat is I could only commit to about a year there, as I should have a full case load in my practice by then.",1,1765746431.0,HuntsvilleAlabamaJobs,0,1.0,False

I called out an order for a peppermint tea double and some dude waiting for a double picked it up, then as he was walking out he was like what’s this this isn’t what I ordered I ordered a coffee double double just as my co-worker came up and offered it to him. He then turned away and as he did I let out like a silent smile/giggle thinking abt a TikTok where the server says “oh this isn’t what you ordered? Then maybe it’s not you fucking order.” This dude somehow saw me outta the corner of his eye and lost it. I then proceeded to say that I wasn’t laughing at him and that I’m allowed to smile( not in any angry tone or anything) and still atleast acting polite, which went about as any of you expect. Then my manager told me to go back while she solved the situation and then came and told me I was in the wrong for my body language and smiling. Now ik working at Tim’s usually means u treat yourself like your worth less than a dog but still I mean was I really in the wrong here?

1pmoybd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pmoybd/wondering_if_he_actually_likes_me_or_is_just_nice/,Wondering if he actually likes me or is just nice,"So, I (19F) started college in August and in my college, they divide the students into groups of 5 for the semester. One guy (18M) in group; everything about him used to annoy me to pieces. We didn’t talk to each other much. Literally 3 interactions in total until October when the group work started. All five of us used to meet up everyday after class to work on projects and presentations and so we got to talk more.

  
When we first met, he asked if I liked someone and I told him I was in a situationship (that is over) and he randomly started bringing it up. He started teasing me a lot and our dynamic became us just bullying each other. The first incident was when I got sick, I didn’t leave my room for two days. My best friend, who was better friends with him than me, told me he asked about me every time he saw her over the course of these two days.  
There was a program everyone had to attend and before it started, I was in my seat and he was awkwardly hovering near the table before he asked me how I was doing now? So, I told him I was fine. So, him and this one other girl from my group came and sat next to me with her in between us but then she got up to get some water and he pushed her stuff aside to his seat and sat in her place. I didn’t think much of it then but now that I like him, it has been on my mind.

  
During the project making, we became closer. Lots of coffee and library runs. We started saying hi to each other around the campus. Our group was not very interested in working, so sometimes, it was just the two of us. Eventually, I realised how wrong I was about him, we shared a lot of interests and our thoughts matched a lot. Slowly, I started noticing things. He called me princess in front of the other group members and everyone just went silent. He offered me his jacket even though he was sick himself. He still refuses to let me pay for things. He carries all the heavy stuff for me. He always follows the sidewalk rule. He rushes to get ahead and open doors first. At the restaurant, he served me first.

  
We were walking to the library to return our semester books; we were walking side by side but then he told me to walk ahead of him and when I did, he picked up my bag from its handle, and I would think he did this for everyone but the other girl who was walking with us didn’t get this treatment. On our way, we ran into his friends and he immediately let the bag go and when I asked what was wrong, he said that he can’t lose aura in front of them (T.T) but as soon as we walked past them, he asked me to take my bag off and he carried it along with his own. Idk why he didn’t want his friends to see.

  
So, after endsems, we decided to go out drinking. There were 6 of us: me, my best friend, the other girl from the group, his guy best friend, girl best friend and him. Me and my best friend reached later than them because we got stuck in traffic so he called me and asked what I wanted to eat so that the food will already be there when I arrive. We got there (a rooftop bar) and I climbed up the stairs and was trying to find our table when the girl came over and walked us to the table and I saw him turned around in his seat while looking at me with the biggest smile on his face. I sat down and he kept looking at me so I asked his friends if he drank and they said he had half a beer bottle. So, then H starts pouring some in my glass too and the night starts. I ended up getting way more drunk than I planned to; he kept refilling my glass.

  
My friends took me away from the table to give me some break; I couldn’t even walk straight. We were near the stairs and he was coming back up and I saw him and staggered towards him…put my face on his chest while grabbing his sweatshirt with both hands. My friends kept trying to pull me away but I just wouldn’t let go. H was more sober than me so he went, let’s make her sit. My friends managed to pull me away but I grabbed his hand and we walked back to our table. I sat down on the long bench but because I was so out of it, I lied down (still holding his hand) and he too, just stood there holding my hand. We stayed like that for about 7 minutes according to my friends and then he too wanted to sit so he asked his girl best friend to hold my hand and went back to sit.

  
I didn’t remember any of this the next morning and all of this is based on what my friends told me. I had a text from him asking how I was doing. I apologised over text a lot and he said that there was no need to and it was fun overall. I avoided him the next day but TODAY I ran into him at the dining hall. So, he came to sit with me and we started talking about stranger things (I sent some texts about it in the group gc) and then he asked me whether he should watch it or I’d rather explain the entire climax to him. So, I was like, I think you should watch it, so he sets it up on his phone right there and we watched the first 30 minutes of an episode before getting kicked out of the hall. We were walking back to our hostel and on the walk, he kept asking me a gazillion questions, didn’t bring up how I acted at the bar even once. And when we reached my hostel, there was an awkward pause of 5 seconds before I said bye and then he said bye and we walked away.  
  
I know this is really long, but I need to know if his behaviour points toward him liking me or if I’m overthinking. Also if I actually have chances after how I acted when I was drunk.",1,1765746270.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

He’s been there for about two weeks, but we’ve barely crossed paths because our shifts never line up. Today, unfortunately, fate decided to correct that mistake.

Our boss paired us up and asked me to show him the ropes. I asked him to repeat his name, and he did, but I barely registered it, because at that exact moment his breath hit me like a biological weapon. Whatever he said was instantly erased from my brain by the stench pouring out of his mouth.

We then spent six full hours working side by side. Six Hours!!! Even when he wasn’t talking, the smell lingered, like it had filed a formal complaint and decided to stay.

He declined, saying he was good.

1pmoul6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1pmoul6/not_just_another_tourist_post/,(Not) Just another tourist post.,"So me and 3 friends are visiting Miami in the last week of the year. We have certain spots we want to visit: Key West, Palm Beach, little Havana, Cape Florida lh, the Everglades, clubs etc. I have a couple of questions where I would like a locals take.

But I want to know a locals take on the city. Where do you guys go and have fun.

Are there any weekly flea markets like Fremont market in Seattle. 

Also looking for couple of Christmas gifts and I heard the coffee is great. What kind of coffee and where would I not get ripped off when buying?

I also am looking for souvenirs or room decorations stuff to remember the trip by. Any ideas what to look for or where. 

Anything I might have missed to do that week. I'll go through the links in the mega thread but they seem like a bit.

And are their areas and neighborhoods to avoid and stay away from. We are immigrants so we do nothing avoidable to happen.

Thanks you so much and I am really excited to visit your beautiful city

1pmot5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pmot5v/aio_just_feel_like_i_have_closed_the_door_on_my/,AIO: just feel like I have closed the door on my “old life”,"I am a little worried this is going to have a few twists and turns but I’ll try to keep it fairly together. 

I’m a 30 year old woman but I feel like I am still carrying around baggage from my teen years. I was a bit of a complicated character who was loud, gobby, outspoken and a bit of an edgelord pick me type. Shaved my head at 15, obsessed with Morrissey - just an all round pain in the proverbial. 

Understandably, I got people’s backs up. Due to various circumstances I ended up in quite a toxic relationship in my mid to late teens with someone who I look back and realise was abusive, second long term relationship was with someone who cheated and I ended up with an STI (very glam). I spent my early 20s and post uni years drinking quite heavily, dating the wrong people and to be honest I didn’t quite stabilise until Covid hit and I took stock of my life. 

Nevertheless I’ve come out of this very okay - got my master’s, bought my own home with no help from family, have a management level job in the public sector and a two year relationship with a man I am going to marry. 

Despite the above, there are friends from my teenage years and early twenties who will still see me as the person I was who was a heavy drinker, a loudmouth and a bit of a hot mess. The week before my dad’s wake, I met up with a friend and her fiancé for a coffee with my partner which was used as an opportunity by her to tell my partner how “I really was”. Of course, he didn’t care about me having to get a taxi cleaned once, falling over in a nightclub and a drunken one night stand when I was 19. 

There people from that part of my life I feel like I am on high alert, trying to prove to them that I am not a mess, I have “calmed down” and that I’m “together” now. 

I’m sick of the act. No wonder I always feel like I’m having to be on high alert constantly - I’m not hiding who I am but I am carting around so much shame that I just feel exhausted. So anyways, I’ve just gotten rid of the vast majority of people on my social media. People I knew, people who I saw not six months ago, people who were those I considered to be close friends until recently. I don’t live near these people anymore. There’s no need to keep the relationship going if it drains me mentally. It wasn’t a decision taken lightly and I’ve had months of tears and agonising over moving on from people who were once close to me but to finally close that door feels like a new one has opened and I have more space to give to the friends who see me as I am, who I don’t feel anxious around and to give even more energy to the new friendships to those who have known me as me in my current and best form. 

It’s so scary and in my head I feel like the bad guy, but at my big age I do not need to feel crippled under the weight of high school nonsense, either real or imagined. So I’m shedding that now. 

It feels good. Scary but good. But is it an overreaction? ",2,1765745917.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

Short Devotional about The Mindful Day

Introduction
------------

Every day is an opportunity to experience the abundant life that God has prepared for us. Imagine waking up each morning with a clear mind and a joyful heart, fully present and ready to embrace the blessings of the day. Practicing mindfulness can transform your daily routine into an enriching spiritual journey, bringing you closer to God and His purpose for your life.

In our fast-paced world, it’s easy to rush through the day, missing the small but significant ways God is at work in our lives. By cultivating a mindful day, we open our hearts and minds to His presence, allowing His peace and love to guide us in every moment. Let’s journey together to explore how mindfulness, grounded in scripture, can enrich your life and draw you closer to God’s truths.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Be still, and know that I am God.” — Psalm 46:10 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Psalm 46:10 is a beautiful reminder of the power of stillness and reflection in our walk with God. In this fast-paced world, we often forget to pause and listen for His voice. Mindfulness is about being present, fully aware of the moment, and open to the whispers of the Holy Spirit.

The verse invites us into God’s presence, encouraging us to trust in His sovereignty and embrace the peace that only He can provide. By quieting our minds and focusing on His divine nature, we can experience a restful assurance that He is in control, no matter the chaos around us.

Mindfulness helps us acknowledge our thoughts and feelings, but more importantly, it helps us redirect them towards God’s truth. With each mindful pause, we remind ourselves of His promises and realign our hearts with His will.

When we center our day around God’s guidance, we become more attuned to how He is working in and through us. It is in this sacred space that we find clarity, comfort, and courage to face whatever comes our way.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Set aside time each morning for quiet meditation on God’s word.

– Practice deep breathing exercises throughout the day to refocus your mind on God’s presence.

– Pause before meals to thank God for His provision.

– At the end of the day, reflect on moments you felt closest to God.

– Spend time in nature, appreciating the beauty and creation around you.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– How can I incorporate mindfulness into my daily routine to feel closer to God?

– Reflect on a recent experience where you felt God’s presence. How did it impact you?

– What are some distractions that prevent me from being fully present with God?

– Describe a moment today when you felt truly present and at peace. What contributed to that feeling?

– How does practicing mindfulness deepen my faith and understanding of God’s love?

Prayer
------

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank you for the gift of today and the opportunity to be present in Your presence. Help me to embrace mindfulness so that I may savor each moment with You, fully aware of Your love and guidance in my life. Quiet my spirit amidst the noise, and teach me to trust in Your divine plan. May my thoughts, words, and actions reflect Your grace and truth. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

Conclusion
----------

Embracing a mindful day isn’t just about slowing down; it’s about opening ourselves to the fullness of God’s love and wisdom in every moment. By becoming more attuned to His presence, we not only enrich our spiritual lives but also our relationships and personal growth.

We hope you continue this journey with us at BGodInspired.com, where we explore how integrating faith and mindfulness can lead to a richer understanding of God’s purpose for your life. Remember, each mindful moment draws you closer to His heart.

Genuinely, it basically works well enough, it's been reliable, the espresso is fine. But after a few years, I find myself weary of the inconsistencies of this grinder. I feel like I'm constantly chasing down retention gremlins, the workflow is annoying, and let's be honest, it's pretty ugly. I bought an SK40 just to try out (cheap and pretty nice!) and I honestly like using it more than the DF64. 

  
So what's the upgrade path from the DF64? Just straight to a Mazzer Philos or a Zerno? Or something like the Timemore 078S a meaningful upgrade? My main concerns are consistency and workflow. The DF64 in terms of the actual *espresso* is fine, I don't need better coffee quality. I just want a better experience!

1pmord5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1pmord5/question_about_legs_turning_into_stone_in_last/,Question about legs turning into stone in last 15km,"So last Friday morning I went out with my club. 100km, 1100m of climbing, I was with the fast group as I normally am. It was windy but I felt good. Spent a bit of time on the front and there was only 10 of us and it was a fast pace. I was happy to do it and never felt that I was pushing myself too hard. Was quite comfortable. I was pushing but not too hard. As the day went on I ate what I normally ate. Porridge before I left the house, couple of bananas, carb pouch, rice kripsie bar and of course the ubiquitous croissant at the coffee stop. With about 15km to go I could feel myself really struggling. Couldn't catch my breath. Its worth noting that Ive been doing a lot of indoor training over past few weeks but I didn't cycle 2 days before this ride.

Anyway I ended up at the back of the group clinging on for dear life with 15km to go. Just struggling. Staring at the cassette of the guy in front hoping that everyone would slow down. I made it to the end with the group but my legs felt like stone and I couldn't catch my breath. Heart rate soaring and not coming down fast like it normally does. 

  
From those in the know do you think my fueling was off, was I over training or was my pacing way off and pushed myself too hard in the early days going into the wind. Trying to figure it out before next Fridays ride. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.,",2,1765745790.0,cycling,10,0.75,False

In the next update I want to try and pay a bit more attention to Android and make sure the experience is on par with the iOS version. As always, thanks for all the feedback and bug reports!

\---

To update the app please fully close and re-open it, it'll download the OTA update on startup (no App Store update needed).  
  
**Features**

\- Added new ""Controversial"" comment sort option  
\- Added ability to save image from comments, or from the body of text posts (long hold on the image)  
\- Added option to the subscription screen to unfollow followed users by opening [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) (as no api endpoint exists for this)  
\- Added option to the subscriptions screen to favorite/unfavorite subreddits by opening [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) (as no api endpoint exists for this)  
\- Updated toast notifications to have a new design and also place them at the bottom of the screen to make them easier to dismiss  
\- Added close button to the top right of open images as an alternative to swiping  
\- (android) Added ability to swipe down on images to dismiss them like on iOS

**Fixes**

\- Fix an issue where some items were not correctly marked as read on scroll when that feature is enabled (it was mainly tall videos).  
\- Fix issue where ""Load More"" would only show for comment threads and not for posts with lots of top level comments.  
\- Fix an issue where videos would not be marked as read when tapping them in a feed with autoplay enabled.  
\- Fix an issue where gifs did not play when displayed in a gallery.  
\- (android) changed some logic which might fix an issue where setting a theme type (dark, light, system) did not persist properly.

**Misc**

\- Kind of got multi touch working on images on iOS, but it's still a very finicky. It seems having double tap and multitouch at the same time has some conflicts.

**Support**

1pmomxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/twenties/comments/1pmomxv/life_rants/,Life rants.,"I'm 17m and I'm having quite trouble in moving on with some of my insecurities like looks, money, not being good enough for anyone. Growing up in an abusive household gave me some decent wounds which are hard to be completely healed. Never really had anyone in my life who actually accepted me for who I am or even someone who is proud of me. Love is just out of the box thing so yeah these are some deep roots for my insecurities. I've tried to do some optimistic talks with myself, built a mid physique, some money shit etc but its just never enough for me. I always feel low and its like how do I even say.. I'm just stuck in a never ending loop of dissatisfaction with myself and my life. I try to reward myself with things like going on cafe or some food etc. But tbh I never really wanted anything like this so it never really feels like rewards but formality like yeah smth is done so I'm doing this to cope with the fact that I'm lonely and miserable and I need some friends. But its just out of the topic for me, I cant really talk as I left school for jee (which I kinda regret but it sucked anyways) and the remaining friends for whom I nearly did every fucking thing to make them feel good left me in my worst time when I needed someone so desperately. Honestly I learnt so many things this year but the way I learnt em all was so painful like it was like you're getting heart surgery without anesthesia. I had a lot of health problems. Got nearly paralyzed but yeah I overcame cuz if that happened to me even God couldn't stop me from killing myself, had some crazy level of migraines some minor heart problems. I'm just barely hanging by a thread and I'm scared of cutting it cuz there's always a maybe that something better is waiting for me in the other end but its just too hard to reach that end. Honestly my only demand right now from God and life would be to just let me experience genuine love for the first time. Those small efforts, coffee dates, holding hands I just cant help but envy people who have experienced all this but don't really care. My life is just all about work work work and for reward? just eat or read some books or use wikipedia to go through some random philosophical bs. 

I think thats more than enough for now. (Though I have a crazy lore bout my first ex who i genuinely loved but that would be too much.)",1,1765745476.0,twenties,0,1.0,False

When I use to work as a vet assistant with my boss (f) capricorn sun and Taurus in Venus and another coworker (f) with Taurus sun/mercury, Aries moon, Leo Venus/rising. I easily got along with Capricorn but started to notice her little red flags. She acted like a people person, but she would chatter up to see what she can get out of you. 

As for Taurus, girl was a hot head. I was scared to even ask for help without her slamming doors and making a scene. I tried not messing with her too much because she’s bipolar with an addiction. 

This is where the issue started, Capricorn hired her gay friend (Scorpio sun/venus, sag moon/mars with Leo rising) from a previous job they worked together . 

I quickly got a long with Scorpio, and we’ve been besties since. But my goodness the ride we took together dealing with these two. Scorpio also became Taurus’ bestie so we’d all hang out without Capricorn 

Capricorn got upset, telling Scorpio that she knew him longer. That it wasn’t fair that Scorpio didn’t hang out with her. That HE was HER bestie not Taurus’. 

When I brought it up with Scorpio, he had informed me that they never hung out 1:1 when they use to work together. That she never met his other friends or family. So he was unsure what she met by ? 

Then the Taurus got upset with Scorpio from hanging out with me? during a time where my ex was emotionally abusing me and even being physical. Saying how we didn’t put her feelings into consideration by not inviting her to go get coffee. 

Both were salty that Scorpio was hanging out with me more than them.

I’m a soon-to-be 34 years old woman living in Western Europe and looking for someone to talk about everything and anything. 

About me : I just got out of a long relationship. I’m a lawyer. I have two dogs and a small child. I drink way too much coffee. I do a lot of pilates. I don’t drink and I don’t smoke. I try to be funny, but I have a dry humor and it has been a hassle sometimes. I have a shitty English accent. I am very competitive. My hobbies are watching tv shows (how original), Korean skincare, and cleaning (is it an ocd or is it an hobby, you decide!). I am also a bit of an history nerd. 
I’m 5f6 and this is me : https://imgur.com/a/hv3qpCe (the picture is from yesterday so there will be no false advertisement!). 

About you : you must be witty. I enjoy someone who works out and takes care of himself. You must enjoy black coffee and my dry humor. I do not care where in the world you are, but I must say I usually get along well with Americans for some reason. 

As it’s late for me, I might fall asleep on you but I’ll be here tomorrow ! 

I’m currently rewatching every season of stranger things so if you want to discuss it, I’m here for it !

1. Which coffee service (if any) do you have at your canteen / office?

B. Does it run on a subscription service?

3. It is base-wide?

D. Are you happy with it?

5. Have your reps ever re-negotiated the ""contract"" and were you happy with the outcome?

Five spoonfuls of sugar. Maybe more. Who’s counting? Certainly not the FDA. Certainly not you. Could it be four? Sure. Could it be six? Also yes. Standards of review apply.

Then a heaping spoonful of cocoa powder you found hidden behind a half-open bag of Doritos you don’t remember buying on your desk now called outline bunker. Is it cocoa? Is it chili powder? Is it expired? Irrelevant. We’ll litigate that later.

Stir aggressively. Not gently—stir like you’re trying to establish intent.

Take a sip. Feel briefly alive then nothing  because your body is running on two hours of sleep and four red bulls. Immediately dissociate. Begin outlining anyway.

See time collapse into a single multiple-choice question. Black out for 0.3 seconds and wake up convinced you understand the Commerce Clause.

Forget your own name. Briefly consider whether names are a property interest. Decide that’s a post-exam problem. Type for forty-five minutes.

You fall asleep and dream that your computer crashes before you hit save on your Con Law exam. Come to with 1,200 words on your screen and absolutely no memory of writing any of it. Read the first sentence. It makes sense. Read the second sentence. It cites a case that does not exist. The third sentence is just the word “however” repeated four times.

Delete everything. Immediately regret it. Try to undo. Undo does nothing. Stare at the screen like it personally breached a duty of care. Start again.

Outline turns into a flowchart. Flowchart turns into a manifesto. Manifesto turns into a single bullet point that says “POSSESSION = INTENT + CONTROL.”

Convince yourself you’ve finally cracked the Commerce Clause. Open the casebook to confirm. Realize you’ve been wrong since September. Experience all five stages of grief in alphabetical order.

Type faster. Your fingers hurt. Your thoughts are faster than your fingers and also deeply incorrect. Every paragraph starts with “Under the modern approach” and ends in vibes.

Check the time. It’s been three minutes. Check again. It’s been forty-seven. Time is now a suggestion, like dicta.

Open Reddit “just for a second.” Surface twenty minutes later knowing twelve strangers’ GPA curves, three transfer strategies, and one guy’s unsolicited opinion on whether law school was a mistake (it was).

Return to the document. Add a footnote. The footnote is longer than the main text. The footnote argues with itself. You lose control of the footnote.

Forget what class you are studying this for. Consider emailing the professor. Draft the email. Delete the email. Draft it again. Decide silence is safer.

Start outlining again.

Stare into the middle distance. Whisper “reasonable person” out loud. Take another sip of coffee.

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

For a well-established, and also perhaps top 3 most popular cafes in Limassol, it has the worst wifi speeds i've experienced at a cafe. It's a pain in the ass to get anything work-related done here.

""Dude, just use your mobile data via hotspot"". Fuck you. I have Primetel, meaning it ain't gonna do much difference.

Anyway, it's crazy that they've done absolutely nothing to fix this issue for definitely a year or two. Even Costa Coffee has speeds of 200-300Mbps+. Costa fucking Coffee. (No shade)

""Dude, why don't you go to Costa Coffee then?"". You know what, you're right. But fuck you, let me rant.

Now I understand it’s about vibes, timing, and whether the interviewer had coffee.

I watched someone forget basic syntax and still get an offer because they were confident and blessed with luck.
Meanwhile I optimized my solution, explained trade-offs, and got hit with
“we’ll get back to you.”
In my dreams huh 🫩

Interviews themselves feel like speedrunning confusion.

You start confident.
You explain slowly.
You explain faster.
You start explaining things nobody asked.

The interviewer says “okay” a lot.
But “okay” can mean:
good
bad
please stop
we’re out of time
I’ve already decided

Answering and simultaneously thinking:
Am I overexplaining?
Am I underexplaining?
Was that joke a mistake?

Your code works.
Then it doesn’t.
Then it works again for reasons unknown.

You finish.
They say “any questions?”

You ask one.
They answer half of it.
You nod like you understood.

Interview ends.
Memory erases everything you said.
Brain replays only the stupid parts.

On the other hand, WhatsApp placement groups are pure psychological warfare.
One message ruins your entire day:
“Students final shortlist is out”

Out where?
Which link?
Why am I shaking?

Also love how everyone suddenly becomes mysterious.
“Bro it was easy only”
“What did they ask?”
“Basics bro 🙂”

Basics of WHAT.
Life?
Trees?
Existence?

Some days I feel job-ready.
Some days I forget how loops work under pressure.

At this point my preparation strategy is:

revise
apply
get humbled
repeat

If placements are a meritocracy, I’m clearly missing the merit called “right moment.”

Anyway.

1pmo24t,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pmo24t/teaching_an_old_programmer_new_tricks/,Teaching an old programmer new tricks...,"I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around ""how do I create X type of app"", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to ""test"" my hypothesis.

**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \*\*\*SOME\*\*\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. 

The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.

And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra ""bits"", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some ""extras"" available in a pro version for $1 or something.

The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default ""profiles"". Like, ""Profile 1"" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. 

There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.

The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. 

The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). 

But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks.",4,1765744014.0,learnprogramming,2,0.84,False

*  coverless duvets. I prefer the feeling of them and it’s so much easier not having to wrestle a duvet cover off and on
* barefoot shoes. I’ve been transitioning to them for a few years and my toes are SO much happier. Altra is a good transition brand - still padded but with a wide toe box
* Shearling lined slipper boots. so cosy
* A memory foam pillow between my knees when I sleep. this might have more to do with hypermobility but it helps me sleep so much better
* reformer Pilates. the first exercise I’ve enjoyed in my entire life
* Sony linkbuds s. I find most headphones painful and over-ear ones are too heavy. these are noise cancelling which is a godsend in loud restaurants 
* a really good mug that’s just the right weight and size for my morning coffee
* I’ve always struggled with jeans, but over the past few years almost all waistbands have become an issue for me. I now almost always wear leggings with no seam at the top. I work in a semi professional office and wear trendy oversized jumpers or maxi dresses over them
* on that note, only buying clothes that feel really good on my body. I’ve wasted so much money over the years on things that I like the look of but never wear because they don’t feel good on. I’ve learned that high quality athleisure is generally my favourite type of clothing. 
* carrying a small, very light water bottle everywhere to deal with my insatiable thirst
* having short hair. I hate the feeling of hair on my neck and a short haircut is so freeing.
* eating on my lap on the sofa. Again, maybe hypermobility, but I find most chairs really uncomfortable, so I decided to stop sitting on them unless it’s socially required.

Us learning and building together is beyond beautiful, it's magical. You solidify my confidence, as I will always be here to build your confidence, because you can accomplish anything.     

I watch our movies and laugh at our private jokes. Keanu, Snatched, Twilight series and more. I love your sense of humor. It's as demented as mine lol.   

I am attracted to you in a cosmic, magnetic way. I'm attracted to you because you are the hottest person alive! As in this is a bond that will never be broken. Spanning into the next life and beyond. I'm going where my heart leads and it's heading directly to you.    

I'm your love fool covered in glitter. You're a prescious angel to me. When I close my eyes it allows me to see. To be there for you now, even though we are separated by space, but not spiritually. To be there for you when you are psychically ready. I'm here for you however you may require. Do you want any or all of this? I'll do anything to sooth you and everything to make you smile.   

Happy Hanukkah my beautiful queen! I have a present for you. A present for both little flowers as well.   

Let go and let Mike

1pmny24,https://www.reddit.com/r/PataHaiAajKyaHua/comments/1pmny24/found_a_kid_practicing_a_speech_under_a/,Found a Kid Practicing a Speech Under a Streetlight at 3 A.M.,"Yesterday, around 2:30 a.m., I was completely drained and went out to get some coffee and air.

While driving back at around 3:00 a.m., I noticed a young boy—barely 10 years old—standing under a streetlight. He had a bag opened down the footpath, his books open, and he was talking to himself. Something about the scene made me stop.

When I got out of the car, he looked scared. I gently asked him what he was doing at night it is not safe.
He told me that the next day he had to give a speech in school, in English. The topic was “Education.”

I asked him if he had prepared it.
He said no—he only knew two or three lines, because he didn’t have any books to study from.

So I sat down with him under that streetlight.

I wrote ten lines. I helped him understand the meaning, made him repeat it again and again, and i teach him persuasion methods too to deliver speech efficiently. By around 4:00 a.m., he could recite it smoothly and with confidence.

Then I asked him about his life—where he lived and what his parents did.

He told me his father had passed away, and his mother stitches blouses and goes to houses to wash utensils.
I asked if he helps her. He said he tries, but he doesn’t know how to do much.

I sat with him again and taught him basic concepts of business profit and loss, CP and SP and shared a simple business idea.

Nearby, there are three parks where couples usually sit in the evenings. About ten minutes away, there’s a flower shop selling roses at ₹25 each. I suggested he buy 20 roses daily and sell them for ₹100. I told himto sell it to boys who are with their girlfriends and tell him to insist boys in front of their girls to buy it.

I gave him ₹500, and very clearly told him:
“This is not charity. This is a loan. When you earn, you will return it to me tomorrow and tell me your profit.”

I also told him something firmly:
“You are not a little kid anymore. You are a man now. You must take care of your mother, protect her, and never disrespect or bully her.”

I told him i will come Tommorow and ask you about your business.

Today, I met him again.

His speech went really well. His teacher gave him kachcha mango as a reward. He saved it and brought it for me.

I fealt very emotional there!!!

Then I asked about the roses.
He told me he sold 38 roses and made around ₹2,800, returned my money, and explained his costs. Two roses were left unsold. I advised him to buy only 10 roses at a time to minimize losses and to work only 2–3 hours in the evening when people are around.

I also told him very clearly:
Never take money for free. You have dignity and integrity. You are not a beggar.

When I asked him what he did with the remaining two roses, he said:
“One for my mother… and one for you.”

I was genuinely happy I think that happiness i have never experienced till now...
Then i hugged him. And he said ""Thankyou didi""

(Honestly, I’ve always ignored poor people and beggars. I used to believe that people remain poor because of their mindset—that poverty is often a result of one’s own choices.

But meeting this child changed something in me.

If a child is born into poverty, it is not the child’s fault. Many of them simply don’t have guidance or someone to show them the right path.
But if someone dies in poverty, then yes—that responsibility and fault is theirs.)

1pmnxl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pmnxl3/drowning_in_silence_thirsting_for_friends/,"Drowning in Silence, Thirsting for Friends","Everyone always says silence can be blissful, but it can also incredibly deafening. These walls of my home, once filled with chatter, laughter, and the occasional spat, are now eerily silent. I miss when my friends would come over for dinner, the smell of homemade pizza wafting through the air, the echoes of our favorite songs playing softly in the background. Now, all I hear is the tick-tock of a clock reminding me of the relentless march of time.

I never realized how much noise signifies, until it was replaced with silence. The chirping of my friends, reminiscent of a chorus of birds in the early morning, was such a significant part of my life. But just like migrating birds leaving for the winter, my friends have dispersed into their different paths, spread across continents for careers or families, and I'm left behind amidst the quiet. 

The world can be an overwhelmingly rushy place on the outside, and I always cherished the tranquility of my home. But now that silence has become my only company, I'm yearning for the clamor because it showed the presence of life. I guess too much of anything really can be suffocating.

So, how do I make peace with this silence and the gaping absence of the warmth I once knew, how do I bring the symphony back in my life? How do you cope with such a profound change? 

Title: The Loneliness of Achieving a Long-Sought Goal

Body: I’ve spent the better part of my adult life dreaming of owning my own bookstore. Weeks fueled by coffee and long nights crammed with business plans, budgeting, location scouting; my whole existence turned into a relentless pursuit of this dream. Then, one sunny afternoon last May, I finally opened the doors of “Bookworm’s Haven.” 

Opening day was a burst of joy and relief bundled into one -- so many smiling faces, so many shared conversations about our favorite books, so much hope in the air. But the one thing nobody tells you about achieving your dreams is what to do with the quiet that follows the initial burst.

Once the euphoria of achievement faded, I was left in a vacant, unknown space. A space where dreams that were dove-like free, now sit quiet, tamed and caged in reality. I had feared failure constantly, but no one ever spoke about the silence that ensues success. We're so focused on the summit, we seldom plan for life on the other side.

Now, I ponder, is it normal to feel this void in triumph too? How do you keep yourself grounded when your dreams become your everyday reality?

Title: Departing From the Technological Treadmill

Body: A few days ago, I made the conscious decision to distance myself from my smartphone. This tiny device, a junction box of the world, had started to feel like a millstone around my neck. Notifications, buzzes, and updates seemed to hijack my agency, turning my thoughts into a scattered cloud of static. So, I turned it off. 

Suddenly, my world closed in, a little. The conversational hum of strangers planning their weekends or friends discussing what to cook for dinner nosedived into silence. The vibrant colors of my Instagram fed sunset turned into the monochrome soft lights of my living room. Instead of virtually connecting with hundreds, I conversed with my roommate. I read a book, not just a highlighted summary on Goodreads. It felt de-stressing and alien at the same time.

You wouldn’t think disconnecting would be so... radical? Even though I can't shake off a strange sense of missing out, it's also oddly liberating. 

So, have any of you taken a break from technology, and how did it make you feel?",1,1765743691.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I’m a 30 year old woman but I feel like I am still carrying around baggage from my teen years. I was a bit of a complicated character who was loud, gobby, outspoken and a bit of an edgelord pick me type. Shaved my head at 15, obsessed with Morrissey - just an all round pain in the proverbial. 

Understandably, I got people’s backs up. Due to various circumstances I ended up in quite a toxic relationship in my mid to late teens with someone who I look back and realise was abusive, second long term relationship was with someone who cheated and I ended up with an STI (very glam). I spent my early 20s and post uni years drinking quite heavily, dating the wrong people and to be honest I didn’t quite stabilise until Covid hit and I took stock of my life. 

Nevertheless I’ve come out of this very okay - got my master’s, bought my own home with no help from family, have a management level job in the public sector and a two year relationship with a man I am going to marry. 

Despite the above, there are friends from my teenage years and early twenties who will still see me as the person I was who was a heavy drinker, a loudmouth and a bit of a hot mess. The week before my dad’s wake, I met up with a friend and her fiancé for a coffee with my partner which was used as an opportunity by her to tell my partner how “I really was”. Of course, he didn’t care about me having to get a taxi cleaned once, falling over in a nightclub and a drunken one night stand when I was 19. 

There people from that part of my life I feel like I am on high alert, trying to prove to them that I am not a mess, I have “calmed down” and that I’m “together” now. 

I’m sick of the act. No wonder I always feel like I’m having to be on high alert constantly - I’m not hiding who I am but I am carting around so much shame that I just feel exhausted. So anyways, I’ve just gotten rid of the vast majority of people on my social media. People I knew, people who I saw not six months ago, people who were those I considered to be close friends until recently. I don’t live near these people anymore. There’s no need to keep the relationship going if it drains me mentally. It wasn’t a decision taken lightly and I’ve had months of tears and agonising over moving on from people who were once close to me but to finally close that door feels like a new one has opened and I have more space to give to the friends who see me as I am, who I don’t feel anxious around and to give even more energy to the new friendships to those who have known me as me in my current and best form. 

It’s so scary and in my head I feel like the bad guy, but at my big age I do not need to feel crippled under the weight of high school nonsense, either real or imagined. So I’m shedding that now. 

It feels good. Scary but good. Anyway just wanted to get that off my chest! ",1,1765743483.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1pmnu9d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmnu9d,AIO my father ruined my drawing.,"I (19F) have recently decided to learn how to draw. I've never been good at making art, it's never been my thing, but I'm a huge fan of cartoons and I wanted to learn how to draw my favorite characters.

 This week, I made this drawing of Aang, from ATLA and it's the first time I've actually done something I am really proud of. I know that for some experienced artists this is nothing, but to me it meant everything. It might not be the best ""fanart"" in the world, but when I finished it I felt proud. I felt happy. I wanna get better at painting and doing sketches, but this felt pretty good to me and I showed it off to everyone in my house because I felt so good about my drawing. 

I left the sketch with a couple others I'd been working on at the coffee table in the living room, since I was looking for a frame to put it on, because I wanted to hold on to it as the first I had ever made. I had to put a hold on looking for a frame since my cousin (15F) came to spend the weekend at my home. She is an artist and was also proud of my sketch, which made me like it even more. 

About an hour ago, my cousin was leaving and I came to collect my drawing since my aunt brought me a frame to put it on as an early christmas present by my cousin, but when I looked at it, I saw someone had doodled over it. I immediately burst into tears and I felt my heart shatter. When I came into the kitchen and showed it to my family, my father admitted that it was him who had done that with a blue pen, joking that ""dude needed some lashes"". I broke down crying again and told him he ruined my drawing. He said he didn't, and was just testing out the pen and decided to contribute to it somehow. My mother got pissed at me for making a scene in front of my cousin and aunt and my father kept telling me to grow up and stop crying for such a stupid reason since I could just make another drawing. 

I tried explaining to him the sentimental value this sketch had, and how making another one won't fix the issue, and that he knew how much that drawing meant to me. I also told him that he would have been really pissed if I doodled over his work spreadsheets, but he said it's not a fair comparison. 

Both my mom and my dad are pissed at me for being upset about the drawing. They think I am overreacting, but to me it's not about just the drawing, it's about dismissing my feelings and the effort I put into this work. My father refuses to apologize and my mom thinks I embarrassed my father in front of his sister. 

So, reddit, am I overreacting?

I asked him the same, and he told me he moved to another country for a job but it didn't went well and now changed to other and because is remmote he is comming back to our country.

I told him that I relate to the moving-abroad part since I had a difficult experience living a months in another country and I told him if the problem was more about adaptation or the job itself (I thought it could be interesting to learn from other work experiences in the same area).

But he end up telling me is was a long story and suggested if maybe we could take a coffe so we can meet up and he can tell me more. This was his last message and I didn't answer.

I’m not great at reading social cues, and I’m aware of that. My gut feeling is often unreliable, so I’m trying to be cautious. I am comming here because sometimes the same experience as a woman can affect the meaning you know?
