I just got my first ""real"" paycheck, and honestly? I'm feeling a little anxious. Suddenly, rent, bills, groceries... it's a lot. I'm trying to find a way to avoid blowing it all and maybe save a little, and here's what really helps:



Write down everything. Every. Expense. Even that $3 coffee. It's exhausting, but it shows you where your money is really being spent.



Set some rules. I allocate 50% to bills, 30% to fun things, and 20% to savings. It's not perfect, but it prevents me from overspending.



Automatic saving. I transfer a small amount into a savings account as soon as I get paid. Out of sight, out of mind, and I don't miss it.



Don't optimize everything. Just because my income increases doesn't mean I need a new phone, new gadgets, or fancy dinners every weekend.



Small wins count. Canceling unused subscriptions, cooking at home, and using cashback apps all add up.



Honestly, I probably make a lot of mistakes along the way, but facing reality and thinking things through makes me feel like I'm in control.

- The holiday is the first Monday of September, marking the end of summer.
- Starbucks lets each store set its own schedule; hours can vary and some may close early or stay closed.
- The most reliable way to confirm a store‚Äôs hours is the Starbucks mobile app or the store‚Äëlocator tool, which show any temporary changes.
- No Labor Day‚Äëspecific promotions have been announced; the company is focusing on its core coffee experience rather than discounts.
- Tips: order ahead via the app to avoid lines, consider alternative caf√©s if your nearest Starbucks is closed, and use the Saved Favorites feature for quick reorders.

Why it matters: Checking ahead prevents missing your coffee on a busy long‚Äëweekend and helps plan holiday gatherings.

We live in the States but he‚Äôs from another country. 

Recently, his parents who are in their 70s both needed hip replacement surgeries. His sister is in the States as well and there is no one to help take care of them. So we discussed and agreed that he should go while I stayed back and took care of the kids. 

He went for almost 1 month and we talked daily telling each other about our day. He mentioned that he went to visit his mom‚Äôs friend one night. Now his mom‚Äôs friend has a daughter (F30) who also studied in high school with him. He told me before that he didn‚Äôt remember her at all. He also told her the same thing in front of me once and she said that it made her sad that he didn‚Äôt remember her. We met together in our previous visits and I had a feeling that this girl is interested in my husband especially with the above statement. 

Well, he told me during this visit that his mom‚Äôs friend was bombarding him with questions regarding his career and salary so as a way to get out, he and this friend went out for coffee. I felt very disturbed when he told me this because he knows I‚Äôm not very comfortable if he goes out alone with the opposite gender. It would be fine if we communicate in advance. 

When he came back to the States, I checked his phone (we both know each other passwords and don‚Äôt care if we see each other‚Äôs phone), it wasn‚Äôt a spontaneous coffee catch up. It was planned and she even sent him photos of the coffee catch up afterward. He paid for the meal too. I got very upset and asked him why he lied to me. He said he didn‚Äôt lie. They saw each other on the road one time and said let‚Äôs catch up but didn‚Äôt decide which day. That day was just a good time so they went. I asked why didn‚Äôt he tell me in advance or even afterward, he just said he didn‚Äôt think that far. 

He didn‚Äôt know that I checked his phone and later on, I found out that he deleted all the messages from/to that girl. I‚Äôm upset and haven‚Äôt talked to him for over a week now and he doesn‚Äôt know why. 

He has also mentioned that he feels he should go back home more often to take care of his parents and now all I can think about is him meeting that girl there. His mom likes her and always talks about her. It‚Äôs driving me nuts. Am I being insecure?

At the moment, I‚Äôm open to long distance if the energy feels right, but I‚Äôd love for it to eventually lead to something in person. This could be coffee dates, museum days, getting food together, or just wandering around the city.

1n5khwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n5khwl/the_art_of_graceful_boundaries_your_daily_guide/,The Art of Graceful Boundaries: Your Daily Guide to Dealing with Difficult People üåü,"
Life has a funny way of putting challenging people in our path. Whether it's the colleague who constantly interrupts, the friend who always plays victim, or the family member who thrives on drama, we all encounter individuals whose behavior can drain our energy and test our patience.

But here's the thing - you don't have to choose between being kind and protecting yourself. There's a middle ground that can transform how you navigate these tricky relationships, and it starts with understanding one powerful principle.

## The Balance Between Compassion and Self-Preservation üéØ

Imagine you're standing at a crossroads. One path leads to endless frustration and resentment, where you either explode at people or silently suffer their problematic behavior. The other path leads to a place where you can maintain your inner peace while still being a decent human being.

This second path is what we're exploring today - the ability to extend understanding to others while simultaneously protecting your own well-being.

## Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short ‚ùå

Most of us have been taught to handle difficult people in one of two ways:

**The Doormat Approach**: Just smile and bear it. Keep quiet. Don't rock the boat. This usually leads to building resentment and eventually exploding or becoming bitter.

**The Confrontation Approach**: Call out every bad behavior immediately. Set harsh boundaries. Cut people off completely. While sometimes necessary, this can damage relationships that might otherwise be salvaged.

Both approaches miss something crucial - the possibility of maintaining kindness while staying smart about protecting yourself.

## The Third Way: Conscious Awareness with Protective Action üõ°Ô∏è

Here's where things get interesting. You can acknowledge that someone is struggling, having a bad day, or dealing with their own issues WITHOUT letting their behavior negatively impact you.

Think of it like being a skilled goalkeeper. You can see the ball coming, understand the player's strategy, even empathize with their effort - but you still block the goal. You don't take it personally, and you don't let it score against you.

## Practical Daily Applications üåÖ

**Morning Coffee with the Complainer**

Your coworker starts their daily rant about everything wrong with the company. Instead of:
- Getting sucked into the negativity spiral
- Telling them to stop complaining
- Avoiding them entirely

Try this: ""Sounds like you're having a tough morning. I need to focus on this project now, but I hope your day improves."" Then physically redirect your attention to your work.

You've acknowledged their struggle without absorbing their negativity.

**The Family Drama Text Chain üì±**

Your relative sends another inflammatory message trying to pull you into ongoing family conflict. Instead of:
- Engaging in the argument
- Sending an angry response
- Ignoring them completely

Try this: Read it, understand they're venting their frustration, then simply don't respond immediately. If you do respond later, keep it brief and neutral: ""I can see this is important to you. I'm staying out of this one.""

You've shown you heard them without getting entangled.

**The Chronically Late Friend ‚è∞**

Your friend shows up 30 minutes late again with elaborate excuses. Instead of:
- Pretending it doesn't bother you
- Lecturing them about respect
- Ending the friendship

Try this: ""No worries, these things happen. Next time let's meet at [different location/time] that works better for both of us."" Then adjust your expectations and plans accordingly.

You've maintained the relationship while protecting your time.

## The Mental Shift That Changes Everything üß†

The key insight is this: other people's behavior is information about them, not instructions for you.

When someone is consistently difficult, they're usually telling you something about their internal state - they might be overwhelmed, insecure, in pain, or lacking certain skills. This information helps you understand them better, but it doesn't obligate you to fix them or absorb their emotional state.

## Building Your Daily Practice üí™

**Step 1: The Morning Intention**
Start your day by reminding yourself: ""I can be kind and understanding while keeping my peace intact.""

**Step 2: The Pause Protocol**
When someone's behavior triggers you, pause for three seconds. Ask yourself: ""What are they really telling me about their inner state?"" Then ask: ""How can I respond in a way that protects my energy?""

**Step 3: The Evening Review**
Before bed, think about any challenging interactions from the day. Did you maintain both compassion and boundaries? What would you do differently?

## Long-Term Benefits You'll Notice üåà

As you practice this approach, you'll start noticing some remarkable changes:

**Reduced Stress**: You stop taking other people's issues personally, which dramatically decreases your stress levels.

**Better Relationships**: People actually respond better when you're not defensive or aggressive. Your calm presence can sometimes help de-escalate situations.

**Increased Self-Respect**: You'll feel better about yourself because you're neither being mean nor being a pushover.

**More Energy**: You'll stop depleting yourself trying to change or fix other people.

**Clearer Thinking**: Without the emotional charge, you can make better decisions about relationships and boundaries.

## Advanced Techniques for Challenging Situations üé≠

**The Broken Record Method**
When someone keeps pushing after you've set a boundary, simply repeat the same response calmly. ""As I mentioned, that doesn't work for me."" Don't elaborate or justify - just repeat.

**The Redirect Strategy**
When someone tries to pull you into drama, redirect to solutions: ""That sounds frustrating. What are you thinking of doing about it?"" This puts responsibility back on them.

**The Time Buffer**
For emotionally charged communications, use time as a buffer. ""Let me think about that and get back to you."" This prevents reactive responses.

## When This Approach Doesn't Work ‚ö†Ô∏è

Sometimes, despite your best efforts to maintain grace while protecting yourself, certain relationships become genuinely harmful. If someone is:
- Consistently abusive or manipulative
- Violating serious boundaries repeatedly
- Causing significant harm to your mental health

It may be time to limit or end contact entirely. This approach works best with people who are difficult but not actively toxic or dangerous.

## Making It Sustainable üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The beauty of this method is that it's sustainable long-term. You're not suppressing your feelings or being fake - you're simply choosing responses that serve your highest good while maintaining your humanity.

Remember: You can wish someone well from a distance. You can hope they find peace while not letting them disturb yours. You can be compassionate without being a target.

## Your Action Plan for Tomorrow üìã

1. **Identify Your Challenge Person**: Think of one person whose behavior regularly affects you negatively.

2. **Practice the Pause**: Next time they display difficult behavior, pause and ask yourself what their behavior is telling you about their internal state.

3. **Respond with Grace and Boundaries**: Acknowledge their humanity while protecting your peace.

4. **Observe the Results**: Notice how this different approach affects both your stress level and the interaction.

5. **Adjust as Needed**: Every person and situation is different. Fine-tune your approach based on what you learn.

## The Ripple Effect üåä

Here's something beautiful that happens when you master this skill: other people often start treating you differently. When you stop reacting emotionally to their behavior, when you remain calm and boundaried, it can actually help them regulate their own emotions better.

You become like a steady rock in turbulent waters - unshaken by the storm, but also not fighting against it.

## Final Thoughts: The Long Game üé≤

This isn't about becoming cold or indifferent. It's about becoming wise. It's about recognizing that the most loving thing you can do - for both yourself and others - is to maintain your inner peace while still engaging with the world around you.

In a world that often feels chaotic and overwhelming, your ability to remain grounded while staying open-hearted becomes a gift not just to yourself, but to everyone you encounter.

The people who frustrate us today are often fighting battles we know nothing about. By extending understanding while maintaining our boundaries, we create space for healing - both for them and for ourselves.

Tomorrow brings new opportunities to practice this delicate balance. Each interaction is a chance to choose wisdom over reactivity, understanding over judgment, and protection over absorption.

Your peace doesn't require other people's permission. Your kindness doesn't require your suffering. Both can coexist beautifully when you give yourself permission to be fully human - compassionate, wise, and boundaried all at once.

Start small. Practice daily. Watch how your life transforms when you master the art of graceful boundaries.

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm here or what I‚Äôm supposed to write, but let‚Äôs try.

I‚Äôm writing this on the first day of September. Summer has ended, and autumn has arrived (my favorite season. I like how it mixes the best of both: winter‚Äôs chilliness and summer‚Äôs stillness).

Another reason I‚Äôm writing is that I just finished reading Kafka‚Äôs Letters to Milena, and it made me wonder what it would be like to live in a world where letters take days to arrive. Again There‚Äôs a certain charm in waiting. I like waiting and its stillness just as I like autumn and its stillness too.

But enough about why I‚Äôm writing, let me tell you a little about who I am!
It's suggested I mention the usual trivia, but I think those things are more fun to discover slowly, through the back-and-forth of letters (the thrill of waiting to find out your favorite book, or what you think of my random collections). For now, I‚Äôll just say: I‚Äôm someone who enjoys coffee, long walks, and a disturbingly wide range of other things. Mostly, I try to spend my days enjoying the moment, without yearning for an unknown future or lamenting a gone past.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm a big fan of a lot of things so I thought Art is a good umbrella term to try and box those interests even if they are barely fitting in. 
If I had to pinpoint one or two things I would say books and movies as are these the two arts that i consume most but please feel comfortable to share anything else. There's a big probability I'm a fan too !
 And if not, even better! 
A new thing to learn about.

I think I have to ask questions to start the conversation, so let me start with hoping that you are having a wonderful day/night and to ask 
What's your opinion on memories?
 How we should handle them?  
Do you think memories should be remembered or recorded? 
Are bad memories worth remembering as good ones? 
And how to tiptoe into them without falling into Nostalgia ?

Have you ever stopped to wonder if you're climbing the right mountain? üèîÔ∏è In our fast-paced world, millions of people wake up each day pursuing goals that feel important but might actually be leading them away from genuine fulfillment and growth.

## The Great Misdirection

Picture this: You're at a gym, and you see two people. One is constantly checking themselves in the mirror, adjusting their pose for the perfect selfie, counting likes on their fitness posts. The other is quietly focused on their form, tracking their progress in a notebook, celebrating small improvements in strength and endurance.

Both are at the same gym, but they're playing completely different games. One is optimizing for external validation, the other for internal development. This scenario plays out everywhere in modern life.

## The Validation Trap üì±

We live in an era where external approval has become our primary currency. Social media platforms have gamified human interaction, turning our natural desire for connection into an addiction to metrics that don't actually measure what matters.

Think about it: When you post something online, what's the first thing you check? The number of reactions, right? This behavior has rewired our brains to seek quick hits of dopamine from strangers' approval rather than the deeper satisfaction that comes from genuine skill development or meaningful relationships.

**The Real Cost:** When we chase external validation, we become performers rather than learners. We start asking ""What will get me the most attention?"" instead of ""What will help me grow as a person?""

## The Comfort Conspiracy üõãÔ∏è

Here's another trap most of us fall into: choosing what feels easy over what builds our abilities. Modern society is designed to make everything as convenient as possible, which sounds great until you realize that growth happens in the space between where you are and where you want to be ‚Äì and that space is never comfortable.

Consider these everyday choices:
- Taking the elevator instead of the stairs
- Ordering delivery instead of cooking
- Watching tutorials instead of practicing
- Avoiding difficult conversations instead of addressing problems
- Staying in familiar social circles instead of meeting new people

Each choice seems small, but they compound over time. The person who consistently chooses the slightly harder path develops resilience, skills, and confidence that the comfort-seeker never acquires.

**The Reality Check:** Your future self is built from the decisions your current self makes today. Every time you choose ease over effort, you're voting for who you'll become.

## The Image Illusion üé≠

Perhaps the most dangerous misdirection of all is focusing on how things appear rather than the actual results they produce. This shows up everywhere:

- Buying expensive workout clothes but never exercising
- Having an impressive job title but adding no real value
- Owning the latest gadgets but never learning to use them effectively
- Talking about big goals but taking no meaningful action
- Creating elaborate plans but never implementing them

The image-focused person spends energy managing perceptions while the impact-focused person spends energy creating actual change.

## The Path Forward: Practical Redirections üöÄ

So how do we escape these traps and start optimizing for what actually matters? Here are concrete steps you can take starting today:

### Replace Validation-Seeking with Learning-Focused Habits

**Instead of posting for likes, document for growth:**
- Keep a daily learning journal where you write down one new thing you discovered
- Share knowledge to teach others, not to impress them
- Measure progress by skills acquired, not social media metrics
- Seek feedback from people whose opinions you genuinely respect

**Daily Practice:** Before sharing anything online, ask yourself: ""Am I sharing this to help someone or to get attention?""

### Swap Comfort for Capability Building

**Make discomfort your friend:**
- Take cold showers (builds mental resilience)
- Have one difficult conversation per week
- Learn something that challenges you for 30 minutes daily
- Do physical activities that push your limits
- Say ""yes"" to opportunities that scare you a little

**Weekly Challenge:** Identify one area where you've been choosing comfort and deliberately choose the harder path for seven days straight.

### Shift from Image to Impact

**Focus on results, not appearances:**
- Measure your work by outcomes, not hours spent
- Invest in experiences and skills rather than status symbols
- Ask ""What difference did I make?"" instead of ""How did I look?""
- Build systems that create real value over time
- Surround yourself with people who care about substance

**Monthly Review:** At the end of each month, list three concrete ways you made a positive difference in someone's life or improved a situation.

## The Compound Effect of Right Metrics üìà

When you optimize for the right things, something magical happens: the external rewards often follow naturally, but they become bonuses rather than the main goal.

The person who focuses on learning becomes genuinely interesting to be around. The person who builds real capabilities becomes more valuable in their career. The person who creates actual impact develops authentic confidence that no amount of likes or status symbols can provide.

## Small Shifts, Big Changes üîÑ

You don't need to overhaul your entire life overnight. Start with these micro-adjustments:

**Morning:** Before checking social media, spend 10 minutes reading something educational
**Afternoon:** When faced with an easy option and a growth option, choose growth
**Evening:** Reflect on one way you made a real difference today, no matter how small

## The Long Game Perspective üéØ

Think about the people you most admire ‚Äì whether in your personal life or public figures. What do they have in common? They likely:
- Consistently chose learning over quick wins
- Embraced challenges that built their character
- Focused on creating value rather than just looking successful
- Played the long game instead of seeking immediate gratification

These people understood something crucial: the metrics that matter most can't be measured by external observers. They're internal, cumulative, and compound over time.

## Your Next Move üé¨

Right now, you're at a crossroads. You can continue optimizing for metrics that feel good in the moment but lead nowhere meaningful, or you can start the more challenging but ultimately more rewarding path of building real capability, pursuing genuine learning, and creating actual impact.

The choice isn't just about what you do ‚Äì it's about who you become in the process.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner who chose to keep learning instead of pretending they already knew everything. Every successful person was once someone who chose capability over comfort. Every person who makes a real difference was once someone who chose impact over image.

The question isn't whether you're capable of making this shift ‚Äì you absolutely are. The question is whether you're willing to start today, with the next choice you make, the next goal you set, and the next metric you decide to optimize for.

Your future self is counting on the decisions you make right now. Make them count. üí™

I calmed her down and I think we will be filing for divorce. I am sad for me and my kids but I am done trying to put myself down all of the time just to never meet her expectations.

A little bit of information, I am not a very emotional person and I‚Äôm trying to change that and be there to support my wife. I have never talk down or say anything negative about her, I love her very much. She is a SAHM and our kids thrive because of that. She sacrificed a lot with her career to be with them and I told her all of the time that I appreciated her for that. It is a lot to be a SAHM so a lot of time her emotion is very high. 

I am at a loss where I don‚Äôt know what else to do to make her happy and for her to just not have negative feeling for everything that I do.

I don‚Äôt share my feeling a lot and when I do, she always said that I got offended by what she said that I need to do better. So I hid them. In our recent fight, I talked to her on what‚Äôd happened and that made me unhappy. 

1. We went to an afternoon tea party, one of our kids got a bit cranky and I offered to sit next to her but instead she took it over and under her breath she said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt do anything to help anyway.‚Äù Right after I said I can take care of her. 

2. I dropped her off to have a coffee with her friend and went home with the kids. I cleaned the house and got the kids to help but they ended up fighting and made a little mess in their play area. I folded clothes, cleaned the kitchen and the living room. Her friend and her came back, we chatted a bit and I said I cleaned and got the girls to help and her response was ‚Äúclean what? All these mess‚Äù - the only mess that were there at the play area. 

She told me she needs me to take emotional load off of her and in all honestly, is there anything else that I need to do? Or am I just trying to make her happy and doing harm to my own mental health? I feel like I am in this relationship because of the kids.

I tried to search for inspiration, yet the hanging pictures of my ‚Äúpast successes‚Äù mock me. They are creations too different from me. Words of recognition printed on paper, confined strictly within the company. Never mine, never a part of me.

When you‚Äôre left with nothing, start anew. This rings true as I claim the project as my own with the first stroke on the blueprint. A project that does not take homage. A building free of limits. Yet I can‚Äôt help but feel shackled by the absolute.

‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre joking,‚Äù I manage to choke out, as the breath from my mouth reeks of caffeine. The shadows beneath my eyes began stirring two months ago... yet they are nothing compared to the words uttered before me.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. They‚Äôre cutting the budget down to 400 million USD.‚Äù Stern and firm, my boss‚Äîthe utter worst‚Äîconfirms it for me.
‚ÄúThe officials say the funds are needed for a national emergency,‚Äù he adds, sipping the bitter iced coffee in his hand, expecting me to answer back.
‚ÄúI told them we‚Äôll be fine. Restrictions inspire creativity after all, yes?‚Äù

I never thought I would want to strangle a man before this day.

Useless, useless, useless. The officials know nothing. They want me to create grandeur with leftover coins?? And when all was going well too! I‚Äôve finally finished the sketches, but now they want me to chain it down, to turn it into an amusement park! I retreat to my cell, wondering how it‚Äôll be possible to recreate a one of a kind.

‚ÄúThey want it by next month, Kaven. Don‚Äôt disappoint the company.‚Äù The voice that came out of my phone reminds me, yet it takes all my effort not to hang up. What lies before me is a disfigured corpse of a god, stripped of all its beauty and significance. I can‚Äôt see its humanity, its sense of pride in itself. Too much has been removed, shackled. I almost wrote it off, a mockery of my architecture‚Äîdesigned by me.
‚ÄúOf course, boss.‚Äù Soon, it should be done.

Soon, it will hit the final note.

I stand before the realized dream. The crowd‚Äôs chattering is twisted and sick. How could you appreciate this? How could you appreciate the horrible vomit of a homunculus? Do you appreciate everything shoved in your face?! Is that the secret? To disfigure what‚Äôs mine? Is that what pleases you all?!

I never thought it would happen. I never thought I would reach the stage all architects yearn for‚Äîto connect with their design. I can hear it. It‚Äôs calling for me. So sudden. One moment, the crowd turns and disappears, shaken by the rumbling laugh the building gives. For a moment, it smiles at me, before pulling me into its embrace, crushing me with the weight of hard, cold stone built with a quality that was never my standard. The building gave way to my exit‚Äî
and to my rise of acknowledgement.

Perhaps it was always meant to be like this? They call it a disaster after it killed me, along with countless others. Some laughed, some cried, most fell silent. They blame it on me‚Äîa failed architect, an incompetent designer.

But they remember me. A silver lining, perhaps.

And that‚Äôs how I became famous.

I regularly eat about one meal every day because I don‚Äôt feel hungry until I‚Äôm suddenly starving, and by then I would end up eating a lot of one food item I crave. I don‚Äôt realise when I‚Äôm full until I‚Äôm absolutely about to explode, which by then I find it easiest to just throw up until I don‚Äôt feel stuffed anymore.

I grew up fairly malnourished given that my parents withheld meals and/or didn‚Äôt eat with me (I had to work while they ate), which definitely contributed towards my non-existent eating habits. (There are more days than I can count where I just had coffee and half a bagel as a child.)

I don‚Äôt have a fear of my body weight but it‚Äôs just this terrible eating habit. 

I also find it really hard to be forced to eat when I‚Äôm not naturally motivated because, when I was even younger than the ages I‚Äôve mentioned, I‚Äôve been forced to eat certain things (this isn‚Äôt to trauma dump but to make clear: things such as raw eggs mixed with honey and milk, which I puke up because it tastes awful but I‚Äôd be forced to then drink my own puke over and over).

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed in myself (and heard from others too):

* **Constant fatigue** ‚Äì You wake up tired, even after 8 hours of sleep. Coffee doesn‚Äôt even touch it.
* **Brain fog** ‚Äì Opening an email and re-reading the same sentence 5 times before replying.
* **Cynicism** ‚Äì Work used to excite you, but now you roll your eyes at every ‚Äúurgent‚Äù request.
* **Irritability** ‚Äì A coworker asks a simple question and you snap. Later, you regret it.
* **Sleep/appetite changes** ‚Äì Either crashing the moment you get home, or lying awake at 2AM thinking about tomorrow‚Äôs tasks.

It feels like you‚Äôre running on empty, but you still keep pushing. That‚Äôs burnout. It‚Äôs more than tiredness ‚Äî it‚Äôs your mind and body waving a white flag.

Some common causes I see:

* No boundaries (emails at midnight, ‚Äúurgent‚Äù always means ASAP).
* Lack of control (being told to ‚Äújust figure it out‚Äù with no guidance).
* Emotional overload (carrying deadlines, office politics, and personal stuff all at once).

Quick self-check:

* Do you dread work every morning?
* Do you feel emotionally numb, like you‚Äôre just ‚Äúgetting through the day‚Äù?
* Have you lost the joy or meaning you once had in your role?

If yes to most, it might be more than stress.

I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but what‚Äôs helped me is setting firmer boundaries (no emails after dinner), actually taking breaks, and finding small outlets outside of work (journaling, sports, even just a walk without my phone).

Dry brining the night before vs just adding salt when you're cooking a slab of meat.

Using MSG+fish sauce vs MSG+anchovy paste vs just MSG, or something along those lines

Salting each step of the way vs just at the end.  Ethan Chlebowski mentioned in his salt video that he always suspected that the reason salting each step of the way seems to ""work"" was that it just tricked people into using sufficient amounts of salt.  He never got around to testing this AFAIK.

Some people are completely fine with a single alert ‚Äî the phone pings, they see it, and they act. For others, one ping is never enough: if they don‚Äôt get a second or third nudge, the task just drifts out of sight and never gets done.

I‚Äôve also noticed that timing plays a big role. A reminder that arrives when you‚Äôre already busy can feel like background noise, but one that lands in a predictable slot ‚Äî like just before lunch, or right as you‚Äôre packing up for the day ‚Äî seems more likely to stick. Then there‚Äôs habit stacking, where a reminder is tied to something you already do without thinking (like drinking water when you make coffee, or reviewing your calendar as soon as you sit down at your desk).

For me, what seems to matter most is context. A reminder on its own isn‚Äôt enough unless it‚Äôs connected to something bigger: either part of a routine, or reinforced by repetition. Otherwise, I‚Äôm just as likely to swipe it away as I am to actually follow through.

I‚Äôm curious how others here approach this. Do you rely on one strong reminder, or do you prefer multiple spaced nudges? Have you found that tying reminders to routines or habits makes a difference? Or do you use a completely different system to make sure tasks don‚Äôt get lost in the shuffle?",3,1756719010.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

For some context, I (23F) lost my mother when I was a baby due to a freak accident. I grew up with just my dad until I was about 8, and because of that him and I have an extremely close, healthy relationship. He remarried to my stepmother, who is 18 years younger than him when I was around 8 years old. They had my half sister (11F) when I was 12. My stepmother and I have always had a rocky relationship. We‚Äôve made many mistakes on both ends. She took the more authoritative parenting role in my life while my dad was more of a laid back parent which definitely caused rifts in our relationship. I like to believe I was a pretty normal kid overall. I got straight A‚Äôs as a kid. I fucked up a little bit in high school (dated the boy my parents didn‚Äôt like, got caught drinking and smoking weed once or twice, etc.), but overall I like to think I have a good head on my shoulders and came out to be very successful now in my 20s. I did unfortunately get diagnosed with BPD about a month ago, and my specialists believe that it stems from a fear of abandonment tied to my relationship with her. 

Growing up it always felt like I was vying for her to treat me like I was an average child. When I got my first phone, I was going into ninth grade (which was pretty late for where I lived, I was the last of my friends to get a phone) and I had to sign a PAPER CONTRACT with rules for how I was allowed to use the phone. When I would get my phone upgraded, she would go the next day and get a better phone than I had. Always getting pushback when I asked for certain things that my friends had, like name brand stuff, like clothes from Justice and American Eagle. I remember really wanting a hoverboard lol, dumb stuff like that. Always was told no when we stopped at a coffee shop and I wanted a muffin or donut. Got grounded for what seems now like relatively small things. These small incidences have added up over time. My best friend works with my stepmom and she makes comments to her about me, about how I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell her anything about my life‚Äù and that ‚Äúmy dad is lucky she didn‚Äôt divorce him because of me‚Äù. She once told that I made it difficult for her to love me as a child. That‚Äôs always stuck with me.

Now to my sister, we‚Äôll call her L. She has a very close relationship with my stepmother. She seems to get everything she wants, and has the relationship that I wish I could have had with my stepmother. She has a closet filled to the brim with Lululemon. She asked for a hoverboard for Christmas one year, got it. She just got a phone going into sixth grade. Every time stepmom stops for coffee, she gets something. If you looked at my stepmother‚Äôs social media, you would genuinely think she has one child. It is filled with pictures of L, with maybe one picture of me from when I won an academic competition in high school. In my opinion, L has some serious behavior issues. She is in therapy for some serious anxiety, and unfortunately because of this it has led to her having zero consequences for her actions. When I lived with my parents she would constantly (and I mean every week) go in my room and take things that belong to me. I would always call her out on it, because I felt like if I didn‚Äôt then no one would. She recently went into my room while I wasn‚Äôt home with her friend, went through my stuff, and found some of my adult toys which she proceeded to not put back. I got mad at her and called her out. I ended up getting chewed out by stepmom for saying something to her. She ended up fessing up that she does it for attention from me, which I felt extremely bad about. She unfortunately has been put a bit on the back burner in my life recently due to multiple factors (just graduated college and got a big girl job, just moved out to my first apartment, balancing friends/family/relationship, relationship with stepmom is rocky which makes it hard, etc.) I ended up having a talk with her that I thought went relatively well. I explained to her that it‚Äôs not my intention to be mad at her all the time and I promised to make more time for her. I told her (without getting into detail about stepmom) the factors that have played into my lack of time for her. After that, I took her back to school shopping on my own dime. She then proceeded to tell my best friend that ‚ÄúI got her a bunch of stuff that she didn‚Äôt even want‚Äù. This hurt me, especially after we had just had this talk and I spent over $300 of my own money on her. So, I said something to my father, who said something to her. I ended up getting a text that night from stepmom essentially yelling at me for getting upset at the comment.

My breaking point was today. It‚Äôs my birthday, and we decided to have a small family celebration at my own house. L came up to me, completely unprovoked, and told me that I ‚Äúhave a lot of pimples on my back‚Äù. Thanks, very nice of you to say!! I walked away, and ended up coming back and simply saying ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt a very nice thing to say to me‚Äù. She went upstairs and cried after getting called out. She was never disciplined.

I came to the conclusion leaving today that I feel like a stranger in my own home. I don‚Äôt like my stepmother as a person or as a mother. I am genuinely starting to not like my sister, which sounds crazy because she is eleven years old. I look at L and all I feel is hatred and jealousy for all of the love and things I never had growing up. I want to cut off my stepmother, I know that for sure. But at this point in time, I feel like my mental health would be better if I cut out any ties to my stepmom, which includes my sister. This just feels so crazy and unfair when I say it. She‚Äôs eleven. She is a child, and I can‚Äôt be mad at a child. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I apologize for the length.

Cuz the air you breathe there matters just as much as what‚Äôs inside your home. Unfortunately, rolling up the windows doesn‚Äôt protect you. Pollutants, dust, smoke, and even bacteria still creep in.

So, being the nerd I am, I went down the rabbit hole researching (and trying some) of the best car air purifiers you can actually buy in India right now. If you‚Äôre in Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida.... or honestly anywhere where the AQI looks more like your exam roll number than a healthy level...this list is for you.

üëâ Before you scroll, let me just drop this: **if you love your lungs even half as much as you love your iPhone, click below and just get one already.**

# 1. Reffair AX30 MAX ‚Äì Compact Purifier with Aroma Therapy

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Reffair-AX30-MAX-Internationally-Aromabuds/dp/B0912WJ87V/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

If you‚Äôre looking for something small but dependable, this model makes sense

* **Why it‚Äôs cool:** It uses an H13 True HEPA filter, which means it‚Äôs built to handle PM2.5 particles...the main culprit in city air. On top of that, plasma ion tech adds another layer of purification.
* **Bonus point:** Aromatherapy function. Imagine stuck in Ring Road traffic but your car smells like lavender instead of exhaust fumes.
* **For whom?** Anyone who wants a budget-friendly, compact purifier that doesn‚Äôt compromise on essential filtration.

# 2. Philips GP3601 ‚Äì Serious Filtration for Serious Pollution

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/filteration-particles-Equivelant-eliminating-certified/dp/B0CRRWXQC4?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Philips always nails health gadgets and this purifier is no exception.

* **Why it‚Äôs cool:** It can trap particles as tiny as 0.004 microns (H14 grade level), which is far beyond what most models in this range offer.
* **Extra flex:** Built-in UVC light that kills up to 99.9% of bacteria and viruses and it does this without producing ozone, so it‚Äôs safe for everyday use.
* **For whom?** People who drive daily in high-pollution zones and want top-notch filtration rather than just a ‚Äúfresh smell.‚Äù

# 3. Honeywell Move Pure5 ‚Äì Reliable and Practical Choice

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Launched-Purifier-Filtration-bacteria/dp/B0DRT91QSK?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Honeywell knows their air business, and this model proves it.

* **For whom?** Families or rideshare warriors...perfect if your car is always full of people and snacks.

# 4. Qubo Car Air Purifier Pro ‚Äì Indian Brand, Straightforward Build

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Qubo-Filtration-Technology-Pre-filter-Activated/dp/B0DHGFCG6P?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Made by Hero Group, this purifier feels solid.

* **Why it‚Äôs cool:** It uses 3-layer filtration (pre-filter, HEPA 13, and activated carbon), and the negative ion feature helps keep the air inside crisp.
* **Feels like:** The balance... it‚Äôs not over-engineered, but it does what most people actually need: remove dust, smoke, and odors efficiently.
* **For whom?** Drivers who prefer a reliable Indian-brand product that‚Äôs easy to maintain and service locally.

# 5. Wellinzer TAG5 ‚Äì German Style, Indian Roads

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Wellinzer-TAG5-Car-Purifier-Ionizer/dp/B0BFJ5TFTZ?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

This one takes a different route.

* **Why it‚Äôs cool:** Instead of full HEPA filtration, it relies on releasing 10 million negative ions to freshen up the air. That makes it great for removing odors and giving a ‚Äúcleaner feel,‚Äù but not the best pick if your city‚Äôs AQI regularly hits the ‚ÄúHazardous‚Äù range.
* **Feels Like:** Sleek German design and portability... it‚Äôs light, simple, and fuss-free.
* **For whom?** If you‚Äôre all about minimal, portable, no-fuss gadgets.

# 6. Philips GoPure GP5212 ‚Äì Premium Option for Consistent Clean Air

üîó [Check here](https://www.amazon.in/Philips-Automotive-Lighting-Performance-Purifier/dp/B099HL5SV2?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

This is Philips‚Äô higher-end model and it shows. Big brother in the room.

* **Why it‚Äôs cool:** . With a high-performance HEPA filter and fast cleaning speed, it‚Äôs designed for people who don‚Äôt want to compromise on indoor air quality while driving.
* **Feels like:** Consistency. It cleans faster than most compact models and holds up well over long drives.
* **For whom?** If budget isn‚Äôt your main concern and you want something dependable for daily use in heavy-traffic areas.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì So, Which One Should You Get?

If you want **value + compact design** ‚Üí go for **Reffair AX30 MAX**.  
If you want **premium protection + virus-killing flex** ‚Üí Philips GP3601 or GP5212.  
If you want **practical daily use + extra USB charging** ‚Üí Honeywell Move Pure5 is your best buddy.

üëâ Honestly, don‚Äôt overthink it. The AQI won‚Äôt wait for you to ‚Äúresearch more.‚Äù Just pick the one that fits your budget and car size. Your lungs will thank you every single day.

Performance is key. I'll be on the road a lot with this laptop, but places where I can charge often, so battery is nice, but not top priority.

Yes.

Editing: Audacity, Divinci Resolve, Fruityloops, Krita

The middle white part is milky white. On the contrary, for domestic products, the selected leather embryos are all the poor ones left over after being picked by foreign countries, and only the spraying process can be used. The middle white part will have a slight bluish tint, and the pores in the coffee-colored part are not so obvious. Moreover, the hand feel is also different.

The shocking part of this story came when the journalist was told that the cartel hitmen were trained by Israeli's.","https://x.com/RyanMattaMedia/status/1923719979251446000

https://x.com/RyanMattaMedia/status/1962334084916510866

Evidence suggests that Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, has a policy or practice of funding or indirectly funding drug cartels. Allegations and claims have surfaced over the years, often tied to specific incidents or individuals, suggesting possible involvement in activities that indirectly supported cartels, particularly in Latin America during the 1980s.  Below, I‚Äôll outline the key points based on available information, critically examining the narrative while acknowledging the limitations of the evidence.

Key Allegations and Sources
1. Israeli Involvement with Colombian Cartels (Medell√≠n Cartel)
   Training and Arms Supply: Reports from the late 1980s, notably a 1989 *Los Angeles Times* article, documented that Israeli instructors, including former army Colonel Yair Klein, trained paramilitary units linked to the Medell√≠n Cartel in Colombia. A videotape showed Klein running military and assassination training for about 50 men, including Alfredo Vaquero (alias ""Vladimir""), a leader of the cartel‚Äôs death squads. These squads were blamed for killing judges and court workers. Colombian authorities also identified key cartel figures, including Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha, as involved in the training program.
   Arms Shipments: A 1990 *Washington Post* article reported that a weapons cache, including Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns and other surplus military equipment, was found on a ranch owned by Rodr√≠guez Gacha after his death. Colombian officials alleged that Israeli mercenaries, including Klein, facilitated these shipments. A high-ranking Colombian official claimed the Israeli government knew and consented to the arms sales, though Israel‚Äôs Defense Ministry denied knowledge of how the weapons reached private hands.
   Klein‚Äôs Defense Klein, through his company Spearhead Ltd., claimed his actions were legal and approved by the Israeli government. He was convicted in absentia by a Colombian court for training paramilitaries and faced an Interpol warrant but was never extradited from Israel. Some Israeli media, like journalist Nahum Barnea, defended Klein, arguing that similar activities occurred during Israel‚Äôs involvement in Lebanon, where allies like the Phalangists were tied to the drug trade.
   Mossad Connection?
While Klein was a former Israeli military officer, there‚Äôs no direct evidence linking his activities to Mossad. However, books like *Dangerous Liaison* by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn and articles from *Middle East Monitor* suggest that Israel‚Äôs intelligence community, including Mossad, may have had knowledge of or tacitly approved such operations as part of broader geopolitical strategies, such as acting as a U.S. proxy in Latin America during the Cold War. These sources argue that the Israeli government‚Äôs oversight of arms exports implies some level of state awareness.

2. Thai Heroin Trade:
   - In his 1990 book *By Way of Deception*, former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky claimed that Mossad used the Thai heroin trade in the late 1970s to raise funds for covert operations on U.S. soil, which he suggested were likely illegal under U.S. law. Ostrovsky wrote that Mossad contacted opium growers in Thailand, offering to help them export opium while supporting coffee production as a cover, to finance operations like undermining Arab diplomacy at the United Nations.

3. Mexican Cartels and Israeli Spyware
   A 2020 TRT World report noted that Mexican drug cartels, including the Sinaloa Cartel, gained access to Israeli-made spyware, often through corrupt officials reselling government-purchased equipment. While the spyware was initially sold to the Mexican government, its leakage to cartels raised concerns about oversight.

   A 2019 ‚ÄúTimes of Israel‚Äù article linked the assassination of two Israelis in Mexico City to disputes over money laundering and drug cartel activities, possibly involving the Jalisco Cartel. This suggests criminal connections to Mossad‚Äôs direct involvement.

she‚Äôs fun to be with, but most of the time i‚Äôm the one initiating stuff. she still seems to enjoy hanging out tho, like she even play hits me sometimes and teases me.

here‚Äôs the big problem tho: when we first started texting, it was literally on her 19th birthday. she asked my age and i panicked because i‚Äôm 17. so i lied and said i was 18, even gave her a fake birthday. truth is, i‚Äôm turning 18 in like 10 days

now i feel stuck. i can‚Äôt keep lying obviously, but i don‚Äôt know how to come clean without looking like an idiot. she‚Äôs a year older anyway, so it‚Äôs not like me being younger is a dealbreaker‚Ä¶ but the lie might be.

so how and when should i tell her?

EDIT: yes guys i obviously plan to tell her as soon as possible but as i said my birthday is in a week and i cant come up with the confidence to blurt it out

For my free time, I still buy coffee or order takeout every day. But these small choices add up much faster than I expected.

I (54f) met my friend (54f) when we were both 19 working at the same bank. I remember her being very emotional and sensitive but so was I (probably even more so). She became quite controlling at the time and after I got married, I let the friendship dwindle - probably ghosted her. 

Anyway fast forward to 7 years ago, after a horrible divorce from a 22 year emotionally abusive marriage, we came into contact again, I think Facebook or something. 

We connected right away and she was very supportive of me. She is a very good person. Things went well for about two years, she insisted on being invited to my second wedding which was for family only, arrived late and then stayed over at the guest house which we booked out for the family and my family had to move themselves around to find her a bed. 

Anyway, that was all okay for then, but then slowly she started demanding we see each other more - I told her at one stage that I can‚Äôt do coffee (which usually ends up as a few hours) more than once a month as I have high social anxiety. She started buying me expensive gifts (I can‚Äôt afford to do the same for her as we are not rich). She started commenting and giving advice like I am a child etc etc. We constantly text (at least 5 days a week - and it is very difficult for me, but I want to try and have a friend)

I had my diagnosis (AUDHD) in April this year. I told her about it as I thought she would maybe now understand why I can‚Äôt handle to have that much contact. She started treating me even more like a disappointment mother, saying she worries about me and when I ask why, she says she just does. At one stage I realised that most of my stress revolved around her and so I texted her this (we both don‚Äôt like talking on the phone)

Dearest [. ], I appreciate your friendship so much and how deeply you care. But at the moment I am going through a lot of personal things, especially after my ‚Äòdiagnosis‚Äô, and I realize now that I need more time and space to process things in my own way.

This isn‚Äôt about you and you definitely haven‚Äôt done anything wrong ‚Äî I just have less capacity right now for people and for all the different and sometimes conflicting advice and well-meant encouragement. I know that very few people can really understand how my mind works and what it feels like to be me. This is just something I need for myself right now.

My psychologist is helping me a lot, and I feel like I make better progress when I only focus on myself and my family.

I‚Äôll contact you again when I have more capacity. Take good care of yourself ‚Äî I know you hate this message. I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt be there for you right now ‚Äî I‚Äôm praying for you and [.  ]‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

She took two days to answer and then just texted: I hear you. Be blessed. 

She stopped liking my posts on instagram and I know her well enough to see that she is angry/ hurt. 

I feel so much less stressed without her in my life and after her reaction I actually don‚Äôt want to contact her again. 

But now I feel sorry for her and I see al the things she gave me and I kind of think I should give it back to her because I feel guilty (things like her old designer clothes etc and an expensive artwork (About $300 worth), but I think that will make her more angry - I just don‚Äôt want her to use it against me at some stage. 

She is a good person. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Everyone said to not do it and I did understand why. Its toxic, it's not healthy. I asked anyways

What truely made me ask was a dream. It's silly but it was a lucid dream where him and this woman with dark hair were staring at me and it startled me awake. I've had vivid dreams like this before when my bf at the time was cheating. Whether you believe in that or not, my guts never been wrong

I asked and he was hesitant and withdrawn but said yes. He showed me specific texts (he has A LOT of friends, many of which are women) 

One woman he was texted this week and asked her out for coffee. He told me they were work buddies and that she has a kid and a possible boyfriend. I find that odd.

Is this normal for social people? Why would you ask someone out for coffee casually if it's not work related. There were other women friends he talks too consistantly but that particular one made me very unconfortable 

He keeps telling me he wants to stop meeting people and socializing so much and yet here he is asking an attractive woman ""friend"" out for coffee 

I feel like a fool. Everything in me is telling me he's lying, twisting everything around to sound innocent

Ever got that d√©j√† vu feeling, like AI is reincarnating old ideas with a futuristic makeover? Spoiler alert: You're not imagining things‚ÄîAI might just be the ultimate nostalgia trip for tech geeks. While it wears a snazzy new outfit, the roots are as old-school as bell-bottoms.

‚Äî **Blast From the Past: A Brief AI History** ‚Äî

**1950s Symbolic AI:** Tried to mimic human logic but fell flat on ambiguity‚Äîlike trying to charge a smartphone with static electricity.

**1980s Expert Systems:** Promised to handle everything for you, until it hit a weird situation and asked you to call IT.

**2010s Deep Learning:** Finally, the comeback tour! With better tech, AI started powering everything from your phone‚Äôs camera to self-driving cars.

**The Cycle:** Same blueprint, just fancier tech. AI keeps resurrecting itself whenever we've got the gadgets to support its dreams.

‚Äî **So, What‚Äôs Innovation Then?** ‚Äî

Most AI ""innovations"" are like adding more fireworks to an old rocket. Bigger scale, yes. New revolution? Not quite. That doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt cool‚Äîas long as you‚Äôre not expecting HAL 9000 to suddenly invent coffee.

‚Äî **Borrowing From History: The Cheat Sheet** ‚Äî

**Neural Networks:** Old-school still rocks, just add more juice.

**Computer Vision:** Grandpa of today‚Äôs AI eye-candy.

Tried dating apps such as FB dating, Bumble, and Tinder with no luck from the previous years. Reinstalled bumble for the past days kasi why not ky free time na ulit ako then may naka match ako na isang girl(28F) from QC, Ok naman si ate gurl mo pasok sa tipo ko siya and we hit it up naman from the start, although we've had 1 day na usapan lang gusto niya agad mag meetup which is fine din naman sakin kasi I preferred meeting up in person agad base sa description ng profile ko I preferred this way din kasi to see if the level of attraction can still be maintained sa personal. 

So fast forward last sunday, sakto naman at may lakad din ako na balak ko na lang siya puntahan after that lakad, we set to meetup na malapit lang sa lugar niya and and I let her choose the place which is a local coffee shop on the area. Around noon time like an hour before the meet up nagsabi siya na medyo may hangover daw siya kasi may kasiyahan daw sila ng mga ka officemate niya sa condo last night at tinanong ko naman kung okay at kaya ba niya na makapunta which sabi niya keri naman daw niya. Tinanong ko rin kung gano ba siya kalayo sa meeting place and she said about 10 minutes lang naman daw so sabi ko okay kasi malapit na din naman ako. I arrived at the coffee shop before 1PM kaso wala pa si ate gurl so I decided to order muna ng coffee. 20 minutes passed and no updates, iniisip ko baka na stood up na ako haha then about 30 minutes. Dumating din naman siya. Kala ko casual lang ang mangyayare na usap lang or kumustahan sa coffee shop more like getting to know each other ang mangyayari, di pa kami nakakaupo sabi niya may mas alam daw siyang place na mas okay daw tambayan eh di ko pa nababawasan ng 1/4 yung coffee ko sabi niya iwan ko na daw kasi baka ano isipin dun sa shop na pupuntahan namin which is weird pero pinagbigyan ko na lang.

 Pumunta kami dun sa sinabi niyang place na di din naman kalayuan sa coffee shop, yung place is mini resto bar infairness instagramable naman yung lugar, masarap din yung food I recommend it for dating. Sabi ko total first meetup naman to pumayag naman siya na sagot ko siya. Sa pilian ng food yung una medyo mura yung pinili ko na food sabi niya nahihiya daw siya kasi mas mahal daw yung bet niya sabi ko goods lang and don't mind it. So ayun na nga, medyo vocal si ate gurl and madaldal which is hindi naman turnoff sakin kasi mas maganda nga yung ganun kasi parang hindi boring yung date. Let's say may outgoing personality siya. 

Ayun andami naman namin napagusapan tungkol sa buhay buhay like dati daw siyang taga pasig lumipat sa cainta bla bla bla kala ko talaga nag click kami or like there's some connection. Nagtanong din siya ano work ko which I explained din naman sa kanya. Then nung nag explain siya sa work niya may gusto siyang ipasok na topic na about stem cell something. Sabi niya graphic designer daw siya currently and may part time daw siyang ginagawa which is yung drop shipping (I still don't have idea kung ano ba to nung naguusap kami). And I dont mind na may side hustle si ate kasi di biro yung ganung dedication ah. So middle of the conversation nung nalaman niya na may supplement ako na tinitake pinasok niya ulit yung topic ng stem cell sabi ko sa kanya mukhang mahal yun kasi alam ko ini-inject yun sabi niya hindi daw. Kala ko lilipas na yung topic na yun. Sabi niya check ko daw kala ko like check ko sa fb or google ganun hindi pala. 

Natapos na kami kumain kala ko goods na like bounce na sana ako. Sabi niya samahan ko daw siya muna papunta sa office nila kasi papakilala daw niya ako dun sa mga ka office mates niya napaisip ako angbilis ah pero go lang ang kuya mo haha. btw yung office is di naman kalayuan dun sa  kinainan naming place tapos base sa usapan namin magaling daw siya mag reto ganern,  kaya pala nung tinatanong ko ano hanap sa lalaki either pogi or mayaman daw which is napa ""okay"" na lang ako mukhang alanganin na agad ako dun haha. So ayun sinamahan ko naman niya, pagdating ko sa lugar yung harap ng building alam mo yung typical na pang frontrow yung mga nakalagay, may mga tarpaulin sila ng highest earner ganun tapos may mga pang hikayat na mag invest daw kuno. Sabi ko sa kanya ay sorry di ako papasok diyan. Dun pa lang ako naghinala na ako like damn parang pang networking ata to ah haha. Nag insist siya na hindi daw sila ganun. Na pioneer daw sila and check ko lang naman daw wala naman daw ako ilalabas na pera tapos nakipag argue na ako na I can't commit sa mga ganyang bagay, kasi wala naman talagang passive income, like lahat yan need mo paglaanan ng oras at pera which is di ko kaya ma commit sa ngayon. Naghahanap siya nung kakilala niya sa labas possible colleague niya din buti wala namang ibang lumapit samin, sabi ko sa kanya pasensya na di ako interested and di ako comfortable sa place na yun. Wala naman siya nagawa kaya umalis na lang din ako ng medyo dismayado. 

Nakakainis lang kasi kala ko genuine na yung usapan namin kasi sa totoo lang I'm interested to her lalo yung mga sinabi niya about sa situation niya and family niya etc. after that feeling ko hindi totoo yung mga bagay na sinabi niya nung nag meet kami. Nakakapanghinayan lang din na nag invest ka ng oras at panahon like bruhh pumorma din naman ako tapos tapos networking pala sa dulo haha (aray ko!). Ayun lang gusto ko lang mailabas to kasi nahirapan ako matulog kagabi hahaha nakakatrauma pala kasi nababasa ko lang to at nakikita ko sa meme di ko inasahan na mangyayari din sakin lol.

1n5jgk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeanMedicalUnis/comments/1n5jgk0/your_ultimate_guide_to_trakia_university/,Your Ultimate Guide to Trakia University ‚Äì Everything You Need To Know,"This guide includes: First-year, Accommodation, Language, Banking, Bureaucratic work (Residence Permit & Tax Number)

# ü©∫ First-year ‚Äì What to Expect

The academic year at Trakia starts in October (with admin and induction in September).

* Years 1‚Äì2 (Pre-clinical): Subjects include Anatomy, Histology, Physiology, Biochemistry, and Embryology. Anatomy is widely seen as the toughest early subject.
* Years 3‚Äì6 (Clinical): You combine hospital rotations at the University Hospital in Stara Zagora with lectures.
* Classes are taught fully in English, but clinical years involve Bulgarian-speaking patients ‚Äî so language basics are important.

üìå Tip: The first weeks are the best time to meet classmates. Most students are nervous but excited, so take initiative ‚Äî grab coffee, explore Stara Zagora, or cook dinner together. Friendships usually start forming here.

# üè† Accommodation

There are two main options:

* Dormitories: On-campus student dorms cost roughly ‚Ç¨75‚Äì‚Ç¨150/month. They‚Äôre convenient, cheaper, and a good option for first-years. Apply early, as spots can fill.
* Private flats: Shared flats in Stara Zagora cost around ‚Ç¨150‚Äì‚Ç¨250/month per person, while single apartments can go up to ‚Ç¨300‚Äì‚Ç¨400.

üìç Most students choose areas close to the university or city centre, with easy bus links. Stara Zagora is compact and affordable compared to Sofia or Plovdiv.

# üí≥ Banking

Most international students rely on Revolut or Wise for:

* Paying tuition in instalments
* Managing rent & daily expenses
* Receiving a debit card linked to an IBAN

You can also open a Bulgarian account with UniCredit Bulbank, DSK Bank, or Postbank, but for most, Revolut/Wise works perfectly.

# üó£Ô∏è Language

* Classes: Entirely in English for all 6 years.
* Hospital years (3‚Äì6): Patients speak Bulgarian, so you‚Äôll need conversational skills.

üìå Recommended: Aim for B1 Bulgarian by Year 3. Apps like Busuu (with CEFR-structured lessons) or YouTube resources can help. Even a little effort goes a long way with patients.

# üóÇÔ∏è Bureaucratic Work ‚Äì Residence Permit & Tax Number

# For Non-EU students:

* You must apply for a residence permit within 90 days of arrival.
* Start at the post office, where you submit documents (passport, acceptance letter, proof of finances, health insurance, rental agreement).
* You‚Äôll get a receipt with an appointment for fingerprints at Immigration. Later, you‚Äôll receive an SMS when your residence card is ready.

# üí∞ Costs of Living

* Tuition fees (2025‚Äì26): ‚Ç¨9,000/year, payable in 2 instalments.
* Living costs: \~‚Ç¨400‚Äì‚Ç¨600/month total.
* Dorms: ‚Ç¨75‚Äì‚Ç¨150/month.
* Shared flat: ‚Ç¨150‚Äì‚Ç¨250/month (per person).

üìå Overall, Stara Zagora is one of the most affordable cities in Bulgaria for medical studies.

# ‚úÖ Quick Recap

* Programme: 6-year Medicine in English
* Tuition: ‚Ç¨9,000/year (2025 onwards)
* Start: October intake
* Recognition: Degree valid across EU/EEA & UK (GMC-approved)
* Students: \~9,000 overall, \~600 in Medicine
* Living costs: \~‚Ç¨400‚Äì‚Ç¨600/month (much cheaper than Sofia)
* Hospital training: Built into later years at university hospital
* Language: English classes, but Bulgarian needed for patient contact

üëâ That‚Äôs the verified guide to Trakia University!  
If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable EU-recognised medical degree in a smaller, student-friendly city, TU is a solid option.",3,1756716228.0,EuropeanMedicalUnis,0,1.0,False
1n5jfh1,https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/uaes-campaign-against-islamists-fuels,UAE‚Äôs campaign against Islamists fuels moves to ban the Muslim Brotherhood and anti-Muslim sentiment,"By James M. Dorsey

United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed sounded an alarm bell eight years ago that rings loudly today.

Fuelling a global groundswell of anti-Muslim and anti-migrant sentiment, Mr. Bin Zayed, warned a World Economic Forum panel in 2017 that ‚Äúthere will come a day that [we will see far more radical extremists and terrorists coming out of Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwzea7OpZ48&ab_channel=AIJAC) because of lack of decision‚Äêmaking, trying to be politically correct, or assuming that (the Europeans) know the Middle East, and they know Islam, and they know the others far better than we do‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs pure ignorance.‚Äù

Muslims, activists, liberals, and moderate conservatives rejected Mr. Bin Zayed‚Äôs broad-brush definition of who is an extremist and advocacy of a crackdown on non-violent political Islam.

Moreover, his prediction did not pan out.

Islamic State attacks in Europe have tapered off since Mr. Bin Zayed made his assertions, following a wave of attacks in the years immediately before he made his remarks.

Mr. Bin Zayed would likely credit the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and Western nations‚Äô adoption of Emirati definitions, supported by, among others, Egypt, for the stark reduction in the number of jihadist attacks on European soil.

Mr. Bin Zayed will also probably take heart from seeing the UAE‚Äôs long-standing no-holds-barred campaign to persuade Western and other nations to proscribe the Muslim Brotherhood as the source of all Islamist evil, produce results.

While the United States has designated Brotherhood offshoots and individuals as terrorists, it has stopped short of labelling the group as such.

That could change with lawmakers, including Republicans Ted Cruz and Representative Mario D√≠az-Balart and Democrat Jared Moskowitz, [reviving efforts to pass a bill in Congress](https://mariodiazbalart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/diaz-balart-moskowitz-reintroduce-muslim-brotherhood-terrorist) that would mandate designating the Brotherhood under US law.

Messrs. Diaz-Balart and Moscowitz co-chair The Friends of Egypt Caucus.

In May, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered his government to draw up proposals to [tackle the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/21/macron-urges-government-action-on-muslim-brotherhood-s-influence-in-france_6741505_7.html) and the spread of political Islam in France, following the release of a 75-page UAE-inspired government report that Mr. Macron‚Äôs office said, ""Clearly establishes the anti-republican and subversive nature of the Muslim Brotherhood"" and ""proposes ways to address this threat.""

The report estimated that at most 1,000 of France‚Äôs 5-7 million Muslims were formal members of the Brotherhood. Brotherhood-affiliated groups operated 139 or seven per cent of France‚Äôs 2,300 mosques and 21 of the country‚Äôs 74 Islamic schools.

Turks, followed by Moroccans and Algerians, rank as the [largest groups of individuals](https://nordicmonitor.com/2025/08/turks-among-top-groups-stripped-of-french-citizenship-over-jihadist-terror-links/) whom France has stripped of their nationality on charges of jihadist activity.

In April, Jordan, in the most recent decisive action, [banned the Brotherhood](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwzywjwgvyo) and criminalised promotion of its ideology after security services arrested 16 people associated with the Brotherhood on suspicion of plotting rocket and drone attacks.

The Brotherhood-affiliated Islamic Action Front, the largest opposition group in the Jordanian parliament, denied involvement. The group, which was not included in the Brotherhood ban, reiterated that it ""remained committed to its peaceful approach.""

The government has accused the Front of instigating pro-Hamas demonstrations in the kingdom.

In the final analysis, the question is whether crackdowns on freedoms of expression and assembly, leaving Muslims and others with few, if any, release valves, coupled with anger at Western and Arab restrictions on expression of support for the Palestinians and a Western refusal to sanction Israel for its Gaza war conduct, creates a feeding ground for a next generation of Islamist militants.

A 2019 [Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) memo](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/cia-memo-designating-muslim-brotherhood-could-fuel-extremism-214757/) warned that designating the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organisation ‚Äúmay fuel extremism‚Äù and damage relations with America's allies.

The memo noted that the group has ‚Äúrejected violence as a matter of official policy and opposed Al-Qaeda and ISIS,‚Äù an acronym for the Islamic State.

The memo acknowledged that ‚Äúa minority of MB (Muslim Brotherhood) members have engaged in violence, most often in response to harsh regime repression, perceived foreign occupation, or civil conflicts.‚Äù

Even so, Mr. Bin Zayed‚Äôs warning, echoed since then by Emirati surrogates, was a clarion called that fuelled anti-Muslim and anti-migrant sentiment in Europe, positioned the UAE as a crucial partner in Western opposition to Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and counterterrorism, and promoted the country's autocratic concept of moderate Islam and image as one of the world's most tolerant societies.

In that vein, Emirati strategic affairs analyst Amjad Taha recently argued that [the UAE was a beneficiary of flawed European policies](https://x.com/amjadt25/status/1960985314815828165). Mr. Taha singled out France and Britain.

Posting on X, Mr. Taha said, ‚ÄúChaos doesn‚Äôt just arrive; it sets up a company in London or Paris and opens a bank account. Look at the UK. Look at France. Some immigrants bring talent, but the majority bring Hamas‚Ä¶fatwas printed in Sudan by the Muslim Brotherhood-led army, the Hamas of Africa. And Paris? It welcomes immigrants from the Houthis in Yemen militia who treat death like a lifestyle brand.‚Äù

Mr. Taha asserted that 16,500 millionaires in Britain and 10,000 in France had decamped in 2023, while 9,800 had moved to the UAE in that year.

‚ÄúThat is not migration, that is profit. London and Paris are the drain. Abu Dhabi is the magnet,‚Äù Mr. Taha said.

‚ÄúHere in the UAE, 200 nationalities live as one: mosque, church, synagogue, all side by side. In London, they debate banning knives because stabbings are now the national pastime. In Paris, they cannot decide if the riot is over or just taking a coffee break,‚Äù he added.

The UAE's visceral opposition to political Islam was one reason that drove the country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020.

It also drives the UAE's backroom manoeuvring to secure an influential role in a post-war Gaza in which there is no place for Hamas, that, like Al-Fatah, the backbone of the West Bank-based, internationally recognised Palestine Authority, traces its roots to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Hamas [severed its ties to the Brotherhood](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hamas-softens-stance-on-israel-drops-muslim-brotherhood-link-idUSKBN17X1N9/) in 2017, as opposed to Al-Fatah, which projected itself as a secular nationalist movement from the outset.

The UAE, arguably Israel‚Äôs closest Arab partner, is the only Arab state to have publicly said it may contribute troops to a post-war Arab or multinational peacekeeping force and participate in a transitional administration of Gaza, albeit conditionally.

The UAE said it would only participate if an end to the war was linked to a credible US-led pathway to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. In addition, the UAE insisted that a reformed Palestine Authority would have to invite it.

The UAE and other Arab states, in line with Israel, have [rejected any future Hamas governance role](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/middleeast/arab-league-hamas-gaza-israel-intl) in post-war Gaza and demanded that the group disarm.

For its part, Egypt has begun [training several hundred members of the Palestine Authority‚Äôs security forces](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/egypt-is-training-palestinian-forces-to-take-over-postwar-gaza-0944d6fe) and Al-Fatah for participation in a peacekeeping force, despite Israel‚Äôs refusal to involve the Authority.

The UAE offer and the Egyptian training may be exercises in futility as long as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejects a complete withdrawal from Gaza and a role for the Palestine Authority.

‚ÄúThere will‚Ä¶be no ‚ÄòArab force‚Äô willing to stabilise or govern Gaza for Israel, without the Palestinian Authority, or after Israel withdraws to whatever ‚Äòsecurity perimeter‚Äô Netanyahu has in mind,‚Äù said Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington (AGISW) senior resident scholar Hussein Ibish.

As a result, ‚ÄúIsrael is‚Ä¶left with the fundamental choice it has had since the war began almost two years ago: reestablish an open-ended occupation throughout Gaza (thereby providing Hamas with ample targets for an insurgency that will only intensify over time), or withdraw and watch Hamas crawl out of the rubble and declare ‚Äòdivine victory,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Ibish said.

AGISW was established in 2015 with Emirati and Saudi seed money.

The Israeli military said, barely 24 hours after Mr. Ibish made his prediction, that an improvised explosive device in Gaza City had wounded seven Israeli soldiers.

That didn‚Äôt stop Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military‚Äôs Arabic language spokesman, [from accusing the ‚Äúbankrupt Muslim Brotherhood media‚Äù](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1961680819728142660) of publishing ‚Äúfalse news.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is not migration, that is profit. London and Paris are the drain. Abu Dhabi is the magnet,‚Äù Mr. Taha said.

‚ÄúHere in the UAE, 200 nationalities live as one: mosque, church, synagogue, all side by side. In London, they debate banning knives because stabbings are now the national pastime. In Paris, they cannot decide if the riot is over or just taking a coffee break,‚Äù he added.

The UAE's visceral opposition to political Islam was one reason that drove the country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020.

It also drives the UAE's backroom manoeuvring to secure an influential role in a post-war Gaza in which there is no place for Hamas, that, like Al-Fatah, the backbone of the West Bank-based, internationally recognised Palestine Authority, traces its roots to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Hamas [severed its ties to the Brotherhood](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/hamas-softens-stance-on-israel-drops-muslim-brotherhood-link-idUSKBN17X1N9/) in 2017, as opposed to Al-Fatah, which projected itself as a secular nationalist movement from the outset.

The UAE, arguably Israel‚Äôs closest Arab partner, is the only Arab state to have publicly said it may contribute troops to a post-war Arab or multinational peacekeeping force and participate in a transitional administration of Gaza, albeit conditionally.

The UAE said it would only participate if an end to the war was linked to a credible US-led pathway to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. In addition, the UAE insisted that a reformed Palestine Authority would have to invite it.

The UAE and other Arab states, in line with Israel, have [rejected any future Hamas governance role](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/30/middleeast/arab-league-hamas-gaza-israel-intl) in post-war Gaza and demanded that the group disarm.

For its part, Egypt has begun [training several hundred members of the Palestine Authority‚Äôs security forces](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/egypt-is-training-palestinian-forces-to-take-over-postwar-gaza-0944d6fe) and Al-Fatah for participation in a peacekeeping force, despite Israel‚Äôs refusal to involve the Authority.

The UAE offer and the Egyptian training may be exercises in futility as long as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejects a complete withdrawal from Gaza and a role for the Palestine Authority.

‚ÄúThere will‚Ä¶be no ‚ÄòArab force‚Äô willing to stabilise or govern Gaza for Israel, without the Palestinian Authority, or after Israel withdraws to whatever ‚Äòsecurity perimeter‚Äô Netanyahu has in mind,‚Äù said Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington (AGISW) senior resident scholar Hussein Ibish.

As a result, ‚ÄúIsrael is‚Ä¶left with the fundamental choice it has had since the war began almost two years ago: reestablish an open-ended occupation throughout Gaza (thereby providing Hamas with ample targets for an insurgency that will only intensify over time), or withdraw and watch Hamas crawl out of the rubble and declare ‚Äòdivine victory,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Ibish said.

AGISW was established in 2015 with Emirati and Saudi seed money.

The Israeli military said, barely 24 hours after Mr. Ibish made his prediction, that an improvised explosive device in Gaza City had wounded seven Israeli soldiers.

That didn‚Äôt stop Col. Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military‚Äôs Arabic language spokesman, [from accusing the ‚Äúbankrupt Muslim Brotherhood media‚Äù](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1961680819728142660) of publishing ‚Äúfalse news.‚Äù

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You‚Äî""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily‚Äôs reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn‚Äôt know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She‚Äôd loved him so much she‚Äôd given up her future, her dignity‚Äîeverything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn‚Äôt expected her to actually agree this time‚Äîto marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. ‚ÄúOne month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I‚Äôve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It‚Äôs what you owe the Ginger family, and I‚Äôm not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
‚ÄúThe Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I‚Äôll take your daughter‚Äôs place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.‚Äù  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but reopen the news article she‚Äôd just seen.  
  
It was everywhere‚Äîvideos of John and Elsa Quinn‚Äôs wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend‚Äîthe man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he‚Äôd been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She‚Äôd heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs‚Ä¶  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they‚Äôd been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa‚Äôs.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands‚ÄîElsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her‚ÄîElsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa‚Äôs neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it‚Ä¶ he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn‚Äôt call him. Didn‚Äôt beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess‚Äîjust like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you gone to bed?‚Äù  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, ‚ÄúJohn, let‚Äôs break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents‚Äô keepsake as soon as possible.‚Äù  
  
John immediately understood‚Äîshe must‚Äôve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn‚Äôt like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad. I didn‚Äôt forget your birthday. This is your gift.‚Äù  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece‚Äîa pink diamond the size of a pigeon‚Äôs egg‚Äîsparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn‚Äôt what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn‚Äôt live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this necklace! I just want my parents‚Äô keepsake!‚Äù  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, ‚ÄúThat pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!‚Äù  
  
Still throwing a tantrum...  
  
John‚Äôs patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
‚ÄúElsa really likes that pendant.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so sick‚Äîhow much longer do you think she‚Äôll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?‚Äù          
  
Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy  
  
Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant‚Ä¶  
  
But that pendant was hers‚Äîleft to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
She wasn‚Äôt that pathetic.  
  
Before she could even say a word, John‚Äôs phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. ‚ÄúJohn, I just threw up blood. I feel awful‚Ä¶ Can you come be with me?‚Äù  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
‚ÄúElsa, don‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn‚Äôt bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night‚Äîhe was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he‚Äôd once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she‚Äôd marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was‚Äîher wedding day would be on John‚Äôs birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. Poetic, really.  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She‚Äôd contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn‚Äôt transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she‚Äôd ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John‚Äôs shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
‚ÄúLily.‚Äù  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt‚Ä¶ emptier.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. ‚ÄúDid you drink, sir? I‚Äôll make you some ginger tea.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo need.‚Äù  
  
John wasn‚Äôt in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily‚Äôs room.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy‚Äîplush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers‚Ä¶  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lily?‚Äù  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, ‚ÄúMiss Lily said‚Ä¶ she broke up with you. And that she‚Äôs not coming back.‚Äù  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
So she was still throwing a tantrum?  
  
Running away from home?  
  
She really thought she had guts now, huh?  
  
‚ÄúMandy, leave.‚Äù  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn‚Äôt possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger‚Äîshe could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn‚Äôt take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
‚ÄúLily, how long are you going to keep this up?‚Äù  
  
John typed the message into the chat app‚Äîbut then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she‚Äôd just walk out for good.  
  
He didn‚Äôt need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She‚Äôd had no home since then.  
  
If she didn‚Äôt come back to him‚Äîwhere else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they‚Äôd argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn‚Äôt had a good night‚Äôs sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching‚Äîshe really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she‚Äôd built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream‚Äîto become a great voice actress.  
  
‚ÄúLily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can‚Äôt hold it anymore!‚Äù  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. ‚ÄúMr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO‚Äôs office for me?‚Äù  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn‚Äôt want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn‚Äôt want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO‚Äôs office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock‚Äîthen froze.  
  
She heard Elsa‚Äôs coy, flirty voice.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!‚Äù  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa‚Äôs body suddenly go limp‚Äîand fall into John‚Äôs lap.  
  
‚ÄúElsa‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she‚Äôd get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn‚Äôt move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?‚Äù  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his‚Äî  
  
And John didn‚Äôt move away.         
  
Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake  
  
""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John‚Äôs relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her‚Äîonly to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I‚Äôm sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily‚Äôs dull gaze dropped to Elsa‚Äôs shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn‚Äôt say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, ‚ÄúLily, meeting you is the happiest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I‚Äôll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.‚Äù  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend‚Äôs shoelace. She‚Äôd snuggled into John‚Äôs arms and teased, ‚ÄúWould you tie mine if it came undone?‚Äù  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that‚Äîtoo childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn‚Äôt.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense‚Äîit wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his ‚Äúcan‚Äôts,‚Äù were never about principle.  
  
He just didn‚Äôt love her.  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa‚Äôs laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John‚Äôs arms again, Lily didn‚Äôt linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn‚Äôt know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWayne, I‚Äôve already broken up with John.‚Äù  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn‚Äôt let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, ‚ÄúHe loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he‚Äôs tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want it. Wayne, I‚Äôve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.‚Äù  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn‚Äôt need John‚Äôs signature to quit‚Äîbut she did need his.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really sure about this? Does the boss know?‚Äù  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn‚Äôt want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood‚Äîleaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn‚Äôt just called her name. He‚Äôd insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he‚Äôd fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
‚ÄúMs. Lily, you‚Äôre giving this directly to the boss? I‚Äôll bring it to him. I‚Äôll talk to him first. If he agrees, I‚Äôll sign it.‚Äù  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn‚Äôt want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn‚Äôt approve it, she wouldn‚Äôt be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John‚Äôs office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John‚Äôs face was thunderous.  
  
‚ÄúBoss‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho made this coffee?‚Äù  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt signed Lily‚Äôs resignation yet‚Äîbut she‚Äôd already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before‚Äîso good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else‚Äôs brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, ‚ÄúBoss, it wasn‚Äôt Ms. Lily. She just‚Ä¶ she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?‚Äù  
  
Resign?  
  
John‚Äôs expression darkened even further.            
  
Chapter 4 They All Forced Lily to Apologize to Elsa  
  
As if realizing something, John let out a cold laugh.  
  
So that‚Äôs what this was‚ÄîLily was throwing a tantrum and threatening him with a resignation. Playing hard to get, was she?  
  
He knew better than anyone how much she wanted to be his personal assistant.  
  
She‚Äôd buttered him up for days just to land that role.  
  
If he really approved her resignation, she‚Äôd be the first to panic.  
  
She needed a lesson‚Äîto understand she had gone too far this time.  
  
‚ÄúSign it.‚Äù  
  
After letting out that icy aura, John added coldly, ‚ÄúAnd when you do, tell her‚Äîif she resigns, she better never come back.‚Äù  
  
Wayne shrank his neck.  
  
He wanted to say Lily seemed completely determined this time, like she never intended to come back at all.  
  
But the killing intent radiating from John was too terrifying, so he kept quiet.  
  
He just nodded and respectfully went to sign off on her resignation.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
Once Wayne signed, Lily quickly completed all her paperwork and left the company.  
  
Almost the moment she got back to the hotel, a message came in from John.  
  
‚ÄúCome to Flora Club.‚Äù  
  
Flora Club‚Äîthe place John always took his friends for drinks and parties.  
  
Lily had broken up with him. She had no intention of going.  
  
She was about to refuse when another message followed:  
  
‚ÄúIf you still want your parents‚Äô keepsake, be in front of me in half an hour.‚Äù  
  
Lily desperately wanted to get that pendant back. She didn‚Äôt dare delay and rushed to Flora Club.  
  
Inside the private room, Elsa and several of John‚Äôs close friends were already there.  
  
When Lily pushed open the door, she immediately saw John seated in the center of a deep red leather couch, Elsa curled up beside him.  
  
Elsa lifted her chin proudly, striking and radiant as ever.  
  
John sat protectively at her side, every movement full of tenderness and care.  
  
Lily felt a sharp sting behind her eyes.  
  
But she had come for a reason. She swallowed the bitterness and stepped inside.  
  
‚ÄúApologize to Elsa!‚Äù  
  
The moment John saw her, he slammed his glass down at her feet.  
  
‚ÄúHow dare you send thugs after Elsa to steal the pendant? If Simon hadn‚Äôt happened to pass by and save her, she would've been assaulted by those animals!‚Äù  
  
His friends all jumped in, shouting their indignation.  
  
‚ÄúHey, you, that was too much!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWe get that you‚Äôre jealous of Elsa, but this? You can‚Äôt just send people to attack her!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúApologize to Elsa now. Maybe if she lets it go, John will still forgive you!‚Äù  
  
Elsa‚Ä¶  
  
Lily stood frozen, face pale.  
  
She‚Äôd loved John so much. She had gone out of her way to be nice to his friends, always trying to fit in.  
  
But in all the years she was with John, not one of them ever called her by name. Their attitude had never even been respectful.  
  
She used to think they were just arrogant and blunt by nature.  
  
But hearing the way they now fawned over Elsa, she finally understood‚Äîthey had never lacked manners. They simply knew John didn‚Äôt truly care about her. She wasn‚Äôt worth respecting.  
  
But Elsa‚Äîdespite having betrayed John four years ago‚Äîwas cradled in the palm of his hand. So now, they all worshiped her too.  
  
‚ÄúLily, apologize to Elsa!‚Äù  
  
John‚Äôs cold voice snapped in her ear. Lily snapped out of her daze.  
  
She hadn‚Äôt done anything. Of course she wouldn‚Äôt admit to something she didn‚Äôt do.  
  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt send anyone to hurt Elsa. I‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThose thugs said you were behind it. Elsa wouldn‚Äôt lie!‚Äù  
  
John cut her off without letting her finish. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say it one more time. Apologize.‚Äù  
  
Elsa wouldn‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶  
  
Lily almost laughed out loud.  
  
So if Elsa said something, it was the truth? But when I spoke, it was all lies?  
  
Even if he loved Elsa more, after four years together, shouldn‚Äôt he know what kind of person I was?  
  
Shouldn‚Äôt he trust me, just a little?  
  
Was it really that easy for him to condemn her?  
  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. I won‚Äôt apologize to Elsa.‚Äù  
  
Lily hated being falsely accused. Even as the cold in her chest turned to ice, she still stood up for herself.  
  
‚ÄúIf someone‚Äôs word is all it takes to convict a person, then what if I say Elsa‚Äôs a murderer? Should we send her to jail? I didn‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm not admitting to it. Call the police if you want. If they find me guilty, fine‚Äîbut they‚Äôll need evidence. Elsa‚Äôs lies don‚Äôt count.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJohn‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Elsa‚Äôs voice trembled, her eyes red.  
  
A proud, dazzling rose now looked soft and wounded. It only made her more lovable.  
  
John‚Äôs patience with Lily had completely run out.  
  
He pulled out the pendant and held it up like a weapon.  
  
‚ÄúApologize to Elsa, or you‚Äôll never see this again.‚Äù  
  
Lily‚Äôs gaze dropped to the pendant.  
  
It had been handmade by her parents, after studying with a master craftsman.  
  
Delicate gold filigree, encircling a fine piece of Hetian jade‚Äîone of a kind.  
  
Just seeing it brought back memories.  
  
Four years ago, when John was cast out by the Jones family after the accident, his father‚Äôs illegitimate son had tried to kill him.  
  
That snowy night, Lily had shielded him with her own body, taking two stab wounds before the police arrived.  
  
That night, her pendant had been stolen by those hired thugs.  
  
She‚Äôd lost it while saving his life.  
  
Even if he didn‚Äôt love her.  
  
Even if his heart belonged to Elsa.  
  
Once he recovered it, he should‚Äôve returned it to her.  
  
Not used it as leverage to hurt her.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, don‚Äôt be so hard on Lily.‚Äù  
  
Elsa cast Lily a smug glance, then pretended to smooth things over. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the past.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhy not have Lily drink a glass of wine? Let‚Äôs just call it even and move on.‚Äù  
  
Hearing this, John frowned slightly.  
  
But unable to say no to the sickly Elsa, he gave a cold nod.  
  
Lily kept telling herself‚Äîthis man wasn‚Äôt worth her tears.  
  
But when she saw him nod, her eyes still turned red.  
  
He knew she couldn‚Äôt drink.  
  
Her stomach's not great; she once had bleeding from drinking too much. The doctor had warned her never to drink again.  
  
John had held her, eyes full of guilt, promising to get stronger, to protect her, to never let her suffer again.  
  
But now, for Elsa, he made her suffer over and over.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink.‚Äù  
  
She didn‚Äôt explain.  
  
Explaining to someone who didn‚Äôt believe her was pointless.  
  
All she wanted was to get the pendant back and leave.  
  
She looked at the rows of hard liquor on the table and gave a bitter smile.  
  
‚ÄúIf I drink all of these, will you give it back?‚Äù  
  
John‚Äôs eyes darkened like a gathering storm.  
  
For some reason, Lily‚Äôs smile stabbed at him.  
  
She seemed so far away now.  
  
But he still believed‚ÄîLily could never truly leave him.  
  
Elsa was dying. Even if Lily had just sent thugs to get the pendant and not to hurt Elsa, the scare alone was enough. He wouldn‚Äôt let Elsa suffer in her final days.  
  
His voice turned cold. ‚ÄúDrink.‚Äù  
  
Lily exhaled slowly.  
  
So he meant it. Drink it all, and he‚Äôd return the pendant.  
  
They were all hard liquors.  
  
Her eyelids twitched.  
  
But she didn‚Äôt back down.  
  
She grabbed a bottle and began to chug.  
  
It burned all the way down.  
  
Like fire searing her mouth, her throat, her heart.  
  
So this was what it felt like‚Äîto love the wrong person.  
  
Like being skinned alive, crushed to ash.  
  
So she had to stop loving John. She had to move on.  
  
‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù  
  
Seeing her flushed face, her swaying body, the way she reached for another bottle, John couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore.  
  
He snatched the bottle from her and smashed it on the floor.  
  
‚ÄúTake your pendant and get out!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJohn‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Elsa hated anyone taking what she wanted.  
  
Lily had taken John while she was abroad‚Äîshe wouldn‚Äôt let her get away with it again.  
  
She knew that pendant was too important to Lily. She couldn‚Äôt let her have it.  
  
As John reached to hand it over, Elsa grabbed it first and threw herself into his arms.  
  
‚ÄúMy stomach‚Ä¶ it hurts so much‚Ä¶ John, am I dying? It hurts‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
As she sobbed, she even spat out a bit of blood.  
  
‚ÄúElsa!‚Äù  
  
Panicked, John scooped her into his arms and rushed out of the room.  
  
‚ÄúHold on, Elsa. I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJohn‚Äî!‚Äù  
  
Lily staggered forward, desperate to get the pendant.  
  
But just as she reached him, Elsa lifted her leg‚Äîand her foot slammed right into Lily‚Äôs face.  
  
Lily was already unsteady. The kick sent her crashing to the ground.  
  
As luck would have it, she struck her temple against the sharp edge of the table.  
  
Blood immediately gushed down her face, blurring her vision.  
  
‚ÄúLily!‚Äù  
  
Hearing the thud, John turned in panic.  
  
When he saw her bleeding, her pale face stained with red, his dark eyes filled with alarm.  
  
‚ÄúIt hurts‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Elsa‚Äôs pained whimper brought him back to reality.  
  
Without another glance at Lily, he turned and ran.  
  
Lily was injured.  
  
But it was just a cut. She was strong. She could take care of herself.  
  
Elsa, on the other hand, was dying. She needed him.

I couldn‚Äôt figure out which grinder to get, so I figured I‚Äôd ask the coffee experts themselves.  
I‚Äôve been using a Kingrinder K6 hand grinder for a while and I like it, but I‚Äôm officially done with hand grinding and want to move to an electric grinder. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to three options:

* Baratza Encore ESP (\~‚Ç¨170) Bad things I‚Äôve heard: some people say it doesn‚Äôt grind fine enough for certain coffees, and others mentioned you need to mod it before it‚Äôs usable for espresso.
* Fellow Opus (\~‚Ç¨185 Cons: I‚Äôve read about retention issues and that dialing it in can be a bit tricky. I don‚Äôt mind a learning curve though, so that part doesn‚Äôt bother me much.
* DF54 (\~‚Ç¨310) This is the one people keep recommending, but it‚Äôs a bit over budget for me. It‚Äôs ‚Ç¨130 more than the ESP and ‚Ç¨100 more than the Opus, which is a pretty big difference for me.

So my question is: which one should I get, and why?  
Is the DF54 really worth the big stretching the budget for, or is the ESP/Opus good enough if I‚Äôm not chasing absolute perfection? or maybe you have another grinder that I should get?

Thanks in advance for your help, coffee snobs

I realized that she, and maybe my sister, are the only people who I would let touch my hair (I've gone to a couple of hairdressers who turned 1 inch off into 5, so that turned me off of salons completely). My sister has never actually cut my hair though, and she's the type to spend most of her free time in ""boyfriend land,"" so it's really just my mom. 

It's dumb, but I couldn't stop thinking about who's supposed to cut my hair when my mom can't. I am asexual and aromantic, so I can't count on having a partner around to do it for me. That would be cool and all, but my dating/QPR pool is kind of non-existent since I'd have to find someone who is okay with the fact that I will never be sexually or romantically attracted to them. There's a pretty good chance that I'll end up in an apartment by myself. I guess I'll just have to get better at cutting my own hair. 

Anyway, if I can't find someone I trust with my hair, what am I supposed to do if I have some kind of major surgery? Who the fuck is going to be my emergency contact? My sister, maybe? She isn't the most reliable person though. Love her, but she isn't great at picking up the phone. My best friend actually offered to be my emergency contact when I was talking about something like this once, but I have no clue if that'll be an option in a decade or two. Obviously, I'll try to make sure it is, but a lot of shit can happen in that time. I did make him my fourth emergency contact after my parents and my sister for now though. 

I know the answer is obviously to make friends, but I'm kind of bad at that. I'm in my last year of college right now, and I've made exactly one friend who I see outside of class. To be fair, I'm a commuter and I transferred as junior so I've only had a year to make friends, but it's still lame. My two other friends are both in relationships and live in different cities, so it's pretty much impossible to schedule anything with them. I literally had to plan a hangout six months in advance once. 

I've tried my best to make friends. I went to a yarn circle where everyone was at least four decades older than me (stitching with the local grandmas was still fun though, went for like four months before my class schedule changed), a book club with people my age run by a girl who didn't ""get"" asexuality, another fiber arts group that was just moms for some reason? I don't know what I was expecting, but it was at a dive bar, so I was just hoping for someone my age to be there. I've also volunteered at a couple of pride events and gotten some people's socials that led to two coffee hangouts, but the first girl ghosted me after meeting up once, and the second girl thought I was hitting on her despite the fact that I wore the ace flag to the event we both went to and ...also ghosted me after one meetup. I got to play DND a couple times with another girl I met at an event, but then she got a girlfriend and dropped off the face of the Earth. Same thing with a speed-friending event I did at my college, except girly got a boyfriend instead. 

I did make friends with one person who actually texted me first. It was so exciting since usually I'm the one who has to break the ice and find a time/place to meet up, but then she tried to sell me makeup. She also tried to get me to sell makeup. Luckily, I know what MLMs are, so I just told her that what she's doing is really harmful. On the bright side, I got to be the one who ghosts someone else for once! I took a break from my friend-making schemes for a bit after that one. 

Even if I do make friends (I pinky promise this is the last ""if""), there's still the whole ""everyone but me having a partner"" issue. Most people just don't prioritize friendship. I might never have anyone who's truly willing and able to drop everything if something happens to me. I know it's dumb to be speculating so far into the future, but I'm scared that one day I'll pick up my phone and have no one to call. There isn't really a road map for people like me. Asexuality as a label hasn't even existed for that long, so I really don't have a ton to draw on here. 

TLDR: I am aroace and I'm kind of freaking out over who's supposed to cut my hair when I'm older. ",2,1756714956.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

A man in his late 20s offered me some help for my problem which I posted and bhai then he asked me to meet him for coffee???? Insta pe bhi everyday there are atleast 4-5 requests. Itna bhi kya desperate hona h bhai and if you are atleast baat to dhang se krlo . Na baat karne ki tameez hai creepy hone lg jayenge phir ego bhi inhi ki hurt ho jati h 

Ab few will say tum hi attention dete ho aur complaint bhi krte ki creep hain. Bhai post daaldi to maine kaha se maang liya attention? Ya phir being a humble person if I treat a guy like human to vo attention dena ho gya? ",1,1756714948.0,TeenIndia,22,0.57,False
1n5j4wn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5j4wn,New Coffee Day!,"No real story here, just sharing my joy. 

About once a month I take 5 bags out of the freezer, dose them into tubes and refreeze them again. It‚Äôs always an exciting day, that heralds new coffees to be experimented with and enjoyed. 

This month coffee roasted by Placid FR, Manhattan NL and DAK NL, from Colombia, El Salvador, Rwanda and Ethiopia. 

Among other things is pictured my new DF83v2. It has rare Mazzer K151G brew burrs installed. The Cafec Deep 27 is ideal for brewing small batches, so I can split the frozen 20g dose in two (‚Ç¨ in the picture refers to ‚Ç¨/20g, as to remind myself I‚Äôm not drinking for free at home). Comparing the DF83v2+K151G and the Philos+I200D, so far I prefer the latter for its more enjoyable acidity. ",6,1756714941.0,pourover,0,0.88,False

I‚Äôve got the day off work and instead of being ‚Äúproductive,‚Äù I‚Äôm fully embracing the option of doing absolutely nothing. Sofa is occupied. Motivation is missing. Snacks are very much being considered. Coffee is a constant. 

I‚Äôm married with kids, generally content with life, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a few more friends to chat with. Ideally someone I click with for regular back-and-forth texts about whatever‚Ä¶ random thoughts, silly memes, what we‚Äôre watching/reading, or just life stuff.

A bit about me: Movies, I‚Äôll watch pretty much anything, from epic actually good films, to nonsense murder mystery things that can be watched while playing with my phone. The same goes for TV shows. I love a good binge, but I drop bad ones with zero guilt (too many shows, too little time).

I‚Äôm a big reader. Am big into fantasy and crime. Always on the lookout for recommendations, even though my ‚Äúto be read‚Äù stack is threatening to crush me.

If you‚Äôre 28+ and also fancy a new texting buddy, come say hi. I promise to respond‚Ä¶ unless I accidentally nap, which might be a risk today! ",1,1756714859.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False
