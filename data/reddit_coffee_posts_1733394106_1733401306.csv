1h77tsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1h77tsj/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1733400909.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
1h77sa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coqinu/comments/1h77sa2/the_future_the_flippening/,"The Future, The Flippening","It was Monday 1st of March, 2025. My giant golden rooster alarm went off at 5am. I laughed. Old habits. 

Just a few months ago, 5am meant I had to go to my 12-hour shift as a professional shit-eater at my wife's boyfriend Jamal's manure testing facility. But ever since the flippening, my days have been quiet. Peaceful, even. I watched the sun come up while I had coffee. My 14 wives jerked me off while I read the news. Elon Musk came round and begged me to punch him in the face again, just so he could feel my skin against his. I did a runny poo and forced Jamal to wipe my gooch with $100 bills that he wasn't allowed to keep afterwards. I drove all 18 of my Lamborghinis to the beach and ran over some folk I didn't like the look of. It was bliss. 

In the news that day, the people of El Salvador had revolted. It was a bloodbath. Nayib Bukele had been publicly bukkaked due to his foolish investments in Bitcoin, which was now third on the list of cryptocurrencies by market cap. Some hard-working El Salvadorian coq enthusiasts had fought and jerked their way past limp army barracks and into the National Palace to reinvigorate the country's flaccid economy with their heaving coqbags. Avax was also involved somehow.

Gary Gensler, former head of the SEC and now Supreme Leader of the Taliban, had released another hostage video on his OnlyFans. This time he demanded 5 whole coq coins for the lives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, whom the Taliban had recently captured. A total of 10 coq coins were eventually paid by the US government: 5 for Meghan and the other 5 to keep Harry. The world once again admired the US for their negotiation with terrorists. Harry was consensually bukkaked live on Al Jazeera shortly after.

Vitalik Buterin had finally been locked up for massive fraud, ironically in the same minimum-security cell as Do Kwan, SBF and Donald Trump Jr. The article rumoured that the 4 of them were issuing a new stablecoin. Avax was not involved at all. 

A moose was hit by a car in Canada. The government formally apologised to the moose's family. The driver was given $40 and sent to rehab in the Bahamas. 

In the lifestyle section there was a follow up article on that guy from Tiger King and Zendaya, who had recently been exposed as the creators of Bitcoin, AKA Satoshi Nakamoto. Turns out they had a great interior decorator. It also turned out that 'Satoshi Nakamoto' was a spelling error - they had originally tried to write 'GrossBalls69'. The whole thing was meant to be a rug pull but they lost the seed phrase. Then some nerds took it over. No one cared anymore because Bitcoin only had a market cap of $66k, and $COQINU was well over 500 trillion. All other cryptos (except for Avax) had crashed and disappeared. 

I looked out at the beach from my cars. It's amazing how life can change so quickly. 

Then my phone rang. It was Elon Gensler. CUCK! No wait, it was my rooster alarm! I wasn't at the beach, I was naked at Jamal's house! CUCKDOODLE! No. NO! NOOOOOO -

1. For all those who want a milkshake ride....Is it possible to build a drop tower ride where the building for the queue looks like a milkshake and the ride is the ""straw"" for it? 

2. A name for the water park could be Tim Apple Tides.  Instead of burgers everything gets apple themed.

3. For all those who are asking for fries....Theme the queue for a ride like a french fry forest maze.

4. There can be a land called Extras Extravaganza.  There can be the Caffeine Crashers bumper cars which could be coffee themed. The milkshake ride mentioned before. The carousel of desserts (How many free desserts were handed out for better reviews?) It could be a place for all those things that don't fit the other areas.  The mascots for the area could be Ratuu and Ratrina.

5. For the water park the boys might want to look at some places like Indiana Beach where it is located on a river with a lot of trees since their park is also not an oceanfront area, but inland waters.",1,1733400686.0,JamesTurnerYT,0,1.0,False

The sound of Dexterous’ knocking reverberated through the room. The sudden noise made Summit’s talons slip, which caused several of his book’s pages to tear in the grasp of his sharp claws.

Summit’s pupils dilated and stared at the front door in fear.

*Why did I have to invite him?* Summit asked himself. *Why could I have just not enjoyed the last days of my childhood?* Summit pondered.

As Summit thought, Dexterous knocked again. “Are you there? You told me to be here today,”

the muffled voice of Dexterous said.

*Why did I not think of that? I knew this was going to happen. This is all my fault. I should of thought of a plan. Well, I can think of one now I guess. But what to do? If I let him in, I could be doomed, but if I don’t let him in, I lose my only friend. Me, or Dexterous?* This dilemma stunned Summit while he pondered his few options at the moment. He tried to look around the room he was in for an escape, but it was no use. He had two options nonetheless that would work in the future. But there was one that would work for a bit: stall.

“Can I have a second?” Summit asked.

“I’ve got all day,” Dexterous responded.

With a few more minutes granted to him, he started to search for a solution, but he found nothing at all. All he could do was say yes or no. Yes or no. Yes, or no...

Summit took an incredibly deep and profound breath as he prepared for the worst-case scenario.

 

 

Dexterous was waiting patiently for his friend. *What’s taking him so long? It’s not the morning anymore, he should have gotten up a long time ago.* He thought.

From the other side of the door, all he could hear was some light pacing, and then a deep breath from Summit. Summit had begun to speak through the door again. “Okay, I’m, all ready now. Can you come into my place first?”

“Sure, I guess. But why? ”

“ I’m a little nervous right now, I’ll explain it in a bit. ”

After a second or two, the door opened, to show... nobody. Summit must have opened the door so that he could not be seen.

Dexterous walked in slowly through the door. He looked around the room, there was nobody that he could see. After he walked through the door, it was closed behind him. Dexterous looked around. And the only thing that he saw: a dragon, staring right at him. Dexterous ran and screamed away from the monster that preceded him, narrowly escaping his surely imminent demise. After a few seconds of running, he was right against a wall, right as he was violently pulled back into the grasp of the dragon.

 

 

*Well, I mean I could have been dead by now, so this is fine,* Summit thought after pulling back his friend. Because of Summit’s relatively small stature, he was not able to hold his friend. So instead, he just gave Dexterous a very strong hug. After a few seconds of Dexterous realizing what was going on, Dexterous slowly stopped making noises of fear, Summit decided to let go of his friend and let Dexterous slowly get his bearings. “Please, don’t scream again, I won’t eat you, I promise. I just don’t want them to know,” Summit gestured towards the front door.

Dexterous brought his gloved hands towards Summit as a little bit of safety as he nervously looked around in search of a way out “What’s going on? Why can you talk? Dragons don’t talk. W here’s Summit? ”

“I’m right here. I’m Summit,” Summit said. *It’s over, I’m going to lose him, and he’s going to be the death of me...*

“ No, that’s not how the world works...you must have eaten him already! ” Dexterous said.

“And I said the same thing. It’s me, you have to believe me, please.”

“Then why are you trying to scare me, you beast?” Dexterous gestured to the menacing look of Summit’s face with an open hand.

“I’m not trying. I’m just stuck like this, okay?” Summit extended his head forward and gestured towards it with his hands. “I don’t want to lose you, you’re my only friend.”

Dexterous was breathing heavily, “No, you are a monster!” He spent a few more seconds breathing heavily while he looked around. “I don’t trust you, you’re keeping me in here, you must be planning something!”

“Fine, then leave if you want, just don’t tell the Lord. I want to live.” Summit pleaded to his friend.

Dexterous looked at him, seeing him like that. He hesitated a little. There was no way that this Summit could be lying to him, right? “...Is it really you Summit?”

“Yes! That’s what I just told you!”

“Fine... I’ll listen then, I trust you, somewhat. Just, what’s going on?” Dexterous continued to look around the room as he slowly backed away from Summit.

“I don’t know,” Summit said. “When I got up today, I was just like, this... My parents freaked out, I freaked out. It was a whole situation. I don’t want to talk about it...”

“Okay,” Dexterous walked towards a chair to sit in, but while he was walking over, his foot was caught in a small dent in the floor. The small hole caused him to fall over. Luckily, he managed to use his hands to catch himself, but as he fell a small gold coin fell from his pocket. The scratched token rolled around to an empty part of the floor. The coin immediately caught the attention of Summit, as his pupils shrunk and he started running clumsily to collect it, which he was able to do since Dexterous was too distracted with getting back up to notice.

The ruckus of sound made by the clicking of Summit's speedy, clumsy talons made Dexterous see what was going on. Dexterous saw that Summit was holding the gold coin right in front of his face, admiring the shimmer it possessed with wide eyes. “What are you doing?” Dexterous said with confusion and disgust. “I’ve never seen you do things like that. Is this like, a dragon thing?”

Summit pivoted his head towards his friend with surprise. “Ah!” Summit quickly let go of the gilded object and jerked back, before recollecting the coin. “I don’t know why, but I want it. I guess it is a dragon thing.”

“But can I have it back? It’s mine, and I want it. It’s so shiny...”

“I guess it’s contagious then? Maybe you’ve got a bit of dragon in you too.”

“Hey! I’m no dragon,” Dexterous objected. “So can I have it back?”

“...fine” Summit said as he offered the coin to Dexterous. Quickly, he grabbed and pulled it out of Summit’s talons. Because of the sharpness of Summit’s talons, the coin now had two little scratches in the soft gold, but it was still beautiful and shiny.

“Hey, you scratched my coin!”

“Well, you did steal it from my... talons? I guess that’s what I have now...” Summit said with a frown, staring down at his mock hands.

“That sounds like the right term to use for a dragon.”

*Yes, the right term for a monster, a menace, a killer, a hoarder...* Summit thought.

“So, I guess you can’t do your apprenticeship now, that must suck,” Dexterous said.

“I’d be lucky to be able to go outside without being executed on the spot. Everyone hates dragons, especially me.”

“I guess that’s how it will be with you, that sucks,” Dexterous said.

“Yeah...” Summit said.

 

 

Dexterous looked around the room. He looked at the kitchen, he looked at the various chairs, he looked at the dining table that a family enjoyed, but the one thing that he would not look at was Summit. While Dexterous looked around the room, he also took a few steps toward the door.

For the first time, Dexterous looked at Summit fully. He could see the unnatural light blue scales that covered his strange body, his horns that curled behind his head like they were pretending to be hair, and were those gills on the side of his chest? *Why is he keeping me here, I want to go, I want to escape, I want out. I don’t care if he used to be my friend. I don’t need a friend. I need to survive,* Dexterous thought while he stared at the door.

“I guess that there isn’t very much to do here, do you mind if I get going? I think my parents want to spend some time with me.” Dexterous explained.

“I guess it is pretty boring around here. I guess I’ll see you sometime soon. It gets pretty lonely in here, and I haven’t been here for even a day!” Summit asked.

“Okay, goodbye,” Dexterous said. Only a second later, Dexterous had disappeared into the city once more.

 

 

After a swift thump from the door, Summit was alone again. His muscles calmed due to the advent of solitude, and he no longer had to worry about scaring someone to death or scaring them so much that they decided to cause his death.

After looking around for about one minute, Summit decided to get back to the book he was reading an hour ago. Summit collected the novel and examined the many damages it had accumulated from its accidental beating. Its hard cover seemed rather untouched, just a light scratch in the degraded green fabric. But when he examined the book’s pages, many of them had been heavily ripped, shredded, and scratched from his fumbles and follies. A dozen or more of the pages had had many words rendered unreadable, and even a few whole pages were made incomprehensible. Perhaps he could find a copy from the library and copy down the lost pages to fix it. Maybe it could be an adventure for another day.

*I feel bad for any dragons that would ever try to read if they even do. Do dragons read? I guess I will never know.* Summit thought

Luckily, the pages ahead were still perfectly fine to read, so he did. He quickly ran page by page, chapter by chapter, through the book. Sadly, only a few chapters before the end of his book, his parents had returned with the materials for dinner. It seemed to be some bread buns, and a whole chicken, ready to be cooked.

“Why did you get a chicken? We never do. It’s too expensive, right?” Summit asked.

“Well, because you’ve been having a hard day, we thought that we could make you something nice,” Acorn explained.

“Yeah, it has...” Summit closed his eyes partway. “I needed this a lot. I’ll be in my room in case you need my help with anything. Let me know when dinner’s ready,” Summit picked up his book and scurried into his room.

Summit decided to continue where he left off, reading his book until the very end. In Summit’s opinion, the ending was most likely the worst part of the book. It did not feel very satisfying in his opinion, but he read it anyway because it was better than no ending. After reading the book, he pushed the green covers back together and placed them on the side of his desk. Unlike much furniture, it was made of wood. Oakley had made it himself, it was the first time he had gone through the whole process of making furniture. From cutting to staining. And it was rather nice, being a pleasing coffee brown with some nice edge smooth edges that were soft to the touch.

Summit pushed his chair out of the way as it now served no purpose to him; he could never fit in one of those again. Summit looked around his desk until he found a small leather-bound book, a reservoir of ink, and an iron dip pen. Summit pushed away all the clutter on his desk and arranged his writing equipment to be used for the first time in about a week.

The book that Summit held was a journal of sorts where he would write down anything important to him. Whether they were lists of items, important events coming up, ideas for things to do, or important moments that happened in that day that he wanted to be preserved. Quickly flipping to the first open page he could find, Summit began to write.

 

*Felsite 17, 5012*

 

*Today has been rough. After all, I only write in here when something is worth remembering first hand. Today I have woken up to find that I’ve become a disgusting dragon. This has been terrible. I can’t go outside, I will never be able to become an apprentice, and it feels that everyone is scared of me or does not want to see me. Well, my parents seem to be trying, but I am still uncertain if they are being truthful or not. I’m scared. I might be alone in a cave for the rest of my life, with no one but my parents to talk to until I die as I slowly get bigger and it becomes harder for me to move around this already cramped home. Or maybe Dex has already told others and someone is coming to have me killed as I write here. I guess I won’t know until later, but right now I kind of hope that an executioner* is *on his way. It’s pretty lonely in here anyway, what’s the point of me being in prison for life when I will not live a good life either way?* *Or maybe, just maybe, I could try to get out. No, that would never work. I would never see my parents again. I would just die that way too. Or I could be free. But it seems more likely that a night guard would kill me. Hopefully, my parents are here to help me, and Dex cares somehow.*

*Hoping that I never have to write in here again,*

*Summit.*

 

Summit waited just a few seconds for the bold ink to dry onto the papyrus. Summit closed his book. “Dinner’s ready!” Acorn called after she opened the door to his room.

Summit stepped away from his desk in a clunky manner and walked over to the main room to eat with his family. As he arrived at the dining table, Summit pushed his chair to the left and sat on the ground where the chair stood so he was right in front of his plate. On his plate, there was a piece of chicken, along with two buns served warm. Even though there was more on his plate than usual, it was exactly what needed because of how hungry he was. But right before Summit started to eat his tempting meal, he was interrupted by his meal.

“How was your day while we were gone?” Oakley asked.

“It wasn’t good, but Dex came by to visit. That went fine I guess,” Summit said.

“Three moons! How did he get here? What happened? Will you be safe?” Acorn said.

“Okay, I’ll explain it then Mom,” Summit said. “The reason he came over is because we agreed on it yesterday. Like I said, it was fine, he freaked out a lot, but after that, we had an alright conversation. He didn’t stay long; there’s not much to do here, but he promised that he would not tell anyone, ever. I’ll be fine.” Summit explained.

Summit stared down at the delicious meal that sat before him. “Can I eat now Mom? I’m really hungry. I haven’t eaten since breakfast,” Summit said as he started to eat.

“You didn’t get any lunch?” Acorn asked.

“I thought that’s why you made me such a big plate of food,” Summit said.

“I made it that big because you’re growing, a lot. And I think that a dragon needs more food anyways,” Acorn explained.

*Right, that is what I am. I love being reminded of that. I love being reminded that my parents are nothing like me now,* Summit thought.

“Yeah, well thanks for getting me all this, it looks great!” Summit said. Summit stopped talking to his parents and they stopped talking to them as he ate his food. All he needed in that moment was something to eat. It was delicious. His parents had years of experience making food for themselves and him after all. It only took a few minutes, but his plate was entirely clean of food. Despite that, Summit still wanted more food.

*I guess Acorn was right,* Summit thought.

“ Is it okay if I have some more food? I’m still hungry, ” Summit said.

“Of course, just don’t take too much, I want to save some for myself,” Oakley said to his scaly son.

“ Okay, ” Summit said as he collected some more food. But as he went to grab some chicken, his father slapped his talon to stop him.

“Don’t use your talon! You use that to walk, it’s dirty. I can get it for you, just don’t make my food dirty,” Oakley interjected.

“Okay, Dad,” Summit responded as his father put more food on Summit’s plate. After his plate was refilled, Summit ate all of his food. And after that, he was finally full. It was a good feeling to have again, to say the least.

*Why am I tired?* Summit Thought *It can’t be that late right now, right? Well, I guess I’ll go to bed anyway,* Summit thought.

“Hey, I’m feeling tired, can I go to bed?” Summit asked his parents.

“You’re tired already? It’s not that late! Can’t you stay up a little longer?” Oakley said.

“That’s what I was thinking, but I do still want to go to bed Dad,” Summit said.

“Okay, then. Goodnight!” Oakley said,

Summit got up from the dinner table and began to walk towards his room. As he did that, a flurry of that day’s memories rushed over Summit. He woke up, realizing what he had become, being in fear, the people around being scared of him, and all the other terrible things that happened that day. All at once. It was very overwhelming to him. But luckily those thoughts faded away as fast as they came to him by the time he was in his bedroom.

Summit walked over from the entrance of his room to his bed and looked at it. How was he supposed to sleep? In the moment, he decided to do it as he always did: lie down with his legs and arms parallel to his body. It felt very uncomfortable, so he decided to instead go into a fetal position so his wings, tail, and head had more space to breathe and get comfortable and lie on the ground. After a minute, Summit’s eyes closed, and he was asleep.",1,1733399072.0,WingsOfFire,0,1.0,False

To make a long story as short as possible, I was pretty smitten with her. We met at a coffee shop before she came to my house and just the way she carried herself and came off as so genuine was extremely attractive. She was super sweet and we had a great time together. We went at it quite a few times that night and watched multiple movies and ordered food in between our fun time. She even spent the night and told me I made her feel very comfortable and safe. We were together for over 24 hours which is not at all what I had originally expected. 

She gave me her number and Facebook before she left the next day and for a few months we hadn't talked at all but that changed when I couldn't resist texting her because I enjoyed her company so much and was genuinely one of the kindest women I've ever met. I kinda spilled my feelings to her and while she was open and acknowledging of my feelings she said she just has too much going on for any sort of relationship. She was moving across the country and working on her bachelor's degree so very understandable. She had also just got out of  4 year relationship and I was the only other man she had been with sexually and was wanting to explore a poly lifestyle.

The last message she sent to me was ""I think you're a really cool person and I really enjoy the casual connection. Thanks again for making me feel safe and comfortable"" that message was almost 2 years ago.

Fast forward to this Thanksgiving when I sent her a message that just said ""Hi (name) I just wanted to say happy Thanksgiving and I hope you're doing well ""

Today I had noticed the message still only says ""sent"" and I couldn't see any new posts on her timeline. I ended up finding out that she restricted me and honestly that hurt a bit.

I definitely came on too strong and really kick myself for it. I wish I had just let things be after we met and looked forward to casual connections only in the future. I almost wish she just blocked me instead and am not really sure why she only restricted me.

This is a life lesson though for sure and I have learned from it. Coming on so strong was not a good idea and it definitely turned her off. This has taught me to not be so eager in the future and just let good things stay as they are. 

It still sucks though. I've never had such a good time with someone in a 24 hour period than I have with her.

When I was in middle school some WWII veterans came to speak about their experiences as italian soldiers jailed in german prison camps after the 8th of semptember 1943.

One thing stucked vividly in my mind and that was when one of them said that they were given bread with “margarina minerale” which sounds as a nasty surrogate of margarine. The only mention of that mineral margarine I have found is this:

“the meal consisted of--""unsweetened lukewarm black ersatz coffee and a slice of bread that varied in size from a half inch to an inch in thickness."" The Germans also gave the POWs ""a small pat"" of what seemed to Howard to be ""mineral margarine.""*

Mineral evoked in my mind the term mineral oil. Is there a connection? It still bugs me after 30 years and I hope that an historian can give me a clue as to what the veteran intended.

Went up to see what it was and saw smoke coming from the back of the computer.  I unplugged the power supply and checked for any melting on the outside, didn't see anything externally.  The computer was off but plugged in.  Removed the panel and inspected the internals but couldn't see any obvious damage but had the burn smell.  Luckily I am still in the warranty period and called tech support and they first wanted to send a box to ship it back.  Then I told them I live in Chile for retirement that I purchased in the states while my ship was in Tampa.  That complicated things a bit.  End result is they are sending a tech to the house to either repair or take it in for a replacement.  Overall it was a decent experience with support and they worked out a solution to my satisfaction.  ",1,1733397921.0,Alienware,0,1.0,False

I'm 23 years old from the US but have lived in Spain for the past two years (I grew up speaking Spanish at home and hold EU citizenship). I'm interested in studying the Bachelor of Commerce in Accountancy AND Banking, Finance and Investments at the University of Malta.

I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Law at the University Carlos III in Madrid. I am interested in switching to studying Finance and Accounting.

He talks about putting a 5 mile 'deck' 20 meters above the ring road and having landscaping, retail, coffee shops, cycling and having it drop down into the places people want to go like Mayfield, castlefield, Ancoats etc

It's only an idea and would need funding but could be done little by little as funding comes available.

This would provide 90 acres of green space in the centre. Alexander Park is 60 acres for comparison.

Would be great for exercise/tourism? Imagine a Park Run around there, Manchester Marathon/10k etc could incorporate it, Xmas light trail like Dunham Massey do, the views would be great too.

Ever since my first breakup, I've been into flings - not that i wanted to get into them but straight after my breakup happened i met this girl who was in my group and we were making a short film - just in couple of days we were making out with each other - did i started liking her? Yes i did! Why did i left her? She was involved with too many guys.

This didn't ended here - every other girl that i met, i made out with instantly - and she was just there for the fun - all this time i kept looking for someone who will try to know the real me and talk to me like a sane human being or a friend who knows you inside out but all i found were women ready to just sleep or have fun - it never went to a relationship state.

But in all these weird 4-5 years, i did met women who i couldn't take out for even a coffee and these were the girls that looked to me like the one who isn't involved into all this shitty fling culture and would be interested to make a healthy relationship work. Yet either they looked at me as a fuckboi or weren't interested for what reason I don't know.

So my question is why do i keep getting the same kind of women who are just looking for some fun night out? What am i doing wrong? Am i approaching to many of them? Should i just stop approaching women? Should i wear a shirt saying not a fuckboi? 

I just want to find someone who is going to understand me and my fucked up life, who i can share my problems with, who i can listen and make her happy and feel good about it, but it feels more like a fiction than reality.

I just want to get involved with someone emotionally rather physically only - i want to see her smile, talk about her problems, go out and do all the stupid and silly stuff that i haven't done.

1h76zkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/seniorkitties/comments/1h76zkv/i_changed_my_sleep_schedule_and_now_i_am_worried/,I changed my sleep schedule and now I am worried my 18 year old isn’t getting enough quality sleep ,"For various quality of life reasons, my sleep schedule has changed so that I go to bed around 7pm to 10pm and wake up between 2am and 5am. This is working out fantastically for me. 

However, my sweet 18 year old sleeps in bed with me every night and gets up when I get up. She typically comes to bed around 10pm or 11pm, and is always there when I briefly wake up around midnight. It used to be that I was sleeping until 6 or 7am, and she stays the entire time with me, so she was getting a solid 7-9 hours. 

I’ve noticed that if I lay in bed for a while she will stay after I wake up, even if I am petting her or something or talking to her. But as soon as I get up to make a coffee and start my day she gets up too. 

Basically I’m worried that because my average wake up out of bed time now is between 3am and 4am, and she gets up with me, she isn’t getting enough quality sleep! 

She does rest a lot during the day, maybe more than she was prior to my schedule change. She still seems to sleep deeply during the day, snoring and twitching like she is dreaming. But my apartment complex is super loud during the day and that startles her sometimes and wakes her up from a slumber at least three or four times a day. 

So that is my worry. I guess my question is… is my new sleep schedule affecting her quality of sleep? Should I be staying in bed longer with her to make sure she gets her rest? Or what can I do to convince her to keep sleeping once I get up? Is this a super dumb thing to worry about? I don’t know much of the science behind cat sleep schedules at all so I am probably applying human logic to it. ",2,1733397819.0,seniorkitties,0,1.0,False
1h76zkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1h76zkd/the_coffee_table_why_life_is_a_horror_movie/,The Coffee Table - why life is a horror movie,"One of the things I find the most frightening about life is how easy it is to fuck it up in a way you can't go back from. Not only can one bad decision lead you into a nightmare, it can be just one bad moment, where you don't even make any big conscious choice. One small accident. The line between your normal, comfortable, safe and familiar life and a horror movie can be an event that happens in a second or two, and then the former is closed to you forever.

There's a sense of extreme injustice about this, but who can you complain to?

This movie captures this feeling perfectly. I read some comments that this is a horror movie parents would feel the most, but I think everyone can understand it, as least I did. This situation can be something else, but the point of it is, its the moment after which life of the subject is destroyed.

While I don't really get how the accident happened (it sounded like he was showing the table to the baby and dropped it on it, or he put it under the table? confusing, but although the guy didn't want the kid, it definitely doesn't seem plausible that he killed it), it happened in a bizarre and unlucky moment.

It's insane, you can do risky things in your life, you can recover from crazy accidents and situations, but one bad mundane moment can destroy everything.

The reaction made total sense to me, the sense of such shock where you can't even process what happened and want to just make it go away. I could totally understand why he went on with the dinner and then planned to just kill himself, how do you face the outcome of that? And the sense of panic and sickness creeping through that whole evening. I think a part of you believes it can't be real and you'll wake up or it will magically get fixed because it's too insane, too unfair and just too big to deal with.

Even as a viewer, I kept irrationally expecting some magical fix, that it was just a weird nightmare or that the kid will come to life by some supernatural forces and redirect the movie, because I got into the characters head and simple reality seemed to be too much, almost unreal.

What's the right reaction? I guess to call the cops right away and whatever, but really there's no right reaction, there's nothing you can do to fix the extent of the damage that affects not only your life but others too. It's too much to face.

The ending also made perfect sense, because again, what else can you do when you can't live with it?

Ultimately the movie for me was about the danger, randomness and unfairness of life, where there's nothing you can't lose.

Aside from that, I liked how realistic the movie felt, at first I found his wife really grating, and in many scenes she's intolerable but I appreciated how they didn't play into an idylic family. It didn't take away from what happened to them, it made it more effective. The acting and tension are excellent. I throught the guy's reactions throughout the movie were believable and it really immersed me in that metnal state.

I didn't know much about this movie aside from that the title got my attention so when I saw it brought up a few times I finally decided to check it out. I was under the impression it was some bizarre movie about a haunted coffee table, and really didn't expect what I got, especially how quickly the tragedy happens and the rest of the movie is the agony of the aftermath.",7,1733397817.0,TrueFilm,2,1.0,False

1h76xnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1h76xnz/managers_why_do_you_keep_making_people_come_to/,"Managers, why do you keep making people come to the office more than i.e. twice a week? ","So I am one of those people that actually missed coming to the office sometimes during COVID. I know it helps to connect with your colleagues and it is nice to get out of the house, socialize, have a coffee break or lunch with your colleagues and get to ideas that you would not get to through emails or online meetings with strict agendas and purposes. 

But the keyword here is SOMETIMES. 

For me, once or max twice a week is really enough. Anything else beyond that puts me in the position of having to come to the office more than at least two days in a row and the thing is, coming to the office is really, REALLY, REALLY MAKING YOUR EMPLOYEES LESS PRODUCTIVE. At least in an open office (which y'all also love for some reason, and do not get me started on that one!). I don't know how y'all can't see this. 

For example, this week I have this document I need to write that I expected to take me about 3 hours, but it is already Thursday and I am not nearly done. Why? I've had to come to the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. And I've been unable to do anything because: 

1. People are talking around me ALL THE TIME for no good reason. Yay socializing! But not yay focused work! And yes I have earplugs and noise canceling headphones, but I can still hear them, and would it not be so much easier to be somewhere quiet? And yes, there are ""quiet policies"" in place but nobody cares and if you complain about someone speaking loud then you are the antisocial asshole. 

2. I am FUCKING COLD all the time. All of us women are FUCKING COLD all the time in the office. It does not help concentrate. 

3. My office casual clothes are uncomfortable. 

4. I am tired and overwhelmed from the commute in public transport. 

5. I need to stop working earlier than I would if I was home, because again, commute. 

6. I need to take more (or longer) breaks because it is rude to say no to coffee breaks or cut the lunch short when it is someone higher in the chain that has asked you to have coffee/lunch with them. 

And that's just the start of it. 

Oh and do not dare to assume this is just specific to my workplace, because I have to spend days at client sites and it is exactly the same. 

Seriously take it from me, a person that takes her work seriously and respects ALL deadlines because God forbid I am a failure. Having to come  to the office +3 days per week is REALLY NOT MAKING ME DELIVER FASTER OR WITH BETTER QUALITY. It goes in detriment of all the results you want from your employees. 

So why are you so damn obsessed with making people come to the office? Just love the availability of our bodies or something? We are not even having in person meetings because all the meetings are online now with people on the other side of the world!",17,1733397602.0,askmanagers,35,0.68,False

I’ve noticed that after midnight, I have horrendous insomnia and a super power level of resistance to sedatives…

I do use 20mg of IR Adderall each day, but only once in the morning. Same with coffee - one cup in the morning and that’s it.

After midnight, I just can’t sleep no matter what. I’ve tried all of the following in various combinations to ZERO effect (yes, I know it’s reckless, but I’m desperate…): 

-Xanax
-Klonopin
-Various opioids including Fentanyl-laced percs (insufflated…likely with Xylazine), kratom, 7OH, and poppy pod tea (only the tea helps but hard to procure and takes a long time to kick in)
-Gabapentin
-Clonidine (this helps but I hate the feeling)
-Doxylamine
-Diphenhydramine
-Meclizine
-Dimenhydrinate
-Liquor
-Melatonin

On one of the worst nights, I literally combined 3/4 a bar of Xanax + 3/4 fent-laced perc snorted + gabapentin + 2 shots of Whiskey. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep and then was wide awake and alert at 4AM.

1h76p4r,https://i.redd.it/3rsl9r55i05e1.png,2024 Motivation post ,"Just a quick motivation post to those who are wanting to do extended fasts for weight loss. 

You can do it!! 

I've completed a few fasts this year and it's addictive. 

I didn't do a traditional water fast but it worked for me so could be a good way for others to help them on their fasting journey. 

I started this year on 100.5kg (heaviest at 105kg). 
Down to 75kg as of today. 👊  (25.5kg loss)
I was basically a packet of crisps. 😂

2024 goal was to lose 20kg. I hit it. 
I moved the goalpost to 70kg which I'm on track for. (last time I was this weight it was 2012)

My 2025 goal is to hit 65kg and maintain it in 2025, I haven't been this weight since I was 18.

The way I achieved my 2024 weight loss is:

Daily
Black Coffee with beef collegen 
Lemon water 
Matcha
Hoijcha 
Absolutely no diet sodas drinks 

I occasionally have bone broth (300ml) or a glass of whole milk with butter. 

Also, occasionally I'll eat a table spoon of Presidente (french) heavily salted butter. 

Gym wise. 
Weights daily for the first two fast however, work has been busy this year so it's mainly been walking and generally being on my feet. 

I work in a kitchen so am surrounded by food. 😂 

Food when not fasting
One meal a day. (occasionally ill have two but I keep to this as much as I can). 
No sugary drinks but I do occasionally drink coke zero or Fanta zero. 
No alcohol. 
Lots of meat. 
Potato is my preferred carb but it's a once a week treat. 
Beef dripping chips are my achillies heel. 
I avoid seed oils and use natural oils where I can (butter, tallow, olive oil, ghee). 
Avoid bread and rice where I can, but if I want it I'll eat it. 

Benefits
Save loads of money. 
Apart from the weight loss. I feel f*cking fantastic.
More energy than ever, light on my feet. 
Apparently, I've also reversed in age. 
Had a few friends comment on 'how do i look younger every time they see me!' Love that autophaghy.

=========================================================

""Discover the SECRET of Fresh Breath for Dog https://freepage.pro/samutores/dogfresh""

Ah, dog breath—the kind that could peel paint off the walls! If you’ve ever gotten up close and personal with your furry friend, you’re well aware that their breath can sometimes be, let’s just say, less than pleasant. Bad breath in dogs, or halitosis as the fancy vets call it, is a common issue dog parents face. While many of us might brush it off as a natural part of dog ownership, there’s actually more beneath the surface. That’s where probiotics come in.

Now, before you think probiotics are just a trendy buzzword that’s making its rounds in health circles, let me assure you they’ve got real benefits, especially when it comes to freshening up your pup’s stinky mouth. In this article, we’ll dive deep into why probiotics can help combat bad breath in dogs, how to choose the right ones, and even throw in a few practical tips for maintaining your dog’s oral hygiene. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle down with your four-legged companion, and let’s get started!

What Causes Bad Breath in Dogs?
-------------------------------

Understanding the root causes of bad breath is essential to tackling the problem effectively. You'll find that it's not just about poor dental hygiene (though that's certainly a major player). Let’s break down some common culprits:

### 1. Poor Oral Hygiene

Just like us, dogs need regular dental care. Without it, plaque and tartar build up, creating a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. This bacteria produces foul-smelling compounds, leading to that dreaded doggy breath.

### 2. Diet

What your pooch munches on plays a crucial role. A diet high in processed foods can lead to digestive issues that contribute to bad breath. Plus, certain foods, like fish or garbage (let's be real, they love it), can leave lasting odors.

### 3. Health Issues

Sometimes, bad breath may signal more serious health concerns, such as gastrointestinal problems, kidney disease, or diabetes. Keep an eye out for other symptoms, like lethargy or changes in appetite.

### 4. Dry Mouth

Dogs need saliva to help wash away food particles and bacteria. If a pup’s mouth is too dry—whether due to medication or health concerns—it can lead to increased odor.

### 5. Age

As dogs get older, their oral health deteriorates. Gum disease and tooth decay become more common, leading to worse breath.

### 6. Food and Treats

Some doggie treats are packed with ingredients that can contribute to bad breath. Even some dental chews can leave residues that linger.

### Transitioning to Probiotics

Now that we’ve identified the key players behind that rancid breath, you might be wondering: How do probiotics fit into all of this? Great question! Let’s dig deeper.

What Are Probiotics?
--------------------

Probiotics, often dubbed ""good bacteria,"" are live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. They are primarily known for their role in gut health, but did you know they can also impact oral health?

### The Gut-Mouth Connection

The gut and mouth are intricately linked. A healthy gut microbiome can influence the types and quantities of bacteria in the mouth. If the balance of good and bad bacteria shifts toward the latter, it can lead to bad breath. Probiotics can help restore that balance, promoting overall well-being for your furry friend.

Here’s a quick rundown of how probiotics work wonders for your dog’s breath:

- **Fighting Bad Bacteria:** Probiotics can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria responsible for halitosis.
- **Boosting Digestion:** Improved digestion leads to fewer undigested food particles in your pup’s system, which means less odor.
- **Enhancing Immune Function:** A robust immune system fights off infections that can cause bad breath.

Probiotics for Dogs Bad Breath: How Do They Help?
-------------------------------------------------

So, you've made it this far and you're probably wondering: Can probiotics really make a difference? Spoiler alert: Yes, they can! Here's how:

### 1. Reducing Plaque Formation

Certain strains of probiotics may help reduce plaque and tartar formation on teeth, leading to fresher breath. It’s like having a little army of defenders fighting against oral invaders!

### 2. Balancing Oral Microbiota

Just like in the gut, maintaining a healthy balance of bacteria in the mouth can prevent the overgrowth of odorous strains. Probiotics can tip the scales back in favor of those friendly bacteria.

### 3. Enhancing Saliva Production

Probiotics can stimulate saliva production, which is essential for washing away food particles and bacteria. More saliva means less bad breath!

### 4. Digestive Support

By improving your dog’s digestion, probiotics ensure that food is properly broken down, limiting odor-causing compounds from being released.

### 5. Overall Health Benefits

A happy and healthy pup is a pup less likely to have bad breath. Probiotics can help with a variety of health issues, contributing to better overall well-being and, by extension, fresher breath.

Choosing the Right Probiotics for Your Pup
------------------------------------------

Not all probiotics are created equal. To help you make the best choice for your furry friend, here are some pointers to keep in mind when selecting probiotics for dogs bad breath:

### 1. Look for Specific Strains

Certain probiotic strains have shown efficacy in treating bad breath specifically. Look for options containing *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, *Bifidobacterium bifidum*, or *Streptococcus salivarius*. These guys are champions in the battle against odors!

### 2. Ensure They’re Formulated for Dogs

It might be tempting to share your human probiotics with your dog, but hold your horses! Canines require specific formulations designed for their unique digestive systems. Make sure to pick products labeled for canine use.

### 3. Check for Quality Assurance

Look for brands that provide third-party testing and quality assurance. Hop online to read reviews and see what other dog owners are saying about the product’s effectiveness.

### 4. Choose the Right Form

Probiotics come in various forms—powders, capsules, chews, and more. Depending on your dog’s preferences, you can choose the form that’s easiest to administer.

### 5. Consult Your Vet

Before starting your pup on any new supplement, it’s always wise to consult your veterinarian. They can guide you in choosing the right probiotic for your dog's specific needs and health conditions.

Other Tips for Fostering Fresh Breath in Your Dog
-------------------------------------------------

Aside from probiotics, there’s plenty you can do to enhance your pooch's breath. Let’s explore some additional tips:

### 1. Regular Dental Checkups

Routine vet visits should include dental checkups. Catching dental problems early can save you and your pup from discomfort and hefty vet bills down the road!

### 2. Brushing Teeth Regularly

Just like brushing your pearly whites is crucial for you, it’s equally important for dogs. Aim to brush your dog’s teeth at least two to three times a week. Using pet-safe toothpaste can make it a breeze.

### 3. Offering Dental Chews

Dental chews can be a tasty treat that helps scrub away plaque as your dog gnaws away. Remember, choose chews that are suitable for your dog's size and age!

### 4. Providing Fresh Water

Ensure your buddy always has access to clean, fresh water. Hydration is vital for saliva production, which helps keep that breath fresh.

### 5. Monitor Their Diet

Sometimes, simply swapping out treats for healthier options can work wonders for bad breath. Look for high-quality, natural treats that don’t leave behind smelly residues.

### 6. Avoid Table Scraps

Human food can cause digestive upset and lead to bad breath. Stick to a balanced diet specially formulated for dogs.

### 7. Regular Exercise

Believe it or not, regular exercise helps with digestion and overall health. A happy and active dog is bound to have fresher breath!

Real-Life Success Stories
-------------------------

Let’s take a moment to share some success stories from dog owners who’ve tried probiotics for their furry friend’s bad breath. These anecdotes show just how effective probiotics can be!

### Case Study 1: Bella the Golden Retriever

Bella had always been a lovable golden retriever, but her breath was legendary—for all the wrong reasons. After a visit to the vet, Bella’s owner decided to incorporate a probiotic supplement into Bella’s routine. Within weeks, Bella's breath improved, and her overall mood seemed lighter. “I couldn’t believe the difference,” her owner exclaimed, “it’s like she got a fresh start!”

### Case Study 2: Max the Dachshund

Max, a feisty little dachshund, had terrible breath that overshadowed his adorable antics. With his vet’s recommendation, Max’s owner started giving him specific probiotics designed for oral health. Not only did his breath clear up, but Max also began devouring his food with gusto—an unexpected bonus!

### Final Thoughts

When it comes to combating bad breath in dogs, probiotics are an exciting avenue worth exploring. They’re not just for improving gut health; they can significantly influence oral hygiene and overall wellness. But remember, they’re most effective when combined with a comprehensive dental care regimen, including regular vet visits, good oral hygiene practices, and a balanced diet.

It was meant to be another food / drinks hall under new owner after I’m guessing its refurbished, but since then its just been abandoned, does anyone know why?? Seems stupid to kick all the shops out and then leave the place abandoned

You can still have a coffee from ASAP coffee (which replaced Takk) and sit in the courtyard.

Help. I am not sure what Is more beneficial for me. I understand I need my stcw and my medical to be able to work on yachts. I am looking to become a stewardess. There is two courses that they offer there is one which includes the stcw and also it covers how beds are to be made , how to make coffees , how to get stains out of clothes , it includes how to use a rib boat ect. However I have a couple years experience in house keeping for a variety of places such as air bnbs and also in luxury chalets in the french alps. I also have an over a years worth of experience working in a french bistro where we delivered excellent customer service. So  I would like a second opinion would it be worth doing this course or should I just do the stcw on its own. I can also get a power boat licence or experience using one else where as I live by the sea and there is a few boat club’s nearby. Thank you ! ",1,1733395703.0,yachting,2,1.0,False

The messages were nothing compromising however I deleted them and she noticed that when I went to pick her up from work.

The person from work had been reaching out to me mostly since some people at my workplace sell some  mixed nuts and coffee and due to scheduling purposes she was not able to see all this people who I work with. So I was her point of contact with these people and most conversations were regarding if they had restocked or she wanted to buy some stuff. 

I know deleting the messages and keeping her notifications muted looks wrong and it's a sign of distrustful behavior but in all honesty I had it set up like that to avoid any unnecessary confrontations and it ended up making it worse....

I think she might be dumping me despite having always interaction with this person in public at my workplace were a lot of my fiancee's friends work and even my sister in law works at the same place.

The coffee was just the way I liked it. You never missed on that. You always made sure whatever we did was picture perfect. I love the efforts that you made for us to work. Taking care of my needs, handlingmy mood swings, takin me on perfect dates.

People used to say we were the perfect definition of ""perfect couples"". Our relationship was immaculately 50-50. 1 always played harder than you to show my best in our relationship. In my dreams it was always you and me. When I was with you, I saw my whole future with you.

After all this, wasn't I enough for you? Haven't I done enough to make you stay with me? You made me feel I was enough for you at times when I doubted myself. You were the one who kept telling that you didn't need anyone as long as I'm with you, didn't you? And I never left. Then why? Why did you turn your back on me? Why did you made me feel special when I wasn't? Why did you told me I meant the world to you? When I meant nothing to you. Why? I wanna know why.

These questions that come to my mind now and then, they... they suffocate me.Today on our to be 5th anniversary I can't help but to think of that December morning, that Valentine's Day we spent together. I can't forget those days and I can't forget those eyes, that smile, that soft touch and that gentle voice.

Not now, not never I would forget how you made me feel. You left a trace of you in me which could never fade. And after everything still, I will love you, always.

1h766lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h766lv/crazy_neighborhood/,Crazy Neighborhood ,"  A strong consistent ocean breeze, the smell of salt in the air, seagulls trying to snatch a meal, the sounds of waves crashing. These were my daily doses of bliss in my neighborhood.

  I spent most of my days sitting on my stoop taking everything in, watching people tossing a ball at each other, trying to time the clockwork daily jogger, and looking at the sunsets turn the ocean into a sparkling beauty. But my favorite were the seagulls. Watching them lurk and target a person’s sandy snack was by far the best dose of bliss. 

   I was ready to get my daily dose one day, I had my coffee, and put on my coconut scented sun block. As I walked out the door I noticed something off about the day. The smell of salt was gone replaced by the slight smell of ammonia, the people seemed sluggish and somewhat paranoid, and the ocean was still. I decided that day was not a stoop day and  went for a walk instead. 

   During my walk through the neighborhood I started to feel the slight paranoia that I saw in the people. I started to feel eyes.

   I looked everywhere, like a dog looking for an imaginary ball you trick them to fetch, and then I saw them. The seagulls. They were looking at me as if they were waiting for me to mess up in someway. The slight paranoia is not slight anymore, it’s full blast. I start to internally panic and go from sluggish person to sluggish person asking if I am seeing what I am seeing but with no luck, they seemed annoyed by me and ignored the question. 

   The seagulls are locked on me. I run. 

   I make it into my house and immediately question what had happened “Did I just run from seagulls out of fear? Yes you actually ran”. Knowing how silly that was I decide to go back outside. 

   I step out again and noticed the smell of ammonia is stronger and the seagulls have decided to flock on my neighbor’s roof. In disbelief of what I’m actually seeing I freeze and stare at them like a deer to headlights. After what felt like a life time I break from the freeze and start yelling at the gulls and manically run to and question the people of the neighborhood about it. They started to try and calm me down but to no avail, I saw no hope in their eyes. Then the most terrifying thing happened, they call to the seagulls to get me.  

   The seagulls swarm and started to coordinated and herd me in to my house. Thrashing and pushing my way through the mad birds I get a hold of one, but somehow it overpowered me and managed to push me in my room, exit then slam the door shut. I was left with a hand full of feathers, absolute fear, and complete confusion. I take a second before trying to open the door. When I decide it’s a good time to open it and grab the door nob I noticed the feathers in my hands have changed to a piece of fabric. 

   I inspect the ripped piece of fabric, it was white and had a sewn in patch of a seagull. Times slows down and all I can hear is the thumping of my heart and the harsh breaths I’m struggling to take in. Then comes a cold and wet feeling. I look down to see my pants are saturated with a liquid and the smell of ammonia rocks me. I slam my head on the door out of frustration but it was soft and no pain came of it. 

   There was nothing left to do but laugh and laugh about laughing, plan my revenge against the seagulls, escape from the crazy neighborhood, and get my daily dose of bliss.

My main query is, do you need to dial in every time you get new types of beans or once you dial it in for one type, it should be fine for the others?

Don't really want to be wasting precious beans every time I open a new bag, but I also like the idea of having something new every few weeks.
