1kklk7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kklk7g/ex_caused_trauma_im_fucked_up_years_later/,Ex caused trauma. I'm fucked up years later.,"\#walloftext

I'm just going to ramble.  I expect no responses and I'm treating this as a diary.  A woman asked me out today...for the third time.  She's the type of woman that would get ""uh yes please"" from every guy she asks.  She's gorgeous.  Conventionally gorgeous.  She's definitely my ""type"" due to her half-sleeve and definitely intentionally-built ass.  Who would and who COULD say no?  And yet...the first time was merely a hint.  ""I'm going to a birthday party...but I really don't know anyone there...I wish someone would come with me...""  ""Haha, well I'm sure you have plenty of people would willingly go.  I hope it's fun, see ya later"" #escaperoute.  The second time she said she's going to ""this really cool theatre"" and went on about it.  ""Cool that sounds fun I hope you enjoy it.""  ""Yeah...if you'd ever want to go sometime we should do that..."" ""Yeah I'm sure it's a good time see ya later!""  The third time: ""Hey, long time no see.  I like your haircut!"" (Blatantly blushing) ""Thanks!  How've ya been?"" ""Good good.  I'm so tired though.  I need some relaxing.  What are you doing this weekend?""  ""Oh the usual.  Working and not much else.""  ""Well I could use some company since I don't have any plans at all..."" ""Yeah I'm sure.  Sounds boring but that's the best type of weekend, right? haha."" \*walk away\*.  Dude.  Why do I do that shit.  She's fucking...fantastic.

  
My last relationship was fucked up.  I spent a couple of years with a woman...who I don't even know if I know her real name or not.  The entire two years I though it as ""Alex.  But that's on my Russian birth certificate...on my Turkish one it's Kubra.""  She lied about that.  She's not 1/2 Russian.  She now claims she's Belgian (which she doesn't know I've gleaned from her socials years later).  She had her Masters in Computer Science.  I have some history in programming although self-taught.  I showed her my old Github commits and Gerrit forks...(Code speak for people taking my code and implementing it in other projects)  Despite my being inactive for years...people were still forking my projects to that day (at the time) and I thought that was cool.  I showed her how the framework of my code worked.  Who implemented it.  She seemed...""Oh wow that's awesome"" but completely...ignorant?  Didn't seem to understand what I was showing her?  She worked from home.  At one point she said she had trouble focusing without an office.  I turned our living room into an office for her.  Admittedly, she paid for SOME of it but I bought the majority share.  Upon breaking up I found out she didn't have a job.  Her parents from Turkey were sending her 10K every couple months.  10K...while I made 1/4 that and paid the majority of the bills.  And worried about her entirely because when she met she had left a home where she took care of a woman with dementia...and that woman's son kicked her out one day because he's an alcoholic who didn't like her.  She had nothing.  No belongings, furniture, etc.  So for two years I spent every extra cent I had to buy her new clothes.  New shoes.  New lingerie.  The place she moved into (mine) was furnished...but I made her an office.  She complained about the bathroom lighting.  I furnished her a  new cover for the fixture with pine and hemp that I carved by hand and coffee-stained until she liked it.  I worked literally 65=80 hour weeks.  Never a day off...people say that...but...I worked literally open-to-close as a store manager for 48 days in a row (as my record) and would only ever have one day off.  I was never notified what that day would be.  I would get  a call from my District Manager the night prior ""Cameron is going to work your store tomorrow so you can have the day off..."" and I'd rejoice internally.  Then sometimes I'd get a call that morning ""Cameron can't make it..."" and off to work I'd go.  The company I worked for...sucked.  I finally put in my notice and left after the breakup.  But...it wasn't the catalysts as the lies started before she knew my schedule.  The breaking point was...I knew things were weird.  Always.  She always seemed off and sketchy in so many ways.  Her origin story.  Her prior home story.  Her ""I'm married for a visa and he works nearby so that's why I'm sketchy at your job.""  Etc.  One day I recorded the home audio.  She was telling some dude ""No no no I love you so much I'm sorry I'm just busy...no...you fuck me so good my family will understand...bla bla bla""  I woke her from her sleep once I got home from my 10 hour day of 30 in a row or whatever.  ""Let me see your phone or we're done"" after I finally got to hear the recording.  ""What?""  ""Let me see your phone...or we're fucking done.""  ""What's going on/  What?""  I explain what I heard in the recording.  She explains ""that's an ex...what the fuck...you recorded me?  What the fuck?!"" ""Dude...you've been so sketch for so long I had to know...who the fuck now is he?"" ""He's an Ex.  He's dying.  I don't have the heart to not give him something to hold on to...""  She later gives me his info...tells me showing me her phone is too much and she deserves some privacy...etc etc.  She's being so honest right now...etc etc etc.  I tell her she's not to contact him anymore.  She agrees.  Shows me she blocked him on Instagram now...etc.  A year or mor later...same shit.  She's being sketchy.  I see 3K sent to her on Cash app (where here and I send each other money for groceries or whatever) as she's showing me how much she spent at the store so I could send her money.  I didn't ask nor really note it...until she said ""Oh by the way that's my friend who owes me some money...no big deal.""  I then tried to remember exactly what I saw...because...again...I didn't really note it.  From...Kevin...Carter...No...Kevin?...Huh.""  Core memory.  More sketchy shit.  I record the home again.  She's telling some dude she ""really wants to see him soon...can't wait...maybe we should take a vacation together...where should we go?""  I never told her about this one.  They decided New York.  She took a ""work trip"" to New York shortly after.  After finding everything out.  Some dude she posted a photo of on the back of his motorcycle in Florida during a work trip?  Yeah.  She's ""married"" to him now three years post break up.  The dude who I finally caught her with?  Yeah she ""was taking care of an elderly lady with dementia she she couldn't have visitors since that's her part time job technically.""  Same exact story I got.  He described our home.  And how he wanted to meet our cat (who I got for her because she was ""lonely"") but she slammed the bedroom door (where all of the pictures of her and I are on the wall and bedstand) and said ""she's shy"" and escorted him out as he picked her up.  No job.  The past job was a lie.  Her name was a lie.  She continually tried to convince me to let her bring home dudes ""from the college"" (where I now know she wasn't going) for a threesome.  I eventually agreed to an open relationship.  She refused repletely.  Saying she was only for me but though it was sexy etc.  I agreed it's a sexy concept but...she's mine and I could never see her with someone else.  We did some webcam shit.  She...again...years later...I found out was sending our videos to an ex...another dude she saw a few times on ""work trips.""  All the lies later...I can't.  I can't.  I already spent 8 years alone and refusing to date due to another liar and cheater (I'm 34 so not like I spent my 60s but prime dating age).  Since I was a kid.  Pubescent and prior...I've dreamt of a wife.  Someone I could trust my life to.  Someone I could spend every day with happily.  I'm not that picky.  I've dated less physically attractive woman and loved them just as much due to their personality.  But something about thinking ""Dude....I've nailed it"" multiple times (twice that are notable for my trauma) has fucked me up so far that I won't even take anyone out.  I get not making a pass...I get being a recluse...but I don't understand ""THIS WOMAN ASKED YOU OUT"" and blatantly ignoring it.  I'm so fucked up and I don't think I'll ever get over it this time.  Those 8 years alone.  I swore I'd never date again.  I did.  Even after this most-recent-ex.  I dated a woman for a few months (never officially bf/gf) who was 12 years older than I...but fucking beautiful...lost interest.  Took a woman to coffee a few times...she told me she was bipolar (the straw=that=broke=the-camel's-back-ex said the same) and I told her I wasn't interested after that third outing.  I had another lady in those short few months after who I just took home and fucked and told her I'd call her whenever I wasn't busy.  I eventually felt awful after it was clear that she was developing feelings despite my declaring that none were going to become a thing here...and called it off.  I was so kind (in my opinion) that I asked a woman I've known for 10 years ""What would you say to this"" and showed her response...and she basically ""dude...if someone broke up with me like this...I couldn't even feel sad...that's so fucking nice..."" and the woman's response was basically calling me out for all my red flags..calling me a piece of shit..etc.  Valid, you just got broken up with...I'm sorry.  Point being...when I was FUCKING OVER IT.  Fucked up.  Blatantly hurting.  Asking anyone out who I deemed attractive.  Didn't care.  I had a success rate of 3 out of 4.  The fourth had a boyfriend, she said.  So I learned that confidence gets me there even if the woman was ""out of my league.""  And then...then...I stopped hurting as much from the ex.  The ""fuck it"" attitude dropped.  The ""I just want someone to love"" kicked in...but the ""I can NEVER go through that again"" kicked in at the same time.  And here I am.  Upon being asked out by this woman for the third time...I googled my ex.  Which then made me google her husband (or whatever) which then made me google his username on social media.  Which only showed comments on one profile.  Who was my ex's secret account...linked to her Onlyfans and Webcam site (Clapper).  I was asked out and discovered this a couple weeks ago...and here I sit.  Alone.  Blatantly lonely.  With a cat (who I love dearly) I got for my ex that I told her she couldn't have after the breakup.  And...never wanting to do it again.  Still.  I thought three years would definitely be enough.  But the confrontation of reality said ""nooooooooooooooooooooope.""

1kkliv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1kkliv9/how_to_rebuild_retirement_savings_after_leaving/,How to Rebuild Retirement Savings After Leaving Corporate America for Freelance or Gig Work,"Hey everyone! 🌟 

So, let’s be real for a second. Leaving that cushy corporate job for the freelance life can feel like jumping out of a plane without a parachute sometimes, right? One minute you’re sitting in a corner office, and the next you’re working from your couch (or your favorite coffee shop). It’s exhilarating! Until you remember—oops, I still need to fund my retirement. 😅 

But fret not, my fellow creative souls! Rebuilding our retirement savings isn’t as daunting as it sounds, especially when you work smarter, not harder. Here are some tips to help you regain your financial footing while enjoying your newfound freedom:

**1. Set realistic goals.**
   - Seriously, setting wild goals like ""I’m going to save a million bucks by next year!"" isn’t going to help anyone. Start with a number that feels achievable.
   - *Example:* Try saving an extra 10% of what you earn each month. Take baby steps. 🐾 

**2. Stay focused on your income.**
   - That freelance life can get chaotic; projects come and go. Keep a close eye on your income sources and set up a system to track them. 
   - *Pro tip:* Use apps or spreadsheets to monitor what’s coming in. Who knew juggling finances could be this much fun? 🎉 

**3. Create a savings plan with purpose.**
   - Define why you’re saving. Is it for travel? A comfy future home? Or just to create that cozy nest egg? 
   - *Quick visualization:* Picture yourself sipping cocktails on a beach—now that’s motivation!

**4. Automate where you can.** 
   - Automating your savings can feel like having a little financial guardian angel. 💰 Set up an auto-transfer to your savings account right when you get paid.
   - Takes the pressure off! Plus, out of sight, out of mind, am I right? 

**5. Diversify your income streams.**
   - Freelancing often means working with multiple clients. Why not throw in some passive income too? Consider things like stock investments, affiliate marketing, or even teaching online classes. 
   - More income sources = more opportunities to save! 

**6. Prioritize self-care for motivation.**
   - It's easy to fall into the ""hustle until you drop"" mentality. Taking care of your mental and physical health will help keep you motivated. Don’t forget to reward yourself for small wins! You deserve it! 🙌 

So, as you embark on this wild journey, remember that rebuilding your retirement savings is completely within reach! **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** 🏡💪

During our little coffee chat, she excused herself to send a message. As she started typing, it was like she was trying to punch a hole through her phone. The rapid-fire tapping of her thumbs echoed like a war drum. At that moment, I imagined myself listening to this cacophony for the next few months, years or even decades.

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), the message turned out to be an emergency, so we had to end the date prematurely. To be polite, I gave her the old ""it's not you, it's me, no hard feelings"" talk, and I meant it for the first time in my life. She had been nothing but sweet, even offering to pay for our next date after apologizing profusely.

""Hi, I'm Jason,"" I muttered, eyes darting around the room. ""And I haven't played Arc Raiders in eight days.""

A chorus of sympathetic nods followed.

The counselor, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and a clipboard, leaned forward. ""Tell us what brought you here, Jason.""

I exhaled sharply. ""It started when the servers went down. I thought, 'No big deal, I'll wait it out.' But then... then the days stretched on. I couldn't raid. I couldn't strategize. My squad moved on to other games.

At first, I tried to stay calm. I refreshed Reddit every few hours, scrolling through desperate posts from other players, all of us clinging to the hope of an update. I checked Discord obsessively, watching as the official channels remained eerily silent. The memes started rolling in—*Day 3 without Arc Raiders: I touched grass. It was terrifying.* I laughed at first. Then I stopped laughing.

By Day 4, I was pacing my apartment like a caged animal. My fingers twitched, muscle memory aching for the familiar rhythm of movement—dodge, aim, fire. I booted up other games, but nothing scratched the itch. The mechanics felt sluggish, the worlds empty. My squad had moved on, their Discord statuses mocking me: *Playing Destiny 2*, *Grinding Apex*, *AFK*.

Day 5 was the breaking point. I woke up in a cold sweat, convinced I had missed an announcement. I grabbed my phone before my eyes had even adjusted to the light, scrolling frantically. Nothing. No patch notes. No ETA. Just silence.

And that’s when I lost it.

I found myself standing in front of my PC, hands clenched into fists. I opened the game launcher, stared at the *Arc Raiders* logo, and whispered, ""Come back.""

It didn’t.

That’s when I knew I needed help.""

A man across from me, wearing a hoodie with a faded gaming logo, nodded knowingly. His eyes had the weary look of someone who had fought this battle before—someone who had stared into the abyss of server downtime and barely crawled out.

""We've all been there,"" he said, his voice carrying the weight of experience.

I studied him. The hoodie was stretched and worn, the logo barely visible—some old esports team, maybe, or a relic from a convention long past. His fingers tapped idly against his knee, as if still accustomed to the rhythmic movements of a controller or keyboard.

""You think you're fine at first,"" the man continued, leaning forward. ""You tell yourself it's just a game, just a temporary outage. But then the hours turn into days, and suddenly, you're spiraling. You start checking forums at 3 AM, hoping for a whisper of news. You boot up other games, but they feel hollow. You wonder if you’ll ever feel that rush again—the perfect ambush, the last-second escape, the thrill of a well-executed raid.""

I swallowed. ""Exactly.""

The man gave a knowing smirk. ""I once spent an entire weekend refreshing Twitter, convinced the devs were about to drop an update. They didn’t. I ended up watching speedruns of *Dark Souls* just to feel something.""

A few people chuckled.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Maybe I wasn’t alone in this after all.

The counselor smiled. ""Withdrawal is tough. But you're here now, and that's a step forward.""

I glanced at the others—former raiders, strategists, warriors—all casualties of downtime.

""Does it ever get easier?"" I asked.

The hoodie guy smirked. ""Not really. But you learn to cope. And when Arc Raiders comes back..."" He leaned in, eyes gleaming. ""We’ll be ready.""

# ✅ Use this free tool:

👉 [https://www.whatismyzipcodeis.com/](https://www.whatismyzipcodeis.com/)

It automatically detects your location using your browser’s geolocation (with your permission, of course) and shows your ZIP/postal code in seconds.

# 🛠️ When is this useful?

* Signing up for services that require a ZIP code (e.g., ride apps, stores)
* Filling out address fields when traveling or relocating
* Working remotely in new locations and needing accurate info

I found it especially handy while working remotely from different coffee shops — no more googling “what’s my ZIP code?”

**Try it out and bookmark it if you're someone who's often on the move.**

1kkl9xo,https://i.redd.it/2nf4bq1qja0f1.png,Final Boarding: Gate 6D,"I was at Kempegowda International Airport, sipping filter coffee and idly watching the boarding queue for the 10:35 IndiGo flight to Delhi, when a sharp, commanding voice sliced through the ambient noise of boarding announcements.

“You *have* to help me!”

The voice belonged to a woman, likely in her late 60s, draped in a crisp silk saree with a handbag that looked older than most of the passengers. Her bangles jingled aggressively as she pointed at the gate agent, demanding attention like a VIP at a temple queue.

“Madam,” said the visibly tired airline staffer, “I’ve explained this already. The flight is full—there are no seats available.”

“But the counter staff said I could go on standby!” she protested, her voice echoing across the terminal.

“Standby is only possible if someone cancels last minute or doesn’t show. Everyone is present and accounted for.”

“Then *make* someone get off! I need to be in Delhi *tonight*! It’s urgent.”

The agent took a slow breath, visibly clenching her jaw. “Everyone has paid, confirmed seats. I cannot bump anyone for a standby request.”

“Then offer money. Surely some poor soul will take it. What’s the use of all this technology if you can’t even do that?”

“Madam, this isn’t an auction. And we aren’t overbooked. We have exactly as many passengers as seats.”

People were starting to watch. A few were whispering, others recording on their phones. The woman stood her ground like she was owed the sky.

“I *demand* to speak with your manager,” she bellowed, drawing more eyes.

A man in a hoodie two rows down chuckled audibly. “Here it comes,” he muttered, and several around him giggled.

“Madam, please. You are disrupting the gate. Either calm down or I’ll have to ask you to leave.”

“This is *outrageous!* I have connections! You’ll lose your job for this!”

The woman’s voice was nearing a fever pitch, her anger blooming across the terminal like monsoon clouds.

Then I stood up.

“Excuse me,” I said to the agent. “If it means that much to her, she can take my seat.”

The woman turned to me, victorious. “See? Finally, someone with *sense*. Not like these people.”

The agent turned to me, frowning. “Are you sure, sir? You’re not obligated to give up your seat.”

“It’s fine,” I said with a quiet smile. “I’m in no rush.”

She typed quickly, reassigned the seat, and handed the boarding pass to the woman, now beaming like a devotee granted darshan after hours of protest.

As I turned to leave the terminal, I checked the gate number: 6D. Fitting.

People often think fate comes with warning bells or lightning strikes. In truth, it walks quietly, carries no luggage, and has impeccable timing.

It wasn’t even her time yet—she had twelve more years to live. But who was I to deny such eagerness to meet me?

She would’ve met me eventually.

After all, I always get my due.

Hell, they'll fire you for getting even 1 hour of overtime. The ""blue collar "" jobs weekly hours are capped at around the 32 hour mark, or less. Companies in general, have REALLY cut back in paying ANY overtime in the last 10-15 years. It's that whole attempt to constantly cut costs and make record profits every quarter, to kick it all up to the top executive's. Most jobs that do not require a degree and pay hourly, don't even want anybody getting full time hours anymore. That way they don't have to provide benefits (which are ridicliously expensive anyways). They want to keep everybody at 32 hours a week or less. This is why there's so many ""blue collar"" workers now that have 2-3 jobs and still have no benefits. Every decade it gets worse for the workers while the top executive's make record profits, like clockwork. They always find more money to squeeze out of somewhere and give it to the top.

The ""white collar"" jobs I think actually have it worse. Because they're ""salaried"". All that means is they can work you 80 hours and pay you the same as if you worked 40. 

This constant pressure for the company to make more money than last year, or last quarter, is insane. They cut ""costs"" from anything and everything. They'll fire people and not hire anybody else, that job will just cease to exist and they literally put all those responsibilities onto current employees, without raising their pay. You have people doing 2 salaried jobs, working 60-70 hours for the same pay. They'll cut the employees down to a skeleton crew. They'll cut how much coffee you can drink, ""only 1 cup per person per shift"" type shit. They'll monitor your bathroom time ffs. I mean, where does this end? There can't be ""record profits"" every quarter and every year FOREVER!

All this is doing is burning through good employees and offering them pretty much nothing. It's not a sustainable plan, at some point it will implode and the pendulum will have to swing in the employees favor. I thought this happened with COVID and the remote work thing, when people refused to come back into the office 5 days a week, or at all. But that seems to have broken down and the employers largely got the employees back into the office and under their control again.

Ricardo sometimes has work and then sometimes does not, but he keeps going to the pub and insists on having a beer from the fridge at home. I often protest, but the blows and his threats make sure that beer is rebought. I hardly have any contact with my friends and family anymore, so I can't ask for help anywhere.

At the end of the month, I want to pay the rent. I sit down at the computer with my bank card in hand.

'Ricardo, I'm going to pay some bills. Can you make us some coffee?'

At that moment, Ricardo storms towards me, almost knocking me out from behind the computer, and snatches the bank card from my hands. He runs outside.

Dazed, I watch him go and feel my lip swelling. Now I can't pay the bills again, and the housing association really wants money. I pace around the house, trying to devise a plan but can't. I have nothing and no one left to turn to. What now…?

 

Around three in the morning, he comes home completely drunk and wants sex. I refuse; I really don't want to. But that doesn't help. First, I get a few blows, and then he rapes me. I feel helpless under this violence and don't know what to do anymore. I have to get out of here and protect my son from this, but I have no idea how. Where do I go? What can I do?

The next morning, I wake up to the sound of Martijn crying. The first thing that comes to mind is that I didn't pay the rent this month, and there's no money left for food. Angry and sad, I take my son downstairs and take care of him - my pride. With the last scraps, I make him breakfast. An hour later, Ricardo comes downstairs, too.

'Good morning, my dearest people. Did you sleep well?' he asks cheerfully.

'We have no food left in the house,' I snap. 'How are we supposed to do groceries now? You've drunk all the money away in the pub again!'

'Don't be so dramatic, Princess, I'll take care of that,' he says, laughing. He picks up the phone and calls his mother. Less than five minutes later, money is transferred to our account. We'll use that to do groceries, and of course, Ricardo also grabs two crates of beer. Silently, I walk next to him in the store. I'm disgusted by his exaggerated friendliness.

'Look, Princess, you love strawberries so much, come, let's get a nice little box. Then you can have them for lunch with Martijn.'

With difficulty, I put on a smile to show myself as loving and grateful because I'm also getting something tasty. I look at him sweetly.

'Darling, don't forget the diapers and food for Martijn, okay?'

'Do you think I'm stupid?' he hisses angrily. 'I take care of my son just fine.' He storms off to get diapers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a barndominium with a pool offers a perfect blend of relaxation and rural living. This modern take on the traditional barn structure has become increasingly popular for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. A barndominium not only provides a unique aesthetic but also combines style and function with the added bonus of a swimming pool. Whether you're contemplating building your dream home or renovating an existing space, several key features can enhance your rural retreat.

### Open Floor Plans

One of the main attractions of a barndominium is its spacious open floor plan. This design allows for seamless transitions between the kitchen, living, and dining areas, making it ideal for entertaining family and friends. Large windows let in natural light, while high ceilings create an airy feel that enhances relaxation.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

When thinking about a barndominium, be sure to integrate outdoor living spaces. A covered patio or deck next to the pool provides a great spot for lounging or hosting summer barbecues. Imagine sipping iced tea while soaking in the sun or enjoying evenings warmed by a fire pit.

#### Essential Features for Outdoor Spaces:

- **Sheltered Areas:** The addition of a pergola or awning protects from the sun and allows for longer use of outdoor spaces.
- **Furniture:** Consider comfortable outdoor furniture such as lounges, dining sets, and hammocks.
- **Landscaping:** Incorporate native plants and flowers to blend your barndominium with the surrounding natural beauty.
- **Lighting:** Soft, ambient lighting can enhance evening gatherings and create a cozy atmosphere by the pool.

### Energy Efficiency

In rural settings, energy efficiency is crucial. During your design process, think about incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technology. Solar panels and insulated windows not only cut down on energy costs but also align perfectly with the serene, eco-friendly lifestyle that barndominiums promote.

### Modern Kitchen and Living Areas

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home. In a barndominium, you can create a modern, functional kitchen that connects effortlessly with the rest of the space. Opt for open shelving, large islands, and energy-efficient appliances. An open-concept design will encourage family gatherings over meals, enhancing the rural living experience.

### Luxury Pool Design

A pool adds a luxurious touch to your barndominium and is an essential feature for relaxation. When planning your pool, think about the type that best fits your lifestyle. Options can include:

- **In-ground Pools:** These pools can be designed in various shapes and sizes, allowing for customization to match your space.
- **Infinity Pools:** These provide stunning views and create a dramatic effect as the water seems to flow into the horizon.
- **Above-ground Pools:** A cost-effective option that can still provide plenty of fun and relaxation for the whole family.

#### Decorating Around the Pool:

Make your pool area feel like a personal retreat. Add decorative tiles, stone pathways, and tiki torches for ambiance. Stylish safety features, like elegant fencing or illuminated pathways, ensure a safe environment without taking away from the beauty.

### Private Retreat Spaces

No barndominium is complete without cozy retreats. Consider adding a master suite with a spa-like bathroom, or a reading nook with stunning views. These intimate spaces create a sanctuary for relaxation, making your home a peaceful retreat from everyday stressors.

### Embracing Rustic Charm

Embrace the rustic charm that a barndominium offers. Exposed beams, wood finishes, and stone accents create a warm and inviting atmosphere. These elements not only add to the aesthetic but also connect your home to its rural surroundings.

Designing a barndominium with a pool is about personalizing your living space to match your lifestyle. Emphasizing comfort, functionality, and style will help you craft the perfect sanctuary where relaxation and rural living come together harmoniously.

The Benefits of Owning a Barndominium with a Pool: A Harmonious Blend of Comfort and Nature
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a relaxing countryside lifestyle combined with modern comfort? A barndominium with a pool may be the perfect solution for you. This unique living space fuses the rustic charm of a barn with contemporary amenities, and when paired with a pool, it becomes a tranquil retreat that promotes leisure and relaxation.

### The Charm of Barndominium Living

Barndominiums are trending for a reason. These hybrid structures combine the durability of metal buildings with the coziness of a home. You’ll enjoy spacious open floor plans that are perfect for entertaining or simply unwinding after a long day. With high ceilings and large windows, natural light fills the space, making it feel warm and inviting.

When you own a barndominium, you also welcome a lifestyle deeply connected to nature. Imagine sipping your morning coffee while gazing at the surrounding fields. This living arrangement encourages outdoor activities and a harmonious relationship with the environment.

### A Pool as the Heart of Relaxation

The addition of a pool elevates the experience of owning a barndominium. Here’s how:

- **Enhanced Outdoor Living:** A pool provides an excellent space for relaxation and entertainment. Whether you’re hosting a barbecue or enjoying a quiet afternoon, the pool becomes a hub of activity.
- **Exercise and Wellness:** Swimming is a fantastic low-impact workout. Having a pool at home means you can incorporate exercise into your daily routine without the hassle of traveling to a gym.
- **Family Bonding:** Spending time by the pool creates lasting memories with family and friends. Pool games, parties, or simply lazy afternoons encourage connection and fun.
- **Stress Relief:** There’s something soothing about water. A pool adds a serene environment that helps you relax and unwind, promoting excellent mental health.

### Nurturing Nature

Opting for a barndominium with a pool allows you to embrace the outdoor lifestyle fully. With a property typically situated on larger plots of land, there’s more room for gardens, workshops, or recreational spaces. Imagine customizing your outdoor area to include:

- **Landscaped Gardens:** Create beautiful gardens with native plants that attract wildlife.
- **Patios and Decks:** Design inviting spaces around the pool for lounging or entertaining.
- **Outdoor Cooking Areas:** Barbecue grills and outdoor kitchens make it easy to prepare meals while enjoying nature.

### Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

Another significant advantage of a barndominium is the potential for energy efficiency. Many modern barndominiums feature insulated walls and roofs, which can help lower your utility bills. a roof-mounted solar system adds to this sustainability aspect. A pool can also be designed with energy-saving technology, like variable-speed pumps and solar heating, ensuring you can enjoy your oasis without heavy costs.

When you’re nestled in your barndominium, surrounded by nature and your inviting pool, you create a wholesome environment. It’s a space that fosters creativity, relaxation, and growth. Being close to nature encourages outdoor exploration, while the comfort of your home ensures you have a sanctuary to retreat to.

### A Feasible Investment

Investing in a barndominium with a pool is not just a lifestyle choice; it can also be a sound financial investment. These structures often appreciate well due to their unique charm and growing popularity. The added feature of a pool can increase property value, making it attractive for future buyers.

Owning a barndominium with a pool beautifully merges relaxation and rural living. This unique blend not only enhances your quality of life but also offers opportunities for personal growth and connection with nature. Take the leap into this wonderful living arrangement; you may find that it’s the peaceful escape you've always desired.

### Conclusion

Choosing to design and live in a barndominium with a pool perfectly combines the best of rural living and relaxation. When you consider key features such as large open spaces, ample natural light, and outdoor areas that seamlessly integrate with your pool, you can create a home that not only reflects your personal style but also enhances your quality of life. Imagine stepping out from your cozy living space into your outdoor oasis, where the sound of water gently splashing can soothe your senses and bring you closer to nature.

Owning a barndominium with a pool offers numerous benefits that go beyond aesthetics. This unique living arrangement promotes a lifestyle centered on comfort and community, serving as a gathering place for friends and family.

Moriarty immediately knew what the intention was. The intention was to hack these angels to get them on our side. Moriarty considers this a fine idea for what they can come with as a whole. The approach to this request is that Dante and Metatron Jeanne are securing angels elsewhere, while you, Kadoc and Moriarty are securing it here. Kadoc uses himself as bait to lure the angels in. Later, Kadoc gathers a lot of angels up to the Seventh Rank.

After the battle, Kadoc gets a bit pissed at himself for pushing himself too hard. Moriarty checks the items that Kadoc obtained which is perfect for the request. Moriarty suggests Kadoc to not try dodging anytime soon before he actually injures himself with his own mobility acceleration magecraft.

Dante and Metatron regroup and report that they have Ninth to Seventh Ranking angels, and the party thinks that they’ll have a tougher time getting angels from the Sixth Rank and above. Metatron Jeanne blesses Kadoc with something to allow Kadoc to continue acting as bait.

Kadoc goes off to bait more angels from Sixth Rank and above, and he states that he feels like a Servant with this blessing that Metatron Jeanne gave him. As Kadoc continues baiting, he is caught off guard when the angels do a pincer attack which he last expected from them. Lilith comes in to assist Kadoc with the angels.

After the battle, Kadoc thanks Lilith, but she asks why he'd be thanking her if she’s his enemy. Kadoc thought she was his ally, but Lilith jokes about how she can’t remember, and makes a poor joke at Kadoc’s expense at how he was an enemy and now an ally.



**Kadoc:**

>…Also, why are you so against Mashu?

**Lilith:**

>Why, huh. Well—can’t tell you.

>I’ll tell **him** if he asks. —Well, maybe not.



Lilith leaves, and Kadoc brings back some angels to the rest of the party and they begin fighting them off.

After the battle, you give Metatron Jeanne a piggy back ride after being so exhausted. King Ashoka arrives to help the party carry the angels back to Granato. Kadoc asks if he’s allowed to do this, but he doesn’t mind it. Back at Granato, Kirei is impressed at how quickly this was handled.



**Kotomine Kirei:**

>Let us wait. The invitation has been sent. They will arrive shortly.



**Everyone:**

>…Invitation?

**Naucrate:**

>—Please allow me to forwardly introduce myself. I am the chamberlain doll, Naucrate.

>And here is my lord, the transcendent craftsman, Daedalus. Gates of Hell? Chamber pot of demons? Please place your orders fitting for my lord.

**Kashin Koji:**

>I am a trivial gejutsu user, Kashin Koji. I came because I was called. What should I do?



**Kotomine Kirei:**

>I want you both to analyze these angels.



**Naucrate:**

>“Analyze” is putting it loosely. A crude request is life or death for my transcendent craftsman.

>If you’d like us to take a thousand years for us to analyze life within a forest, I do not mind.



**Kashin Koji:**

>I can search for their weaknesses.



**Kotomine Kirei:**

>No, not everything nor their weakness. I’d like for you to focus on their networking feature.



**Kashin Koji:**

>Networking.



**Kotomine Kirei:**

>This is mere conjecture…

>But the Seventh Rank supervises the Eighth and Ninth Rank, while the Fourth Rank supervises the Fifth and Sixth Rank through a networking feature.

>On the other hand, I would guess that robbing them of that feature will render the angels powerless.

Naucreate relays the message of her lord, Daedalus. They state that these angels are interesting, but they don’t like how underutilized and the loss in potential these angels have. Daedalus requests to add gimmicks and the ability to change appearance. Moriarty wants to remove the feature of changing their appearance. However, the party doesn’t mind if they add something like a gatling gun on there. Daedalus tells everyone to get out because Kashin and Naucreate will start their work. Kotomine’s job here is done. You have a chance at arriving at the full court. Both the party and Kotomine Kirei are prepared to fight at this trial with everything they have.

**Kotomine Kirei:**

>Now then, the rest is up to you all. …Oh, I will say this.

>SEE YOU IN COURT.

**Everyone:**

>…



**Dante:**

>Hehe…Prosecutor Kotomine, surely you didn’t just come all the way here to say that, right?



**Kadoc:**

>That’s what I thought too but that just drained me, so I’ll stop here.



**Moriarty:**

>Well, we’ll just have to wait patiently until tomorrow.

Naucrate desires chocolates, coffee, anything because that’s what her lord desires so that they can continue working. Kashin Koji wants gyokuro tea, and Naucrate notes how expensive that is. Kadoc wonders if there’s anything that expensive or luxurious as gyokuro tea. Amakusa says that he was just drinking one, when in actuality, he just stole Metatron Jeanne’s.

It’s nighttime and you’re outside as Kadoc comes out. Kadoc asks if you’re worried about Mashu. You are worried, but Kadoc says that all they can do is wait it out. Kadoc jokes about how they can’t pray because they’re going up against people who are closest to God in this case.

I will not promote,"Not the overpriced curated lifestyle boxes that just repackage random products (a lot of brands on Cratejoy fall into this). I’m talking about brands that sell their own products on subscription—meal kits, coffee, pet supplies, pantry staples—things people genuinely need to restock regularly.

I’ve been exploring the subscription‑box space, and despite our interviews and surveys showing that 70% of subscribers would embrace a true one‑stop platform—with consistent policies, standardized management, clear rating system. I can’t find any product that actually delivers on this promise. We’re digging in to understand the underlying challenges.

For brands, there’s upside as well: today’s subscription market, especially in meal kits, is dominated by big players like HelloFresh and Hungryroot, leaving smaller companies struggling for visibility. A unified platform could level the playing field by showcasing emerging brands and giving them the exposure they need to win over new subscribers.

Here are some of our assumptions:

1. Demand vs. Reality Is subscription management not painful enough? Have smaller niche platforms snuck in under the radar? Or could our research be overstating true willingness to switch?
2. Market / Partnership Barriers Do brands hesitate to join an aggregator because it dilutes their direct customer relationship or cuts into margins?
3. Trust & Compliance Hurdles Are platforms avoiding unified cancellation or billing policies due to liability, charge‑back risks, or regulatory concerns?
4. Technical Complexities We’ve broken down the integration work—APIs for billing systems, webhooks for status updates, reconciliation logic, and it all seems achievable. What hidden engineering pitfalls might we be missing?

Has anyone here tried to build or research something similar? What unexpected challenges did you hit, on the customer side, merchant side, or technically? I will not promote",1,1747028299.0,u_MyBatisRay1029,0,1.0,False
1kkkyr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kkkyr6/my_dad_forces_me_to_watch_a_whole_ass_movie_with/,My dad forces me to watch a whole ass movie with him EVERYDAY and has a meltdown when I don't,"I'm 20 and I've been unable to move out due to being in debt and I feel like no matter what I do I literally cannot get along with my dad or live in the same house as him without conflict and without him causing me problems and disrupting my routine and being a problematic figure in life because our personalities are just too different in the end. Even when I try to compromise with him and do listen to his demands it's never good enough and he just wants more and more from me and finds some way to create conflict and gets into arguments no longer what. Sometimes I'm convinced he is an actual energy vampire.

We eat dinner as a family and we watch a show everytime we do it and I'm not allowed to leave until the show is over even if I don't give a rats ass about it or he'll throw a fit. Now I don't have a problem with the show's itself, moreso the fact that I literally just have better shit to do with my spare time. I have a bedroom full of art supplies and music equipment but I find it so hard to get any projects done with him living in the same house as me because he doesn't let me have my own free time. Whenever I'm in my room during the daylight and he's not at work, he always calls me on the phone and criticizes me for being in my room instead of in the house doing chores or whatever bullshit. He doesn't see my creative projects as important and thinks they're a waste of time unless it makes money and he's said some really hurtful things to try to kill my artistic motivation.

When it's day time and I'm in the house I feel like I really get very little time to myself even when I'm unemployed because my family (him specifically, everyone else respects my need for space) won't let me be in my own room because I could never possibly be doing anything productive in my own room. It's been hurting me all year and last year and I just hate it. I think I would've gotten so much more of my own personal projects done by now if it weren't for his interference. Living with him is like a job. If he actually respected my boundaries and gave me space when I needed it, it would be fine, but he has stupid anxious attachment so he takes it as a personal attack when I literally just want more time to myself to be in my fucking room besides sleeping. But noooo I'm not allowed to be in my own room because I could never possibly be doing anything productive in it

Anyways, these past few days he's been insisting on putting on full ass movies instead of shows. Forcing me to sit down for the entire show even after I finish my food was already annoying enough but he put on a full two hour long movie without my permission and I of course got annoyed by this because I was planning on working on music. I told him I don't want to watch a movie right now and instead of respecting my boundary, he just got really angry and went into a full 45 minute long rant about how because my attention span is broken (I have childhood brain damage) I NEED to watch the entire movie in order to fix it. I tad him it's not because I can't pay attention, I am fully capable of sitting through a movie. My family literally takes me to the movie theater all the time. Its the fact that I just have better shit to do when I still have daytime energy and I would rather spend my time being creative and actually making stuff then just being stuck on a couch for two hours. I tried explaining this to him and he's just like ""yeahhh but what about the lesson I'm trying to teach you :("" and wouldn't take no for an answer and wouldn't stop whining about it until we finally agreed to it. Even when we agreed with him just to get him to shut up he kept going off on his tangent of never ending dialogue and criticism about how manipulative me and my mom are for not giving him his way and when he does this he just adds to his point and goes on and on in to try to make his rant as long as possible and nothing you say will satisfy him even if you pretend to agree with what he's saying, and if you disagree that will make it even worse and he'll just get louder and more aggressive and never backs down until he gets it HIS WAY.

I came home to dinner and I was grateful for it and when I finished my food I tried to leave the living room but he demanded I stay for the entire movie. I simply said one sentence, which was, ""you didn't even ask me for permission before you put this on."" He took this as a personal attack and started going off on his usual rant about how my attention span is horrible and it needs to be fixed and this is the only way to fix it and he does this for me not him and I keep rejecting the lesson. But the thing is, I literally can sit through a movie and I do pay attention to the show's he makes me watch when they are actually good. I just genuinely have better shit to do with my spare time than sit on a couch for two hours. Especially after I just got down with an hour long drive. I said ""okay fine I'll watch it"" and even after I agreed he still dialogued for another twenty minutes. I just can't win with him. He said that now we will watch a movie everyday and he should switch to audio books to try to force my attention span. He like genuinely delusionally believes I need to watch a movie everyday in order to get my attention span back. Me and mom tried to explain to him that this is not true but he is impossible to reason with.

Here's what my unemployed daily routine is like because I live with this man. (yes I am trying to get a job. I don't like being unemployed) I get out of bed and make coffee, then he gets up and talks to me, then I go back to my room and he calls me on my phone to tell me to come back to the house to do chores. I come back to the house and clean what I think needs to be cleaned but there's honestly not that much to do so I just end up hiding in a corner and spending a lot of time brain rotting on my phone because all my creative projects are in my room. Then I dedicate a couple hours to applying for jobs. Then I need to cook lunch for myself which usually takes an hour or two. Then I usually go to a job interview around this time and hit the gym afterwards which takes at least three hours out of my day. When I get home I walk around and look at my phone because God forbid I go to my ooooo scary unproductive room with my creative projects that don't make any money 😱😱😱 Then an hour later it's dinner time and I have to sit down and stare at a screen for two hours. By the time this is over I am too sleepy and drained to work on my own stuff so I go to bed. Zero progress made on my personal projects. Repeat the next day. This is making me depressed as fuck. I seriously think I would've created so much more if it weren't for him. I'm sick of time passing and getting nothing that's important to me done because of this man

See, I wouldn't have a problem watching a movie with him if he didn't treat it like it's a vital chore and he would actually let me choose WHEN I want to watch the movie and not just hold me hostage at random times without my permission. He has no respect for my space and need to express my creativity and its really been affecting my motivation and causing me problems. I wish he could just be normal and take no for an answer and respect my boundaries instead of going through insane mental gymnastics to justify everything he does. I tried to compromise with him and politely asked him if we can watch a show instead of a movie tomorrow because it's a full moon and I would like to have that creative time to myself and as expected, he just takes it as an attack and it absolutely has to be a movie and I have to stop resisting the lesson and blah blah blah. I feel like I'm really not being taken seriously and he doesn't actually know what I need. His way or his way or I'm officially firing him as a father figure in his eyes. It's very frustrating for me

I am so tired of his clingy bullshit. I am tired of not being able to complete any personal projects. Whenever anyone calls him out he just dialogues for an hour and puts a bunch of words into our mouths about how we are treating him like an asshole and the villain when he's just trying to instill a lesson which doesn't exist and he keeps going on and on and it's so draining to be around. I really don't need to watch a two hour long movie every day to fix my attention span and I know he's just making this shit up to spend more time with me but he literally doesn't let me have any time to myself! If he could respect my boundaries there wouldn't be a problem and I actually would go out of my way to spend time with him but he always forces it and it makes me want to avoid him at all costs and spend as little time with him as possible.

I literally just want to be able to finish my creative projects and be able to work on them when I'm not tired as fuck. Why is that too much to ask for? I'm so sad about this",2,1747028299.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Being an outcast I was, I sat alone at the table nearest to teachers' table and librarian's counter because most chose to sit further away and behind bookshelves. Maybe my ""alone-ness"" caught my teacher's attention. She came and sat beside me, asking me about what I'm reading. I told her about some comics, poem collections, and some random books I picked up.

She walked away, then came back, handed me a book about cultural architectures around the world. It's a thin, hardcover, most likely a book usually bought as coffee-table books. So I read it, it was nice. Not the most memorable nor a deep dive of the topic. One caught my eye, was the Pavilion section, talking about transition from Pagoda architecture to a Pavilion.

Then I remembered adults talked about Pavilion in KL, ""Beli kat Pavilion Kau! *Jangan* *marah* (￣▽￣)"". I was very excited; we were also had to go to KL to visit relatives in a few weeks (forgot why).

On Isabella Bennett's birthday, she waited all night. But Dominic Hinton never returned.

His first love Chloe Winslow was marrying the infamous playboy in their circle today.

He couldn't bare her ruin her life and rush off to stop the wedding.

With swollen eyes, she sat alone in the living room all night. By morning, she received a call from an unfamiliar number.

""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""

Hearing that nonchalant tone, Isabella instantly pictured the man of cynicism. The very playboy Dominic's precious Chloe was supposed to marry.

""Lucas Montgomery?""

""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" Lucas laughed with mischief. ""So I'm here to steal his. Fair's fair, right?""

Isabella fell silent for a moment, then shook her head slightly. ""Seems fair enough.""

On the other end, Lucas arched an eyebrow and said confidently.

""Perfect. I'll arrange another wedding in fifteen days. Get yourself a dress and wait for me to marry you.""

Then the line went dead.

Isabella stared at the cold dinner spread across the table, tears suddenly welling in her eyes.

She never imagined that after all these years of waiting, she'd finally received a proposal.

But the proposal wasn't from Dominic. The groom wasn't Dominic.

And the man she'd be marrying wasn't Dominic either.

...

Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.

It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.

Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.

Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.

But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.

Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.

Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.

She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.

And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.

Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.

Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.

Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.

Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.

The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.

The next day, Chloe flew off to France.

Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.

That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.

His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.

She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.

""Who the fuck are you?""

""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""

He didn't remember at all.

But he let her take him home anyway.

That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.

Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—

A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.

The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.

Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.

But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.

He never forgot Chloe.

She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.

Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.

She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.

During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.

Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.

She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.

Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.

Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.

And everything went back to square one.

He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.

He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.

And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.

Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""

Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.

Isabella stood up and started packing.

One by one, everything went into garbage bags.

The trash truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.

""What are you throwing away?""

The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.

Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless shit.”

Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”

Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.

""Who the hell gave you permission to touch my things?!""

He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.

After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.

As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.

She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.

Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.

Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—

Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through trash.

Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.

“The trash truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”

Only then did Dominic notice her injury.

He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""

Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""

Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.

“It was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.”

Isabella’s breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.

That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.

No wonder he was so desperate.

Chapter 2

The tension inside the car thickened into silence.

Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.

""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""

These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.

The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.

And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn’t meant anything legally for years—was because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.

The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.

She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.

""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""

Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. “Lucas found someone new? Who told you that?”

Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.

But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.

The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.

""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I’m gonna die in there! What should I do?""

""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.

He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""

Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.

After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.

The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of trash under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.

Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.

After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.

Then the housekeeper called.

""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must’ve slipped there while he was sleeping.”

Isabella let out a bitter laugh.

How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?

And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.

Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.

Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.

She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.

Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.

Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.

""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""

Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.

The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.

The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.

""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""

Chapter 3

In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees—was now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.

Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.

Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella’s chest, leaving her gasping for air.

The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.

The room wasn’t fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.

""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why the hell would you take the punishment for me?”

Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.

“I did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""

""I love you, and I didn’t want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""

Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.

""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn’t you?""

Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.

Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?

Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.

The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.

After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.

But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.

""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""

""Dominic’s never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?”

In that moment, Isabella finally understood—marrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.

All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.

Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.

Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.

The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.

""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""

Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.

“Played him? What exactly did I ‘play’? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me—I never forced him to do anything.""

""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""

Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.

She couldn’t even deny it. Because Chloe was right.

“Yes, he made his choice. And I respect it. Don't worry, I'm stepping aside. You two enjoy yourselves.”",1,1747028029.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1kkkvc8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkkvc8,Uhhh... Why does the file has [NA] instead of the actual channel name?,"Hi everyone,

I have a quick question about a YouTube to MP3 converter. After it converts, the file name saved for the MP3 is \[NA\] instead of the channel name. For example, it saves as  
\[NA\] - Name of Video.mp3  
instead of  
\[Channel Name\] - Name of Video.mp3

Now, it's not a problem, since I was able to rename it and it plays fine. There's no functional issue, and it's merely the converter's ability to access certain things when creating the file name. But I wonder, why would the converter not be able to acquire the channel name? Has this happened to anyone else?

Thanks so much!

I noticed I mostly get light roasts, I only drink milk beverages once I dialed in a coffee and I usually make 2-3 cups every morning. 

What I would like to get from this upgrade is more powerful milk frothing (I hate the wait time), stable temperature (it’s annoying that even if I pull a blank shot the coffee is sometimes boiling and other times just hot (before adding milk). Also, I’m not sure if it’s the Bambino or my grinder (DF54), but espresso shots at coffee shops feel much oilier than what I get at home and I sort of like that texture. 

While my budget is 2000€, but I don’t mind getting something cheaper if it makes sense for my use case. I know HX machines don’t really have stable temps and dual boilers are recommended for this sort of thing, but I’m not sure if I really need one based on how many coffees I make per day, although I would rather upgrade big once than feel the need to upgrade again in a couple of years. 

Another problem I have is the counter space. I have around 60cm of depth available so I prefer having something wider than deeper. I was looking at the SPX and Profitec Move which are 42 and 45cm deep respectively (although there is the power cord to consider, too) and those would probably be the deepest I can afford to go before I run out of any usable space. 

Bonus question - is there any need to upgrade the grinder? Although I would do it later, after the espresso machine. 

Edit: Regarding the heat up time, I only make coffee when I know I’m working from home, so I don’t mind waiting 10-15 minutes for the machine to be ready, but anything over is a big no. ",3,1747027766.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

The cutting-edge co -working space is now not pretty much shared desks and Wi-Fi—it’s a clever, tech-driven surroundings powered by way of the Internet of Things (IoT). As startups, freelancers, and faraway teams increasingly pick co -working over conventional workplaces, operators are integrating IoT answers to beautify person enjoy, streamline operations, and improve strength performance. Let’s discover how IoT is [remodeling ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/4462709743593749063#)the co- working panorama.

**1. Smart Access Control and Security** 

Gone are the times of physical keys and sign-in sheets. IoT-enabled smart locks, biometric scanners, and RFID systems permit individuals to enter coworking spaces with just a telephone or get entry to card. These systems also song access times, making sure safety and accountability.

**2. Intelligent energy management**

 IOT sensors monitor light, heating and cooling systems to customize energy use. For example, when a room is uncontrolled, the lights automatically close, or the temperature settings are adjusted depending on the number of people in temperature. Benefits: Low Energy Bill and a low carbon footprint. 

**3. Real-time desk and room booking** 

Co -worker spaces often struggle with meeting room conflicts or low desks. IOT solutions enable real -time availability of tracking. Members can book desk, conference room, or breakout location through integrated mobile apps with sensor data. Benefits: Efficient space use and better member satisfaction.

**4. environmental monitoring** 

IOT sensors can detect air quality, temperature, humidity and co₂ levels. This data ensures a healthy task environment and allows space managers to make quick adjustments if needed. Benefits: Increased welfare and productivity for users. 

**5. Smart lighting system** 

The adaptive light system responds to natural light levels and occupancy. Not only does it save energy, but it also reduces eye stress and supports better focus during work hours. Benefits: Better rest and workplace aesthetics. 

**6. Future maintenance** 

Connected device can inform managers when devices such as printers, coffee machines, or HVAC units require servicing - before they break up. Benefits: Low service disruption and better operating efficiency.

**7. Executive and speed analytics** 

IOT-operated occupancy sensor gives peer managers real-time insights with the most or minimal use. It helps in planning data layout and plan expansion. Benefits: Data-driven space plan and resource allocation. 

# conclusion 

What does it mean to work in a shared office location that is rapidly defined. For colleague operators, it is a way to provide uninterrupted service, while for users, it creates more responsive, comfortable and efficient work environment.

He has a female friend (34F) that he’s known for a long time. He recently started going to her work regularly. She works as a barista at a bikini coffee stand. He tells me that there’s nothing going on between them and that he’s just stopping by to support her. Honestly, I am feeling uncomfortable with it. 

I know his female friend (34) is very attractive. He has shown me pictures of her. Yes, it may be an insecurity thing from my end. I know she dresses in skimpy outfits for her job. I do trust my boyfriend. He lets me see his phone and who or what he is texting. He’s also open about where he is going and who he is meeting up with. But I think the idea of him going to see his female friend at a bikini barista regularly just feels off to me. He tells me that he just grabs coffee and chats with her. But I’ve caught him smiling at his phone while talking to her and talking to her in a way that feels a little too friendly. He says I’m being paranoid and that I should trust him. I think it’s weird because he goes there without me even when I ask. He just tells me that he will take me next time and then doesn’t. 

I’ve talked to him about how I feel, and he thinks I’m overreacting. He says it’s just a job for her and that it’s no big deal and that he just goes there to support her. I just can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to it. It really bothers me that I’m not invited to with him when he goes there.

I’ve tried to explain that I’m not insecure but that the situation still doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t want to control who he hangs out with or make him feel like he’s doing something wrong. But at the same time I can’t ignore how it makes me feel. Am I just being insecure?

It's always something I've been kinda terrified of doing. I mean, what if they think I'm weird or just... ignore me? But I'd read that pushing through these fears can really help you grow, so I figured, why not give it a try?

So, there I was, nervously sipping my latte and scanning the room for someone who seemed open to a chat. I spotted a young woman who looked about my age, engrossed in a book at the next table. After about ten minutes of internal pep talk, I finally managed to ask her if she liked the book. She looked up, smiled, and said she loved it, and just like that, we were talking about our favorite authors. Honestly, it felt really refreshing to connect with someone out of the blue.

I won't lie, my heart was pounding at first, and I was second-guessing myself the whole time. But the experience taught me that most people are actually pretty open to friendly conversation, especially in a place like a coffee shop where people kinda expect a relaxed vibe. It's crazy how much of a barrier our own fears can be. This little win has definitely motivated me to step outside my comfort zone more often. 😅

But this one guy recently really made me question if I handled things the right way.

  


He came in during a busy rush, already looking annoyed. When I politely asked for his name (standard procedure so we can call out the order), he snapped:

  


“Why do you care? Just make the drink.”

  


Then he walked off without paying me any further attention.

  


I made the drink anyway, but since he refused to give a name, I left it on the counter with the other nameless or mobile orders. I wasn’t about to guess what kind of attitude would come back at me if I yelled out “Angry Dude Who Refused to Give a Name.”

  


About 15 minutes later, when the rush had died down, the guy storms back to the counter looking irritated again. He points to the nameless drink and says:

  


“Is this mine?”

  


I shrugged and said,

  


“I don’t know. It doesn’t have a name on it.”

  


(Which was true—and honestly the same energy he gave me earlier.)

  


He scoffed, picked it up, realized it was cold by now, and threw it in the trash before walking out muttering something about “terrible service.”

  


Now a coworker thinks I could’ve handled it better or tried to confirm it was his drink. But I kind of feel like if you’re rude and refuse to follow basic instructions that help us serve you faster, you don’t get VIP treatment.

  


So… AITA for not giving the guy his coffee when he refused to give his name and came back way later to claim it?

  


TL;DR: Rude customer at Starbucks refused to give his name, so I left his drink on the counter. He came back later, asked if it was his, and I said I didn’t know. He threw it away and left. AITA?

Ok, so, I 43(M) pville, Tx, have been working in the service industry for about 10 or so years now,I have held just about every FOH position you can think of I've been a barback all the way up to Hospitality manager at one point. Now for just a little background on me. I am a no grey area kind of man for the most part, meaning I like knowing what I can and cannot do, firm time limits, and give very very little to no leeway when I am a boss. I can be very blunt, NOT RUDE, but blunt, if you ask me my opinion you better want a truthful response from me because that is what you are going to get, i treat everyone the same, until you come for me that's when my Peppermint Petty comes out and I will make you feel dumb and maybe cry with my vicious rhetoric. Male or Female, I do not care, if you come at me cross I will shut you down with the quickness. yes, it has gotten me in trouble, before, but I don't call anyone ""out they names"" and I don't lie. 

From last june (2024) to Feb (2025) I was working for this Ohio based Company well call it Life Commons (LC) they are apartment complexes but the club house is actually a full restaurant and bar, with a game room and coffee bar as well. the food is actually really good, the restaurant is its own separate entity called, well we will call it EL Cabra. well I was one of the OG hires at the property in my city. During training I went against my better judgement and made a friend with this bitchy girl named Small-ia, we both said something under our breathes about this guy wearing his shirt inside out heard each other and laughed boom instant buds. Well once we opened Small-ia(20 at the time), Oh I Wish I was Barbie (not sure but she looked 40, she will be important later), and Small-ia's ""best friend"" Annoying (20 as well) basically got the same schedules and worked together a lot at first. So became cool with them. 

So I don't know if anyone from there would hear this, i actually hope they do and I hope one of them comment, anyway, like any restaurant you have your complainer, the late one, the dingy one, the asshole, the brat, the ""oh ill quit right now""....every personality in the world. and we were all, all of these things at one point in time. I have to give a little more back story, I promise the main story is very short so I have gotten in trouble here at this place as well for my bluntness and saying what's on my mind. I was never really rude to anybody but one of them and that was, Annoying. Me and her got into it on New Year's Eve She was acting drunk off of one glass of champagne and didn't want to clean the floors and scrub the floors and told her she had to do it because me and Barbie did everything else. She kind of got loud with me. I got loud with hers and she made a comment about the way I look, and of course we've already closed noone in the building, but the workers. I called her an alcoholic and she made a comment about Small-ia being the alcoholic that her best friend, And she had nothing to do with that conversation. She wasn't even there that night. And that was pretty much it. And I think I told her I'm dying for her to quit or something like that and all because I asked her to do the floor is when we close on New Year's Eve. Never told small-ia what her best friend said about her because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. They've had issues in the past where they fought all the time. Was a very drama-filled friendship apparently. When a boss got back from vacation like I don't know 8 Days later she pulled me to the office. Asked me what happened? I told her what happened. Annoying's tory was a little more "" like omg, it  was a joke. and blah blah blah and I told her that wasn't a joke. I didn't take it as a joke and I called an alcoholic. I didn't lie about it. I told her straight up what I said. And was asked to apologize to annoying. I don't know why I did but.... but yeah sure I'll do it.  Barbie and I were mad at each other for a minute because she complained all the time about how money was sucky and the place sucked and it's so slow and she wasnt  making any money. It was really easy to get caught up in her negativity and one day I told her to stop and she didn't like that too much. She got mad at me. I got mad at her. We didn't talk for a couple days but again I apologized and smooth thing over. So yes it sounds like I'm the a\*\*\*\*\*\* in those situations but maybe I was. I don't know but this situation I don't think I was. Okay so the main story one Tuesday night it was unusually busy during happy hour. This place has happy hour from 3:00pm to 7:00 p.m. I was scheduled at 4:00 p.m. when I got there Small-ia was already doing homework. I guess she's taking classes at that point. I don't know. I'm talking to one of our regulars who actually used to live in the property. She doesn't like the regular so she rolled her eyes and said I'm going to go over there and do my homework. And say at the end of the bar. Started doing her homework. Go to the service well and I hear her telling the manager on duty. I'm going to sit right here and do my homework and that's basically pretty much it. It's very a point blank period type of statement. She said it and he said okay as long as you help him as he needs it, again Didn't say anything about it, She never really got in trouble. I don't think for things that she did cuz one sitting at the bar top doing homework is not cool. They hired her when she was 20 as a bartender. Their company policy is 21 and she was never told anything about her attitude. She always had a problem with somebody. Always some guest stalking her after they gave their numbers out to people. There's always something with them even asking me to make their drinks for them because they took too many orders at one time. I couldn't do it things like that but I think that's because her dad actually is a higher up in the construction side of the company. About 5:00 I get slammed. I had the full bar. I was making the server drinks. I was doing everything by myself during that time. During down time I would organize the reach-in and other stuff to keep myself busy and she did jump behind the bar and help me a couple of times but she didn't stay behind the bar very long. She did a couple of drinks and then she went back to do her homework. As soon as happy hour was over and it slowed down. She was done all of a sudden she put her stiff away. She came back behind the bar. I had been busy for 4 hours at this point straight with three, Sorry, told her I'll be right back I'm going to go have a smoke, walk outside and come back cuz I forgot a lighter and she's talking mess about me to a server. Got my lighter went outside. My roommate happened to be there when I get outside so we're sitting there talking about situations going on at home and I'm out there for a little longer than I need to be than I meant to be and that I should have been. It was about 20 minutes, n't as I'm hurrying inside, i cross path with the chef. We're talking and I'm walking. We're walking into the back door and Barbie out of nowhere. Comes out to me and says to me, will you do some effing work? I said what? She said she's out there drowning and I have to come down and help her and you're not doing anything. I said f that she hasn't done anything all day long. She'd be doing her homework all day. She should be fine for 20 minutes. The chef steps in and tells Barbie hey she hadn't done anything all night long. I was just taking a break for a second. That was the end of that. I walked into the walk-in real quick to grab something as I'm walking out through the kitchen back to the bar I am immediately met by Small-ia who had my things in her hands, She literally shoved them in my chest and told me I can go home, I said whatever and just brush past her. I didn't push her. I didn't put my hands on her. It just brushed past her. I'm assuming at this point Barbie went out the door and as soon as she walked outside she probably said something to her about what I said. As I'm working on a drink for a server Small-ia gathers her things up walks past me says f you, Jacob and walks out doesn't close out any of her tickets. Doesn't tell me what's going on behind the bar just leaves just goes home for the rest of the night. Night goes on fine, later Barbie and another girl come downstairs and I go. You don't have to stay, A manager asked them to stay and help me clean. I don't need y'all to say I can do it by myself. Not a big deal. We're not busy anymore. They said they weren't playing on it anyway. Said fine. They left night ended. I closed on the bar by myself. Actually faster than two of us do. For some reason, The manager earlier had come and got her tickets from behind the bar and told me we had to have him conversation later. I said fine and then after I close I left and I'm not thinking about it. He calls I turn around go back to talk to him. He tells me what happens. He tells me I'm fired and I said wait. She pushed me. She quit and he says she doesn't work here anymore either fine. We argue for a second. I leave, the next day I call my manager my actual manager she asked me to tell her what happened and not to lie and I told her I wouldn't lied to her and never have, I actually respected this manager and I told her that often she was young and she was one of the most mature people I've ever met in my life and I loved working for her. So I told her what happened Small-ia told her that I pushed her and that's why she left. My manager told me that what I say happened More in aligns with what the video caught the cameras so they watched it. Apparently a ton of people saw,  so I asked her if I was fired. They said they didn't know and they would have to find out fine. Next day I'm officially fired. Try to figure out what's going on and why. How that's fair she quit. She pushed me like literally I mean assaulted me. I wanted to be Petty. I could have pressed charges on her. Literally it was a shove she pushed me. Cusses me out well. Basically In front of guests loudly, and  I got fired. Not fair. Whatever fine. I thought she quit. Go get some stuff online the next day and it turns out they like to have her job back. A few weeks after I finally gets home from HR on the phone and they told me that it wasn't because of what happened with Small-ia it was because Barbie told them I was aggressive with her and I told her Fu when that's not what I said told. That's not what I said but they upheld the decision to let me go and now since then I've been evicted, hospitalized for a week. I can't find a job. I've tried so many places. Funny thing is if I do what they said I did, AND I was the aggressor. Tell me why they approved unemployment so obviously I didn't do anything wrong cuz they approved my unemployment I thought they they would deny it. So I applied late. So that's what I get for making friends at work. So someone please tell me in this stitch in this situation. Was I in the wrong? Because it doesn't seem fair that I lost my job.  I was only written up once for being late and that was totally my fault. I was really really late but I still ended up showing up a word but I was the only one ever written up for being late and that's only they've ever been written up for. Usually I was about 30 minutes an hour early every shift. I was a good employee ,I was one of the best bartenders they had not the best but one of the best and I liked it there. It really did it hurt when I got fired. But these girls have gotten systematically except for one guy, gotten every guy fired, the second they're a little inconvenienced. They call our manager and tell their sad side of the story and then that's what she believes. and then somebody else gets in trouble. But it's always somebody else, never them. For example, and this is all three of them. All three of them have at some point in time given their numbers or their email address or something to a patron. Usually it's a guy well not usually. It is always a guy and when those guys start bringing them gifts and calling them and stalking them on their Instagrams they start coming to see them at work. All the sudden they don't want to serve them anymore. They don't want to make their drinks because they're creeped out by them, but they're the ones who gave them their numbers . One of them has a boyfriend and she likes to hide things from but you know whatever anyway so they've always asked me. Can you make this drink for that person? I'm not serving them because of this or whatever. All three of them did it have done it and if you tell them no they get mad and it's a whole thing so that's just kind of how they work how they are. So they give you a little bit of an idea of what kind of girls these are.",2,1747026765.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

On Isabella Bennett's birthday, she waited all night. But Dominic Hinton never returned.  
  
His first love Chloe Winslow was marrying the infamous playboy in their circle today.  
  
He couldn't bare her ruin her life and rush off to stop the wedding.  
  
With swollen eyes, she sat alone in the living room all night. By morning, she received a call from an unfamiliar number.  
  
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""  
  
Hearing that nonchalant tone, Isabella instantly pictured the man of cynicism. The very playboy Dominic's precious Chloe was supposed to marry.  
  
""Lucas Montgomery?""  
  
""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" Lucas laughed with mischief. ""So I'm here to steal his. Fair's fair, right?""  
  
Isabella fell silent for a moment, then shook her head slightly. ""Seems fair enough.""  
  
On the other end, Lucas arched an eyebrow and said confidently.  
  
""Perfect. I'll arrange another wedding in fifteen days. Get yourself a dress and wait for me to marry you.""  
  
Then the line went dead.  
  
Isabella stared at the cold dinner spread across the table, tears suddenly welling in her eyes.  
  
She never imagined that after all these years of waiting, she'd finally received a proposal.  
  
But the proposal wasn't from Dominic. The groom wasn't Dominic.  
  
And the man she'd be marrying wasn't Dominic either.  
  
...  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.  
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.  
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.  
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.  
  
""Who the fuck are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.  
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.  
  
He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.  
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The trash truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless shit.”  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who the hell gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through trash.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.  
  
“The trash truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.  
  
“It was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.”  
  
Isabella’s breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.  
  
That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.  
  
No wonder he was so desperate.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The tension inside the car thickened into silence.  
  
Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.  
  
""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""  
  
These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.  
  
The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.  
  
And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn’t meant anything legally for years—was because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.  
  
The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.  
  
She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.  
  
""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""  
  
Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. “Lucas found someone new? Who told you that?”  
  
Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.  
  
But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.  
  
The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.  
  
""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I’m gonna die in there! What should I do?""  
  
""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.  
  
He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""  
  
Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.  
  
She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.  
  
After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.  
  
The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of trash under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.  
  
Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.  
  
After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.  
  
Then the housekeeper called.  
  
""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must’ve slipped there while he was sleeping.”  
  
Isabella let out a bitter laugh.  
  
How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?  
  
And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.  
  
Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.  
  
Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.  
  
She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.  
  
Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.  
  
Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.  
  
""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""  
  
Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.  
  
The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.  
  
The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.  
  
""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees—was now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.  
  
Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.  
  
Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella’s chest, leaving her gasping for air.  
  
The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.  
  
The room wasn’t fully shut. Isabella could hear Chloe's sobs from inside.  
  
""Dominic, you're so stupid. I left you alone and go to France. You should hate me. Why crash my wedding? Why the hell would you take the punishment for me?”  
  
Dominic lay on the hospital bed, his voice weak but filled with tenderness.  
  
“I did hate you, right after you left. But as time passed, I was just... grateful.""  
  
""I love you, and I didn’t want you living in my shitty studio apartment, eating nothing but bread and pickles, working part-time jobs till you passed out from low blood sugar... You made the right choice.""  
  
Hearing his explanation, Chloe sobbed harder. Then she threw herself into his arms.  
  
""So you've forgiven me, right? You crashed the wedding because you still love me, right? My parents said if you took my punishment, you'd have to agree to marry me. You said yes, didn’t you?""  
  
Each desperate question hit Isabella like a sledgehammer, leaving her numb from head to toe.  
  
Dominic agreed to marry Chloe?  
  
Then she saw him nod. That was the final crack that shattered what was left of her already ruined heart.  
  
The phone slipped from her hand, clattering on the floor.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, Isabella picked up her phone and turned to leave.  
  
But just as she reached the stairwell, Chloe caught up and grabbed her arm.  
  
""Isabella,"" Chloe smirked, ""I know you saw everything. Dominic never forgot me. You spent seven years suffering with him. But I set up one little trap, and he came running to crash my wedding.""  
  
""Dominic’s never stopped loving me. You really thought you could win against me?”  
  
In that moment, Isabella finally understood—marrying Lucas had been Chloe's strategy all along.  
  
All to lure Dominic into crashing the wedding.  
  
Chloe's parents were probably in on it too, using the punishment to force Dominic to agree to marry her.  
  
Now that Dominic had power and status again, of course they wanted the engagement back.  
  
The realization made Isabella laugh bitterly.  
  
""He loves you so much. And you still played him like that. Doesn't that make you a little bit ashamed?""  
  
Hearing her words, Chloe's face twisted into an expression of disbelief.  
  
“Played him? What exactly did I ‘play’? Whether it was crashing the wedding, taking my punishment, or agreeing to marry me—I never forced him to do anything.""  
  
""He did it all willingly! He loves me enough to sacrifice everything. That's something you'll never have, sweetie.""  
  
Every word hit Isabella like a slap across the face.  
  
She couldn’t even deny it. Because Chloe was right.  
  
“Yes, he made his choice. And I respect it. Don't worry, I'm stepping aside. You two enjoy yourselves.”

1kkkg9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1kkkg9b/long_rant_toxic_work_environment_feels_like_bad/,LONG RANT: Toxic Work Environment Feels Like Bad Relationships,"It feels like I’ve been stuck in a cycle of emotional abuse disguised as professionalism. These workplaces weren’t just stressful... they were destabilizing. They broke down my trust, isolated me, and made me question my worth. It’s like being in a toxic relationship where every small success is invalidated, every mistake is magnified, and your efforts to seek fairness are twisted against you. I had to constantly defend myself, prove my worth, and protect my mental health in environments where others were protected no matter how harmful they were. I felt alone, betrayed, and deeply disrespected. These experiences triggered old wounds. The anxiety, depression, binge eating, and self-doubt that I had worked so hard to heal. And now I’m left processing everything, trying to make sense of how workplaces that are supposed to be professional can be so damaging, and how easily people in power can fail to protect those who speak up. And even though I’ve left those places, the hurt hasn’t left me.

—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since graduating college, I’ve had a few jobs, and I thought things would improve moving from retail into office roles. Retail had its issues. The typical petty gossip and cliques, but I never expected the deep toxicity I experienced in the office world. It felt calculated, political, and cruel.

At my first post-college job, I worked in a shelter and faced constant disrespect and subtle sabotage. There were backhanded compliments, people muttering things under their breath — even threats like someone saying they wanted to hurt me from someone in leadership. I reported that to HR, but their response was to tell me not to take it personally. Meanwhile, I recently learned someone else - a junior coworker -  got fired for a comment said out of frustration. So why was a direct threat towards me ignored? Because the person who said it was a manager and had strong ties to the VP. That’s when I realized connections mattered more than safety or integrity.

At one point, another manager made disgusting and completely false comments accusing me of sleeping with male coworkers and even clients. I reported this to both HR and my supervisor, expecting at least a basic level of accountability. My supervisor had a separate discussion with the CEO and HR as well. But nothing was done on their end. Nothing. No follow-up, no investigation, no consequences. It was a brutal reminder that my dignity meant nothing to them.

Next was the exterminator incident… I found out the hotel manager was illegally exterminating rooms in the shelter. Another staff member and I found this out, and we collected the necessary evidence. We took pictures of the equipment, and had statements from the workers when we spotted them (they said they were not certified and proceeded to try to hide and run away after we made the discovery). I reported it to my supervisor, the PD, and she told me to write an email with the evidence to the VP as we had issues previously with the same hotel manager making decisions without the PD knowing. After the VP read it, the VP … blew up for the lack of a better phrase. He was notably upset, and he told me to “know my place”. He proceeded to curse at my supervisor about me on the phone - which I could hear as he was *screaming* (it was off speaker)- while she was trying to calm him down to go over the evidence. Another coworker who worked near the VP’s office said that he could hear the VP screaming and saying my name, and asked if I was okay. This wasn’t necessarily the final straw for me, but I was shocked to say the least because I did not expect that reaction. I wasn’t trying to overstep - I was trying to protect people and do the right thing. I didn’t like that he didn’t try to have a conversation with me for what I did wrong, and he never did afterwards either. How can he expect me to understand “my place” if I do not know what he means by that?

Next, which might have caused me to rethink everything, was witnessing the only supervisor who supported me get fired. Not because she failed at her job, but because she *dared* to hold others accountable. She took DHS regulations seriously, addressed serious concerns like unmet client needs, lack of safety drills, racial misconduct, and overall neglect, and for that, she was labeled ‘too much.’ Leadership dismissed her efforts as bad leadership simply because others refused to listen to her. Funnily enough, the leadership under her openly mocked her age, refused to follow through on the tasks as stated in their job description, and then weaponized their resistance against her. She was scapegoated for their failures, and that shook me to my core. It confirmed that doing the right thing doesn’t protect you in toxic systems… it makes you a target.

The supervisor who replaced her came in already biased. On her very first day, she told me she didn’t want to hear anything about what happened before, which made me feel like I was the problem, even though I had already documented everything with HR. From there, it only got worse. She constantly accused me of not doing things I had proof I did — I logged everything, took pictures — and she’d still claim things were missing. We shared an office, and she would just stare at me while I worked. It was suffocating. Every little thing I did was scrutinized. I couldn’t relax, couldn’t trust anyone.

Next, one particular coworker, let's call her Stephanie, belittled my achievements, told me not to let success “get to my head” because they’d been there longer and the clients loved *them* more. After a Halloween party, Stephanie (who had been drinking while working- I found this out later) cornered me, yelled at me in front of another coworker I was close with because she thought I was getting **too close** to that coworker, even though she *herself* had obvious favorites and hung out with her department’s manager after work. I cried so hard that night. It wasn’t just her; it was everything - the unfairness, the feeling of being ganged up on, and losing the only supervisor who supported me.

I eventually broke down crying at work, completely overwhelmed. I took a couple of days off just to breathe. When I came back, my supervisor asked what had happened because that same coworker came to her to get to the story first, and when I told her, she said I needed to ‘handle it myself’ because our stories did not match. That was my breaking point. I started applying to other jobs and got out.

I took a new job as a case manager at another shelter - something finally related to my major - and I tried to go in with hope. I was nervous but wanted a fresh start. I shared an office with a coworker, let’s call her Ms. Heller. At first, she seemed kind. I trusted her. But I  found out she was gossiping about me, making comments about my appearance, going through my personal belongings, and even stole money from my bag (WAY TOO LATE).  She also often made racist comments, saying Black people were more loyal and hardworking than Latinos. I’m Latina. And while part of me tried to dismiss it as ‘her age’ or she was wayyyyy to influenced by the current political climate *cough* (I forgot to add, but in both shelters I worked at, I overheard or was directly told racist remarks about Latinos. Comments clearly influenced by what was being said on the news and in the media.) She also liked to say that the supervisor only liked my work because I was latina, as was my supervisor. And it stung every time. Then, while doing my rounds, I overheard another coworker express shock to the VP that he had hired ‘my kind.’ I’ll never forget how he looked at me and quickly tried to cover it up by saying ‘we love all people.’ I was desperate to keep my head down, hold onto my job, and start fresh in my career… so I didn’t say anything. And that silence still weighs on me. Because the truth is, I didn’t feel safe. Not emotionally, not professionally. I felt like a target in a place that claimed to serve vulnerable people but did nothing to protect its own staff from racism, slander, or abuse.

My supervisor confided in me that she and the VP wanted to let Ms. Heller go because she was not meeting her numbers,, and in a moment of compassion (and honestly, desperation to hold onto the only support I thought I had), I warned Ms. Heller and I offered to help her with her cases to prove them wrong - her numbers were admittedly low and she had clients she did not meet with for 3 months. She turned around and told everyone what I said.

Leadership backpedaled and blamed me for ‘gossiping.’ I was shocked! I hadn’t been malicious, I was trying to help someone I cared about despite everything. But of course, the VP and supervisor protected each other and scapegoated me. From then on, people looked at me differently. Comments started - about me being lazy, not doing my job - even though I had the best case numbers. Meanwhile, others were faking theirs, and it was so bad we were getting cited by regulators. But my hard work didn’t matter. I left after only three weeks. I couldn’t stay in a place where I was being emotionally destroyed again.

Now I work remotely in a completely different field. I’ve learned to stay to myself. I do my job, keep my head down. But something changed. Even though I tried to keep my walls up, I met some amazing coworkers—women my age who had also come from difficult workplaces but still had stars in their eyes and were excited to do the work. At first, I kept my distance, but they slowly chipped away at my guard. And I’m so glad they did. We genuinely support one another. They’ve never said anything cruel to me or about me. It’s been a complete 180 from what I went through before.

For the first time in a long time, I feel seen with them. We grab coffee and lunch before or after meetings. I know coworkers aren’t always friends, and I try to keep boundaries now. But I’m naturally friendly, and this has been a casual, healthy connection.

Still, something shifted recently. When I go in for staff meetings, I feel watched again. The current supervisor makes snide comments about how close I am with the other younger women I trained with, like our friendship is somehow threatening. It’s subtle, but it lingers. And it’s enough to make me want to shrink back into myself, to disappear again. 

She’s also been incredibly petty with the language she uses. She makes subtle digs to put our work down, and constantly reminds us that she 'never got proper training' when she was in our shoes (she has been in this field for 20 years) - as if that excuses her reluctance to help others learn or expect others to know the protocol. She carries an attitude, a bitterness that leaks into every interaction. And this time, it’s not just me noticing it. Other staff have complained too, and some good staff members have left. She has chipped away at this little group I found genuine connection with.

It’s exhausting. Even when I’m doing better, even when I’ve found support and regained some confidence, there’s always someone in leadership who seems committed to making others feel small.

My mom and brother tell me this is just the real world, that this is how work is… but it’s *not* okay. I’ve been reflecting on all of it lately because it all happened so fast, one after another, and I’m only now able to *feel* it. I’m still angry. I know people think I’m being too sensitive, but these experiences really affected me. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for years. I was on medication before and finally got to a point where I felt okay without it. But after these experiences, all the symptoms have returned. I’m binge eating again, overthinking everything, doubting whether I’m good enough or if I belong anywhere. My sleep is awful. I dread waking up. I feel like I’m constantly bracing for impact. All of it reminds me of being in an abusive relationship — the love-bombing, the betrayal, the gaslighting, the isolation, the trauma. Except this time, it wasn’t one person. It was entire workplaces. It was systems. And I’m tired of pretending it didn’t hurt.

PS: I’m not the best writer, so I used AI to help me organize my thoughts.

My first-ever job was at a sandwich shop when I was 16. That’s where I met a girl — let’s call her “G” . We were coworkers, and over time, we fell for each other and started dating. After about a year together, we broke up. This was back in 2019, just before the pandemic.

We stayed together until the end of 2020. After the breakup, we completely lost contact. We didn’t talk or see each other — we both had time to grow and figure ourselves out.

Then, in July of 2024, G reached out again. She’d gotten into an argument with her dad and was wondering if things like that had affected our past relationship. I told her no — the truth was, our relationship ended because I (24M) didn’t put in the effort it takes to make something real last. That part was on me.

We started hanging out again — first that week, then the next, and the week after that. Eventually, I told her I still liked her. She agreed to see where things might go and to talk things out. But after about two weeks, she ended things again. I accepted it and tried to move on.

Fast forward to January: I was at a coffee shop when she texted me asking if I wanted to go rollerskating. I said yes. After skating, we sat in the car and talked. She said she was open to giving things another shot — and so we did.

The first three months felt amazing. I was falling for her again, deeply. At one point, I asked if she was open to being in a relationship. She told me that relationships take a lot of work and she wasn’t really open to one. I asked again — three times in total — and got the same answer every time.

And now… here we are.

We had the “honeymoon phase” — the sweet stuff: kissing, hanging out, feeling connected. But now I only see her maybe once a week. We barely text. We barely call. We barely do anything together.

Call me delusional. Maybe I’ve been influenced by social media or just have unrealistic expectations. But I don’t feel seen. I don’t feel cared for. I don’t feel like I’m even in a relationship. It just feels like casual conversation with someone I used to know more deeply.

I’ve told her I’d like to see her more — at least three times a week. I get it, we both work. But I genuinely believe that when someone matters to you, you make time. Saying you’re busy every single day just doesn’t seem realistic — people make time for the ones they care about.

But every time I think that, her words — “a relationship takes a lot of work” — ring loudly in the back of my head and stop me from saying anything more.

And if I’m being really honest, a big part of this might be about me not wanting to be alone. I know people say, “Love yourself first,” or, “Be okay by yourself,” and I get it. I’ve done that for years. But honestly? That feeling still sucks. Being alone sucks. And that’s something I rarely admit out loud.

We even have a trip to the beach coming up this weekend — just the two of us, for three days.

I’m scared to bring any of this up and ruin the vibe, but the way I feel right now is hard to keep pushing down.

I care about her, but I’m unsure how to bring this up without overwhelming her or pushing her away.",1,1747026104.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

The roast is highly inconsistent. This is from a single 14gm scoop from the bag.

Now I understand it’s a blend of two lots and typically the roast profiles to bring out the best from each would vary. Especially when one is clean washed and the other is anaerobic black honey which is borderline experimental. 

What I’ve highlighted are the extremities in the scoop but even otherwise it’s inconsistent beyond the point where you can give benefit of doubt for it being a blend. 

I definitely wouldn’t call this a medium roast by any measure and would stick to classifying it strictly as Medium Dark or even Dark. 


But the taste in the cup is what matters, isn’t it?

These beans and the roaster Savorworks were well regarded in few posts I’d seen on this sub.

So..I got to brewing. 

Technicals (Skip if not interested)
——————
Espresso
14g in 28g out 
92 degrees Celsius 
10s Pre-infusion + 15s Extraction @ 8-9 BARs ramped down to 6 BARs for the last few grams.
Puck saturates at 8-9s

Grind: DF64v @ 11.5 | Slow-fed @ 800RPM (For a consistent particle size distribution) | Blind Shaken
——————-


Taste in the Cup:

Drink Composition | 28ml of Espresso + 180ml of steamed milk added

My pack came with the older tasting notes of orange marmalade, strawberry, toffee etc and to be frank, (despite the subjectivity involved in individual palettes) I didn’t find it anywhere close to it. The updated taste notes were a much better representation of what this coffee offers. The dominant note is definitely Jaggery with a clear lasting bitter end (Probably why they claim Dark Chocolate)

Taste notes aside, the cup falls a bit flat personally. Even the sweetness is not a gentle aromatic sweetness you expect from a good medium roast with complex subtle notes but is actually more of a deep cloying sweetness (think jaggery) that masks any other underlying flavours until the bitter end hits you. There’s not much else to this coffee tbh. Other extraction mediums may have better success that I can’t comment on.

Now extraction science does have solutions to tweak the grind to achieve the cup you want but it becomes more challenging here due to the roast inconsistency. Since they extract at different rates. I will, however, try a turbo next to see if the taste profile changes. 

I do hope this was a one-off QC slip or else I would recommend renaming this blend to Mrs.Bean - comical, clumsy and has nothing much to say to your palette.

TLDR;
Roast very inconsistent even for a Blend
One Dimensional cloying sweetness with a bitter end

1kkkbju,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1kkkbju/just_got_hired/,just got hired,"okay so to give you the time line all within the last four days i’ve been interviewed twice hired and had my first day today. 

going in today was just weird??? 
when i got there initially i was practically immediately told that i would just be watching today (no big deal i’ve worked at other coffee and restaurant this seemed normal) i was then very quickly run through the shop and then was explained that i was never allowed to out loud say that i was going to the bathroom, i had to say i was “going to the office” because of a customer heard me say that it was gross…? everyone goes to the bathroom but i was kinda just thinking okay a little strange still nothing weird. further into my shift i was being quizzed on the drinks? again haven’t been taught anything up to that point. and the people around me also training knew everything so i was thinking maybe they were just die hard dutch bros fans. then when they were explaining how to act at a drive through i was told to either have my hands behind my back or holding the ipad never in front of me unless holding the ipad because it told customers off the bat that “we don’t want them to talk to us”
we then get to pouring shots where we were showed once what to do and then had to do it in front of the whole store. afterwards they wanted everyone working to point out what i did wrong (even the trainees) all with a giant smile on their face was very strange…having something backhanded said to you about something very minor (i got water on the counter) with a giant smile…anyways all of that was extremely unsettling to me between being asked over and over again about drinks that i made my trainer aware that i had no knowledge of but then they’d ask anyways and then go “can anyone help him out!” very loudly to the whole store. to the very end the last hour when i was told i’d be taking a test over “everything” when i asked what the test was about bc i was not taught drink recipes just asked them repeatedly. i was told there was a bunch of online courses i was supposed to have done. i very politely apologized and said i was unsure what he was talking about he got very VISIBLY upset with me saying i should’ve already had everything done and memorized…in four days.


he eventually set me up with an online portal and showed me what i needed to do. when i was then told that he wanted me to go home tonight learn everything and come back tomorrow and take the test. i was not scheduled for training tomorrow so when i said “you mean tuesday?” he got mad again telling me i had open availability and needed to be there which i pushed back on immediately. i was hired on as part time and if i went in tomorrow and did the test AND a whole training shift like they wanted id be WAY over PT hours and not have a single day off this week. i just said i already had received my training schedule and had made plans for that day after they INSISTED i come in today to train on mother’s day. 

after that he told me that was fine but that id be expected to be ready for the test tuesday….
so i have 24 hours to learn the entire menu and how to make the drinks without ever actually making one.


was also told failure to pass would lead to termination. 


is this normal!? there’s literally no way to learn over 20 drinks and the 5 different ways to make them in 24 hours?? 

i also found out from my other peeps training with me that they’ve had access to the training courses for over a week. 



just remembered also that i was told to “learn peoples facial expressions” at the drive through so that if they’re having a bad day we can ask about it and see if it has grounds for a “free bad day drink” i get asking someone about their day but being told to learn facial expressions? i mean what the actual fuck🤣



tldr crazy cult vibes nobody there was even close to my age (early 20s) im supposed to be a genius and learn the whole menu and how to make it in 24 hours IS THIS NORMAL??

1kkkbhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkkbhw/aitah_for_hating_my_girlfriends_friend/,AITAH for hating my girlfriends “friend”,"Okay so Me (20enby) and my girlfriend lets caller her Anna (19f) have been dating for a little over 2 months, i really like her and we do have awkward moments a lot still but i’m fine with it cause she’s so nice to be around. the problem is tho, her friend lets caller her Miley. I don’t know how old she is exactly but i think she’s about 24? So Anna has a brother Kyle (24m?) and he’s dating Miley and has been for a couple years at least, Anna also has her best friend Haley (19f) and Haley and Miley are sisters, you following? They’re all in a friend group together along with Haley’s boyfriend Mike (22m). 

Okay now that we have all the characters sorted out we can begin. So before me and Anna had even been dating for a month she invited me over to Miley and Kyle’s apartment to smoke, and i was nervous but thought that smoking would make it easier to get to know everyone so i accepted. I got there and I was introduced to everyone, Miley, Haley and another girl Sarah. So off the bat i get ignored by everyone but they had all been smoking so i didn’t worry about it. Later that night we’re all sitting on the couch and Anna leaves to get a snack or something and i’m left all alone on the couch with people i don’t know and who refuse to include me in any of the conversations they’re having or even acknowledge my presence let alone try to get to know me. Now my social anxiety is going crazy and my smoking paranoia isn’t helping, but i know i’m not imagining things because Miley and Haley are laughing and joking and Sarah joins in and i’m just sitting there with my heart beating out of my chest and their laughter stops after awhile and it’s dead quiet for at least 20 seconds before Sarah finally acknowledges my presence and starts asking me questions about myself. Meanwhile Miley and Haley are just blank staring at me and exchanging glances and still not saying a word to me the whole night. I’m so confused like they wanted me to come over, they asked Anna to invite me over, they’re constantly asking Anna if i wanted to hangout with all of them, so why are they acting so rude?

That’s just one of many instances where i get completely ignored the entire time, and on top of that, I don’t know if she’s just too into a conversation or what, but Anna completely ignores anything i say when we’re all hanging out with them too, which isn’t okay cause i don’t know any of these people, she’s the one person i know and she’s also ignoring me. 

So Anna is very much a push over (so am I but she’s way more than me) which isn’t a bad thing I see it as more of a she cares so much about people she’d do anything she can for the people she cares about, so much so that she inconveniences herself. She is also a very insecure and self conscious person (so am i so i get it). This is important to the story that’s why i’m mentioning it. This is why I wasn’t surprised when I found out Anna had asked Miley after they had been smoking together one night if she thought I even liked her. The way I found out tho is the real problem and why i made this whole post.

So another day i went over to Miley and Kyle’s apartment to smoke with all of them (Anna, Miley, Kyle, Haley, Mike) and it’s like maybe my 3rd time meeting them but we were sat on the couch and Anna was around the corner petting the cats when Miley came over and kneeled in front of the coffee table and asked me “So Anna wanted me to ask you, Do you even like her?” mind you this is in front of everyone i listed… we were all sat on the couch and she just asked that in front of everyone. I’m starting to have a fucking panic attack fr but i’m trying to be chill, so I just tell the truth “I wouldn’t be dating her if i didn’t ljke her” and Anna comes back around the corner saying “No No Miley what No” or something like that i was freaking out too much to hear. I do not think Anna is the type of person to ask Miley to ask me if I even like her… because like i said Anna would never do anything that would make someone else uncomfortable and she’s very non confrontational. Miley on the other hand clearly fucking is.

I think Anna was insecure and asked Miley if she thought i even liked her because let’s face it we all get insecure and especially in new relationships. I’m also not an affectionate person, Im not a big fan of physical contact and I especially hate pda it makes me mad uncomfortable and Anna knows this. I don’t know if she felt insecure cause i don’t initiate physical contact enough and she just got in her head or what, but i did bring this up to her a couple days later and we talked about it. I just have come to realize that this bothers me a lot more than i was trying to let it and now it’s eating at me. I don’t want to be around Miley and i don’t think Anna should be around her either cause she’s a bad friend for making Annas insecurity a topic of discussion in front of her partner and all her friends.

I actually have a lot more to say on this but i feel like this is enough info for now, but aitah for wanting Anna to not be friends with Miley and absolutely hating Miley’s guts?

1kkkab3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1kkkab3/chapter_seven_mentor_and_friend/,Chapter Seven: Mentor and Friend,"*From ""The Bad Student Liked by the Dean of Student Affairs""*

It was pouring outside in the morning. Cars clogged the streets as people rushed to work and school.

Sitting in the car, I watched the drenched crowd through the window, puzzled why no one used their umbrellas even though they were clearly strapped to their backpacks...

The car slowly stopped in front of the school gate. Mr. Bai stepped out with an umbrella, carefully opening the car door.

""Morning, Baifeng\~""

The one opening the door wasn’t Mr. Bai, but Zhang Yingfang with his black umbrella.

""Good morning, Director.""

Mr. Bai greeted him politely with a gentle smile on his face.

""I'll hold the umbrella for him. No need for you to get wet, Mr. Bai.""

""Thank you for your concern, Director! I’ll leave the young master in your care!""

With that, Mr. Bai returned to the car and drove off.

Zhang Yingfang held the umbrella with one hand and rested the other on my shoulder. His expression was unusually serious, showing no sign of his usual smile.

He didn’t loosen his grip even after we passed the school gate. Instead, he picked up the pace and led me quickly toward the Student Affairs Office.

""Director! Where are we going?""

""You're staying in the Student Affairs Office today. It's dangerous outside!""

I couldn’t make sense of what he meant. It was just a rainy day—was there really a need to rush like this?

""Director! What are we doing at the Student Affairs Office?""

Zhang Yingfang shook the umbrella, flicking the water off his knees, and stared at me with a blank expression.

""Do you know why it’s pouring like this today? And why it came so suddenly, without a forecast?""

He was right. This storm rivaled a typhoon, yet the weather bureau hadn’t said a thing. There hadn’t even been any air currents to indicate a front.

Zhang Yingfang gently pushed open the door to the office—same scene, same black-and-white decor. The only difference was a new painting on the wall. Oddly enough, it was the same one I lost yesterday.

But now wasn’t the time to be happy. If Zhang Yingfang dragged me here, it had to be important.

""Baifeng, do you know shadows can travel through rainwater?""

His words sounded like a warning: *Step outside, and the shadows will kill you.* The rain had become my prison, limiting my movements for the day.

""So stay here in the office. Don’t go anywhere.""

Spend the whole day in the office? Should I be happy or sad? No classes sounded nice, but being confined to one room wasn’t.

Sighing, I flopped down on the sofa and fiddled with the strange bottle, curious about its contents.

Curiosity killed the cat, as they say. Bored out of my mind, I opened the bottle and took a lick. It wasn’t holy water, nor any kind of herbal exorcist concoction. It was blood—from some unknown creature. I hurriedly capped it and stared out the window, pretending nothing happened.

Honestly... the office was boring! Zhang Yingfang was swamped with paperwork and had no time for me. If I disturbed him, he’d probably get mad.

Left to my own devices, I wandered the office like a tourist.

Eventually, I ended up by the window, watching the thunderstorm rage above, wondering when it would stop.

Idly looking down, I froze. The twelve shadows were lined up neatly below, staring up at the office, eyes locked onto me.

Suddenly! One shadow lunged at the window, pounding it violently.

Caught off guard, I fell backward, crawling away in panic.

Zhang Yingfang rushed to the window, yanking the curtain shut, then turned to my pale, shaken face.

""Director... can the shadows break in?""

""No. This is the safest place in the school.""

Even with the curtain closed, the pounding continued, as if the glass might shatter any second.

Zhang Yingfang helped me back to the sofa. My legs trembled uncontrollably...

I wasn’t sure if it was fear or the fall, but my body felt exhausted. My vision blurred. At some point, the pounding stopped, leaving only the sound of typing...

Then the keyboard fell silent. I sat up cautiously, hand on my bayonet, ready for anything.

A quick scan of the office revealed nothing unusual. Zhang Yingfang was gone, the outside now calm and sunny, the shadows nowhere in sight.

I noticed a note on the coffee table:

*""I'm patrolling the high school wing! If I’m not back by the end of the day, feel free to leave. Don’t worry—it’s safe now.""*

Beside the note was another bottle, identical to the one in my pocket. I reached into my jacket to compare them...

""Are you wondering why Zhang Yingfang keeps giving you bottles of blood?""

Startled, I looked around. No one in sight.

Time to get out of here. Fast.

I glanced at the clock—only a minute to dismissal. I shoved open the office door and made my way toward the school gate.

Outside, everything was peaceful. No chasing shadows. No storm. No creepy footsteps. But something felt... off.

I called Mr. Bai, telling him I wouldn’t be home for dinner and to inform my father.

Wandering aimlessly along the sidewalk, I admired the sunset.

Since I wasn’t going home, what should I eat?

My feet led me to a steakhouse. Naturally, I walked in.

""One filet mignon, medium rare.""

""Certainly! Please wait a moment.""

I sat in the farthest corner, dining alone...

""Excuse me! Mind if I join you?""

""So many empty seats and you pick this one?""

""C’mon, look up at me, Baifeng\~""

I looked up and was surprised—it was Mr. Li Ersen.

""Teacher? What are you doing here?""

""If you can eat here, why can’t I?""

Wow—the eldest son of the Li family dining at a roadside steakhouse. How rare.

Without even glancing at the menu, he placed an order.

""Two filet mignons, please!""

Two?! Same as me?

""Same doneness for both?""

The server smiled and nodded before I could respond. I was speechless.

""Hey! Why are you copying me?""

""It’s called *fate*\~""

""Who wants fate with you?!""

The server signaled me to stop. Her hands shook as she held the notepad.

""Don’t worry, Kai. I know Baifeng.""

She let out a huge sigh, as if escaping a death sentence.

""What’s with that face, Baifeng? Surprised by my answer?""

""Obviously! Who talks to a server like that?""

""This place belongs to the Li family. Of course they know me.""

""Alright, alright. Kai, you can go. I’d like to spend time with Baifeng\~""

Unbelievable. This steakhouse belonged to him? Then why work at school, taking crap from students? Isn’t that exhausting?

I gracefully cut into the steak, eating in small bites.

""Baifeng... are you free later?""

What now? Last time he randomly dragged me to a movie. What nonsense this time?

""What for?""

""I want to go to the night market... but I need company...""

Seriously? A grown man still goes to night markets? My time is precious, not for silly games.

I was about to refuse when his sapphire-blue eyes sparkled with innocence, short-circuiting my brain.

""Sure... I guess.""

What kind of answer was that?! Now I look desperate, like I’m into him or something.

""Yay!""

Li Ersen beamed like a child. His golden hair swayed with his smile, those gleaming gemstone eyes dazzling.

After paying, we stepped outside. I looked around, curious about what kind of car he drove to work.

""Where’s your car, Teacher?""

""Right here.""

He pointed to a flashy red motorcycle, spinning his keys proudly.

""You’re kidding. You ride a motorcycle?""

""Hey, this baby is expensive! Costs over 600,000 NT!""

Seriously? So rich, yet chooses a bike over a proper car. Can’t even drive on highways. Makes no sense.

But it was his choice, so I kept quiet.

""Hop on!""

I grabbed the helmet and climbed on awkwardly.

""Hey! I’m not even on yet\~ How am I supposed to mount it like this?""

I slipped off with an awkward smile. Once he was on, I tried again, contorting my body to fit the foot pegs.

""Hold on\~""

He revved up and hit 80 km/h in no time. I clung to his coat, the wind almost blowing me off.

Then—a curve!

Li Ersen leaned sharply. His knee nearly scraped the ground. I shut my eyes, clutching him tightly.

""Scared, Baifeng?""

""Can you just ride properly? We’ll crash at this rate!""

After that rollercoaster ride, we finally arrived. I stumbled off, dizzy and weak, walking like I was drunk.

""Not bad, huh? My riding skills?""

""Never letting you drive me again...""

We wandered the night market. People gave me weird looks, whispering like I was some kind of oddity.

Li Ersen stopped at a booth, staring intently at the vendor.

I followed his gaze... and was speechless.

""How much for one bucket?"" he asked.

He was eyeing the ring toss game. Eyes sparkling.

""One bucket for 50, two for 80, three for 100.""

Seriously? A grown man playing ring toss?

""Do you even know how this works?""

I looked at him like a daycare kid. Why was I babysitting?

""How else would you play it?""

""Just watch me\~""

He bought a bucket, gave it a shake, then flung the rings like he was splashing water.

""What the hell are you doing?!""

I stared, dumbfounded. How was that fun?

""Another thirty buckets, please!""

""Coming right up!""

Is he insane? Doesn’t even check prices, just throws money around. At this rate, he might buy the whole booth.

People started staring. I wished I could dig a hole and disappear. Why did I come?

""Done playing, little Ersen?""

""Too bad... Baifeng didn’t join me...""

Someone help me. I have no experience babysitting! Right now, Li Ersen was basically a toddler.

He held his prizes proudly, smiling like I’d never seen before. Maybe I’d never understand his joy...

We eventually reached a nearby park. I collapsed on a bench, bracing for his next whim.

""Teacher! You seriously spent over 1,000 just to get a bottle of wine. Such a waste!""

He laughed and raised the bottle toward the moon.

""Waste? Nah. I never expect to win anything. What I want is *happiness*.""

The cork slowly rose on its own, as if absorbing moonlight. No opener needed.

""This wine isn’t cursed, is it? Why’d it open itself?""

""Because I have superpowers!""

Seriously? He talked like a kid, did fantasy-level stuff—yet it was weirdly... cute.

Li Ersen popped the cork and downed the wine like a heartbroken man.

""Want some, Baifeng?""

""Teacher! I’m underage!""

""Shhh\~ besides me, who else knows that?""

Seeing his flushed face, I hesitated... and accepted the wine.

He was right. No one else knew. What harm could a few sips do?

I drank like him—big gulps.

The alcohol burned down my throat, setting my body on fire. My heart raced.

I stood to walk it off, but everything spun. I collapsed after one step.

""Hot... I’m burning up... Ersen...""

""Haha\~ lightweight!""

He laughed, dragging me back to the bench. Thankfully, no one else was around.

Then a ringtone startled me. I fumbled in my pocket—not my phone. I leaned toward him. Of course—it was his.

He answered seriously. The caller? The infamous Zhang Yingfang.

""Wow\~ You have Zhang Yingfang’s number!""

""Of course. We talk about work.""

""But private chat? There’s group chat for that!""

He shot me a deadly glare.

""Let’s call him!""

""You’re drunk! Want to get us scolded?!""

Fueled by alcohol, I snatched his phone and hit dial, running across the grass as he chased me.

""Baifeng, stop acting stupid! I’ll get reprimanded!""

""Let’s see if Zhang Yingfang picks up.""

Not watching my step, I tripped.

Li Ersen seized the moment, grabbed the phone, and ended the call, chugging wine in relief.

Just when we thought it was over—Zhang Yingfang called back!

Startled, Li Ersen dropped the phone. It rang incessantly, but he didn’t dare answer.

I picked it up—just as it stopped ringing.

Then I had a dumb idea.

Grinning, I typed a message, imagining Zhang Yingfang’s reaction.

Li Ersen stumbled over, fear replacing his drunken haze. He snatched the phone, turned off the screen.

""Baifeng! Are you insane?!""

""It’s fine\~ I’ll take the blame.""

*""Director! First-year Class D student Wu Baifeng wants to visit you at the Student Affairs Office.""*

No matter the hour, that message was suspicious.

""I’m dead! They’ll call a meeting over this...""

""Surprise\~ Didn’t expect that, huh?""

Seeing his panic, I burst into laughter.

Then he dropped the phone and collapsed, gripping the grass.

""What are you doing? Didn’t you retract the message?""

""I didn’t... because he read it...""

My turn to sober up instantly. Not because he read it. Not because he didn’t reply. But because of what he *did* say:

*""What’s wrong with Baifeng?""*

Was he mad? Worried? Just being polite? Would he call if I didn’t respond?

But nothing happened. He didn’t call. No reply followed...

""I’m heading back. Want me to drop you off?""

""Forget it. I’ll ask Mr. Bai to drive you. Better than getting caught in a checkpoint.""

""What police would be out now? Give me my phone! I need to call in sick tomorrow.""

Unbelievable—a teacher giving alcohol to a minor, drunk-riding a motorcycle... and he’s still allowed to teach?

I hazily called Mr. Bai, told him my location, and drifted into sleep...

Not for her. Not even for you.

This is the final part of a story I didn’t expect to unfold.  
From casual classmates.  
To silent questions.

—

It’s been a while since Baguio.  
Wala nang bagong messages.  
Wala nang emojis.  
Wala na siya.  
At oo, naka-block pa rin ako.

Hindi na ako umaasa.  
Pero minsan, memory has its own ways of lingering.  
Kahit tapos ka na.

Eventually, napagod na rin ako.  
Hindi biglaan.  
Hindi dramatic.  
Wala ring ""self-love era"" na may malakas na music sa background.

Healing, for me, came like Sunday afternoons.  
Mabagal. Tahimik.  
Habang naglalaba.  
Habang binibilad ‘yung mga alaala na dati ay basang-basa.

May mga araw na hindi ko na siya naiisip.  
Tapos biglang...  
maririnig ko ‘yung “I Turn to You” sa commute.  
O makakaamoy ako ng pabango na parang sa kanya.  
At doon ulit ako mahuhulog kahit sandali.  
Pero ngayon, alam ko na kung pano umahon.

Hindi ko na kailangang i-replay lahat.  
Alam ko na ang ending.  
Wala ngang ending.  
At minsan, ‘yun na rin pala ang closure.

No dramatic confrontation.  
No last coffee.  
Walang sagot.  
Walang “I’m sorry.”

Just me.  
Folding clean shirts.  
Cleaning my flat.  
Lifting some weights.  
Texting people who reply because they actually want to.

One night, I was ""cleaning"" my old inbox.  
Nakita ko pa ‘yung messages niya.  
Yung “Puntahan mo ko.”  
Yung “😘😘😘.”  
Yung mga “haha” at “same” na dati ay parang lifeline.

Tinignan ko lang.  
Hindi ako nag-screenshot.  
Hindi ko rin dinelete.  
Sinara ko lang ang phone ko.

Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is nothing.  
Not reach out.  
Not beg.  
Not wait.  
Just breathe.  
And leave it.

**She was the storm.**  
And I let it soak into everything.  
But lately, I’ve been finding warmth again.

**END**

If you’ve ever been someone’s “Breeze”…  
Or if someone ever made you feel like a ghost inside your own story...  
I hope this reminded you:

You are not unfinished.  
You are not disposable.  
And you don’t need someone to return just to prove you mattered.

You were real.  
You loved sincerely.  
That’s more than enough.

1kkk8kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kkk8kj/health_anxiety_experience_so_far/,Health Anxiety experience so far..,"Quick notes:

\- Male in early 30s

\- History of depression

\- Switched from unhealthy \~3000+ calorie diet to \~1600 recently

\- Restarted anxiety medication after panic attack

\- Cut out caffeine cold turkey (360mg/day -> 0mg/day)

\- Had 3 days of constant waves of panic attacks leading to little to no sleep

\- Currently feeling low energy and depressed, occasional feeling of being strangled

\- Had close family member pass earlier this year

\- Lifted 2-3 times a week before panic attack but now lifted 3 days this last week with 1 hour of walking a day

\- Big panic attack triggered by thoughts of mortality

\- Unemployed for a year, took a temporary job, now have a job in my career field

\- Haven't gotten much sleep in the last week, moved from my bed to the couch as it gives me comfort

For a little bit of background; I'm a male in their early thirties who had high blood pressure in the past (stage 1 hypertension) but was able to bring it down with exercise and cutting out certain foods. I lost my job a year and a half ago and my mental health took a big hit. Once I ran out of insurance I stopped my anxiety/depression medication and fought for a way to cope with things. I had a lot of time to myself so I was sleeping a lot, playing games, reading whatever, and overall doing alright I suppose. I had a close family member pass away in March and was not able to attend the funeral due to a new temporary job (I regret this a lot). I picked up temporary work which helped pay the bills and keep the lights on. During all of this my diet wasn't so great but it wasn't as bad as it was last month.

Fast forward to a month ago; I get an offer for a golden opportunity in my career field and celebrate by eating Mcdonalds (two cheeseburgers + large fries), burgers, ice cream, two containers of onion pringles (370 calorie containers), two spicy nachos lunchables, and three protein shakes on pretty much a daily basis for a couple of weeks. Also, I had been consuming \~360mg (two cups of coffee + c4) on a daily basis for the last year.

During the three days of panic attacks I was hardly able to eat a thing and had a hard time drinking water. I felt constantly on edge and as if I was in a stranglehold until I would fall asleep. Even then I'd wake up at \~2:30am, without fail, and have a panic attack that would make my legs feel like jello. I'd have to tell myself that things will be alright and breath in and out of my emergency paper bag. I actually had a panic attack this morning at this time as well but it only lasted \~10 minutes before I fully calmed down.

It's officially been 8 days since I had a very bad panic attack from 1am to 4am and I believe that I've slowly been recovering. I still feel very depressed and a bit anxious but I have been consistently walking an hour a day for the last five days and doing 3 days of strength this last week. I have been coughing a little. I also scheduled a Dr.'s appointment next week so I'm very much looking forward to that.

I believe that my constant waves of panic attacks were fueled by restarting citalopram, caffeine withdrawal, and a big shift from a high sugar/unhealthy fatty diet to a very lean one.

Here's a timeline of events:

5/3: Panic attack from 1am to 4am, start citalopram from last years bottle I saved at 10mg. I sleep for around 7 hours

5/6: I cut coffee out completely (360mg/day -> 0mg/day). I sleep for around 6 hours

5/7: Tremors/waves of panic attacks start to occur and thinking becomes difficult, don't remember falling asleep. I do some strength training and walk around town for an hour. I hardly eat. I sleep for around 5 hours

5/8: Panic attacks continue, try to socialize but panic after an hour. Walk around the town for a couple of hours. I hardly eat. I sleep around 2 hours

5/9: Waves of panic attacks slow down and I'm able to consume food. I eat around 1000 calories. I walk for a couple of hours around the town. I then go to my gym and hit the stairmaster for 5 minutes and stationary bike for 15 minutes. Eyes are extremely bloodshot. I sleep for around 6 hours

5/10: Have occasional panic attacks through the day fueled by worries of mortality even with friends. I eat around 2000 calories. I walk around the town for and a half hours with a friend. I sleep for around 7 hours

5/11: I start off the morning by eating a light breakfast and walking for an hour and a half around my neighborhood. I watch a few videos on YouTube, take a nap for a couple of hours, and then proceed to walk for 15 minutes. I'm now writing up this post and wondering if things will get better or will I wake up at 2:30 again and break down.

Part of this post is to document what's been happening to me in case others can relate now, in the past, or the future. Another part is to gather my thoughts and hope that things will be much better a week from now.",2,1747025462.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Do you find yourself yawning despite the nervousness? Do you actually fear falling asleep midway during your exams only to be woken up by the ""time is up"" announcement?

This is what you've to do:

1. Power Nap Smartly – If you're running on little sleep, a 15–20 minute nap before your exam can refresh your brain without making you groggy.


2. Hydrate, But Not Too Much – A glass of cold water can perk you up. But not too much making your bladder overexcite.


3. Snack Right – Eat something light but energizing: bananas, dark chocolate, or a small handful of nuts can give your brain the right kind of kick. Bananas and dark chocolate, I repeat.


4. Cold Splash – Wash your face with cold water before heading it. Like DUH.


5. Move a Bit – If possible, take a brisk walk or do some quick stretches. It’ll boost your circulation and help fight off drowsiness.


6. PUMP up on a cup of coffee or a red bull just before entering the exam hall. It'll get your heart racing and keep sleep at bay

7. Finally - Don’t pull another all-nighter tonight. Sleep is not a luxury - it is a NECESSITY

I was never worth staying for.

It started before I could regulate my own temperature.

How do they get to be okay

I would let them back in.  
No questions. No consequences.  
Let them walk in like they never left

waiting for people  
who didn’t even realize  
they forgot to say goodbye.

One last road trip.

New jokes.  
New favorites.  
New replacements.

I still drive by

if they ever think of me  
at all.

They have new people now.  
New laughter.  
New safety.  
And I’m still outside looking in  
through windows I was never allowed to break.

They said they wanted me.  
That I mattered.  
That I belonged.

have expiration dates.

you leave.  
And I stay—

someone to choose me  
and keep choosing me  
after they realize  
I’m not something  
they can fix.

I wish I couldn’t love.

It was from a friend I hadn't spoken to in years—just a quick 'Hey, hope you're well' type thing. For some reason, it suddenly struck me how these little gestures from our past keep us connected, even when we drift apart.

I guess it got me thinking about how small acts like texts, catching up over coffee, or even a meme shared randomly can mean the world. It's like we're all desperately trying to tell each other, 'Hey, I'm here and I care.' In a weird way, that postcard felt like a hug from the past, reminding me that connections, even the simplest ones, deserve attention.

I am a 26 year old female, 5 foot 3 and 140lbs. I don’t smoke, don’t use marijuana, and I don’t drink. I’m relatively healthy and active.

About 4 years ago I noticed that when I would purse my lips to make them into a circle, they would shake a little bit. Nothing too serious and only for a moment. I’ve gradually noticed that my lips are quivering more and more when I purse them a certain way. It’s completely involuntary and I can’t make it stop unless I relax my lips. I was drinking out of a coffee cup and the way my lips positioned on the lid made them shake and the whole coffee cup was visibly vibrating. When I kiss my partner my lips shake/quiver if they are positioned a specific way. I’ve told my doctor and I’m on a waist to get an EMG to test my nerves, I think.

I don’t know anyone else that experiences this. Let me know if you have any thoughts on what this might be our certain testing to ask my doctor for.",1,1747024530.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

(mother's day 😔) we had a new staff member on POS so he obviously needed some help which is totally normal and cool, but on top of that we were completely understaffed and IMO my store has horrendous management, especially from a particular shift supervisor who I am always scheduled with.

Scheduling is consistently awful. After 2PM we always only have 3 people on, one of those a shift supervisor who is usually doing their duties, and on top of that we have to run breaks, so there's normally 2 people on floor running literally everything and we're the only store in my area so we are constantly busy. I hate it so much. This one shift supervisor does not let us close anything. I understand we want to be able to keep everything open ideally, but even my SM says if we are overwhelmed we can always close mobiles and if need be DT too.

Whenever I ask this particular shift supervisor if we can close mobiles or drive thru they always say ""people can just wait."" which i honestly hate. Yes people can wait but it comes to a point... it's starbucks so people are expecting drinks fast, and we have had literally insane wait times for both cafe and drive. Sometimes the drive thru wait is like 25+ mins and I honestly feel awful. Yes people can wait, yes we are understaffed, but there are still so many things that can be done to improve wait time, and giving good customer service is really important to me, especially when i'm the one at the receiving end of hostile customers who are upset their coffee took literally 30 minutes to get (rightfully so). Also not to mention the stress it puts us under!

This woman yelled at me today in drive thru because of the wait, i tried to be understanding of her frustration (because i do really get it) but she was screaming at me as if it was all my fault while I tried to explain I did not have the power to control what she is conplaining about and that all of the stuff she was screaming was on management. We were all working as fast as humanly possible, that's literally all we can do. I was so stressed because of running around and dealing with hostile customers yelling at me one after the other I started crying. I could not hold it back. I was so over it at this point I just told her I do not get paid enough to deal with her screaming in my face and I almost walked out then. My shift supervisor stuck up for me and the woman said she wanted to write to management. I really hope she does and that more people complain because maybe then my SM will actually do something about the awful scheduling but I doubt it. When we called my SM about the hostile lady she told me to refuse service to those people which i don't get... she totally ignored the bigger picture of why I am receiving so much hostility. AKA awful wait times due to her scheduling. And a side note i'm literally mortified that I cried on shift in front of everyone I just feel so embarrassed now, has anyone else ever cried on shift?

I just want to quit but it's going to be hard to find another job right now and I can't afford it so I guess i'm sticking here for now... any suggestions or advice on what so should do to possibly improve things? this is the only store in my area. Is it worth talking to my SM to bring these things to their attention?

1kkjtur,https://i.redd.it/u4fzcfm22a0f1.png,Family drama: Mother’s Day flop (with pet tax),"Hello and hello, welcome to my tale of Mother’s Day woes. 

Today our lovely cast of characters is Julia (mother), Jane (my aunt, Julia’s sister), Henrietta (my grandmother, their mother) and me (34 trans man)

—

Today my aunt (who lives next door) invited me to go for a coffee with her and Henrietta. I get in the back behind the driver's seat with the dog (goofy little chunker) and we head out. Turns out, oops, it’s Mother’s Day. I’d been invited to tag along because I love coffee and car rides. I didn’t realize until we were halfway there, even then I thought “eh, should be fine.”

When my grandmother (who lives with Julia) comes to say hello to the dog, she spots me sitting in the back and her mouth drops open. She gasps, puts on this whole act of heartbreak and distress, sniffling and hyperventilating before finally exclaiming “JULIA”

She doesn’t acknowledge me, instead addressing Jane and repeatedly asking “can Julia come?” We don’t have enough space in the car for everyone, so eventually Henrietta says she can’t come. My aunt gives her a card and we head off to get a coffee on our own.

I’d considered sending Julia a “happy Mother’s Day” to keep the peace, but I don’t view her that way and it twists my gut to force it. Her and my grandmother used to force me to do and say a lot of things to keep up the happy family appearance.

Meanwhile Jane and Julia also have a strained relationship, so inviting Julia to ride with us wasn’t really an option to begin with. In the past, Julia has admitted to feeling like my aunt is responsible for our shitty relationship. She also believes my aunt wants to replace her as the role of mother. The truth is, my aunt supported my attempts at reconciliation and I have zero interest in anyone filling that role in Julia’s stead. We’re just weirdly similar and enjoy eachothers company.

So you’d think that’d be it, right? Kind of a shitty reaction but whatever.

We get to the coffee shop and my aunt suggests “Oh! Do you want to invite Julia and mom to come meet us here?” I think about it, then shrug like “I don’t not want to see her, so sure. I’ll even text her.” At the time I was comfortable with both of us being in the same vicinity and viewed it as an offer of goodwill so I invited Julia and she said yes. 

Jane and I have our coffee and we’re sitting together chatting, waiting for the others to arrive. Then we hear a dog in the vehicle next to us whimpering pathetically while in a carrier. We're both so sad about this that we park elsewhere. (It’s cold out and the windows were all open, the dog is okay)

Julia texts me that they’re inside the coffee shop and my aunt and I both lurch like “oh shit, time to socialize in public” before we stop and consider whether we actually want to or not. I don’t want to and say so, my aunt feels the same, plus we have a dog with us, that adorable chunker. 

I text Julia to tell her as much and we begin looking for where they parked. Yep. They parked right next to the pathetically crying dog car but neither of us say anything because Julia is weird about being told to do anything. We parked next to them and noticed my grandmother was still in the car. 

My aunt and I assume Henrietta’s either forgotten how to open the window or she’s locked in, I joke she’s trapped. She looks upset, though, and we get the feeling she’s ignoring us. Eventually she gets the door open but doesn’t greet me. Whatever, she’s chatting with Jane.

Julia finally arrives from the coffee shop carrying two cups of coffee. She walks around to the passenger side of her car, right past me, and makes a big show of giving Henrietta her coffee, some napkins, sugar packets, creamers, some stir sticks… literally announces each item.

I call out “Someone wants to say hi to you!” The dog is on my lap now, her tail is wagging, and Julia doesn’t so much as look at me. Mind you, I’m in the back seat so she had to walk past me. Twice.

We get the feeling my grandmother doesn’t want to talk, so Jane suggests Julia turn her car around to face us, which she does. Jane tries to make light of the poor dog whimpering pathetically to Julia, because it’s almost comical that they chose to park there.

Henrietta exits their car and while walking over to sit next to my aunt demands “go sit with your mother” I quickly said no. 

Julia clearly heard me and is pouting, I don’t know if Henrietta did. Once she’s seated next to Jane and sees I hadn't moved she demands again “go sit with your mother” and again I said no. She for sure heard me this time and there's a minute of tense silence as everyone seems to take in the situation. 

The poor dog one car over is practically screaming now.

Henrietta gets back out and returns to the car with Julia and I assume she’s just going to sit and stew in her displeasure. My aunt later told me she heard her say “this is bullshit.”

I was still willing to chat with Julia, but Henrietta began complaining of a headache, then says she even took an Advil (she prides herself in never having to take medication until it’s bad) Julia still hasn’t said a god damn word, just sat there sadly. Henrietta then declares “Take me home!” And they abruptly leave after a swift goodbye.

My aunt and I are sitting there just absolutely baffled by the way all of that went. 

—-

TLDR; I tag along with my aunt for coffee with her and grandma. Grandma is aghast that I dare show my face without also making it a happy Mother’s Day event with my own estranged parent. We invite them both to join us at coffee shop. They show up, and when I won’t play the doting son, grandma gets mad and they both storm off.

Finding conflicting answers from similar issues. The light streaks on the bottom make me think maybe a light leak during the darkroom/light tank maybe?

1kkjqv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kkjqv7/how_do_i_make_up_with_her/,How Do I Make Up With Her,"My wife (26F) and I (27M) got into a hell of a fight. Verbal only, but we may as well have been stabbing each other.

For context, I've got PTSD and she's got BPD so we both say mean, hateful shit we don't mean when we're triggered. I'm medicated and go to therapy every blue moon, she's (consciously) not and can't open up to therapists and doesn't trust psychs. All that means is my fuse is a bit longer than it used to be, and when I can sense that I'm triggered I can fight it a bit before that can opens.

Mother's Day 2025 - but again there's context. Kiddo's (suspected but undiagnosed ASD) 5th birthday was the 1st, we wanted to take him to Six Flags the weekend after but it didn't happen due to torrential downpours - $400 I get to try to recoup from trip insurance. We rescheduled to this weekend, with the knowledge ahead of time she'd be off today. Therefore, we spent yesterday buying things for her garden and getting stuff done for that.

This morning we all slept in a bit, but I was the last to wake up because I'd woken up around 6am with a leg cramp and I decided to go back to sleep after. Woke up at 9am to kiddo running in yelling ""get uuuuup"", I did and she'd brought me a cup of coffee. We get to talking about what we're going to do and around 10 get on our way. Drive there starts a little iffy, I almost read ended a Nissan that decided to stop in the middle of the highway. We get to Six Flags, walk in, and the first ride we get to kiddo is scared and crying the entire time. Next one we do he's having a blast, then we pass by two my wife was really looking forward to because they were closed, find the third one and it was open - kiddo's freaking out crying and screaming. I say I can stay behind with him, she says she doesn't want to do the ride alone, which pretty much sealed the deal that she wasn't going as it's not like we can force him to ride and we definitely can't just have him wait. I try to coax him to try, she's annoyed, we skip the ride. We get to the kiddy side of the park, he's freaking out about the 5mph choo choo train ride that we kinda wanted him to ride alone because it's TINY, I ended up getting in. Next he sees a ""tornado"" ride, but it has a height limit that both my wife and I exceeded and since we *couldn't* ride it, he had another meltdown. We ended up hitting the playground, and then Dippin Dots. We're eating ice cream, trying to get him to consider the last ride my wife wanted to ride and he's insisting that at this point the entire park is scary because it's scary. She's pretty upset at this point, we go home.

He'd also clogged the bathtub drain to the point it had a very slow drain, so I had that project waiting for me at home. We get home, she's sun bathing in a lawn chair in the front yard, I tell him to take a nap and I get to trying to snake the drain. She comes in, I take a break from the tub, she mentions she wants a seafood boil, I tell her we'll go get the seafood boil and I'll get a pickup order for Home Depot to get stuff to replace the pipe I'm going to have to cut into as the snake was not clearing the issue and we'd already tried draino.

We get dinner, we're having a good time, we get to heading to Home Depot to pickup my order and the fight begins. She tells me I don't take her out often enough, I try to point out that we are and have been overwhelmed with a list of things, she rebuts, I get silent because I'm in a spot where I know the first thing that comes to mind is not the thing to say. She tells me that me shutting down is toxic, I tell her I shut down because I learned that the first shitty thing I have to say is never something I mean, she says when I get silent she wonders what I'm thinking, I tell her that it's not a good idea for me to speak up at that time because my PTSD decides fight or flight is happening and I get mean and hateful thoughts I know I don't believe. She keeps going, I keep asking her to stop, and then I met my limit and the mean hateful things come out. She's crying, our son has *been* telling us to stop, and I ask her if that's what she wanted. Obviously, no, but now she's saying I hate her and starts talking about what her friends think, and that the one said if he had a better relationship with me that he'd tell me to ""wake the fuck up"". I said ""why can't you just tell me what you tell your friends instead of just being mean"", she said she's mean and hateful because I don't do enough. I reminded her again, we are overwhelmed. It carries on, she tells me to leave her on the side of the road, I keep driving anyways and we finally get to Home Depot.

I get back in the car, and I ask her what made her even want to start the fight *right after we had just gone out*. I should have just stayed quiet because that just rekindled the argument. We ended up in a screaming match, my son and I go inside and she stays in the car. I start to work on the bathtub, realize I have more to do, take a break and then head out to try to talk. She starts calling me a psycho, saying I waved my fist (if anything I was doing the 🤌 thing), and that she tells her friends she just has to wait until our son's 18th birthday to leave, I ask her ""then what's the point"", she says she doesn't want to be a single mother and starts listing reasons that basically boils down to her telling me I'm an ATM with handyman benefits 

NOW...reason I'm asking how I make it up to her. I know that her and I both just say shit to hurt each other when it comes to it. I know that she didn't mean the things she said just like I didn't mean the things I said. However, I'm the rock. It is understood that I am the rock, and that if and when I do get heated, there is a scary element that comes from the fact she is 5'4"" and pees when she sneezes, and I am 6'4"", fairly strong, and my anger comes out a smidge ragey as my voice projects. I get it, I scare her, she does not scare me.

I PTO'd tomorrow to finish the drain project, I don't have the supplies to finish it tonight else I would. This means tomorrow I will be home when she expects me to be at work. How do I keep tomorrow from being a repeat of tonight? Is there anything I can do to try to at least neutralize the field, or am I likely in for a day of being a janitor/maintenance?",1,1747023630.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
