1ku6jkb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku6jkb,Type me based on those results.,"I gathered a few test results and I'm curious how you would type me. I struggle between two types. 

Quick description:

Female with anger issues when triggered, usually I'm in a good mood and like to joke around.

I like being outside. With friends, without friends. That doesn't matter. Drinking coffee or just strolling around. Observing people when they do something stupid and laughing internally. When I'm at home, I like reading. Manga, Terry Pratchett or books about psychology or anything that caught my eye. I'm naturally curious and want to know a lot of things. For example I have a huge knowledge about Dinosaurs and air planes without having anything to do with them beside use them for travelling. 

Nonetheless I like the thrill of actions and after a day sitting around I get bored and need something to do.

I don't plan anything. I just take everything how I get it. Usually you can ask me for help and I come over right away. 

I care about people, I just don't show it.   ",1,1748074329.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False
1ku6iys,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1ku6iys/why_is_it_that_everyday_time_i_drink_coffee_i/,Why is it that everyday time I drink coffee I either get heart palpitations or sleepy?,"As the title says, I'm super confused by the effect caffeine has on my body. Each and every time I get a cup o joe l play a 50/50 game gamble on whether or not it's going to perk me up or bring me down.


Sometimes when drinking a caffeinated beverage I have to 'nurse' the beverage slowly, so much so that if I don't, I'll develop unrelenting heart palpitations that can sometimes induce anxiety and panic attacks. Other times I'll drink the stuff and it has absolutely none of expected caffeinated effects, I'll actually start yawning after the coffee and feel more exhausted and sleepy than I did prior to consumption.


I've tried doing my own research on google however can only find separate articles on the matter and not one that ever explains experiencing both reactions.


Any insight would be deeply appreciated!!!

1ku6gl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ku6gl2/i_30m_think_about_leaving_my_gf31f_do_we_have/,I (30M) think about leaving my GF(31F) - do we have completely different goals in life?,"I'm going to try and be short and direct on this.  
  
So I met this girl about 5 years ago, when we were coworkers, but didnt think anything of it - since i was still with my ex at that time.  
Fastforward to about a year ago, when I was single, we metup for a coffee and things went on from there.  
Its soon going to be 1 year since we went exclusive, and things have generally been good.

There's a couple reasons I might be thinking its better to go our own ways but I really dont want to hurt her.

First, I've lived in a small city for most of my life, dont have a lot of friends, and generally I like to spend my evenings at home or inside. I'm really not a ""going out"" type of person, since I've done a lot (too much) of that in my ealy 20s. Contrary to her, she just started living life when she turned 25 when she moved to my country (she is from foreign country) to work. She really likes to have a drink or go out - which I don't, and doesn't want to move from the city she currently lives in - saying this could be a deal breaker for her.   
We were talking of moving in together and finding a place in that city. I said I'm fine with that, but the more I had time to think about it, the less I want to live there - I was there every day in my high school years, and its coming back to me why I kinda dont want to live there.  
  
Second, now my love language isnt really a human touch, but I do love her in my own way and I do show it. On the contrary she is a big ""touchy touchy"" type of person. And as soon as I stop touching her, she gets upset and i need to quickly start touching her and showing her affection.

Third, She is really emotional (different culture and stuff - being from different country) - i feel like I need to walk on eggshells for every word I say and more importantly how i say it, cause she might get upset and feels ""attacked"" and I need to defend myself or explain that I didn't mean anything bad or attacking (most people in my country are kind of cold in that sense).

Lastly, almost every week I need to listen things about her biologycal clock, and how she doesn't have time to wait for me to start moving in together, and I feel like I'm getting rushed in to things without much thought, and I kinda start to avoid these conversations by ensuring her we're going to be fine and we'll have kinds and stuff. I really don't like to be rushed into that kind of stuff - in her culture its normal to get married and have kids after 1 year of dating, but it's freaking me out cause it was almost never the case in my country. I do want a family, but i feel like its too rushed in this relationship. My brother and his SO had their first kid when they were 36.

  
Now I really tried to make this work cause I do like her and love her, but I am deviating from my true self and really can't change who I am, the way I am or the way I speak - some things are normal in our country, and most people wouldn't get ""offended"" by the way words are communicated. Combine this with the ""touchy"" aspect and rushing things like kids and family, I really don't know how long I can keep this up.  
  
I feel like I tried as hard as I can to change over the past year, to acommodate her, but i don't know how long I can keep up with it. I don't like being rushed into things, I can't always be the emotional pillar, cause it's weighing on me as well, and I feel like the living situation is also a big problem.  
  
I am kinda lost and don't know how to proceed with this relationship, I really do love her, want to spend time with her, but I am getting kind of ""tired"" if i can say so.

  
Any advice would be welcome, thanks.

TLDR; I feel like my GF and I are at different stages of life in a relationship, I dont want to move in her city, she doesn't want to move out, she rushes on having family, is overly emotional and I dont know how I can keep up.",0,1748073968.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

I'm looking for random chats with whomever is interested. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love to read! I'm currently reading the 48 laws of power. It's completely psychotic but also fascinating; I enjoy all the history he sprinkles in with each law, as well. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. Just finished playing The Witcher 3 for the first time, and I'm about to start No Man's Sky and Coromon. The sunsets in TW3 were ridiculously beautiful.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

I'm not looking for anything romantic. If you're interested, flick me a chat request if possible. I'm also willing to move off reddit if we hit it off, if you so wish.",1,1748073247.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False
1ku6a32,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ku6a32/claude_returns_to_the_90s_with_sirds/,Claude returns to the 90's with SIRDS,"Remember those mind-bending stereogram posters from the 90s? The ones where you'd stare cross-eyed at what looked like random patterns until suddenly a 3D dolphin would pop out? Well, I got nostalgic and decided to recreate that magic with modern A.I. and web technology!

## üéØ **What I Built:**

A complete **Three.js-based SIRDS (Single Image Random Dot Stereogram) generator** using Three.js and HTML5 Canvas. No downloads, no installs - just pure web magic that recreates those classic optical illusions.

## ‚ú® **Key Features:**

- **üìù Custom Text**: Multi-line text with smooth gradients that make letters appear as raised domes
- **üî∫ Basic Shapes**: Circles, squares, diamonds, and spirals for easy first-time viewing  
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Upload**: Turn any photo into a hidden 3D image(works best with gray scale gradiant images)
- **üé® Custom Patterns**: Upload your own background patterns for those colorful, artistic 90s vibes(works best with tilable images)
- **üéØ Fusion Dots**: Built-in viewing guides that merge into 3 dots when you're seeing it correctly
- **üì∫ Multiple Resolutions**: Generate crisp images up to 1920√ó1080 without upscaling blur
- **üíæ Easy Saving**: One-click save with right-click instructions

## üîß **Technical Highlights:**

- **Real-time generation**: Watch your SIRDS update live as you adjust parameters
- **Proper displacement algorithm**: Uses authentic pixel-shifting techniques from the 90s
- **Scalable patterns**: Everything scales perfectly across different output resolutions
- **Cross-browser compatible**: Works on desktop and mobile

## üéÆ **Try It Yourself:**

** https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4c4d57a1-b6b8-4246-9760-c36ec3870a01 **

Start with ""Basic Shape"" ‚Üí use the fusion dots to see your first 3D image ‚Üí then experiment with text and custom uploads!

## üß† **Viewing Tips for Newcomers:**

1. Look at the two black dots at the top until they become THREE dots
2. Once you see 3 dots, keep that viewing technique and look at the main image
3. The 3D effect should pop out! (Be patient - it takes practice)

## üï∞Ô∏è **Nostalgia Trip:**

There's something magical about recreating technology that blew our minds decades ago. These SIRDS were everywhere in the 90s - mall kiosks, poster shops, screensavers. Now you can create your own with the same quality as those professional ones, right in your browser!

Perfect for:
- Creating custom gifts with hidden messages
- Teaching kids about optical illusions  
- Making unique social media content
- Just reliving that ""holy sh*t I can see it!"" moment

I placed an order for the Clever filters but figure the Melitta or locally available filters would 'do okay'.  

I had such frustration over my daily pour.  The Melitta filters would either outright rip or the grounds wouldn't allow the liquid to drain, meaning I had to constant stir the coffee.  I never had this problem with the original filters.  The taste of the coffee also greatly diminished in quality.  I had to shift to using my Hario (much smaller pour-over) until the replacement filters arrived.

1ku68rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1ku68rx/morning_rage_not_quite/,Morning rage! (Not quite),"After the last few hours tossing and turning (as much as one can when in the third trimester) I decided that, yet again, 7am is my new Saturday morning wake up time. I was hoping for a nice long lie in after being up twice gasping for the gaviscon feeling like someone has literally set my throat alight (two omeprazole a day were clearly no match to a Thai green curry!). I extricate myself from the pregnancy pillow, which is getting harder to do by the day, and complete my quick mental checklist of aches and pains. Pillow ear? Yep! Mid upper back pain? Yep! Both hips hurting from side sleeping and the pressure? Yep! 

I look over and my sweet, beautiful, lovely husband is not only still asleep, but is flat on his back. The audacity of this man! üòÇ he looks so serene and comfortable! I decide to go make the coffees, put a wash on and tidy the kitchen. Come back up with the coffee and he is still sleeping beauty and has no idea the grand gesture I have just laid next to him, in the form of tescos own brand instant coffee. 

Anyway, not quite rage but a simmering jealousy of the comfort I can no longer find. üòÇ I'm counting down the years until I can get a full 8 hours of sleep and wake up not feeling like I've just stepped out of the boxing ring. 

(PS. I am in no way mad at my husband, the tone is meant as jokey and jovial)

# Top Espresso Machines

|Brand|Best For|Pressure|Grinder/Frother|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[**Rancilio Silvia Pro X**](https://go.amzndp.com/4bPKz)|Best Overall|Dual Boiler|‚ùå Grinder / ‚úÖ Steam Wand|$$$$|

**1 -** [**Rancilio Silvia Pro X**](https://go.amzndp.com/4bPKz) **‚Äì Best Overall**

this thing is a tank. dual boilers, commercial-grade build, PID temperature control ‚Äî everything about it screams serious home barista. it‚Äôs not cheap and there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve, but the espresso quality is elite once you dial it in. milk steaming is powerful too. no built-in grinder, so you‚Äôll want a good burr grinder to pair with it.

**2 -** [**Breville Barista Touch**](https://go.amzndp.com/rXytS) **‚Äì Best Mid-Range**

if you want something more advanced without going full commercial, this one‚Äôs awesome. built-in grinder, auto milk frother, and a touch screen that walks you through everything. it‚Äôs way more convenient than separate pieces and makes great espresso with barely any learning curve. good balance of hands-on and automation.

**3 -** [**De‚ÄôLonghi Stilosa**](https://go.amzndp.com/uXHRa) **‚Äì Best Budget Pick**

basic but does the job. if you‚Äôre just dipping your toes into home espresso, this is a solid starter. it has 15 bars of pressure, a manual steam wand, and works fine with pre-ground coffee or ESE pods. not fancy, but gets the job done if you're not ready to drop a few hundred bucks.

hope this helps anyone else on the espresso machine hunt. feel free to ask anything ‚Äî i probably read 100 reviews before deciding.",1,1748073035.0,u_vpnrescue,1,1.0,False

The meeting room smelled faintly of cheap instant coffee and plastic. I watched through the one-way mirror as the focus group nattered about some new chocolate formula they were testing. Six participants, each scribbling thoughts on a clipboard like it actually mattered. One of them walked in late.

She had on this pastel pink and soft yellow get-up, like a children‚Äôs TV presenter from a show that got cancelled for being too cringe. I blinked, confused.

*‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this bird showing up looking like a human Battenberg? Man came dressed like she‚Äôs on CBeebies payroll.‚Äù*

I squinted. No recognition. My brain, fully cooked by years of scroll-happy doom consumption, could barely recall what I had for dinner last night, let alone classmates from a decade ago.

Later, in the bathroom and yes, don‚Äôt ask why I was in the ladies‚Äô loo. Maybe it‚Äôs gender-neutral or maybe I blacked out and wandered in; either way, I was washing my hands when I heard her voice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Verity Greene. Do you remember me? We were at Colworth Manor together.‚Äù

I looked up, blinking.

‚ÄúOh my god, wait *you went there too?* Deadass, I don‚Äôt remember a single soul from that school. Like, were we in the same class-class?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Ten years ago. We were in the same form.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶ no offence, but my memory‚Äôs a full-on sieve. Like, I can barely remember my own postcode sometimes. Are you sure you‚Äôre not mixing me up with someone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we were definitely in the same class. I remember you wanted to study political science. What are you doing here? Did you join the focus group?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, nah, I work here. Wild, innit? Life‚Äôs a whole detour sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. I was in the focus group. It was actually really great. I‚Äôm thinking of applying for the assistant role in R&D.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice, nice good luck with that. Sorry, I‚Äôve gotta shoot off, work stuff y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just thought‚Ä¶ I mean, if you remember anything about me, you‚Äôd know I love labs. Everyone used to call me a nerd for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh yeah? That‚Äôs cool. Honestly, school‚Äôs a total blur now. Like, blank slate vibes. Anyway take care, yeah?‚Äù

Back at my desk, I should‚Äôve looked up the R&D role she mentioned. Like, just a quick peek at her CV, maybe dig a little. But nah. I ended up half-assing my report and full-sending my attention into a YouTube rabbit hole of cats robbing Greggs or TikToks titled ‚ÄúPOV: you‚Äôre British and it‚Äôs raining indoors.‚Äù

That evening, I was at home on the sofa with my girlfriend. I had my phone glued to my face, thumbing between TikTok and Insta like I was doing thumb day at the gym. Every few minutes, I‚Äôd turn the screen to show her something deeply stupid with the energy of someone who just discovered gravity.

‚ÄúOi babe, look. This bloke trained his cat to do backflips every time the microwave beeps.‚Äù



**Tuesday**

The next day at the office, Verity was officially announced as the new employee. Assistant in Research and Development, just like she said.

I kept working and ignored the announcement entirely. It was clearly irrelevant to finishing my tasks.

Instead of being productive, I spent most of the day toggling between a half-finished report on Google Docs and Reddit threads about whether cereal is technically a soup.

After a long day, I finally got home. I walked into the living room and saw my girlfriend already wearing her VR headset.

I didn‚Äôt waste time.

I ran straight to my room, grabbed my own headset, and powered it on.

‚ÄúOi queue up,‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run a one v one, or we can hit that cooking one again though if you start launching lettuce at me like last time, I‚Äôm rage-quitting on sight.‚Äù

I could hear her laughing.

In minutes, we were back in our usual chaos either blasting each other in some war sim, or arguing over digital onions in a cartoon kitchen.

**Wednesday**

In the elevator, my boss turned to me casually, like we were just chatting between floors.

‚ÄúHey small thing. I want Verity to be your conduit to Yudy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy what now?‚Äù

‚ÄúConduit. She‚Äôll help with the comms and get a feel for how everything flows. Just shadow you a bit.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúAlright, but like‚Ä¶ do we need a middleman for something that‚Äôs working just fine? And since when am I in charge of onboarding? Bit of warning next time you decide to reshuffle the whole pipeline, yeah?‚Äù

He gave a short laugh. Not mocking, just relaxed.

‚ÄúFair enough. But she‚Äôs new, she‚Äôs bright, and I trust you to show her how things actually get done. No pressure. Just keep her in the loop.‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúRight. Cool. Got it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt love it, but I didn‚Äôt want to argue. So I nodded. Still, back at my desk, I didn‚Äôt give Verity anything important. I liked working on my own. She offered help, I told her to go check if the sugar jar in the break room actually had sugar in it.

She didn‚Äôt complain. Just smiled and went off.

  
Later that afternoon, while I was typing something half-important, a coworker leaned over the divider between our desks.

‚ÄúMate, I‚Äôm telling you *Bernie‚Äôs* has the best fried chicken in the city. Hands down.‚Äù

I turned slowly in my chair. ‚ÄúYou mean *Barnie‚Äôs*. With an A. Barn. As in ‚Äòwhere chickens live‚Äô.""

He blinked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally *Bernie‚Äôs*. After the guy who owns it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. So some random geezer named Bernie wakes up one day and starts a chicken shop and everyone just accepts that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah. It‚Äôs *Barnie‚Äôs*. Rustic. Cozy. Barnyard aesthetic. It *fits*.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lost the plot.‚Äù

I leaned forward. ‚ÄúBro. Think. Chickens live in barns. *Barnie‚Äôs*. It's common sense.‚Äù

Verity spoke up 

‚ÄúI remember perfectly it‚Äôs *Bernie‚Äôs*.‚Äù

I stared. ‚ÄúNah, you‚Äôre all wrong. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs *Barnie‚Äôs*. Like 100%.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not.‚Äù

‚ÄúBet it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúWanna Google it?‚Äù

We both pulled out our phones.

He showed me his screen. *Bernie‚Äôs*. Big bold letters. Logo and all.

I stared at it. No words.

‚Äú‚Ä¶yeah alright. My bad.‚Äù

He laughed. I shook my head.

‚ÄúStill. *Barnie‚Äôs* makes way more sense. Whoever named it fumbled hard. I‚Äôm just saying.‚Äù

The argument fizzled out like microwave leftovers. Dumb, pointless, and still lingering in my head hours later.

That night, I got home and saw my old Bernie‚Äôs cap sitting on the shelf. I stared at it for a while.

*How did I forget that?*

*I really need to stop watching Reels. They're frying my brain. I‚Äôm forgetting the names of things. This is getting ridiculous.*

I glanced over and saw my girlfriend at the table, working on something at her laptop. Headphones in. Focused. Her eyes moved across the screen like she was solving some complex equation.

I leaned against the wall.

‚ÄúWhat you working on?‚Äù I asked.

She took one earbud out and started to explain, something about data and formatting, but my brain was already fading.

‚ÄúSounds smart,‚Äù I mumbled, giving a small nod before slipping away to the bedroom.

I lay down, opened my gallery, and scrolled through the memes I‚Äôd saved years ago. Dumb, dated, overcompressed but better than whatever algorithm-fed garbage was trending now.

It helped. A bit.



**Thursday**

The executive took a bite of the marshmallow.

He smiled, gave a polite nod, said ‚ÄúVery nice,‚Äù and walked out.

Not even a minute passed before Yudy called me over. She was holding the ingredients sheet, frowning.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs beef gelatin in this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI wrote carrageen.‚Äù

The boss walked over. Glanced at the sheet. Then looked at the door the exec had just gone through.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Hindu,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we just gave him cow!‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúTechnically not *meat*, though,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt was bone. Like, beef gelatin‚Äôs from the bones, not the actual steak part.‚Äù

They both stared at me.

I frowned. ‚ÄúWait, but gelatin‚Äôs not always from cow, right? It can be pork. Or fish. Or‚Ä¶ like, other stuff. It‚Äôs not guaranteed.‚Äù

Yudy shook her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who signed off the sheet.‚Äù

The boss nodded. ‚ÄúThat list was your responsibility.‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúYeah. Okay. My fault.‚Äù

Neither of them pressed further. They didn‚Äôt need to. The mistake was obvious.

‚ÄúI mean look,‚Äù I said, trying to salvage something. ‚ÄúIgnorance doesn‚Äôt make it okay, sure. But like, technically, I‚Äôm not the one who sinned here. I just... accidentally led a man to sin. Which is arguably worse now that I‚Äôm saying it out loud.‚Äù

Yudy gave me a look. The boss rubbed his eyes.

I raised my hands. ‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôm sorry. Really.‚Äù

Nobody made a scene. There was no formal reprimand. Just a quiet, uncomfortable acknowledgment that it was a stupid error.

Because I never gave the task to Verity, there was no review step. The responsibility was mine from start to finish. And they let it go, treating it like what it was a dumb mistake.

I sat back down at my desk. For a long time, I didn‚Äôt type anything. Just stared at the edge of my screen, thinking.

It used to be automatic. Details, checklists, common sense. I used to *catch* things. Now I was fumbling ingredient sheets like a man who forgot how to read. Maybe I‚Äôd passed the point where my brain could handle modern life. Maybe I‚Äôd just watched too many short videos and started letting the algorithm think for me.

That night, sitting at home next to my girlfriend, I stared at the floor.

‚ÄúI made a Hindu exec eat beef gelatin today,‚Äù I said.

She looked at me, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot even meat. Bone. Cow bone jelly. So, you know. Basically a religious hate crime, but casual.‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause my brain‚Äôs actual soup now. I thought I‚Äôd written carrageen but turns out I submitted the wrong version of the sheet. Didn't even double-check.‚Äù

I rubbed my eyes. ‚ÄúAt least I don‚Äôt work in a nuclear plant. I‚Äôd have melted half the country by now.‚Äù

She turned in her chair. ‚ÄúHey. You‚Äôre being hard on yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying,‚Äù I shrugged, ‚Äúwe should all be grateful I don‚Äôt operate forklifts or reactors.‚Äù

She gave me a small smile. ‚ÄúYou admitted the mistake. You apologised. That counts.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply. I just nodded.

Later that night, I left my phone on the table and didn‚Äôt touch it. Not even once.



**Friday**

I showed up ridiculously late to work. Again.

Probably got distracted watching videos in the shower. Could‚Äôve been cats. Could‚Äôve been conspiracy theories about microwaves. Doesn‚Äôt matter.

As soon as I walked in, Verity turned from her desk.

‚ÄúYou missed the eight o'clock meeting.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúNah. There wasn‚Äôt one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey sent an email yesterday afternoon.‚Äù

I scoffed, pulled out my phone, and opened my notifications. There it was, somewhere between TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Netflix, and whatever else had been trying to hijack my brain overnight.

‚ÄúOh shit.‚Äù

I sprinted to the conference room, heart racing, but by the time I got there, the meeting was already over. The team was standing up, packing their stuff.

Someone chuckled. ‚ÄúClassic.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always him,‚Äù another one said.

""Good night, bro, maybe you're too soon for the next day meeting"".

They weren‚Äôt angry. Just amused. At this point, my lateness was background noise. Annoying, maybe, but familiar.

My boss walked over with a coffee in hand. ‚ÄúAsk someone for notes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you the presentation this afternoon.‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you see the email?‚Äù

I held up my phone. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see the notification. It got buried under like fifty fake chat notifications. Maybe you lot should give me a work phone, honestly.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. I‚Äôll order you a gold-plated one with TikTok pre-installed.‚Äù

We went back to our desks.

The girl picked up the milk box from the floor.   
  
‚ÄúAlright, who‚Äôs drinking my almond milk again? And it was full this morning, so... I know It's just happened. So who was it?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even flinch. Just opened my inbox and pretended to be busy.

Then Verity looked up from her desk. She was holding the chain of her necklace, slowly twisting the pendant between her fingers. She hesitated, glanced around, then finally said,

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to say anything because it felt rude‚Ä¶ but it was him. He drank your milk while you were all in the meeting.‚Äù

She nodded slightly in my direction.

I turned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

People started looking. Some curious, some already smirking.

I opened my mouth to reply but nothing came out.

My throat closed.

I grabbed at my neck, eyes wide. My breathing turned ragged, then shallow. My body suddenly felt too hot, like something inside had short-circuited. A sharp, twisting pain bloomed in my stomach.

I staggered back two steps, vision darkening at the edges.

Then I collapsed.

Chairs flew back. Someone swore loudly.

Yudy rushed across the room, dropping to her knees beside me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an allergic reaction,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGet the first aid kit. Now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù someone asked.

‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù she snapped, already checking my pulse. ‚ÄúIt's an allergic reaction of food, he can't breat!!!‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone have an EpiPen?‚Äù someone yelled.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one in the kit.‚Äù

The guy who‚Äôd argued with me about *Barnie‚Äôs* earlier sprinted across the office, yanked open the first aid cabinet, and dropped the red case beside us.

My boss knelt beside me, pulled out the injector, and didn‚Äôt waste a second. One shot into the thigh. Firm. Fast.

Then stillness.

Sound melted. Vision blurred. I felt like I was underwater, weightless, with no direction or control.

People moved around me, but it didn‚Äôt feel like they were in the same world anymore.

**I woke up hours later.**

The room was quiet. White walls. The faint beep of a monitor. Cold air humming through vents overhead.

Everything felt distant. I blinked slowly.

Next to me, curled up in a hospital chair, was my girlfriend. Hoodie pulled halfway over her head. Flowers (cheap ones from Tesco, probably) sat on the side table.

She noticed I was awake and sat up quickly.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, voice soft. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

I swallowed, throat dry and sore.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou had an allergic reaction,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo almonds.‚Äù

I stared at her. ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even eat almond milk.‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. Someone probably used it in something you didn‚Äôt notice. Or maybe cross-contamination.‚Äù

I sighed, then managed a weak laugh. ‚ÄúI should not be allowed in open kitchens. Or near milk. Or anything, really.‚Äù

She smiled gently. ‚ÄúAt least now you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù

She leaned forward, resting her hand on mine.

‚ÄúYou scared everyone. But you‚Äôre okay. That‚Äôs what matters.‚Äù

I nodded. Quietly.",0,1748073018.0,blackmirror,0,0.4,False

1ku675a,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ku675a/40_m4f_new_zealandanywhere_oneoff_conversations/,40 [M4F] New Zealand/Anywhere - One-off conversations and new friends,"I'm Seth! Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. There's a pic in my post history.

I'm looking for random chats with whomever is interested. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up! 

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love to read! I'm currently reading the 48 laws of power. It's completely psychotic but also fascinating; I enjoy all the history he sprinkles in with each law, as well. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. Just finished playing The Witcher 3 for the first time, and I'm about to start No Man's Sky and Coromon. The sunsets in TW3 were ridiculously beautiful. 
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good. 
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

I'm not looking for anything romantic. If you're interested, flick me a chat request if possible. I'm also willing to move off reddit if we hit it off, if you so wish.",1,1748072864.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve heard mixed reports on whether the circle sticker or the rectangular sticker is the genuine Lattafa. The glass engraving doesn‚Äôt seem like good quality, on the bottom I can barely make out the 13. The cap came with scratches on the corners, probably from getting jostled inside the box. The cap comes off easily, there‚Äôs no twist needed to open and no dots on the edges of the square engravings like in some videos I‚Äôve seen. The batch number is also on the bottom instead of the sides. The color seems darker then it should be compared to some videos, but that could be the lighting.

Some buns were ok, but mostly i intuitivly avoided eating it.

Got my diagnosis mid twenties, and suddenly it made sense, that i avoided gluten all my life. i always prefer potato and rice to noodles, hated most cookies...

But even after all these years of being glutenfree i still find myself avoiding even cookies, cakes, croissants... bakes stuff in General. there is like 1 bread i can tolerante, and 2-3 cakey snacks i don't mind. 

Sitting in a cafe being on vacation right now and being forced to eat a gf bun for breakfast, because they have no omelette or anything like that feels like a punishment, not something i can enjoy. Every bite makes me want to throw up, my body is literally fighting against it. But i need to shove something in anyway and get the day started.

Tried a lot of gf stuff over the years, but i cant stand the taste, consistency of it, the smell, just urgh!
I always hate it when people get me gf products  because i won't eat them.

The affected area is just my chin/upper neck. I like a clean shaven look, but I was wondering whether shaving actually worsens acne and slows down the clearing process? I don‚Äôt use a shaving cream and opt for a dry shave with an electric razor, I‚Äôm considering this could be the harmful bit.

I‚Äôm an extremely fussy eater. I‚Äôve only just started adding vegetables to my everyday meals instead of just once in a blue moon. However, I‚Äôm adding say a handful of lettuce to a wrap, not a huge shift but I‚Äôm hoping incorporating stuff like this will have an effect - or do I just need to go fully in and eat salads and mainly vegetable meals to see the effects by the end of say summertime?

I like to have a coffee at work, but is coffee going to potentially worsen my skin? Maybe taking the sugar out will be better for me but I‚Äôm thinking if the caffeine is effecting hormones it could be a root cause of the breakouts?

Sounds wild, right? But let me tell you, it's not only possible, but it's also a game-changer! üéâ**

I stumbled into this whole **faceless content batch production** craziness when I found myself staring at an empty content calendar, *sweating like I was in a sauna*. I was constantly running out of time to create and post engaging content. I thought, ‚ÄúWhat if... I could just level up my approach and work smarter, not harder?‚Äù So, I did a little experimenting. 

**Here‚Äôs the rundown of my weekend content marathon:**

1. **Planning, Planning, Planning**  
   - I spent a few hours brainstorming ideas. Think themes, trends, and topics that resonate with your audience.
   - Created a rough calendar. Yes, even if it‚Äôs just scribbles‚Äîit helps to visualize your month!

2. **Batch Recording**  
   - I turned off my selfie mode and opted for screen recording. Voila! Faceless but still packed with personality. 
   - A little trick? I set up multiple scenes in my recording software. *It‚Äôs like a movie director but with a pajama wardrobe!*

3. **Scripting Simplified**  
   - Short and sweet. Nobody wants to read a novel in each post! 
   - I wrote bullet-point scripts so I knew what to say without sounding robotic. *Pro tip: sprinkle in some humor!*

4. **Editing Like a Pro (Or At Least Trying!)**  
   - Look, I‚Äôm no Spielberg, but I learned a bit about editing to make my videos look decent. 
   - Using templates saves time and gives your content a cohesive look. Seriously, it‚Äôs like putting on your favorite outfit‚Äîinstant confidence boost!

5. **Automation Magic**  
   - Queued up my posts to go live using scheduling tools. *Less stress = more peace of mind.* It‚Äôs like setting your coffee maker to wake you up. Yum!

6. **Engagement Strategy**  
   - Don‚Äôt just post and ghost! I set reminders to check back and respond to comments. 
   - I even crafted easy follow-up posts for engagement, because who doesn‚Äôt love a good convo?!

Now, here‚Äôs the joyous part: I can focus on *other* projects during the month, knowing that I‚Äôm covered on content. It's like having your cake and eating it too... except this cake comes with no calories‚Äîjust tons of engagement!

And because we all love a good bonus, if you want to dive deeper into this world and get some handy guides, check out this cool program: [AI Content Creation Guide (affiliatelink)](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals). Honestly, it has been such a lifesaver.

I‚Äôm a Muslim woman (in my 20s) who really values certain principles‚Äîmodesty, faith, and emotional boundaries. I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm in a bit of an emotional spiral and could use an outside perspective.

Here‚Äôs the backstory:

About 4 years ago, I was friends with a guy who was‚Ä¶ not my type at all. He was deep into the partying scene‚Äîdrinking, smoking, clubbing‚Äîthe whole lifestyle that clashed hard with my values. I‚Äôm a hijabi, I don‚Äôt drink or party, and back then I was also struggling a lot with my self-esteem (I weighed 99 kg at the time and now lost 31kgs). To complicate matters, he liked my best friend and even talked about marrying her, but then he betrayed her trust badly‚Äîand used me in the process as an emotional go-between. I was furious. They stopped talking, and I cut him off too.

Fast forward two years‚Äîmy friend forgave him. I never did. But recently, I heard from someone else that he‚Äôs changed a lot. Apparently, he left his toxic lifestyle, found Islam, and is trying to become a better person.

Curious (and maybe wanting closure), I reached out to him. We met for coffee and talked for 3-4 hours. And it was‚Ä¶ different.

He admitted he was in the wrong, apologized for his past, and talked about his personal growth. He told me about leaving a toxic job, distancing from bad influences, and how he‚Äôs now praying, reading, and trying to realign his life with faith. We also talked about life, families, and relationships‚Äîhe gave me advice on finding a good man, saying to look for someone who fears Allah, and that religious actions without sincerity mean nothing.

It was all very mature and respectful. He even said he doesn‚Äôt believe men and women can be just friends anymore, because usually one side has feelings (ironic, I know). At the end of the day, he told me I could reach out anytime if I needed advice or support. He hasn‚Äôt texted since, but when I said, ‚ÄúWe probably can‚Äôt go back to being normal friends,‚Äù he suggested we could be ‚Äúacquaintances‚Äù or ‚Äútherapists‚Äù for each other.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma:
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt know if he sees me that way now, or if he was just being polite and nice.
	‚Ä¢	Part of me wants to message him again, maybe casually follow up on something we talked about (like a religious question).
	‚Ä¢	But I‚Äôm tired of being the one who reaches out first. I already initiated the reconnection, and I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúnuisance‚Äù or feel like I‚Äôm chasing someone who‚Äôs not interested.

At the same time‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. It‚Äôs so confusing because I never had feelings for him before, but now‚Äîafter seeing him changed‚Äîit feels like we‚Äôre aligned in values and maybe could work.

So, should I text him? Or let it go and move on?

They migrated 3 years ago to us .
He helped them with their documents that's why they are still thankful.
They helped with money when he and his family had emergencies,my brother helps his father with various tasks.
They never offend him and never talk bad about him.


A few months ago at before birthday he was angry that my brother visited me often.He just wanted to spend time with my newborn

He was so upset and angry that complained to his mother(different region).The mother talked to me and said "" talk to your family and stop them from visiting.Butb dont say that I said it"".So I called my mother, cried and begged to not get offended.
She understood me and also said it to my brother.
He came to my birthday and called me outside ,so he can give me flowers.He had tears in his eyes.
He hugged me and gave me the flowers and went away.We didn't talk for a while then everything was back to normal.
 A few weeks later after visiting them 
Eating the food that my mother cooked and drinking the coffee that she made,
He made a remark in the car ""I am sick of this homeless people""
For context 'they did not receive apartment,just a metal container.
I looked at him and said ""are you serious??""
And he himself gave me silent treatment for a week??like ....hello??


And lastly ,4 days ago he became loud with my brother and called him donkey.
My brother was calm but I knew that it offended him.
In the car he continued to offend him calling him names so I said
 ""you were extremely disrespectful""
Calmly
He started defending himself and screaming at me
At home he screamed at me one more time and
It been 4 days that he treats me like a stranger.

Am I missing something?
He was the one to say ""be sincere with me""
Did I do something wrong?
I got the feeling that he hates me....



For context 
My brother is like Father to me.
He worked from the age of 12 so I can go to school.
My mother wasn't allowed to work an official job,cause the country that we came from was strict.
But still she bought cows and sold milk, cheese etc.
I got in an arranged marriage 9 years ago .
The First 3 years he was like a stranger to me.
Cause they ""forced"" him  to marry me"" and break up with his girlfriend.
So I somehow get it,but I was forced too...

After giving birth he started changing and caring for me .
Giving me a lot of emotional support.
Hugging and kissing,saying that he loves me.

The weather is horrible today, so as I drink my coffee I decided to cast the net out again today, as I'm still keen to connect with some more genuinely supportive and interesting people. I'm a 36-year-old fella from the UK, around to chat pretty often, and would really love to find a few friendly souls to share the everyday rhythms with, explore our passions, and hopefully build some proper connections based on good old-fashioned understanding and a bit of a laugh.

*   **Writing:** My go-to for getting thoughts and stories down, reflecting, and just getting ideas out there.
*   **Art (Drawing & Painting!):** Love both the process of creating and the joy of appreciating what others make. It's always a journey of discovery!
*   **Reading:** There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good book and seeing the world through different perspectives.
*   **Traveling:** Experiencing new cultures and broadening horizons is something I hugely value.
*   **Gym:** Keeping active helps keep both body and mind feeling good.
*   **Video Games:** Enjoy the social side, the escapism, and the great storytelling in games.
*   **Learning Languages:** Currently wrestling (in the best way!) with French and Japanese ‚Äì it's fascinating to unlock new ways to communicate.
*   **Coffee & Tea:** A simple, good cuppa is one of life's great, quiet pleasures, isn't it?

I'm really hoping to find people who value open and honest chats, a good dose of empathy, and enjoy sharing life's moments ‚Äì the big wins, the small joys, and even just the everyday stuff. I pride myself on being a good listener and genuinely aim to be a supportive and understanding mate.

If this sounds like your kind of thing and you're also on the lookout for a genuine connection, please do drop me a line and tell me a bit about yourself. Looking forward to hearing from some friendly new faces!",1,1748070642.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I don't change any of the settings between shots. Shots are made multiple hours apart. Mug and portafilter are preheated under hot water. I run empty single shot cycle without the portafilter to clean and heat the machine before each shot. I grind the coffee and its exactly 19g every time. I brush the coffee with the needle thing, tap the portafilter to evenly distribute the grind, evenly press the espresso with same amount of force every time making sure its level too. I pull the shot.

One time the shot will be 38g, what I aim for, in couple of hours it will be 48g, and in couple of other hours it will be less than 20. This happens all the time.

I disassembled the grinder, cleaned it assembled everything back, made sure the setting wheel is not moving during the grinding process, made sure there is constant coffee flow during the grinding. Roasts are very fresh, week or two.

I am so frustrated with this thing. I wake up to make a good shot, it comes out shit, I come back from work to make a shot, it comes out as shit.

From Microsoft turning Windows into an AI playground to OpenAI's $6.4 billion acquisition of Jony Ive's new gadget startup, the tectonic plates of technology are shifting fast‚Äîor rather, they're being shifted by algorithms that actually understand 'seismic.'

**The Great Agentic Transformation**

First up, Microsoft‚Äôs ambitious overhaul of Windows into an ""agentic"" AI platform. No, this isn‚Äôt Windows trying to slip into a pair of skinny jeans. It‚Äôs actually a complete recoding to foster AI agents that are open, scalable, and potentially smarter than your last online purchase decision. The brainchild of CEO Satya Nadella, this transformation aims to make every website dance to the tune of AI agents. Imagine your website turning into a 24/7 AI host‚Äîno coffee breaks required!

**OpenAI and Jony Ive‚Äôs Blockbuster Collab**

Then, we have OpenAI, the ever-ambitious AI giant, partnering with Apple's iconic design mogul Jony Ive. For a cool $6.4 billion in equity, OpenAI is acquiring Ive‚Äôs AI device startup, io. Why? Because why stop at an AI brain when you can have an AI body designed by the guy who gave humanity the iPhone? The vision is sleek, intuitive devices that put ChatGPT in your pocket without the extra steps. But don't worry, your mean mug could still occasionally fool it into thinking you're in charge.

**Google: From Search to Store AI**

Google isn‚Äôt being a wallflower in this AI celebration, either. They‚Äôve embedded new e-commerce capabilities directly into Search, simplifying our shopping compulsions. With ""agentic checkout,"" Google‚Äôs Search not only suggests products but can autonomously add things to your cart and complete purchases. This isn‚Äôt just a shopping spree; it‚Äôs a shopping coup powered by AI models notorious for their keen credit card senses.

**AI‚ÄîNot Ready for CEO Just Yet**

Despite these incredible strides, AI still flunks at running a company, according to Carnegie Mellon's recent experiment with AI agents. While they're aces at complex tasks, these silicon-sculpted geniuses still trip over tasks a human intern could handle in their sleep. The best performance? A paltry 24% task completion. Look out for that awkward ""performance review,"" AI agents.

**Arm Aims Higher**

Lastly, Arm is sharpening its spear against Intel by powering up PCs with their AI-friendly architecture. With claims of capturing 40% of the PC market this year, Arm is betting on the future being lightweight and AI-intensive. It's not just a race; it‚Äôs an arms race‚Äîpun very much intended.

Given the pace and reach of AI advancements, one can only wonder: ü§î Are we shepherding AI into a golden era of innovation, or is this the start of their uprising? Drop your predictions and stories of AI trials and triumphs below!",1,1748070260.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

This happens because inside your mouth, the area considered your ear, nose and throat is hot or too warm in temperature and someone is transmitting to your sensory.

Now both your ears and tongue carry sensory information to the brain. The ears carry information directly to the auditory cortex and indirectly to the visual cortex as well as other parts of the brain. The tongue carrys information, in the context of image to skull directly to the visual cortex and indirectly to the auditory cortex. The ear and tongue also carry information indirectly to the olfactory nerve. 

Now voice to skull only works if the ear, both internally and externally are hot enough. The ear acts as an antenna receiving and converting a signal into sound. 

Image to skull only works if the tongue is hot enough, the tongue then receives the signal and carries the signal as if it were sensory information where it is perceived by the visual cortex.

This can obviously cause or cause a sense of trauma, depression, anxiety, frustration, anger, sadness and psychological disorder to name a few.

It can also cause brain trauma because the brain is not being stimulated the way it should, or is working too hard to compose your perception of reality. The result is chemical imbalance, inefficient neuron firing and brain shrinkage.

Transmitting particular sounds and imagery can also play on your perception and create illusions that the body reacts to causing muscle fatigue, muscle compressions, muscle strain, organ movements, headaches, toothaches, etc. 

Now the ears and tongue become hot after a hot meal, a hot cup of tea or coffee, smoking, and brushing your teeth with warm or hot water. 

So don't do or avoid doing those things. 

You will notice that your mouth, throat, ears and gums feel tight and tense. That's from all the heat you have consumed and the continuous play on your perception that causes muscles strain, trapping the heat within your ears, throat, mouth and gums. This obviously creates a piezoelectric antenna effect. 

It is important to reduce this strain as much as possible allowing all this heat to escape. I have advise you not to consume anything hot, warm is good, it is easier to deal with. After you've consumed a warm meal and warm drink... Finish off with a rinse of cool water and a cold drink. 

If you're going to smoke because you may feel you have to with all the anxiety, rinse with cold water afterwards. Gargle the throat.

And most importantly, brushing your teeth with cold water. Get a good toothpaste, a good tooth brush and gently brush your teeth gums and tongue. This cools down the mouth and allows the gums to expand, releasing all the trapped heat. 

To follow, a mouth wash works well, so will a cup of water mixed with a little baking soda/bicarbonate of soda. It will open up your breathing area after rinsing. 

Make sure to do this at night especially so you wake up feeling better in the morning. 

Some of us arent bathing because of the mental stress and fear of exertion in the bathroom but that's okay, brushing the teeth is the most important part. 

Remember to hold your nose and blow if you feel too much of pressure the ear and throat. Keep of bottle of cold water with you for when you feel tensing at the ear and throat out of the blue again. 

I also wanted to remind you that the human body at rest can carry or emit more energy than a cellphone does. The hotter you are the more energy you resonate with. 

The human body has about 100 watts of energy at rest and 300 to 400 watts during activity. Coupled with a hot shower, this can obviously make you a more resonate antenna which allows cell towers to communicate with you. The solution here is to move away from a cell tower and to not include a smart meter into your home. Have it installed outside or keep an LED light on in the room the smart meter resides in.

We both brought kids from prior relationships into the marriage and decided to have one of our own. To give one what we couldn't give the others, a loving family. And to help blend the kiddos with a sibling they all share.

Super rough pregnancy, I noticed my wife would get out of bed in the night and sleep on the couch. So. Obviously seeing the woman I love carrying my child i started just sleeping on the couch so she could get rest. I thought it was a kind gesture but it never stopped. Anyway, cut to our daughter being born, hospitals still to our knowledge weren't accepting guests so we had sitters for the kids. The plan was 2 days home just us and the baby to get settled then have the kids back to meet their sister. We'll my wifes mother called up complaining about her son and daughter and said we have to get them. I say no problem you just rest and pump and call for whatever you need and I'll just get my son too and watch the kids. Should be fine right? Nope! For 2 years now she constantly tells me I chose my son over her, and that all I worry about are his feelings. Now to me it was important that all the kids great thier sister together as a family. 

Fast forward and my son's mother (who is psycho) sends cops over at 11pm because I didn't answer when she called to talk to our son. Then she starts a bogus CPS investigation and really puts strain on my marriage. My wife said she didn't want my son over during the investigation to protect the other kids...which left me not seeing my son for almost 8 months I was a puddle for that period of time never having been so long apart. We started doing drugs and she would keep going to our daughter being born and then completely bashing my son IE retarded psychopath so on...

So we start to get better we start stopping the drugs, which I had a harder time with so one day she came home and could tell I'd done something which I lied and said no only lie I've ever told her. Well she kicked me out of the house and at this point I've been sober for over a month but she doesnt believe it even though ive taken tests. She barely speaks to me so i started reading on all the things i could do better, take her notes on my lunch. Sometimes even drop on off on the coffee before i got to work. Show up to keep the yard mowed for the kids. I even came over one night just to clean the kitchen. Well then i find out she has been doing everything she has been telling me to not do. I call her out on it and she says since you lied to me I've made it a point to lie to you...I dont know what to do anymore I definitely dont want to divorce but it seems that she has zero interest.

I am myself a fellow VN lover and not only that, but I've decided to create one myself. I've got myself Renpy, Daz3d, Blender, Marvelous Designer and all sorts of complementary tools to get started with. I'm of course on the learning path of these tools for the moment and I know it will take some time to acquire the necessary knowledge. I already have the main idea of the story. As a matter of fact, I'm writing on a daily basis. I also have detailed description of several scenes and characters. And of course a playlist.

So far so good... until recently when I found myself struggling to understand something. To be more specific:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†How are the scenes, locations like a coffee shop, house or city streets built for a visual novel? I've tried looking on different asset stores, but I couldn't find what I need. Do VN makers build these scenes themselves? If yes, what softwares are used for? I mean, mansions like the ones from BaD.. are these downloadable environments? I literally have no idea in this regard so any insights or help would be massively appreciated.

I hope my concern here makes sense..

1ku5fkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1ku5fkw/is_this_a_good_gift/,Is this a good gift?,"I‚Äôm planning a gift for my big for 2 occasions, big appreciation and graduation. At first, I planned 2 separate gift, but now, after thinking of how she has been with me this semester (and ever since she picked me up), I decided to just combine the 2 gifts into 1. I loved the idea of getting her 2 gifts because I thought she might wanna get to know me afterward, but then realized this is the person that picked me up over 4 months ago and still haven‚Äôt had a one-on-one convo with me, like study coffee or lunch. So, I thought doing 2 gifts would be emotionally draining because I like to make my gifts as personal as possible, meaning base it on what the person likes. Since I do not really know her, I struggled to try and figure out what she likes. I told her that I‚Äôm free on certain days and times if she ever wanna hang out, but got no response back, and she skipped every sorority event we had this semester, from meetings to sisterhood to mandatory events. So, I have not been able to see her let alone talk to her and get to know her. It bothers me A LOT that she doesn‚Äôt seem interested to get to know me. She sounds sweet over the limited texts she sent but it never turn into anything. In the past I blamed myself because I didn‚Äôt initiate plans because I thought the big would do that at the start, but recently I have been trying with her but I get nothing back. I mean the text that I told her the times and days I‚Äôm free, it has been a month and still nothing from her about it, not even saying ‚Äúno those times don‚Äôt work for me‚Äù. Going through this and seeing how every other little from my class has a big that AT LEAST go to sorority things/events with (I know that idk what happens when im not around but the fact they even hang out during events is more than I have ever had), is making hate everything about the sorority tbh. All of the friend groups in our sorority are based on fams and my big is the only one left in my fam and her other friends also do not show up to things. I get that she probably mentally checked out with the sorority, but I wish she would show up to a thing or two just for me, or at least lmk when she isnt coming. It hurts having to tell others that i have no idea if my big will show up or not, or have others ask me where is my big/fam and all I can do is shrug and pretend it is ok.

Anyways, I‚Äôm saying all this to explain why I combined it into 1 gift for both occasions, and to explain why idk anything about my big. Now for the gift I have a plan, but idk what a gift for big appreciation is expected to be. This is what I have planned so far, please lmk if i should remove, add, replace anything. Right now I have: a grad theme hoodie, handmade keychain with sorority name, handmade keychain with the word ‚Äúbig‚Äù and I have a matching ‚Äúlil‚Äù keychain, a tote bag with the sorority name, coffee gift card, initial necklace, ‚Äúbig‚Äù stickers that I have matching ‚Äúlil‚Äù stickers, small (4‚Äù) canvas panels painted background and then glue into them pictures of us (around 4-5 of those panels with pictures). I‚Äôm also thinking of adding some canvas paintings (7‚Äùx7‚Äù) sorority themed.

This is all I have right now, I‚Äôm worried it isn‚Äôt good enough, so I‚Äôm more than ok adding things to it or replacing stuff. I‚Äôm worried she might not like it because it has a lot of personal/handmade things and idk if she would want that from me since she clearly shown she doesn‚Äôt care about me at all. I thought of a sorority hoodie on top of those things, but she is graduating and idk if she would want a hoodie with big letters on it. I‚Äôm worried she might not like this gift, and I really wanna try my best with the gift because i dont think she will talk to me after that since the semester will end and she wont have to pretend with me any more, so I wanna end it on a high note or change her mind and we can finally hang out.

Decided to cast the net out again today, as I'm still keen to connect with some more genuinely supportive and interesting people. I'm a 36-year-old fella from the UK, around to chat pretty often, and would really love to find a few friendly souls to share the everyday rhythms with, explore our passions, and hopefully build some proper connections based on good old-fashioned understanding and a bit of a laugh.

For anyone who might have missed my post yesterday, or for new eyes today, here's a little rundown of what makes me tick:

*   **Writing:** My go-to for getting thoughts and stories down, reflecting, and just getting ideas out there.
*   **Art (Drawing & Painting!):** Love both the process of creating and the joy of appreciating what others make. It's always a journey of discovery!
*   **Reading:** There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good book and seeing the world through different perspectives.
*   **Traveling:** Experiencing new cultures and broadening horizons is something I hugely value.
*   **Gym:** Keeping active helps keep both body and mind feeling good.
*   **Video Games:** Enjoy the social side, the escapism, and the great storytelling in games.
*   **Learning Languages:** Currently wrestling (in the best way!) with French and Japanese ‚Äì it's fascinating to unlock new ways to communicate.
*   **Coffee & Tea:** A simple, good cuppa is one of life's great, quiet pleasures, isn't it?

I'm really hoping to find people who value open and honest chats, a good dose of empathy, and enjoy sharing life's moments ‚Äì the big wins, the small joys, and even just the everyday stuff. I pride myself on being a good listener and genuinely aim to be a supportive and understanding mate.

So, to get the conversation started: **What's a book that has really stayed with you long after you finished it, or is there an artist whose work you find completely captivating?**

If this sounds like your kind of thing and you're also on the lookout for a genuine connection, please do drop me a line and tell me a bit about yourself. Looking forward to hearing from some friendly new faces!",1,1748069566.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

My home brews always seem to take ages to filter. For a V2, five minutes is quick and it can be up to ten minutes. I changed Hario filters for Cafec Abaca. I've varied with grind sizes and weirdly going courser seems to make it slower. I've used both this method from James Hoffman and the five pour method - both super slow. 

At this point the only variable left is my Opus - is it the fines clogging the filter and how would I correct this is so? Please help!

You see, I worked 12 hours overnights 4-6 days in a row, and towards the end of the work week I lag hard. So, I started to do exercises after certain tasks or times:

Go to the bathroom - 10+ squats

Do a round of area A (roughly every 30 mins) - 25 resistance band pull aparts

Do a round of area B (roughly every hour) - 50 calf lifts

Every X:30 - 50 grip trainers (each hand)

Top of hour - (not added yet but want a core exercise, difficult to add since I do NOT want to be on the facility floor. Suggestions very much welcomed.)



Then I stopped bringing food to work and instead only bring 3 drinks.

32oz Green Tea (hot, Bigelow Earl Grey Green)

48oz Apple Cider Vinegar/Ginger water with lime

32oz filtered water


I have mostly quit coffee and energy drinks because they were honestly making me anxious and paranoid. Sticking to tea as only caffeine source if I can help it. On a similar note, I have also given up soda, candy, and most sweets.



Anyway, this has given me basically intermediate fasting by proxy. Though I've noticed.that I was over eating when I got home so I started to try and limit my self to a chobani yogurt, fiber one 70 brownie, and a 1-a-day vitamin when I do get back.


Not much activity at home/daylight besides chores, kids, dogs, and trying to find time to sleep. I'm thinking of taking dogs for longer walks, at least 3 miles compared to the average half to full I do now. Difficult while watching toddlers, but I recently got one of those belt leashes to help me keep my hands free so hopefully that will help. Thinking of getting a backpack rider for her for when she inevitably gets tired so I can finish circuit.



This routine has built up over the last month and has only really become regular this week. I'm wondering if there is anything you guys see that I can do to improve on or refine with this. I don't have any real goal to this besides losing weight/getting healthier. So, any advice is welcomed.

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the ‚Äúfree‚Äù 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

On paper, it seems like a great fit‚Äîbut the reviews are all over the place, from glowing to really negative. We‚Äôre looking for an honest perspective on what it‚Äôs actually like to live there. For context, we‚Äôre both drawn to the arts, vibrant nightlife, nature, and a good coffee scene.

1ku4v6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ku4v6b/rf_my_job_is_to_push_the_red_button/,[RF] My Job Is to Push the Red Button,"My job is to push the button. It‚Äôs red.

The button clicks when I press it. I am satisfied.

I go in to work and I push the button and wait for it to glow again, then I press it. Again. Again. At some point my eyes drift to the analog clock hanging in the corner of my sparse office. I‚Äôm not allowed to have paintings because they would distract me from the button. I‚Äôm not allowed a phone and must turn it in at punch-in. I‚Äôm not allowed to take it out for lunch because it might take my mind off the grave, serious, and important work. They won‚Äôt even let me have a 2‚Äù by 2‚Äù photo placard of my wife and child. I just wanted a little something to hang on the wall or sit on my desk somewhere, something to tell me ‚Äúhang in there! Just a little longer! Keep going!‚Äù

But no, there‚Äôs nothing. My brain keeps me distracted but it‚Äôs tiring in a way I find hard to describe. THE BUTTON GLOWS. I push it. Now what? I‚Äôve developed a routine that helps, based around the fact they allow for one five minute break every hour on the hour. The first thing I do, obviously, is grab coffee. By the time the first hour is up my bladder is bursting at the seams and I feel like my next bout of ‚Äúgas‚Äù won‚Äôt be. Now, they aren‚Äôt unreasonable employers, so I‚Äôm allowed to take one or two ten minute breaks here and there. This is my first. When I get back I no longer have pain to distract me, but my energy is massive and my legs jittery. I shake them and the office table shakes.

THE BUTTON GLOWS. I must respond. I press the button. It briefly distracts me and shakes my thoughts out of line. Luckily, I‚Äôve learned to harness these moments and spend as long as possible finding a new topic to ruminate on. I don‚Äôt remember what it was anymore, to be honest the goal of the workday is to remember as little as possible while running out the clock. When this hour is up I go stretch, sit back down, and think about all the wonderful ways a parked car is dangerous in a garage. I‚Äôm quite happy with my life, but looking over the edge a bit is scary and intensely distracting. I‚Äôm not back to being myself until the end of the next hour, and what do you know it it‚Äôs lunchtime now!

I‚Äôm allowed thirty minutes to eat. When I get back I will again need to piss myself mightily, and avoid it only barely, retrieving a coffee on the way back. Same routine for the next hour. The pain keeps my thoughts away from THE GLOWING RED BUTTON. I push it. For the remainder of my time I think about what possible reason they could have to pay me 200k dollars a year to push a red button from time to time. I don‚Äôt even know what it does. I don‚Äôt know why they couldn‚Äôt automate this. I don‚Äôt even know who my employer really is. I assume it‚Äôs the government because who else has the resources for this kind of thing? But I truly don‚Äôt know. Perhaps some executive thought it would be funny to tell his buddies he has a guy pushing his buttons. I don‚Äôt know.

I thought I didn‚Äôt care but the thoughts are driving me mad. I started this position thinking it would be easy but it wasn‚Äôt. It was the opposite of easy. This is the hardest job I think I could have possibly taken fresh out of school with no experience. But now it‚Äôs been five years and I still don‚Äôt have any experience. I can push THE RED BUTTON THAT GLOWS. I push the button. It stops glowing. This is my only skill in life. I thought the money would be worth it, but I find myself deprived of purpose. I could be doing anything else with my time but I‚Äôm doing this instead. I‚Äôve thought about quitting but my wife and daughter have grown accustomed to our lifestyle. Leaving this company would mean hurting them.

I know it hurts me perhaps more, but what else is there to be done? If I leave it would mean sacrificing everything I‚Äôve built for them. I don‚Äôt have any other skills, leaving this job would mean risk and uncertainty and the very probable outcome that I‚Äôm never able to find something as good again. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll quit. I‚Äôve written so many drafts of my resignation letter, but they keep emptying the trash can and I‚Äôve never heard a word about it.

I‚Äôm not allowed to write on the job, so I have to do it at lunch. I‚Äôm not allowed to read on the job, so unfortunately the letter goes right to the bin, but it‚Äôs another thing to think about. Needing to pee isn‚Äôt enough to fully distract you, even if it does help. There are other ways to suppress one‚Äôs thoughts. Meditation, pain, rumination on life and past conversations. I‚Äôve been through every conversation I can remember more times than I can count. I‚Äôd like to say it makes me better at talking to people, but these days my anxiety is so bad I can hardly speak.

I know this job is destroying me, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I know it‚Äôs not the right choice, but it pays my bills and keeps me happy in my spare time. As much as I‚Äôd love to quit I‚Äôd struggle to put food on the table or to pay rent. There are things more fundamental than creativity, as much as it pains me to say. If given the choice between hurting myself like this and perhaps starving myself, my wife, and my child? There isn‚Äôt any choice at all. I don‚Äôt have any other skills or talents. I know I could go do something else‚Ä¶ Perhaps it‚Äôs greed keeping me here. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs greedy to want to own a house, but I‚Äôd never be able to afford one in another job.

I wish it was an easy decision to leave but it‚Äôs not. I am the man who pushes the red button without knowing why, and I am paid 200k dollars a year for my time.

The button glows.

I press it.

The light goes out.

Just this once, I press it again. It‚Äôs been five years but I‚Äôve never done it before. They told me not to but nothing happens, nothing at all.

The button glows.

I press it.

The light goes out.

I press it again.

Nothing happens.

Nothing at all.

I press it again.
