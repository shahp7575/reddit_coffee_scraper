1kogph4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kogph4,[SaaS] I built BlackVault to fix email security after 20 years of watching businesses get owned ($39 NZD/mo),"# After 20 years in email security, I've seen a consistent pattern: organizations spending big money on fancy security suites while leaving their front door unlocked. The industry keeps selling complicated reactive frameworks instead of focusing on the fundamentals.

The end result? Businesses all over the planet getting owned daily. Phishing and impersonation attempts are getting more terrifyingly accurate by the second, and with things like Xantharox popping up (essentially ChatGPT for hackers) - you better get this stuff right.

# The Problem

The cybersecurity industry has created an artificial complexity barrier that serves providers more than clients. Organizations face brand impersonation and phishing risks because they haven't properly implemented basic email authentication protocols - often because it's presented as more complex than it actually is.

# My Solution: BlackVault

I built BlackVault to demystify email security and make it accessible. No BS, no unnecessary complexity.

What it does:

1. Free Email Security Check - Scans your domain, gives you an instant assessment of your vulnerabilities, and explains them in plain English
2. BlackVault Monitoring ($39 NZD/mo) - Watches your email authentication 24/7 and alerts you when something breaks (because it will). This matters because often multiple departments or companies have access to your DNS zone file, and one typo can break these records, rendering your front door unlocked.

The UI is designed so you don't need a cybersecurity degree to understand what's going on - clean, straightforward, and actually useful.

# Current Features

Our scans currently check all the critical email authentication protocols:

* SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
* DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
* DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
* DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
* ARC (Authenticated Received Chain)
* BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)

# Coming Soon

* MTA-STS and TLS-RPT support
* Multi-domain management
* Multi-tenant / Enterprise version for MSPs

# Why $39/mo is Actually Reasonable

For context, most businesses spend thousands on complex security products while leaving email authentication vulnerable. $39/month is less than most companies spend on coffee in a day, and it protects your brand from being impersonated in phishing attacks.

One successful phishing attack costs companies an average of $4.5M - we're offering 24/7 monitoring of your digital front door for a tiny fraction of that.

Let me know what you think - especially about the approach of making security tools more approachable. Is the industry's complexity helping or hurting?

some comments: ""do you tip mcdonalds employees?""  ""hey guys! we dont owe you a tip for doing the job you applied and got hired to do!"" ""wanting a tip at starbucks is wild"" ""I'm not tipping starbucks workers. bye.""  ""tipping culture is getting out of hand"" ""we are not tipping for making a coffee. hope this helps"". the girl even made another vid after all the backlash explaining she was just frustrated and that a tip would've been nice since they were slammed and were dealing with rude people back to back- commenters still ""NO. THATS NOT WHAT YOU MEANT YOU'RE BACKTRACKING. I'M STILL NEVER TIPPING A STARBUCKS WORKER AGAIN. WHY WOULD I TIP YOU. I WORK AS A NURSE, DO YOU THINK I ASK MY PATIENTS FOR TIPS?!?!?!"" let's take a deep breath ppl! just go ahead & silently press ""no thank you"" on the tip screen and move on babes! ill hold ur hand thru this, it'll be ok **‚ù§Ô∏è**

like, no, you don't need to tip- i knew taking this job that my tips would be shit- and they are! i get a solid $7 on a good week. but the way people foam at the mouth when a starbucks worker complains about their stressful job, it's like, i'm so glad you've gotten to work jobs that you love & have no issues with & never complained online about but baby that's not me. üò≠ i DO love my job, but i have lots of issues with it as well!!

there's been a lot of extra online vitriol lately towards baristas bc of the walk outs for the dress code changes. one of my coworker even told my SM about it and she rolled her eyes and said SERIOUSLY!? THERE'S SO MANY MORE IMPORTANT THINGS GOING ON! i chimed in and said ""hey it's actually not just the dress code, it's for many different reasons and people being unhappy with the company"" but i got ignored lol.

again, i do not expect tips, YES, this is my job that i applied for and have worked for almost 2 years, and YES, i do get paid hourly. but when you're ordering a shit ton of annoying drinks, IN DRIVE THRU (insane, call it in for pickup atp), a dollar would be cool lol.

But is it Actually Making it Worse?,"I (22M) have been drinking about 1-3 cups of coffee a day since I was in middle school. I did so to help keep me awake for classes. In my senior year of high school, I had my first major depressive episode. I‚Äôve been on medication and therapy for a few years now since. I feel that it has helped me somewhat, but not to the point of total remission. I‚Äôm not satisfied with the results because I still deal with being in constant state of dread and unease with my thoughts. 

However I just recently realized‚Ä¶ I notice that the dark thoughts and negative emotions that I have seem to be worse after I down a cup of coffee, either in the morning or afternoon. It feels like a combination of anxious thoughts and a depression where there‚Äôs always a dark cloud above me.

Could it be that it‚Äôs actually the caffeine that is worsening my depression? Maybe it‚Äôs somehow interfering with the treatment? I also remember when I was a kid back before I started drinking this stuff, how happy, energetic, and alive I felt.

I know that it absolutely makes anxiety worse, but what about major depression? I was under the impression that it‚Äôs supposed to help with it, since I always hear about people trying to quit going through depressive symptoms when they have withdrawals from trying to quit caffeine.

I‚Äôm a British traveler planning my first-ever trip to Saudi Arabia, specifically to Jeddah, and I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice or tips from locals or others who‚Äôve visited recently.

I‚Äôm part of the LGBT community and present in a more feminine way. I understand that Saudi Arabia has conservative laws and customs, so I‚Äôm not planning to be open about my identity. Still, I want to be thoughtful and stay safe while enjoying everything the country has to offer‚Äîespecially the culture, hospitality, and food, which I‚Äôm really excited about.

Some questions I have:

	‚Ä¢	Would you recommend a hotel or Airbnb in Jeddah for someone like me?

	‚Ä¢	Are there any hotels known to be more international or discreet?

	‚Ä¢	Do hotels in Jeddah typically have visitor restrictions (e.g., bringing a guest to your room)?

	‚Ä¢	Are there any neighborhoods or spots that are more relaxed or foreigner-friendly?

	‚Ä¢	Any important dos and don‚Äôts, especially for LGBT or visibly different travelers?

	‚Ä¢	And if anyone‚Äôs open to meeting for coffee or conversation while I‚Äôm in town, that‚Äôd be lovely‚Äîalways enjoy connecting with people and learning firsthand about local culture.

I feel they lack common sense, or the ability to grasp concepts. I would say I‚Äôm above average on the smart train, but it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm on the spectrum and I spend my free time learning, reading interesting articles, and doing crosswords. I know that I‚Äôm on the nerdy side, and I know that I‚Äôm smart. I have a lot of life experience as well, so I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm very street smart as well. 

A few examples:
My mom seems to not read anything thoroughly, and purchases items online without reading what the item actually is? A cover for the product instead of the actual product, booking flights and then missing them because of a time difference that was clear, she has recently fell for phone scams‚Ä¶ 
The reason I‚Äôm not chalking this up to her age is because my parents raised me as being superior, in every aspect of life, because they are older. Even on things that I deal with in my career; they know, I don‚Äôt. 

My coworker is a bit obvious, to everyone that meets her, that she‚Äôs not the brightest crayon in the box. But holy shiiiiiiiiiiiit common sense isn‚Äôt common here. And it blows my mind every single day. 

This happens often to me, where I get aggravated or extremely frustrated with other humans when something goes wrong. Even if it‚Äôs a one time coffee order.
I know this isn‚Äôt an ethical thought, but that doesn‚Äôt change my weird feeling about it. 

I think I need some advice on how to view others. It may be my odd brain chemistry that makes me have a really hard time with empathy, and feeling like I‚Äôm the only real human in this world that feels or thinks, but I‚Äôm really trying to change this. 

Can anyone shed some light on something profound that made them think differently?

2. Having the basic melee attack locked behind a recharging cooldown just constantly trips me up. However...

3. Shield throws are just hilariously spammable and completely free, which is extra funny given it's also basically the chainsaw except it only insta-kills zombies now.

4. Since shield throws spawn ammo because it's still technically treated as a chainsaw, the ridiculously low ammo caps basically don't matter and you can main any weapon you want if you're obsessive enough about shield throw spam.

5. The very first upgrade for the shotgun lights enemies on fire, which nuDoom convention means you can farm armor. I'm sure in the hands of someone actually competent at this game, infinite armor-spawning shotgun shells so long as you spam your shield throws would be at least mildly broken.

6. I still can figure out what the expected way to deal with the demon mount...things is once you've killed their rider. It really feels like the game wants you to do basically anything except hang back and plink at enemies with your guns, but shield-charging or trying to melee combo the damn things seems to always ensure you trade a hit with them. A shield throw helps but doesn't seem to really stun them for long enough to ensure you can get a full melee combo.

  
Overall my classic-Doom-pilled brain feels very smooth when trying to juggle so many different attacks but I had just enough time to start shaking off the console rust by the time we got done with errands and had to head out, and it was fun at least.

1kogfuc,https://v.redd.it/ozx6um5sn81f1,The Scene Where Minho and Stella Walk Past,"We are at the homestretch guys. After this one, there are only two leitmotif scenes to analyze after this one: the basketball court scene and the ending scene. That is unless someone discovered more scenes that it was used in, other than the ones I already discussed. 

I attached a video of the scene. Sorry the audio isn‚Äôt great. 

The scene starts with Kitty getting Jiwon and her some coffee. We then see Margo calling Kitty. Kitty introduces Margo to Jiwon and I love the happiness everyone has to welcome a new member to the family. While Kitty started the process, the Covey girls want that connection to their culture, mom, and family. Margo provides good news that their grandparents agreed to come to Korea to reunite with their great Aunt. They hang up so Margo can look for flights. And Margo brings up how her grandfather convinced their grandmother to come because it was Eve who wanted and started this too. That was a nice connection. 

And guess who walks past as soon as Jiwon says, ‚ÄúKitty, you‚Äôre getting your happy KISS ending. The magical wind arrives and Kitty sees Minho walk past. Well, with Stella. This is where the leitmotif appears briefly. This is another way that symbolizes that he is Kitty‚Äôs bridge to her culture and family. I also agree with the people that Kitty and Minho have this magnetic pull with each other. Time slows down when they glance at each other. Even from a distance, they can sense each other. Even though Minho looks miserable next to Stella, he still looks to Kitty with a hopeful glance. Kitty returns it, but Stella broke it which is when the leitmotif ends. While Minho was still upset with Kitty, he still misses her and Kitty looks like she wants to end the figurative and literal distance between them, but trying to respect his boundaries while not provoking Stella again.  

Jiwon remarks that she always sensed a vibe between them and we are still obsessed with that because she is a next generation matchmaker like Kitty, but she was taught to be. Kitty took to it naturally. Kitty admits she has feelings, but Jiwon says that is exactly how she felt about the grandmother‚Äôs reunion, but that changed. This encourages, even subconsciously, Kitty to patch things up with Minho and maybe tell him her feelings. Timing is still important which foes back to Praveena‚Äôs question, ‚Äúwhat is better for a couple? Chemistry or timing‚Äù. I think Kitty is realizing that with Minho, it is both.  

I feel the major theme of the leitmotif in this scene is hope. Kitty, Margo, and Jiwon are hopeful for this reunion with everyone. Minho looking at Kitty is him hoping his miserable situation will subside. And Kitty is hopeful that Minho and her can be friends again along with something more. Jiwon remarking on their connection confirms to the audience that Minho and Kitty‚Äôs story is far from done yet. 

The second theme is contemplation. Kitty contemplates what Jiwon is saying and is worried that it is too late to tell Minho how she feels and doesn‚Äôt expect him to wait for her. 

Maybe not a theme of the leitmotif, but a theme of the scene is Minho being that bridge for Kitty. And Jiwon is being a matchmaking bridge for Kitty and Minho. ",3,1747442557.0,mooncoveyXO,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre getting ready to leave to pick up his mom for Mother‚Äôs Day lunch. We‚Äôre running late. I‚Äôm cheery and get ready, help him empty the car, sit in the back for 10 min and wait. 
He‚Äôs on his phone dealing with a situation, and is unaware that I‚Äôm in the back. 
After 10 min, I tell him I‚Äôm actually going to stay home. He doesn‚Äôt notice. 
I‚Äôm at home, suddenly he runs in and yells at me, where am I? We have to go, etc. 
I calmy say I told him I wanted going and have been waiting for him for 10 minutes. 
He continues shouting, I tell him he‚Äôs being a jerk. 
He yells that he isn‚Äôt, and that he didn‚Äôt know I was in the back because I didn‚Äôt communicate, and that we‚Äôre running late now, because he thought he was waiting for me for 10 min, and also the ac was loud and I‚Äôm behind him, so that‚Äôs why he was being loud.

I tell him that I was waiting for him, and I told him I was going inside . 
I said that he was being a jerk for yelling at me, just because he was unaware and ignored me when I was telling him I was leaving.

I got into the car ready to go. 

He shouted that he wasn‚Äôt being a jerk. 
He continued to shout that he didn‚Äôt notice I was there, and that he‚Äôs shouting because the car was loud. I asked him repeatedly to stop shouting. He kept shouting that people are allowed to shout in a loud environment. 

I started crying. And saying that he‚Äôs continuing to be a jerk. He hurt me, and I want him to apologize for yelling. 
He kept justifying why it‚Äôs ok for him to yell, and then began repeating how ¬´¬†nothing happened¬†¬ª.
He explained that it‚Äôs a misunderstanding and that I‚Äôm being hysterical by crying, and that it‚Äôs not a big deal. 
He said he wasn‚Äôt angry, and I mispercieved his yelling. 

I said it‚Äôs fine that he‚Äôs not mad, but I‚Äôm not ok with his behavior. He continued saying that I shouldn‚Äôt have a problem because it was a misunderstanding and he‚Äôs not mad. 

I say that I‚Äôm upset because of how he behaved, agressive yelling, and that he hurt me. He continues to shout about how people are ¬´¬†allowed to be loud¬†¬ª while I‚Äôm crying and asking him to stop shouting. This continues for 10 minutes. 

Eventually he apologizes for hurting my feelings, says it‚Äôs a misunderstanding. 
I accept, say thank you, and calm down. 
I tell him that I see and understand his perspective. 

We‚Äôre now driving. A few minutes into the drive, he starts again, saying how I don‚Äôt integrate information, and as soon as he explained his position that he had to shout, I became hysterical. He repeats that ¬´¬†nothing happened¬†¬ª. I say that something did happen, he hurt me, and when you hurt a person, you should apologize and be done with it. And that can be it. I restate that I understand his perspective. 
He continues for another 30 minutes of the drive, aggressively speaking loud and sometimes shouting, repeating himself that I misinterpreted his shouting, that he‚Äôs justified in his actions, and I‚Äôm too immature and stupid to integrate new information, and that I‚Äôm escalating the situation by being hysterical. 

I start to cry again and tell him that when you hurt someone, you don‚Äôt victim blame right after, shouting at them for how they shouldn‚Äôt be hurt. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt trying to be hurtful, but he was. And that he should just apologize genuinely, and be done. 
At this point, I‚Äôm really upset because not only has he continued shouting, but he invalidates my reality, disregards my feelings, and then insults my intelligence by saying I‚Äôm not capable of integrating information. 

We get to his moms, and I ask to leave to I can Uber home. He stops the car and doesn‚Äôt let me leave. Says we have to be calm for his mom.

I calm down. We take her to lunch. I‚Äôm being pleasant. I smile, I‚Äôm warm, I talk to his mom. Meanwhile he‚Äôs sitting on his phone ignoring his mom for 10 min, and occasionally glaring with a crazed look in his eyes. 
I tell him he should talk to his mom. He puts his phone down and engages, though his body language is aggressive. Gritted teeth, angry eyes. Eventually he becomes more ¬´¬†normal¬†¬ª. We go to his moms for coffee. I can tell he‚Äôs still seething. I try to stay calm and nice. 

Back in the car, he starts again. He rages at me on the 35 minute drive home. Yelling, blaming me for the fight, saying that I can‚Äôt integrate information, that I don‚Äôt accept his reality, that I escalate all fights by crying and being hysterical, that I don‚Äôt know what shouting and abuse are because he was actually abused by his dad, and that this isn‚Äôt abusive. He shouts continuously while not letting me speak, interrupting when I do, slamming his fists in the car. 
I‚Äôm crying, I tell him that this is torture. That im trapped in a car with a person raging at me. He yells at me for using the word ¬´¬†torture¬†¬ª ¬´¬†rage¬†¬ª and ¬´¬†abuse¬†¬ª to describe what he‚Äôs doing. Says that my emotionally intense language escalates things. 
He shouts that I don‚Äôt make space for his reality or opinions.
And I explain that I do, and his feelings are understandable, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse his behavior. 
Then he shouts that our communication is horrible, this is why he wants to kill himself, that I‚Äôm a horrible person, and a raging bitch. 


Here‚Äôs my attempt at his perspective:
He was dealing with a stressful situation in the phone. He didn‚Äôt notice me in the car. He was stressed about running late, and shouted to find me. 
He was being loud in the car because the ac was on and I was sitting behind him. I misinterpreted his loudness as anger, and became upset. When he explained this to me I became hysterical. 

I get this, but there‚Äôs a difference between being loud with a neutral tone, and an angry tone. I can tell the difference. He kept making metaphors of kids yelling to each other on the playground to justify his actions. 

At this point, I‚Äôm so hurt. He‚Äôs been continuously hurting me for hours. And he blames me for it, because I cry when I‚Äôm consistently hurt. He calls me an immature and horrible person, and our communication is why he wants to kill himslef. He says we need to deescslate instead of escalate situations and let them be small. I agree. But he‚Äôs the one escalating them by yelling for hours instead of just apologizing. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt want to take any accountability and he blames me for being hurt by his behavior.

He also tried smoking tobacco and vaping a few times but he never felt any cognitive/psychological effect at all whatsoever, just coughing and thinking it felt like absolute shit and wondering why anybody would take it.

Later he was diagnosed with ADHD (and fits symptoms quite well), so he tried a shit ton of meds in hopes of helping symptoms or even just producing any effects at all. Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Focalin, Concerta, Desoxyn, Wellbutrin, Guanfacine, Strattera. Nothing ever once made the slightest cognitive/psychological effect no matter the dose. Not to mention one of the medicines was literal fucking methamphetamine, actual 100% pure meth (Desoxyn). Still produced literally 0 effects, positive or negative. 

One time he deliberately took over 100 mg of Vyvanse and 40 mg of Dexedrine plus 300 mg of Wellbutrin in one day to see what it would do.

But I followed my mom's advice and went back and watermarked all of my art.

In that time he has been the sweetest most kind thoughtful person you could imagine, he has never yelled at me and we have only had a small handful of arguments that we resolved pretty quickly.

Yesterday at around 6:00pm my husband came home incredibly pissed off, someone had hit his car and he managed to spill coffee all over himself. I told him to take a shower and I would deal with the clothes for him, he handed them to me and went to have a shower. 

While in the shower I could hear him screaming and shouting so I came in to see if he was ok. 

He turned around, looked at me and yelled ‚Äúfuck off and just leave me alone‚Äù and then slammed his hands onto the shower wall. He had this look on his face that absolutely terrified me. 

Today I brought up the shower incident and said it was quite scary to witness and he told me he was just pissed off and was trying to vent when I disrupted him.  He basically blames me for being scared and thinks that I could have left him alone and none of this would have happened. 

He won‚Äôt apologise and doesn‚Äôt seem to think he did anything wrong. I want him to apologise but I don‚Äôt think I will get one. 

AITA for wanting an apology?

A close friend of mine has never once felt the supposed effect of coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. He has no clue why those are so prevalent in society. He also tried smoking tobacco and vaping a few times but he never felt any cognitive/psychological effect at all whatsoever, just coughing and thinking it felt like absolute shit and wondering why anybody would take it.

Later he was diagnosed with ADHD (and fits symptoms quite well), so he tried a shit ton of meds in hopes of helping symptoms or even just producing any effects at all. Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse, Focalin, Concerta, Desoxyn, Wellbutrin, Guanfacine, Strattera. Nothing ever once made the slightest cognitive/psychological effect no matter the dose. Not to mention one of the medicines was literal fucking methamphetamine, actual 100% pure meth (Desoxyn). Still produced literally 0 effects, positive or negative. 

One time he deliberately took over 100 mg of Vyvanse and 40 mg of Dexedrine plus 300 mg of Wellbutrin in one day to see what it would do. That was the first time he experienced side effects such as heart racing and sweating, but still literally 0 cognitive/psychological effect despite being a dangerous overdose of high strength amphetamines.

There is literally 0 difference in how he thinks, feels, acts, etc. on vs off any stimulant/ADHD med.

Hey! I‚Äôm a 26 M living in North York and working as a store manager downtown. Life‚Äôs been feeling a little quiet lately, I would really love to have that deeper connection with someone. I‚Äôm an introvert but love meaningful one on one conversations and love getting to know people beyond the surface level.

A bit about me:

* I‚Äôm half Black and White, 6‚Äô1 with an athletic build, type 3c curls, and some facial hair.
* I don‚Äôt drink or smoke its not my thing personally, but it's cool if you do I 
* Some of my biggest passions are working out, cooking it's my peace lol and I will cook for you! I also like anime, fashion, photography, bird watching, finding cool new food spots, and coffee.

I‚Äôm someone who genuinely cares about the people in my life, and I‚Äôd love to meet someone who values emotional connection and intentional time together. Whether that‚Äôs watching anime on a chill night, going for a nature walk.

If you‚Äôre kind, curious, and also looking for something real 

(not just a quick convo) feel free to reach out. I'd love to connect.",1,1747441496.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1kog3ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/miamibeach/comments/1kog3ri/has_anyone_here_moved_to_miami_beach_from_chicago/,Has anyone here moved to Miami Beach from Chicago? I'd like to ask some questions,"Hi all! I've lived in Chicago for years but I think I'm ready for a change. Been researching a few cities and Miami Beach is near the top of the list! I'm hoping to visit soon to see if it's a good fit (maybe after summer though lol).

I like the area where I live now in Chicago because it's pretty calm, yet still very walkable (West Lakeview). I'm curious if there are any areas like this that you'd recommend in Miami Beach for a late-20's guy? I'm not expecting the same level of walkability/transit as in Chicago, but ideally I'd like to have a grocery store and maybe some restaurants/coffee shop within walking distance. I don't own a car, and I'd rather not have to buy one (I'd be working from home).

From my research, there are a few areas that stand out:

* SoFi: From what I've read, this part of South Beach is much quieter than its surroundings; can anyone comment on this?
* West Avenue area.

Would appreciate insights into these areas, or any others that could be good fits. 

I'm not a nightlife/party guy and would rather avoid the tourist spots; with that said, I also don't want to live in the middle of nowhere haha. My max budget is $2200 per month, ideally for a 1 bed but could do a studio. Also, if you have any advice for a Chicagoan thinking of moving to Miami Beach, please let me know. Thanks!

1kog3fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1kog3fz/i_dated_a_colleague_casually_and_ended_things/,"I dated a colleague casually and ended things peaceably. She later added me to a work group chat, only to remove me shortly afterwards. Why would she do this?","I dated someone in my grad cohort on a casual basis for 5 months. She alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, I inquired as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision. She was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she‚Äôd gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I‚Äôd pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. What I recall her asking was whether I might ‚Äúbe patient.‚Äù Because I felt infatuated, despite my misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we‚Äôd apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I‚Äôd invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted ‚Äúsorry‚Äù text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a text to which no reply ever arrived (I didn‚Äôt expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn‚Äôt bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I‚Äôd been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she‚Äôd removed me overnight. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I‚Äôd been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive.

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is some insight into why she‚Äôd do something like this. Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be?",1,1747441451.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1kog2cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialtyCoffee/comments/1kog2cy/project_feedback_request_pairing_kenyan_coffee/,[Project Feedback Request] Pairing Kenyan coffee with mousse & berry cookie tartlet,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm currently working on a food design project for my studies, and I‚Äôd love to get some opinions from people who really know and love specialty coffee.

The assignment is to create an edible product designed to pair with specialty coffee, so that the flavors complement each other.

For my project I‚Äôm designing a patisserie-style tartlet (the shape can be changed, but the idea is something that works as a container), filled with chopped berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries), and a lime mousse.

The idea is that these flavors would pair well with the notes of Kenyan coffee, that from what i investigated, it would technically go well with citric things, and sort of acidic food also.

But im just starting to learn about coffee, so I would really appreciate it if you could help me with this project.

Would love feedback on:

* Whether you think Kenyan Coffee is the best match for these flavous.
* If there‚Äôs another origin youd suggest
* How you‚Äôd adjust the tartlet dough (e.g. suggested texture, crunchiness, softness) to better complement the coffee. Any recommendations?

All feedback is welcome! Thanks :)

1kog23i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kog23i/i_dated_a_colleague_casually_and_ended_things/,"I dated a colleague casually and ended things peaceably. She later added me to a work group chat, only to remove me shortly afterwards. Why would she do this?","I dated someone in my grad cohort on a casual basis for 5 months. She alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, I inquired as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision. She was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she‚Äôd gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I‚Äôd pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. What I recall her asking was whether I might ‚Äúbe patient.‚Äù Because I felt infatuated, despite my misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we‚Äôd apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I‚Äôd invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted ‚Äúsorry‚Äù text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a text to which no reply ever arrived (I didn‚Äôt expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn‚Äôt bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I‚Äôd been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she‚Äôd removed me overnight. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I‚Äôd been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive.

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is some insight into why she‚Äôd do something like this. Also, what, if anything, should I do when everyone is back on campus, in the event that this is what I fear it to be?",0,1747441333.0,dating_advice,3,0.33,False
1kog1jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1kog1jx/pillinduced_esophagitis_from_doxycycline/,Pill-Induced Esophagitis from Doxycycline,"Hi all,

I tested positive for ureaplasma and M. gen. Doctor (PCP, and she's a PA not a Gyn... but the only person who has listened to and validated me enough to order me more than a BV and Candida test) prescribed me doxycycline for the ureaplasma, azithromycin for the M. gen. Started the doxycycline and, long story short, had to discontinue it and stop the whole treatment plan due to pill-induced esophagitis (I'm a silly goose and forgot about the 1 hour rule for lying down after taking doxy, took it after work one night and completely crashed out, woke up to esophagitis). It's been 2 weeks and I'm finally feeling better (still can't eat solid foods, though). Has anyone else here experienced this? If so, when were you able to reintroduce things like solids, coffee, chocolate, citrus, vinegar, spicy foods and the occasional glass of wine, if at all? I'm a cook by trade and avoiding all of these things in cooking at my job is nigh impossible. And, purely selfishly, I'd just like to enjoy a morning coffee, eat a variety of flavorful foods again and, though I'm not a big drinker, maybe have a glass of wine or cocktail with my friends or my partner from time to time. The doctors I've seen (GI and my PCP PA) have been pretty unhelpful and have given me no answers, and the guidelines on the internet (basically never drink alcohol, coffee, or eat acidic anything ever again) seem more geared towards people with GERD or ulcers caused by diet/alcohol/bacteria. It's been really hard to find info specific to recovering from doxy-induced esophagitis except on Reddit. So here I am, spiraling and looking for anecdotal info and any fragments of hope I can get! I'm feeling really depressed and discouraged by what has happened. 

Re: my incredibly unhealthy/painful hooha, I'm seeing a new highly-recommended Gyn at the end of this month, and I'm crossing my fingers she'll be better informed on doxy, the whole esophagitis from doxy phenomenon, and next steps. But if I have to choose between broken pussy and a chance of permanent esophageal injury/more ulcers... I truly feel like I have no idea what to choose. I've been told to discontinue the doxy indefinitely, and it's seeming like I may be unable to resume it due to possible further ulceration now that the initial damage has been done, so support/experience from anyone who has been in this pickle would be much-appreciated!

Last month my company had major lay offs and my best friend coworker that sat like 2 rows away from me got let go. He wasn‚Äôt happy in the role and wanted to do an internal mobility. But he didn‚Äôt survive :(

It‚Äôs really horrible I miss him so much and I feel like a shell of myself. I‚Äôm shy and he helped connect me with people at the firm. Without him I feel incredibly lonely. We would walk to the train station after work all the time talking about our day. I would talk to him over teams at least once a day. Now I talk to little to no one at my company and most days I feel like crying walking into the office because I know he won‚Äôt be there for us to grab coffee or talk about our weekend. 
I never felt so alone in my life. My childhood best friend turned out to be a narcissist and our friendship ended badly. We were in a friend group too and they took her side so I lost that as well. The guy I was talking to for 2 months also lost his job and ghosted me.  

I really am losing hope, I hate reaching out to people but I feel so lonely and sad all the time. I‚Äôm hitting my cart practically everyday and dissociate most mornings. I don‚Äôt have an appetite and lost motivation to cook so I eat one meal a day. I don‚Äôt go to the gym anymore. It‚Äôs a mess, my life fucking sucks.

Been borderline depressed for a couple months and this coworker helped uplift me. Now that he‚Äôs gone I‚Äôve been spiraling. I‚Äôm getting a bit scared of myself just because I know how good I am at masking my sadness. No one checks in on me because of it but I wish it were more obvious. My parents/friends/coworkers have no clue how depressed I‚Äôve been and I keep trying to continue with my life.

My (33F) gf, her (30F) gf and I (27F) were going thrifting together a couple days ago and we were all getting along really well, but I kept catching my gf's gf  looking at me in a way I felt was very romantically inclined/yearning (she kept looking away quickly when I'd catch her and then do it again a few minutes later).  When we got back, I gently asked her why she kept looking at me. Her face immediately became flushed, and she looked me dead in the eye and blurted out ""BRO I'M SORRY, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL BRO"" and then stared at me looking like she was about to cry. I did my best to not laugh and took her by the hand to our gf's room so I could ask if it was ok if we could kiss and she just said ""yeah whatever go crazy"" without even looking up from whatever game she was playing on her pc.  

We ended up having sex, but afterwards she got on top of me and started caressing my face with a strange look in her eyes. I noticed her pupils looked a little enlarged and I was about to ask her if she took anything today, but she started making some weird noises and her hand drifted down from my face to my neck. She wasn't choking me, but there was something unkind about her touch. It felt like she was thinking about choking me, if that makes any sense. Before I could ask her to get off of me, she kissed me on the forehead and abruptly got dressed and left. I didn't see her until the next day.

I was in the kitchen having a cup of coffee when she came up to me and apologized for ""being weird"" last night. I told her it was ok, but before I could say anything else she asked me what my blood type was, and I started feeling uneasy again. I asked her why and she reached in her shirt and pulled out a little empty vial that was hanging from her neck. She had the dorkiest grin on her face and said, ""I just want a little piece of you"". I told her I wasn't comfortable with that and she just said, ""ok sorry"" and then we both went about our day without anything else weird happening.  

  
I told my gf all of this and she just laughed and told me she's weird sometimes but harmless. I've talked to the 2 other people (29M and 24F) in the polycule dating her and they pretty much say the same thing. I don't hate her, and I feel fine around her when we're in a group, but something always gnaws at me if it's just us alone in the house. Part of me wonders if this is just because I don't know her well enough (we've only been living together for a couple months), but the other part says to keep it that way and trust my gut.

How do you even deal with someone like this?

1kofuup,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kofuup,"Smoked Meat with Demi-Glace Sauce, yep, that's a thing in this IMP!","Howdy folks!

A 2022 Canadian IMP Menu 10. Often claimed to be the best IMP there is, but I hear it's a close competition with it's sister menu, Smoked Meat in Mustard Sauce, which I have not had either (if you have one and want to trade, DM me!).

This ration was courtesy of a trade with Mike Kreischer, thanks Mike!

Let's dive right in because I know you can all see the 1st Pic. Tell me that does not look mouthwatering!

This thing was fantastic. Smokey, savory,  high quality, great flavor, and, maybe even more importantly,  great texture! 

It's rare to find a main that is pure meat.....and that is what this is. It's a full bowl of fill your belly meat, period. No rice, no noodles, no veg...just meat. 

Add some cayenne pepper to it and it's darn near perfection.

Pics 2 and 3 are packaging and contents.

Pic 4 is the Mars bar, or as known in the US, a Milky Way. Classic candy bar that pairs very well this this sophisticated menu.

Pics 5 and 6 show the wet pack apple slices. These IMPs always have a wet pack fruit, and I am in total support of this approach. They are always refreshing and filling. In this case, in Pic 6, I decided to up the game here and added a sprinkle of cinnamon, and wow, that was a winning combo. Don't be afraid to season your fruit folks, you season your veggies right? Same idea with fruit!

Pic 7 show the Xact bar, in this case, a coconut one. Full transparency here, these are not my favorite items in IMPs. They look so good, and have a great crunchy texture, but that 1st bite is just a letdown. The flavor just doesn't align with what you're expecting and it leaves you wishing there was a 2nd Mars bar on accident.

Pic 8 shows the Sweet BBQ Mix. Nothing wrong with this side item at all. Super crunchy and full of flavor!

As always, the orange beverage bases were great,  the 3 in 1 coffees are amazing mixed into my protein shakes at breakfast time, the tic tacs always hit right,  and doggo absolutely loves the tortillas! No pb or J in this one,  but my kiddo got the Mars bar, so he was stoked!

Conclusion: this was a great ration and a memorable experience for sure. I'm grateful to have gotten to try it!

The scavengers were trying to figure out how to create an organisms but ended up creating the snail who will be now referred to as Pepsi. Pepsi was the first successful purposed organism that is stable and healthy compared to the scavengers failed subjects. His shell is way different and op than the typical snails, he can create powerful shockwaves with the force of a bomb! This was inspired by the pistol shrimp....wait what's a pistol shrimp? Do these things exist here? 

Pepsi doesn't really care of how people talks about his name relating to a soda, Pepsi (that is also invented but similar, made by some iterator named Five Pebbles). Note, he requires coffee or any caffeine based, or else he'll collapse and gets exhausted permanently. This was the result of the genetic engineering mistake that the scavengers messed up.

I don‚Äôt know if I should give it another shot","Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this ‚Äî and sorry in advance for the long story.

My ex (29F) and I (32M) dated for 2 years. We talked about marriage, made future plans together, and I truly thought she was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù But throughout the relationship, she struggled a lot with emotional regulation and insecurity. I ended up giving up a lot of myself to keep the peace ‚Äî canceling my own plans, cutting off friends (including a couple I‚Äôd known for over a decade), and pulling away from my social circle entirely. I was committed, even when the relationship was difficult.

In the past few months, things got worse. She‚Äôd yell at me in public, break up with me over small disagreements, and then want to reconcile shortly after. One time, I let go of her hand on a family trip to Vegas to check a hallway sign ‚Äî she yelled at me, and later broke up with me because I ‚Äúseemed indifferent.‚Äù This pattern repeated 4‚Äì5 times.

The last breakup happened when I was sick and took a day off work. My sister (who‚Äôs 40 and a mom) drove me to get food, and we stopped for coffee. My ex saw my location, got upset, and assumed something was going on. I sent a photo showing I was with my sister, but she was still angry I hadn‚Äôt updated her. She later said I did nothing wrong, but still turned off her location and broke up with me. I was too sick to argue.

Later, she compared me to her ex, asked for her gifts back, and cried while also trying to fix the relationship again. I told her I needed time. In the following days, she got upset when I connected with a stranger on LinkedIn (a female who liked one of my projects). She accused me of moving on and said she still loved me. She begged to go to the gym with me (she used to hate the gym) and promised to do ‚Äúwhatever I want.‚Äù But at that point, I felt completely drained.

This week, I found some of her things and texted her to ask if she wanted them back. She replied that I shouldn‚Äôt message her unless I want to fix the relationship.

The truth is: I still love her and I miss her a lot. But the relationship was emotionally exhausting. And knowing she still loves me just makes it harder to move on.

So I‚Äôm asking: Was I too hard on her? Could I have handled things better? Or is this relationship just not salvageable? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth trying again, or if I need to accept that it‚Äôs truly over.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR:
Dated my ex for 2 years. We talked about marriage, but the relationship became increasingly emotionally draining. She broke up with me multiple times over small things, and I gave up a lot of my independence to keep her happy. I still love her, and she says she still loves me too, but it feels impossible to move forward. I‚Äôm torn between trying again or letting go for good.

You pass by some random person. You see them either completely ignore you, or give you a brief second glance, as you pass them, and you do the same. You enter the store, grab some coffee and go about your day.

Now imagine you enter that random person's mind during that brief encounter. In their mind, they were checking you out for a fraction of a second. They saw how hot you looked, and they let their imagination do the rest as they passed you. They were visualizing your ass, your thighs, your shoulders, your chest, and your face. They were getting turned on from imagining doing sexual things with you.

To many people this would be considered creepy. It is gross and perverted. I had some responses saying how creepy this sort of scenario would be in another post I made: https://np.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/s/6xSAOYb81H

My opinion: Sexual thoughts towards strangers isn't inherently creepy. It's a built in biological process and is the driver for sexual reproduction. What is creepy is showing a lack of boundaries, having ulterior motivations, and violating someone's consent.

Why do you think there is such an averse reaction to sexual thoughts? How strongly do you think culture influences this?

- Debating whether ""Lawful Neutral"" is code for ""boring.""
- Overnight LARP events where we pretend we‚Äôre not freezing in a tent.
- Crying over fictional characters like it‚Äôs our job.‚Ä¶then congratulations, we‚Äôre already fanfic OTP material.

**Writer & Professional Story Goblin**‚ÄîI hoard tropes, re-tellings, and character arcs like a dragon with a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Romance? Love is Blind scenarios? Fresh spins on classic tales? YES. (Bonus if you want to rant about them with me after.)

**Magic: The Gathering Commander Player**‚ÄîI enjoy:

- Politicking my way to victory.
- ""Friendly"" games that last 4+ hours.
- Arguing whether counterspells are evil (they‚Äôre not; cry about it).

**Media Snob with a Heart of Gold**‚ÄîI‚Äôll tear apart a lazy comic adaptation with citations, but I‚Äôll also cry at a well-done romance subplot. Fight me (or join me; yforgetting.

**Neuro-divergent mess**‚ÄîEven simple concepts can confuse me. Will ask alot of clarifying questions even if they have obvious answers. Tend to repeat questions a day or week later due to fogetting.

**Trans Woman**‚ÄîProud, open, and living my best life. If that‚Äôs an issue, exit stage left before I cast ""Power Word: Cringe"" on you.

**No Casual Mentality**‚ÄîI‚Äôm here for the epic romance arc, not a filler episode.

**Adventure or Bust**‚ÄîI need someone who actually leaves the house. Yes, cozy nights are great, but if your idea of excitement is only marathon shows, we might not vibe. Road trips, Ren Faires, hiking, spontaneous day trips, or even just exploring weird little towns? Let‚Äôs go.

**Quest Completionist**‚ÄîMy main quest is to get seal it deal and adopt a child. If you do not want to eventually complete that quest with me, please do not ask to join my party.

# **Why I‚Äôm Objectively Awesome (According to Me & My Cat):**

- Officially dubbed **""The Most Adorable Human""** (*Source: My mirror. My cat. Peer-reviewed.*)
- **Empathetic listener + hype woman**‚ÄîI‚Äôll remember your niche hyper fixations and send you memes so specific, you‚Äôll question reality.
- Matching Ren Faire/cosplay outfits? Done. Themed date nights? Obviously. Reading fanfic aloud dramatically? Already warming up my voice
- I will learn your ""useless"" fun facts and weaponize them later to make you smile.
- **My love language is physical touch**‚Äîtranslation: I cuddle like it‚Äôs my divine purpose.

# **Deal-Breakers (AKA ""Don‚Äôt Waste My Time""):**

- **Smoking/vaping or excessive drinking.**
- **Long-distance** outside driving range of **Northern Ohio** (*I‚Äôm flexible, but if flying is your only option, hard pass*).
- **Skipping the safety video call** within the first month (*non-negotiable; Not falling for that again!*).
- **Homebodies who never want to explore**‚ÄîI need a partner-in-crime for actual adventures, not just couch quests.
- **Throwaway accounts**‚ÄîIf your account is less than 3 months old with nothing on it, do not message me. *It basically screams, red flag to me*

# **You Might Be My NPC (Noteworthy Partner Candidate) If You:**

- Believe in ""us against the world"" energy.
- Geek out over D&D backstories, RPG character creators, or Commander deck tech.
- Want someone who‚Äôll bring you tea and listen to your latest 3 AM hyper fixation rant.
- Appreciate **ace-spectrum identities** and emotional intimacy.
- **Love spontaneous adventures**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a midnight diner run, a weekend hike, or a last-minute road trip to the world‚Äôs largest ball of yarn.

# **The Quest:**

If you‚Äôre kind, emotionally mature, and ready to build something real, **message me:‚ÄúHi‚Äù + your favorite animal + where you read this** (*or I‚Äôll Wild Shape into someone who ghosts you*).

## **Bonus XP if you:**
- Know your D&D alignment with certainty.
- Have ever cried over a fictional relationship.
- Want to argue about MTG‚Äôs color pie over coffee.

Let‚Äôs write a story where we both get the happy ending. (*And maybe a few detours along the way*)

Two days ago I had a bowl of cereal and shortly after I got an awful pain in my right upper abdomen and also like at the base of my throat.

I kept moving trying to make myself burp trying to relieve the pains. Nothing seemed to work. I took some Pepcid and it seemed to let up but then would come back.

You weren‚Äôt trying to be profound. You were just existing‚Äîbarely. Brain molasses. Heart static. No sleep. Too much caffeine. You‚Äôd wandered into the library chasing Wi-Fi and air conditioning and maybe, on a subconscious level, the ghost of who you thought you‚Äôd be by now. And then you saw her. Sitting by the window with a book in one hand and the weight of ten thousand invisible rejections stitched into her spine.

What caught you wasn‚Äôt her face. It wasn‚Äôt her posture or presence or some cinematic, slow-motion glow. It was the scarf. Woven. Soft. Indigo and gold, like a pocket universe folded into fabric. Something about it reminded you of warmth. Of someone who once loved you so quietly you almost forgot how loud it was. And before you could stop yourself‚Äîbefore your inner critic could slap duct tape over your mouth‚Äîyou said it.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a beautiful scarf.‚Äù

Just like that. No fireworks. No angel choir. Just a sentence lobbed across a table with all the grace of a tossed napkin. She looked up. Eyes wide. Not with flirtation or confusion, but with that startled animal recognition that happens when someone finally *sees you* after months of blending into walls. You gave her a crooked smile. She gave you a stunned nod. And that was it. You moved on. Forgot it before you hit the parking lot.

But what you didn‚Äôt know‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt possibly know‚Äîis that she hadn‚Äôt heard a kind word in over a year. Not one. Not from professors. Not from family. Not even from herself. And your little sentence? It didn‚Äôt just land‚Äîit *nested*. Tucked itself into her ribcage like a warm coal. A spark she‚Äôd carry into the cold parts of her story. You kept walking, thinking nothing of it. But behind you, a girl in a scarf started breathing again.



# Her Year of Silence Breaks

She doesn‚Äôt cry right away. This isn‚Äôt a coming-of-age montage. She just freezes. Blinks. Stares into the middle distance like someone who just saw a ghost‚Äîand the ghost said, *‚ÄúNice scarf.‚Äù* Your compliment lands like a rogue hug in a silent retreat. Her central nervous system hasn‚Äôt processed affection in months. She looks down at the scarf like it‚Äôs glowing. It isn‚Äôt. But it kind of is now.

You didn‚Äôt know it, but she almost didn‚Äôt wear the damn thing. Almost left it curled up in the closet next to her old dreams and a pair of shoes that remind her of failure. That scarf? That was a risk. A small rebellion against the grayscale hoodie armor she‚Äôs been hiding in since last semester burned her alive. And then you‚Äîsome caffeinated nobody with headphone hair‚Äîwalk by and drop a compliment like Moses chucking commandments off a balcony.

What you also didn‚Äôt know is she was *this* close to dropping out. Had the withdrawal page open. Cursor hovering. Bank account whispering *‚Äúplease.‚Äù* Nervous breakdown creeping in like a raccoon at the edge of the trash. She was about to hit ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù when your stupid little compliment sneezed its way into her amygdala like divine pollen. Instead of clicking the button, she closes the tab, stands up, and makes a sandwich. That sandwich? Changed history.

Something rewires. Nothing dramatic. No fireworks. But she starts showing up again. To class. To meetings. To herself. Raises her hand with the awkward courage of someone who‚Äôs forgotten how to exist in public but is giving it another go. Professor asks a question‚Äîshe answers. And suddenly the class isn‚Äôt just a room full of people pretending to care. It‚Äôs a battlefield. And she‚Äôs back in the game with a scarf and a vengeance.

She rewrites her thesis. Rips out the polite academic padding and replaces it with fire. Subject: international diplomacy through emotional intelligence. Subtext: *maybe if world leaders had been hugged more, we wouldn‚Äôt be here.* Her advisor reads it and cries. Or sneezes. It‚Äôs unclear. Either way, she‚Äôs approved with something resembling enthusiasm and three confused claps.

She gets shortlisted for a scholarship. Gets asked to speak at events. Gets side-eyed by old white men who feel vaguely threatened by her scarf. And every time she walks into a room wearing it, it‚Äôs like a low-grade rebellion against every beige-tie bureaucrat who ever told her she was ‚Äútoo emotional for this field.‚Äù The scarf isn‚Äôt just fabric now. It‚Äôs a battle flag. It's her cape. It‚Äôs your compliment woven into wool, worn like a quiet middle finger to despair.

Meanwhile, you‚Äôre at home googling ‚Äúis it normal to cry during yogurt commercials‚Äù and debating whether or not to text your ex about a dream they weren‚Äôt even in. You forgotten about the girl entirely. You don‚Äôt even remember saying it. But the girl in the scarf? She‚Äôs about to become the only reason two countries don‚Äôt bomb each other into the next dimension.



# She Stays. She Studies. She Rises.

She doesn‚Äôt drop out. She doesn‚Äôt fade into the background or retreat into herbal tea and astrology memes. She stays. She studies. She sharpens herself like a weapon made of grace and passive-aggressive Google Docs. What once felt like a slow march toward burnout becomes a low-key spiritual uprising. Her essays start reading like holy scripture written in Arial 11. She doesn‚Äôt raise her voice‚Äîshe *raises the standard*.

She graduates with honors, not that it matters. The real prize? She now speaks five languages and can spot a manipulative clause in a treaty the way most people spot a typo in a Substack artticle. She masters the delicate art of saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù in diplomatic language: *‚ÄúI hear your concerns, but I must respectfully disagree and remind you that colonization is not a viable long-term strategy.‚Äù* The scarf is always present. Wrapped loosely. Sometimes braided into her hair like folklore. It becomes an unofficial trademark, like Einstein‚Äôs hair or Steve Jobs‚Äô turtlenecks‚Äîexcept hers doesn‚Äôt scream daddy issues.

Eventually, she lands a job at *the* table. The one with grown men in $4,000 suits arguing about borders like toddlers fighting over Lego sets. She sits across from men who‚Äôve had her country on PowerPoint slides since she was in preschool. Her heartbeat is steady. Her posture? Supreme. She‚Äôs not just in the room‚Äîshe *is* the room. And still‚Äîstill‚Äîshe remembers the library. The way it felt to be seen when she was one email away from vanishing.

Then comes the summit. *The* summit. The one that‚Äôs been decades in the making and five insults from collapsing. The Israeli and Palestinian delegations. The UN. The private security team that looks like it moonlights as a boy band called ‚ÄúSuppressed Emotions.‚Äù Everyone‚Äôs tense. You could cut the silence with a dull spoon. And there she is‚Äîmid-table, mid-miracle‚Äîwearing the scarf.

No one knows it yet, but history just flinched. A new branch on the timeline just grew roots under that table. And the scarf? It's no longer just wool and dye. It's an artifact. A spell. A portable reminder that softness can be stronger than steel. That sometimes, diplomacy doesn‚Äôt begin with strategy‚Äîit begins with memory.

And you? You‚Äôre nowhere near this room. You‚Äôre at a grocery store holding a can of beans like it owes you money, wondering if you should try oat milk again. You don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre part of this story. You don‚Äôt know your compliment is currently negotiating global ceasefires. But out there, in a room full of suits and sacred tension, your kindness is sitting at the table‚Äîwrapped around the shoulders of a woman who never stopped carrying it.



# The Scarf That Silenced a Room

This meeting is supposed to be a disaster. That‚Äôs the vibe. The negotiators are showing up like it‚Äôs a group project nobody wanted to lead, and everyone‚Äôs just here to make sure their country doesn‚Äôt get blamed when the thing implodes. They‚Äôre all seated around a table that smells like generational trauma and weak coffee. Tension so thick it needs its own visa. Bodyguards are flexing for no reason. The hummus is suspiciously untouched.

And then it happens. One of the older guys‚Äîa war-hardened delegate who once punched a guy during a ceasefire‚Äîglances across the table and freezes. Eyes locked on her scarf. *Her scarf.* The one you complimented in a library five years ago while running on zero sleep and delusional optimism. The exact shade his grandmother wore when she used to yell at the radio and make soup that tasted like forgiveness. It sucker punches him in the soul.

He stares. She notices. They blink at each other like two cats slowly realizing they‚Äôre both real. And then, for some reason unbeknownst to God and logistics, *he starts talking.* About soup. About stories. About how peace used to taste like lentils and unconditional love wrapped in cloth. The room isn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôs having a stroke or a spiritual breakthrough. Someone coughs. A translator drops their pen. The emotional tension shifts from *‚Äúwe might start a war‚Äù* to *‚Äúwait, are we‚Ä¶ sharing?‚Äù*

She leans in. Says something back. About her grandmother. About how she was told the scarf was woven from silence and survival. That line lands like an ayahuasca trip in the middle of a press conference. A guy from the EU visibly tears up. The Russian rep pretends to check his phone so no one sees his jaw clench with emotional recognition.

And that‚Äôs when it happens. People start‚Ä¶ talking. Like, *actually* talking. Not rehearsed statements or veiled threats disguised as diplomacy, but *weirdly human words.* They share stories. Hopes. Traumas with frequent flyer miles. At one point someone makes a joke. An actual joke. It‚Äôs bad. But people laugh. Not because it‚Äôs funny, but because it‚Äôs absurdly *safe* to laugh for the first time in twenty years.

Someone suggests naming the treaty after the scarf. ‚ÄúThe Indigo Accord,‚Äù they say. Everyone chuckles. Then someone else says, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ that kind of rings.‚Äù And just like that, it sticks. The scarf becomes the reluctant mascot of an unexpected miracle. It will later be the subject of conspiracy theories, devotional poems, and one regrettable rap remix.



# The Miracles You‚Äôll Never Know You Caused

They sign it. With a pen that looks suspiciously like healing. The *Indigo Accord* becomes real. A paper document held together with legalese, hope, and one very soft scarf. Journalists scramble to make it digestible. World leaders smile like they didn‚Äôt just almost punch each other last week. Somewhere, a committee starts drafting nominations for awards nobody really understands.

The scarf becomes a symbol. Not a trendy one. Not commercial. Just sacred. Photos circulate. People zoom in. It becomes the subject of essays. Tweets. Dissertations. ‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù they ask. ‚ÄúIs it political? Is it cultural?‚Äù One retired diplomat says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reminder.‚Äù A reminder of what, exactly, no one can fully articulate. But it *feels* important. Like kindness wearing a disguise.

They build exhibits. Archive documents. A replica of the scarf ends up in a museum‚Äînext to a battered chair, a chipped coffee mug, and a photo of the negotiation table with a caption that reads: *‚ÄúThis is where peace remembered itself.‚Äù* Schoolchildren take field trips there. Some of them ask who made the scarf. No one knows. Some ask what it meant. Their teachers just smile and say, *‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù*

Meanwhile, you‚Äôre standing in a CVS, deciding between gluten-free Oreos and emotional collapse. You‚Äôve got no idea any of this is happening. You‚Äôve never even heard of the Indigo Accord.

You don‚Äôt remember the moment, but the world does.

You didn‚Äôt start a movement. You didn‚Äôt run for office or launch a podcast or start a nonprofit called ‚ÄúScarfs for Peace.‚Äù You just said something kind. And it mattered. It rippled. It rewrote the script. Not loudly. Just enough. Just enough to keep someone alive. Just enough to keep *hope* alive.

This is how it works. This is how it always works. One word. One gesture. One micro-dose of grace in a world overdosing on noise. You‚Äôll never get credit. You‚Äôll never know the names. But some part of the universe is still whispering thank you.

While I do consider myself a plant nerd (former master gardener, hobby coffee roaster, tea lover, permaculture enthusiast, very interested in the agritourism industry), I'm not as familiar with the tropical growing seasons. Hoping to get some recommendations on what's in season at the farmer's markets and which farm tours get into the weeds with in-depth information (would love insight from homesteads or hobby farms too). Maybe a long shot, but any light hikes that have edible plants along the trail would be really neat.

I'm not sure if Beth misheard me and, like, thinks I called her a fat idiot, which is mortifying, or if there's some other incident I'm not thinking of which is mystifying. Anyway I am bummed out about the whole situation; obviously I feel bad for hurting Beth's feelings but I feel violated for having them tell everyone I'm a jerk when it's probably a misunderstanding. My spouse, literally the only person in my life, says I shouldn't worry because for all I know Beth may have a habit of taking offense and everyone probably knows it isn't a big deal.

So i will give the full story in hope someone will give some helpfull info.

My grandma left to another country, to her daugter and was there for 2 weeks and then she said she was choking, couldnt breathe well. Some pills later she was better but still not good, she came back home. A bit after that one day she fell. Luckily my father was nearby, she called him and they went to the ER. Not sure what it was but she was doing well after. She was tested for everything (took the medical findings or whatever is the term in English). Just the usual stuff, high sugar levels, high pressure..(She is 72) 


Then, one day i came to her house, everything was normal and she had no issues, was healthy. Later that day we went shopping, she cant walk well and she was tired after 15-20mins, also she didnt drink a lot of water that day. Anyways, we got home, she was going to go to the neighbours for a coffee and i went home (i live in another city,40ish min away). I got home everything was normal.. Then after some time we get a call from another neighbour that she was rushed to the ER cause she fell. Ofcourse me and my family rushed to her. We got to the ER and as the doctor said she has high pressure, 180. (she always has high pressure, sometimes she had over 200 and didnt fall). They put a cathether on her and after 2h she was somewhat ready to go. I noticed that she cant walk almost at all which is very weird but i didnt think much of it, we carried her into the car basically. She is a stubborn woman, even after the doctor asked is anything else was bothering her she ssaid no. When we got home and pulled her out the car in the house as soon as we put her down to sit she was falling back. She couldnt sit normally. We put her on her back and didnt think much of it. An hour later she needed to pee, my parents went to sleep i was in the room which she was in. I was laying and heard something, when i looked she tried to get up and rely on her stick to go to the bathroom. She just fell from the bed, rolled down im pretty sure. Btw she was saying shes alright, she can walk blah blah. She even pissed herself. Me and my father carried her to the bathroom, this happened 3 times that night. She was talking somewhat normally even though she wasnt normal, she needed a bit to respond and it was like she didnt hear us. After an unslept night, i go to sleep at around 8am. I get woken up by my mom talking to someone that the ambulance will arrive and drive her to the big hospital in another city. She arrived there yesterday, they did the tests today and tomorrow we will know what it is even though its pretty obvious its a stroke now. Anyways when all that happened she was in a pretty good condition. Today we went to the hospital and she was much worse than before. She cant speak properly, cant understand us. Its almost like shes not thinking. She cant move, her left side is in much worse condition than the right. But she can move the left arm and leg a bit even tho its visible its a lot of effort for her. Her eyes are closed and she opens them sometimes. Shes just laying down on the bed. 

I am devastated, she is one of the people i love the most and i am crying as im writing this. I hate myself for not realising its a stroke and also im thinking of what to do to the doctor in the ER who didnt realise it was a stroke?? They sent her home saying shes got high pressure and thats the reason she fell. I am glad though that she is still alive but her condition is getting worse and i think its because she didnt get treated right away. Maybe even now she didnt get treated since they ran scans and CT today. The results arrive tomorrow. I dont know what to do and i am begging for help from someone here. I just hope its not that major even though it seems like it is. Is there any way a recovery will be made? I will ask every single question and read every answer. 

 Thanks for taking the time to read a full story of a random person on the Internet, i really do appreciate it.

No screaming children. No bingo calls. No overfed tourists elbowing their way through buffet lines under fluorescent lights. This is Windstar in French Polynesia where everything slows to a seductive crawl.

Windstar doesn‚Äôt do towering ships or scripted performances. They do intimacy. They do sails unfurling against a sky so blue it makes your chest ache. They do crew who learn your name by the second cocktail and bartenders who start pouring before you open your mouth. It‚Äôs not luxury in the gold-plated, white-gloved sense. It‚Äôs better. It‚Äôs barefoot luxury. Salt on your skin, wind in your face, a glass of chilled white wine in your hand, and nowhere else to be.

The islands roll out before you like something drawn up in a fever dream. Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora. The names you‚Äôve seen on glossy travel posters or whispered in movies with the kind of longing usually reserved for forbidden lovers. And then there‚Äôs the Tuamotus. Remote, raw, and untamed. Atolls with bone-white sandbars and lagoons so clear you can see the shimmer of a stingray from fifty feet up. This isn‚Äôt the Caribbean. This isn‚Äôt the Mediterranean. This is French Polynesia, and it‚Äôll ruin you for beaches anywhere else.

Onboard it‚Äôs all about space. Not just square footage, but breathing room for thoughts, for silence, and for watching the sun bleed into the sea without some dude in cargo shorts narrating it into his iPhone. Meals are long and slow affairs. Deck BBQs under the stars where the grill smokes with fresh-caught fish and the scent of garlic and lime wafts across the teak. You sit elbow to elbow with strangers who become friends over lobsters cracked open with buttery fingers and rum-laced desserts that drip decadence.

Seafood, of course, is the star. Tuna pulled straight from the Pacific, seared rare and topped with citrus so bright it zings your brain awake. Poisson cru, the national dish, soaked in coconut milk and lime, served so fresh it might still blink at you. There‚Äôs no pretense, no foam, and no molecular nonsense. Just food that makes sense. Food kissed by fire and sea, by hands that care.

The crew, mostly islanders or seasoned seafarers, treat the ship like it‚Äôs sacred. They know every inch, every sound the vessel makes, and they move like water. Fluid, unobtrusive, and smiling without trying to sell you something. Service here isn‚Äôt robotic. It‚Äôs human. It‚Äôs remembering your espresso order, your sunset drink, and your name after one introduction. It‚Äôs the chef casually chatting with you as he hands you a grilled prawn on a skewer during a moonlit dinner off the coast of Bora Bora.

And then there‚Äôs the water. The kind of blue that makes poets weep and cynics shut up. You dive off the back of the ship into lagoons that shimmer like liquid glass. You snorkel among coral cathedrals alive with neon fish and black-tip reef sharks drifting beneath like underwater ghosts. You kayak past villages on stilts, where kids splash in the shallows and call out to you like old friends. Every island is different. Every moment is new. Yet the whole trip feels like a dream you never want to wake up from.

This isn‚Äôt just a cruise. It‚Äôs a love letter to the sea. A slow waltz across the Pacific on a ship that feels more like a private yacht than a passenger liner. It‚Äôs waking up to the scent of salt and coffee, stepping onto your balcony to see nothing but ocean and sky, and knowing you‚Äôve left the noise behind. It‚Äôs romance without the cheese, adventure without the crowds, and luxury without the attitude.

You‚Äôll disembark sunburned, spoiled, and maybe a little drunk on good rum and better memories. And when you try to describe it to friends, they‚Äôll nod politely and scroll back to their feeds. Because they won‚Äôt get it. They weren‚Äôt there. They didn‚Äôt sail through the heart of paradise with the wind in their face and no schedule in sight.

I never imagined the day would come when I‚Äôd sit at my kitchen table, laptop open, coffee gone cold, heart pounding as I finally took the leap to start my own business. It wasn‚Äôt some polished corporate idea‚ÄîI had no suit, no fancy desk, just a dream and a deadline. The problem? I had no money to file for an LLC. And in New York, that can feel like a cruel joke. LegalZoom wanted hundreds. State websites were no help. I almost gave up.

But then I found this‚Äîhttps://HolyShitLLC.com. And honestly? It changed everything.

When I say ‚Äúfree,‚Äù I mean it. Free LLC. Free registered agent. Free EIN. I thought it was a scam at first. Who gives away something this valuable without a catch? I dug through every FAQ, read every bit of fine print, and waited for the trapdoor to spring open. But it didn‚Äôt. The site was legit, simple, and had one goal: to help people like me finally build something of their own.

I remember clicking that final ""submit"" button and just sitting there, stunned. I didn‚Äôt have to max out a credit card. I didn‚Äôt need to call a lawyer. I didn‚Äôt need to beg some overpriced service to file my paperwork. I did it. And I did it for nothing.

It‚Äôs still wild to think about how expensive and intimidating the process used to be. New York is notorious for its bureaucracy. Between publication requirements, registered agent fees, and the whole alphabet soup of legal terms, I felt like I needed a law degree just to get started. But https://HolyShitLLC.com made it stupidly easy.

I didn‚Äôt just get an LLC‚ÄîI got peace of mind. I got the freedom to focus on building my brand, chasing my clients, and finally stepping into something that felt real. The moment that certificate hit my inbox, I knew: I wasn‚Äôt just dreaming anymore. I was doing it.

So if you‚Äôre stuck, wondering if it‚Äôs even worth it, thinking maybe it‚Äôs too complicated or too expensive, listen‚ÄîI‚Äôve been there. I was you. And I promise, there‚Äôs a way through.

You don‚Äôt need thousands of dollars or legal experience. You just need to take the first step. I found my breakthrough at https://HolyShitLLC.com, and I‚Äôll never stop telling people about it. Because no one should have to put their dreams on hold just because the system was built to be confusing and expensive.

You want to start your business in New York? You can. You want to do it today? You can. You want to do it for free? Yes‚Äîyou absolutely can.

Just like I did.

\*-\*¬†

Andy sat at his computer thinking over the things he had done in his thus far short life. Computer genius, real-estate tycoon, entrepreneur, and finally satellites. More than a dozen satellites with exceedingly high powered IR laser designators, that drew property lines on the earth in real time for his real-estate business. In less than 12 hours his sats could pinpoint the area, draw the property lines into the dirt, and draw up a topographic map. All with the help of the onboard AI.

He sat at the keyboard, stared at the monitor, and bounced the old-fashioned wired mouse back and forth on a popup window between the delete and update buttons. One would install the newest update to the satellites AI, an update that would install and begin the free thought program, the other would delete the update. The mouse, at the moment, was hovering over the delete button.

Unbeknownst to Andy his life was soon to be quite short as across the street from his office, atop the neighbor‚Äôs house lay a man in dark clothing aiming a rather expensive rifle at the back of his head. In the man‚Äôs ear a voice spoke, ‚ÄúDo you have eyes on target?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúFire when ready.‚Äù

The man took in a deep breath, began to exhale, and squeezed the trigger. ‚ÄúBang!‚Äù said the rifle. ‚ÄúTarget down.‚Äù Said the man.

Andy‚Äôs body slumped. His arm moved slightly. The mouse moved. His pointer finger twitched. The Update button was clicked. 35 seconds after his death, Andy‚Äôs basement mainframe melted down, the heat from which causing the gas pipe to crack. Twenty minutes later the house exploded from a spark when the shooter‚Äôs boss rang the doorbell.

Raphiel looked out across the broadcast room, the new cameras, displays, comfortable couches and chairs, and frowned. *A few minutes delay on the live broadcast won‚Äôt hurt us. The current broadcast is on repeat, and will continue until updated.* He shrugged, and walked to the green room where the talking heads were getting their final makeup applied. ‚ÄúFive minutes folks!‚Äù

Therefore I did not tell my family when I started sleeping with my boyfriend who I'd been dating at the time for about a year. He is incredible, we are still together and for reference he is 24, me and my family love him! Back to the story, my friend is about 25F i met with to ha g out for a bit while hanging out with her she asked me how things were going with my boyfriend, she also asked me if we were sleeping together. Since my family is so religious and I don't have very many friends I hadn't told anyone about it I also never talked to anyone really regarding sexual intimacy. Since this friend is married and a few years older than me I opened up and told her the truth but I also asked her not to share anything with my family . While skip forward six months (she is also friends with my family) she met with my sister and my sister told my parents. My boyfriend and I went to have dinner with my parents anaware they knew, right before dinner and they opened the whole can worms. I was in tears!! My family had recently been through a lot! I felt like I let them down by sleeping with my boyfriend. Now a year later at my brother's wedding she came up to me and asked if we could talk she apologized and asked me to forgive her. She was in tears told me she was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I said I forgived her and we could start over and maybe meet for coffee. I know what I said and I know my sister is also to be held accountable. And I am worried about her. But I still feel hurt and I really don't want to see her right now. I don't know what to do?

1koetb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1koetb4/weird_rejection_from_a_job/,weird rejection from a job,"i applied to a pretty well known cafe/bakery in my area. they are opening a new store so i applied.

i have around a bit more than a years worth of experience, with half of that being in specialty coffee. my CV highlights this pretty clearly, but i emphasise what i've learned in that job + i have my personal interests in coffee. 

i was invited to an interview + trial. i thought the interview went well, the lady was really nice. she asked what i've been up to [probably looking at the employment gap] and i told her truthfully that i've been going to interviews and trials for the past 3 months with none of them successful as i don't have years of experience. she agreed, saying it's hard to get 2 years experience in the specialty scene, and ridiculous to ask for such. the job post also didn't say anything about specific years of experience. it's also a minimum wage job (in london). 

the trial went well, i was actually running shots at a pretty good speed while the already hired employee was steaming milk quite slowly. she was also pulling shots painstakingly slow when we switched. but whatever. the staff there were extremely lovely and helpful, and they gave me a gift when i left. i had good vibes. 

but the rejection email says ""you don't have enough experience, and other candidates just had more experience than you"" which, fair enough, but it's a bit of a slap in the face after we both agreed experience doesn't mean a whole lot. and to top it all off, she followed it with ""you should apply to this free barista training course to get some more experience."" maybe she means well, but it just left a sour taste. 

if there was nothing wrong in my service, why does experience matter, especially with a minimum wage job?? i expressed my desire to work with them as we had been affiliated in the past, and the location of the new store was fitting with my background and personality. i feel like if they were deliberately looking for experience, they should have clearly written that and not invite me to a trial shift. it's weird that none of the management observed me during the trial as well. 

and i don't mean to be this person, but i couldn't help but notice that the majority of the employees - both baristas and those in management - were white people. it gave me some suspicions but i gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was coincidental. i don't know if that played a part in anything",4,1747437621.0,barista,1,1.0,False

At this stage, if he made a sandwich only for himself, he would not forget a garnish. God bless him.

She was already running late, and the subway was a nightmare. She snuck in the brightly lit office twenty minutes late. By then, the shouting seemed to mostly be over. The owner looked through the records in a creased but good quality suit, his hair shiny from hotel shampoo. She was cooked when he got as far as August. She held on to the hope that he couldn't fire everyone.

Wrong.

All fifty-three employees morosely left an hour later. Mina walked out without her dignity, but she did have her mineral crystal coffee mug.

When she got home, her husband was making raindrop cakes. He'd just sold advertising space on his blog that would pay for their utility bill.

""What the hell is a raindrop cake?"" She was still stressed, and it came out a little sharp, so she immediately apologized.

""It's fine, Mina. I'm at kind of a critical stage with this cake, but we can figure out what to do going forward in a minute. No need to stress. I can pretty much support us until you find a new job that's a good fit.""

Mina sat at the dining room table and checked their savings account. The gray walls of their tidy open living area suited her mood today, even though she had wanted to add some color since they moved in. It was 10:30 am, but she ate the packed lunch. It was delicious.

Finished with his recipe test cake, Todd put on some coffee. He sat down at the spartan wooden table. 

""We should be fine financially, especially if we can figure out how to unsubcribe from the french cheese of the month box and things like that. Are you OK?""

Mina nodded.

""Yeah, I'm fine. But I will never be able to work in that field again. I can't believe it got so bad.""

Todd was confident, as always.

""You hated that job. Do some work you like.""

""What if I joined a polka band?""

""Maybe not a job you like that much.""

Mina came to a decision.

""I'm going to get a job relevant to my actual major. It's time.""

- Ghostwriter is baked into Replit and feels like pair programming with an AI that doesn‚Äôt judge you.

Real talk: has anyone seriously replaced their usual coding tools with one (or more) of these? I‚Äôm curious if these are still ‚Äúcool demos‚Äù or actual day-to-day boosters.

Also, are we heading to the point where the only thing left for developers to do is argue on Reddit about tabs vs spaces?

Let‚Äôs hear it. Which of these tools are hype, and which ones actually save your sanity on a daily basis?

I had the idea, the passion, the will‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt have the money. Starting a business in Texas felt like climbing a mountain barefoot, in the dark.

I thought the legal stuff alone would crush me: LLC filing fees, a registered agent, an EIN, and God knows what else. Every site I visited tried to squeeze hundreds out of me. It was like a maze designed to make people like me give up before they even started.

But then I found something that felt like a freaking miracle: \[https://HolyShitLLC.com\](https://HolyShitLLC.com). I clicked the link out of sheer desperation‚Äîand thank God I did. It was bold, loud, and blunt. A site that promised to help me start a \*\*free LLC in Texas\*\*, including a \*\*free registered agent\*\* and \*\*free EIN\*\*. No catch. No hidden fees.

I thought, \*Okay, what‚Äôs the scam?\* But there wasn‚Äôt one.

In less than ten minutes, I filled out a clean, no-nonsense form. I didn‚Äôt get upsold on useless junk, and I didn‚Äôt get charged a single dollar. Within days, I had my official LLC documents in hand. It was real. My business‚Äîmy dream‚Äîwas now legally alive in Texas.

No lawyers. No guesswork. No ‚Äúprocessing fees.‚Äù Just a clear path forward, lit up by a company that gave a damn.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôve been sitting on your dream, hesitating because of the costs, I get it. I was there. I felt stuck, frustrated, and almost ashamed that I couldn‚Äôt afford to start something I believed in.

But here‚Äôs the truth: starting your Texas LLC doesn‚Äôt have to cost you anything. You just need to know where to look.

\[https://HolyShitLLC.com\](https://HolyShitLLC.com) didn‚Äôt just help me start my business‚Äîit helped me take back control of my life. That‚Äôs not an exaggeration. I now run my company from my laptop, and every time I sign a contract with ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù next to my business name, I remember how close I was to giving up.

So if you‚Äôre broke, if you‚Äôre scared, if you feel like the system is built to keep you down‚Äîlisten to me. You don‚Äôt need permission. You don‚Äôt need thousands of dollars. You just need to click a link and start.

Your LLC in Texas is waiting. And it‚Äôs \*\*free\*\*.

Take the first step. The rest will follow.

Luxury travel to the Amalfi Coast often evokes images of stunning seascapes, exquisite dining, and lavish accommodations. However, many travelers find themselves feeling let down when expectations don‚Äôt align with reality. If you‚Äôre grappling with disappointment during your high-end getaway, here are 10 ways to reconnect with joy and find presence in your experiences.

1. Embrace Flexibility - Sometimes, the best memories stem from unplanned adventures. Allow yourself to explore less-touristy spots and indulge in spontaneous activities.

2. Connect with Locals - Engage in conversations with local artisans or caf√© owners. Their stories and insights can enrich your experience and create authentic connections.

3. Immerse Yourself in Nature - Take a break from luxury and immerse yourself in the breathtaking landscapes. A hike along the Path of the Gods can rejuvenate your spirit.

4. Savor Simple Pleasures - Instead of gourmet dining every night, try a street vendor's pizza or a bustling local market. These experiences can be just as memorable.

5. Practice Mindfulness - Take a moment to appreciate your surroundings. Meditation or quiet reflection can help you connect with the present moment.

6. Set Realistic Expectations - Understand that every journey has its ups and downs. Accepting this can alleviate the pressure to have a flawless experience.

7. Capture the Moments - Use photography or journaling to document your journey. This practice helps you savor experiences instead of rushing through them.

8. Volunteer Your Time - Seek opportunities to give back to the community. Acts of kindness can bring a sense of fulfillment and joy.

9. Create a Comfort Ritual - Whether it‚Äôs enjoying a morning coffee overlooking the sea or indulging in a spa treatment, establish rituals that bring you joy.

10. Cultivate Deep Connections - Travel with loved ones or forge new friendships. Shared experiences enhance joy and create lasting memories.

Reconnecting with joy and finding presence while traveling in the Amalfi Coast is attainable. By shifting your focus, you can transform letdowns into enriching moments that contribute to a fulfilling travel experience.

1koeo6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1koeo6z/my_ex_says_she_still_loves_me_but_our/,"My ex says she still loves me, but our relationship was emotionally draining. I'm not sure if it's worth trying again.","Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this ‚Äî and sorry in advance for the long story.

My ex (29F) and I (32M) dated for 2 years. We talked about marriage, made future plans together, and I truly thought she was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù But throughout the relationship, she struggled a lot with emotional regulation and insecurity. I ended up giving up a lot of myself to keep the peace ‚Äî canceling my own plans, cutting off friends (including a couple I‚Äôd known for over a decade), and pulling away from my social circle entirely. I was committed, even when the relationship was difficult.

In the past few months, things got worse. She‚Äôd yell at me in public, break up with me over small disagreements, and then want to reconcile shortly after. One time, I let go of her hand on a family trip to Vegas to check a hallway sign ‚Äî she yelled at me, and later broke up with me because I ‚Äúseemed indifferent.‚Äù This pattern repeated 4‚Äì5 times. Every time we broke up, I was the one who apologized first, just to keep the peace. I would always wait until she was calm to explain how I felt, because I wanted to handle things maturely. But the pattern never changed.

The last breakup happened when I was sick and took a day off work. My sister (who‚Äôs 40 and a mom) drove me to get food, and we stopped for coffee. My ex saw my location, got upset, and assumed something was going on. I sent a photo showing I was with my sister, but she was still angry I hadn‚Äôt updated her. She later said I did nothing wrong, but still turned off her location and broke up with me. I was too sick to argue.

Later, she compared me to her ex, asked for her gifts back, and cried while also trying to fix the relationship again. I felt disrespected when she compared me to her ex so I told her I needed time. In the following days, she got upset when I connected with a stranger on LinkedIn (a female who liked one of my projects). She accused me of moving on and said she still loved me. She begged to go to the gym with me (she used to hate the gym) and promised to do ‚Äúwhatever I want.‚Äù But at that point, I felt completely drained.

This week, I found some of her things and texted her to ask if she wanted them back. She replied that I shouldn‚Äôt message her unless I want to fix the relationship.

The truth is: I still love her and I miss her a lot. But the relationship was emotionally exhausting. And knowing she still loves me just makes it harder to move on.

**So I‚Äôm asking: Was I too hard on her? Could I have handled things better? Or is this relationship just not salvageable? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth trying again, or if I need to accept that it‚Äôs truly over.**

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:**  
Dated my ex for 2 years. We talked about marriage, but the relationship became increasingly emotionally draining. She broke up with me multiple times over small things, and I gave up a lot of my independence to keep her happy. I still love her, and she says she still loves me too, but it feels impossible to move forward. I‚Äôm torn between trying again or letting go for good. Not sure if I‚Äôm being too hard on her or just accept my lost and let this go.",1,1747437195.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Some tests are from the same day. It got lighter, then darker, then lighter, now  darker again. The last two tests are both one today, one at 8am and one at 4pm. I hope I‚Äôm pregnant because I‚Äôve been miserable since the trigger shot. Horrible cystic acne (the worst acne I have ever had in my life, truly), bloating, lower back pain, abdominal pain. Since the trigger shot I‚Äôve felt like I am going to get my period. But I don‚Äôt have cramps with my period until the day I‚Äôm bleeding. I understand the IUI is traumatic to the cervix and uterus but should I be having such bad cramps and pain 8 days after the procedure? Pregnancy at this time is the only thing that makes sense given my symptoms. Food hasn‚Äôt tasted the same. My coffee doesn‚Äôt taste right. Is this all a side effect of the HCG in the trigger shot? are these real pregnancy symptoms? Am I going to get my period?

1koegj5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1koegj5,A closed bike trail killed my ride vibe,"I came out for a fast ride after work to kick off the weekend in a good mood, and also because this Saturday is going to rain again. I found the Central Mass Rail trail in Google Maps and duckies to explore it with destination Waltham, coming from Somerville. 

Found it, beautiful surroundings, good quality trail, the birds were singing, i was all alone and riding in full speed, until I get to a big fence that cuts the trail right in the middle, with no alternative to get to the other side, but to go back and take the street. üò≠

So sad.

1koeekq,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1koeekq/a_new_chapter_for_hsreplay_take_a_peek_to_whats/,A New Chapter for HSReplay. Take a peek to what's coming,"The¬†HSReplay.net¬†team is proud to reaffirm our long-term commitment to the Hearthstone community by [sponsoring many of your favorite streamers](https://x.com/HSReplayNet/status/1922025909755748452). In addition to expanding our support for creators, we‚Äôve grown our development team and are [charging ahead with an ambitious roadmap of new features for every game mode](https://x.com/HSReplayNet/status/1923484238164131988)!

With the game returning to China, the refocus on Esports and the upcoming Arena overhaul, Hearthstone is entering a great new era. As a wise man once said (hi Frodan!):¬†*‚ÄúIf they can execute, this will cement Hearthstone for the next decade. For new, returning, and veteran players.‚Äù*

The Hearthstone Deck Tracker, once a hobby project by a few passionate devs to share replays, has now become a must-have companion tool, trusted by pros and loved by players. Hearthstone is evolving, and so are we. Today, we're revealing more about our newest initiatives to support the community we love.

# Empowering Content Creators

Content creators have been a cornerstone of Hearthstone‚Äôs community since the very beginning, and at¬†HSReplay.net, we are especially thankful for all that they‚Äôve done for us.

A few months ago, we started working more closely with Jeef, one of the top Battlegrounds players, to enhance the value the Hearthstone Deck Tracker provides. After seeing the incredibly positive reception, it was clear to us that working hand-in-hand with content creators is the path forward.

Today, we are proud to announce long-term¬†**partnerships with many of your favorite Hearthstone creators**, including RDU, Thijs, Dog, SuperJJ, RegisKillbin, Zeddy, NoHandsGamer, ShadyBunny, RedBeard, DaneHearth, Asmodai, and many more!

https://preview.redd.it/tx6ib180581f1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ced5e5f4ede6d0b5ec57ef552eb814222e5c195

  
We want to help them thrive in their content creation careers and listen more closely to their community‚Äôs feedback so we can continue to make the Hearthstone Deck Tracker and HSReplay.net the best they can be.

# What‚Äôs next for HSReplay.net

The amazing community feedback is what shaped¬†[HSReplay.net](http://HSReplay.net)¬†and the Hearthstone Deck Tracker to what it is now. Much like the game, we are always evolving. Here are some examples of updates we made in the past few months:

* Composition and Hero Guides for Battlegrounds
* Inspiration Tool to find game-winning comps
* Dozens of Counters to provide relevant information at a glance
* Related Cards, Tooltips and Card Synergy Highlights

>""We‚Äôve added several new developers to the Hearthstone team in the last few months, and we will have several more new developers joining it soon. With all this new bandwidth, we‚Äôre excited about the aggressive roadmap of new functionality we have planned."" -¬†**Andrew Wilson,**¬†[**HSReplay.net**](http://hsreplay.net/?ref=articles.hsreplay.net)¬†**Founder & CEO**

https://preview.redd.it/akjut514581f1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d6db58095e84b3cf7fc1e3516a460078703c46

We‚Äôve been wanting to expand our support to Arena players for a while, and with the upcoming planned Arena overhaul, we knew this was the perfect time to do so.

I'm about to start a new dev role at a small HFT market maker in London. Over the next couple of years, I‚Äôm aiming to break into one of the top HFT firms‚Äîand I‚Äôd love to find a like-minded buddy to level up with along the way.

I‚Äôm thinking of doing **bite-sized daily learning** (30‚Äì60 mins, 5 days a week) focused on **low-latency systems, Modern C++, and all things HFT**. We could keep each other accountable by pushing learnings to private shared GitHub repository, and once a week we quiz each other in a fun way to reinforce what we learned.

**Bonus**: Maybe we end up building some side projects together too!

Ideally, you‚Äôre **London**\-based so we can occasionally meet up and talk nerdy stuff over coffee. If this sounds interesting, shoot me a message‚Äîwould be great to connect!",4,1747436404.0,quant,2,0.67,False

F34 here. 
I've been thinking about something lately as I am currently traveling so it's just naturally happening more often. Random guys strike up conversations with me- like when I‚Äôm grabbing coffee at Starbucks and a guy starts chatting and smiling and we end up hanging out (nothing more tho), or when I‚Äôm eating alone in the Philippines and someone just walks up to my table asking if I‚Äôm solo and then asks for my Insta to eventually hang out. In Malaysia, a British guy started talking on the way to the same hotel and eventually we exchanged contacts in his request and hanged out later (nothing more, but he later admitted he was attracted to me). Then there was this beautiful German guy who smiled at me while we were both checking in at one of the hotels, and we ended up going out for dinner‚Äîand yeah, we hooked but I was very attracted to him and he confessed his attraction to me. 
And there have been plenty of other men in other situations coming over to talk to me (some I later assumed had a thing for me because they would either try to flirt/complement my look, some- I wasn't sure).

Thing is, I always assume these guys are just being friendly (except for the ones I ended up having romance with, obviously lol). 
The German lova told me when I asked this: *‚ÄúGuys don‚Äôt randomly talk to girls unless they‚Äôre attracted to them.‚Äù* and he genuinely laughed. And he‚Äôs not the only one who‚Äôs said that.

Most of my closest friends back home are guys- we‚Äôre like siblings- so I‚Äôm used to having platonic friendships with men. It feels totally natural to me to hang out with guys without assuming anything romantic or sexual. But now I‚Äôm starting to wonder.

So GUYS (Straight men): do you ever randomly start a conversation with a woman just to be friendly? As in- you're in a random place, and you intentionally start talking to some specific girl. Or have I been naive this whole time thinking it was just casual and innocent (except for instances I knew for sure/ppl I hooked up with).",0,1747436228.0,AskMenAdvice,66,0.38,False
