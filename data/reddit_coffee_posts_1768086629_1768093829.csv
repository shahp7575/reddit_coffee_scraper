1q9lit7,https://i.redd.it/twjaz8s6emcg1.jpeg,My Husband's Rules,"No touching, no kissing, no sex.
That was the strict rules that Rosalie's husband Benjamin set for her.
Because he had severe germophobia.
Once, she accidentally drank from his cup.
He threw the cup straight into the trash in disgust, as if it were covered in poison.
Another time, she got a high fever. When she woke up, she asked him for a hug for comfort.
His brows furrowed. His cold voice carried a warning. ""Rosalie, don't test my limits.""
During her period, she accidentally stained the passenger seat in his car.
He held his breath, pulled over, and immediately called his assistant to sell the car.
After that, she was never allowed to sit in any of his cars again.
Rosalie cried in silence but said nothing. She just became even more careful, respecting his obsessive habits.
Before sleeping beside him, she would shower three times, making sure not a single speck of dust was left.
Just to hold his hand, she wiped her palms with disinfectant until they turned red, then touched him carefully, promising again and again that she was clean.
She thought that if she followed Benjamin's rules long enough, one day he'd let her into his world.
Until both she and his widowed sister-in-law Cassandra, fell into the river, Rosalie realized the one he loved was Cassandra.
If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore.
She would marry his lifelong rival.
The man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.
\*\*\*
After visiting the cemetery, the car carrying her and Cassandra was hit halfway home.
Everything spun. Both of them fell into the muddy river beside the road.
""Help...""
Rosalie couldn't swim. Out of instinct, she opened her mouth to shout, but only swallowed more dirty river water.
Through the blur, she saw Benjamin jump in without hesitation.
Her survival instincts kicked in. She reached her hand toward him. ""Ben... help me...""
But then, Cassandra's voice rang out at the same time.
""Benny... help me...""
Benjamin hesitated only for a second before swimming straight past Rosalie toward Cassandra.
""Rosa, Cassie can't swim. I'll save her first. Hold on!""
Rosalie's pupils contracted. Her heart felt as if it had been pierced by ice.
She tried to grab his sleeve, but before her fingers even touched the fabric, he swung his arm hard and shoved her away.
As the suffocating pain grew stronger, her arms and legs started to lose strength.
All she could do was watch the light on the water's surface blur and fade away...
She and Benjamin first met during a bank robbery.
He was wearing a black designer suit, looking calm and noble among the terrified crowd.
When the police arrived, the robber panicked and grabbed him as a hostage.
Benjamin didn't even flinch. With just one sharp look, he cooperated with the police to shoot the robber dead.
When the gun went off, everyone else trembled in fear.
Only he stayed calm, his eyes glancing down coldly at the robber's curled-up body. His strong brows didn't even twitch.
Rosalie couldn't take her eyes off him, her heart trembling.
She begged her father to introduce them.
Her father saw right through her and immediately disagreed.
""You can like anyone you want, just not Benjamin. He's got severe germophobia. Dozens of women have tried, but none ever got close.""
""So what? I'm beautiful, I've got a good figure, and I'm nice. I can win his heart.""
Back then, she was full of confidence, bright and radiant, chasing after him everywhere.
When she learned he liked bread pudding from the South Side of Chicago, she drove across half the city just to bring him a warm serving.
When he got sick overseas while on a business trip, she chartered a private plane, flew to his hotel, and took care of him for three days straight.
The most dangerous time was when he went to a mountain site and got caught in a landslide. Ignoring everyone's warnings, she dug him out of the mud with her bare hands.
After that, he proposed to her.
""I need someone to marry for the family's benefit.""
No ring. Not a single word about love.
She was overjoyed, holding his arm, asking if he had finally fallen for her.
Benjamin quietly brushed her hand off and gave a faint ""yeah.""
Blinded by happiness, Rosalie didn't notice the flash of disgust in his eyes.
But when she thought back, the day he proposed to her...
It was the same day Cassandra married Benjamin's eldest brother, Joseph Malone!
So Benjamin never loved her!
Rosalie's love was just his way of patching up a broken heart!
Before Rosalie lost consciousness, a bodyguard pulled her out of the river.
But even after she reached the shore, Benjamin didn't look at her once. He held Cassandra tightly, whispering to her.
""It's okay.
""You're safe now. I've got you.""
He had always hated dirt, but now his expensive suit was soaked with foul, muddy water. Grime clung to his hair, yet he didn't seem to care.
All he cared about was the woman in his arms.
There was a tenderness in his eyes that he had never given Rosalie.
Shivering, Rosalie wrapped her arms around herself as hot tears streamed down.
She had truly believed he had severe germophobia.
A year of dating, three years of marriage, over 1,200 days and nights, she followed every rule he made.
But now Rosalie knew... that wasn't it.
Those rules were only for her. For Cassandra, there were none.
How ironic!
How ridiculous!
Cassandra noticed the look on Rosalie's face, and pride flashed in her eyes. She suddenly clutched her chest. ""My necklace! Benny, the necklace you gave me is gone!""
Benjamin immediately said, ""It must've fallen in the river. Don't worry. I'll find it.""
Without hesitation, he jumped back into the filthy water.
After diving several times, he finally found Cassandra's necklace and handed it to her like a prize.
""Don't cry anymore. I found it.""
Rosalie let out a bitter laugh. Her hands trembled as she wiped her tears and pulled out her phone. For the first time, she replied to that same message she had been getting for years—
""For the 9,999th time. Rosie, when are you divorcing Benjamin and marrying me?""
Through blurry vision, she typed each word carefully.
""Return from abroad and find me after thirty days.""
If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore.
She would marry her lifelong rival. The man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.
Chapter 2
Rosalie and Cassandra were both sent to the hospital.
The moment Benjamin stepped into the hospital hallway, the air around him seemed to grow colder. A faint trace of disgust and discomfort flashed through his pale blue eyes.
But after glancing at Cassandra, he forced himself to hold it in and stayed by her side the whole time, never taking a single step away.
Rosalie's gaze fell on them, and it felt as if someone had carved a hole through her heart. The emptiness hurt so much she could barely breathe.
During their three years of marriage, Benjamin hadn't always been cold to her.
When he came home from parties, he would sometimes bring her a cup of her favorite gelato.
When she felt down, he would pat her head gently through his gloves.
But when she once got a high fever and begged him to come visit her at the hospital, he said.
""Rosalie, stop forcing me. You know hospitals are full of germs, and I have serious germophobia.""
Yet now, in front of Cassandra, his germophobia seemed miraculously cured. He actually stepped into the hospital. The very place he had always feared like the plague.
She had once heard someone say that love meant unconditional tolerance and compromise.
Just like how she did for Benjamin, and how Benjamin did for Cassandra.
\*\*\*
After leaving the hospital, Rosalie took the divorce papers that her lawyer had drafted and went to see Benjamin.
""I want a divorce. Sign it.""
Benjamin pursed his thin lips tightly. ""Just because I didn't save you first? Rosalie, Cassie can't swim. Of course I had to save her first!""
Rosalie couldn't help but laugh, though her eyes burned with tears. ""She can't swim! Do you think I can?""
Benjamin froze for two seconds. Then impatience flashed between his brows. ""Even if you can't, even if I didn't save you, you're still fine, aren't you?""
His self-righteous tone hit her like fire, burning through every bit of her heart.
All her struggle, longing, and unwillingness to let go turned to ashes in that fire.
Only bone-deep emptiness was left.
She didn't want to argue anymore. Too tired to care, she closed her eyes and pointed to the signature line. ""Sign it.""
Benjamin didn't move. His cold eyes were sharp as ice. ""Can you stop being unreasonable?""
With a click, the door opened from the outside.
Cassandra walked in. When she saw the divorce papers spread on the table, the corners of her mouth lifted ever so slightly.
She first handed a cup of hot tea to Benjamin and said softly, ""Rosalie, Ben didn't mean it. Here. Have some hot tea. It's my way of apologizing for him.""
Her expression was gentle, but pride flickered in her eyes.
A sharp pain struck Rosalie's heart. Without thinking, she swung her hand. ""Get out of my way.""
Smash.
The cup shattered, and the tea spilled everywhere.
Cassandra screamed and fell to the floor.
Benjamin's face changed instantly. Without hesitation, he lifted Cassandra into his arms and set her on the couch.
""Are you hurt?""
Cassandra leaned weakly against his chest, her voice trembling with grievance. ""I'm fine. I just wanted to talk to her. I didn't expect...""
""It's not your fault."" Benjamin's fingers twitched as he fought the urge to touch her cheek. His icy blue eyes shot toward Rosalie. ""You want a divorce, right? Fine. As you wish.""
He signed his name in bold, elegant strokes and tossed the papers at her. ""I hope you don't regret it.""
Regret?
The only thing she ever regretted in this life was marrying him.
That bitter thought flashed through Rosalie's mind. She turned to leave, but behind her came Cassandra's soft voice and Benjamin's low reply.
""Benny, you actually signed it? Aren't you afraid she'll really divorce you?""
Benjamin's tone held a hint of mockery. ""She loves me too much to leave. It's just a little trick to get my attention. Now, let me see if your foot is hurt.""
Rosalie's steps faltered. She turned instinctively.
Under the dim light, Benjamin knelt on one knee, carefully holding Cassandra's foot on his lap. His expression was gentle and focused.
Germophobia?
What a serious case of germophobia.
Chapter 3
The next morning, Rosalie went to the courthouse to file for divorce.
When she returned to the villa, she saw Benjamin teaching Cassandra how to drive.
His hand rested lightly on hers. The space between them was so small that the air inside the car felt charged with tension.
Rosalie suddenly remembered all the times she had wiped her skin raw with disinfectant just to get close to him.
To Benjamin, his wife was nothing but a carrier of germs. If she wanted to touch him, she had to scrub herself clean first.
But... Cassandra was his exception. The one he treated like a holy item. Even if she were covered in dirt, he would still let her come close to him.
It is true that love always reveals itself.
She was the fool for never noticing it.
Rosalie looked away coldly and walked toward the villa. But then, the sharp roar of a car engine suddenly sounded behind her.
The next second, she felt her body fly into the air before crashing down like a rag doll. A burning pain shot through every inch of her body like a red-hot iron.
She lay amid shattered glass, choking as blood filled her mouth. Through the cracked windshield, she saw what happened inside the car.
Benjamin was holding Cassandra tightly in his arms, his face tense. ""Are you okay? Did you get hurt?""
Cassandra's voice trembled. ""I'm fine. But Rosa looks really hurt. Benny, hurry and take her to the hospital.""
Through her blurry vision, Rosalie saw Benjamin glance at her, his voice icy.
""No. She's covered in blood. It's dirty.""
Tears mixed with blood slid down her cheeks.
Rosalie let out a broken laugh as pain spread through her chest, tearing her apart from the inside.
She couldn't bear it anymore. Darkness closed in, and she passed out.
\*\*\*
When she woke up again, Rosalie was in a hospital.
Benjamin's face was tight with restraint as he reached out to help her. But then, as if remembering something, he took out his gloves and put them on.
One pair wasn't enough, so he put on two more.
Pain stabbed deep in Rosalie's chest. She sneered. ""If you don't want to touch me, don't force yourself.""
Benjamin pulled his hand back and handed her the bowl of chicken broth the maid had made. ""Eat something first.""
Once, Rosalie would have been deeply touched.
Now, it only felt like mockery.
She said nothing, just quietly took the bowl.
When she finished, Benjamin's furrowed brows relaxed slightly. His voice was calm. ""Cassie's pregnant with Joseph's child. She wants to have the beef broth you make. I'll have the driver take you home so you can cook for her.""
So that was why he'd endured his germophobia, stayed with her in the hospital, and even brought her soup.
Not out of concern, but because he wanted her... to cook for Cassandra.
Rosalie's fingers clenched under the blanket, fury boiling inside her chest.
""Benjamin, are you insane? She hit me with her car, and you want me to make beef broth for her?""
Benjamin met her bloodshot eyes. Something inside him twitched.
He thought he was imagining it. His brows furrowed, his tone cold. ""She didn't mean it. The doctor said you weren't badly hurt and can move just fine. And it's just beef broth. How much effort could that take?""
Rosalie's chest heaved. She grabbed the water cup on the nightstand and hurled it at him.
""Get out!
""Get out of my sight!""
Benjamin dodged, irritation flickering across his face.
He tore off his gloves and, as if offering her mercy, grabbed Rosalie's right hand and intertwined their fingers.
""Now, is this enough?""
Rosalie stared at him, tears streaming down her face and splashing onto the back of her hand, cold as ice.
What kind of man had she fallen in love with?
How could he be so heartless? How could he... humiliate her like this?
In the end, the bodyguards dragged her back to the villa, forcing her to make beef broth for Cassandra.
When she was finally sent back to the hospital, her weak body gave out, and she drifted into sleep.
But before long, sharp pain shot through her wrist.
Then, someone yanked her hard and threw her to the floor.
Chapter 4
Rosalie's back hit the cold floor hard. Sharp pain shot through her body, and cold sweat broke out across her forehead.
""Benjamin! What are you doing?!""
Benjamin's face was dark as night, the chill in his pale blue eyes almost solid.
""Rosalie, I could understand if you were mad that Cassie ran into you. But why did you drug her beef broth? Do you know she almost lost the baby because of you?""
Rosalie tried to get up, but the bodyguard twisted her arms behind her back and pinned her to the ground.
Her cheek was pressed against the rough floor and her skin was burning, but it was nothing compared to the pain in her heart.
She trembled with rage. ""Benjamin, if you're sick, go to a mental hospital! Stop making things up! Why would I drug her for no reason?""
Benjamin stared at her pale face, his cold eyes showing no pity.
""She didn't eat anything today except the beef broth you made.
""If you won't admit it, then stay put until you understand what you've done wrong.""
Fear flashed in Rosalie's eyes, her teeth chattering.
""No... Benjamin! You... you can't do this to me!""
The only answer she got was Benjamin's icy order. ""Take her down.""
Rosalie tried to fight, but the hands on her were like iron clamps.
She was dragged out by the bodyguards toward the pool next to the hospital.
Splash.
Her body hit the water and was instantly enveloped by the freezing water.
Rosalie choked on a mouthful of water that reeked of chlorine. Fire burned down her throat and into her lungs, leaving her gasping and unable to breathe.
She called out instinctively, ""Benjamin...""
Through the rippling water, Benjamin stood still, his cold gaze even harder than ice.
Hopelessness filled Rosalie's eyes. She struggled to reach the edge, but her body felt as heavy as lead.
Just when she thought she was about to drown, a bodyguard pulled her out and threw her at Benjamin's feet.
She was soaked from head to toe, her wounds tearing open again. Blood mixed with the pool water and formed a pool beneath her.
Benjamin took a step back, his tone cold. ""Do you admit your mistake now?""
Rosalie coughed hard, her beautiful face white as paper. ""It wasn't me...""
Splash.
The next second, she was thrown into the pool again.
It happened again and again until she had no strength left to fight. She let herself sink.
So be it.
Let it end here.
She didn't want to live anymore.
The blue tiles at the bottom of the pool grew clearer, closer.
Just then, someone pulled her up once more.
Through the ringing in her ears, she heard Benjamin answer a call.
""Have you investigated properly? It really wasn't her?
""Alright, I got it.""
Her trembling, wet body finally gave out. Everything went black as she collapsed to the ground.
\*\*\*
Rosalie woke from pain.
The sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose. Agony spread through her body, her chest burning as if needles were stabbing her lungs. She let out a soft cry.
""How do you feel? The doctor said you have pneumonia. You'll need to stay here for two days.""
Rosalie turned her head and saw Benjamin sitting nearby.
He was still in his black suit, cold and distant, untouchable as ever.
But now, the eyes that were always cold held a trace of guilt.
""We investigated the matter. It really had nothing to do with you. The nurse mixed up the medicine,"" he said, glancing at her again. ""This was my fault. Whatever you want as compensation, I'll provide it.""
Rosalie didn't look at him. Her voice was faint. ""No need. If you really want to make it up to me, leave me alone so I can rest.""
She understood now that Benjamin had only ever cared about Cassandra. He only offered compensation because he didn't want her to cause any trouble for Cassandra.
Benjamin frowned at how lifeless she looked. Something stirred in his chest, a feeling he couldn't name.
But in the end, he said nothing and walked out.
Maybe out of guilt, for the next few days, Benjamin came to the hospital every day, staying for half an hour each time.
If this had been before, Rosalie would've been overjoyed. But now, it just felt like a cruel joke.
Chapter 5
Rosalie stayed in the hospital for a week. The day she was discharged, she accepted a friend's invitation to a private party.
She didn't expect to run into Cassandra there.
When Cassandra saw her, she gave a faint, mocking smile and walked over holding two glasses of wine.
""Rosa, I'm sorry about what happened a few days ago. Benny just cares about me too much. This drink is my apology; consider it me making up for him.""
Rosalie didn't want to deal with her and turned to leave, but Cassandra stopped her.
Cassandra leaned in close, her whisper in Rosalie's ear sounding downright cruel.
""Rosalie, don't you think you're like a dog begging for scraps? No matter how hard you try, Benny will never look your way.""
Rosalie's gaze turned cold. She shoved Cassandra hard and snapped back.
""If I'm a dog, then what are you? A widow sleeping with her ex-husband's brother while pregnant with her ex's child?""
Cassandra's face darkened instantly.
Then, for some reason, she suddenly threw her drink on her own face, slapped herself hard, and dropped to her knees in front of Rosalie.
""I'm sorry, Rosa. Everything that happened before was my fault. But I'm carrying Joseph's baby now. Please, I'm begging you, don't make me drink.""
Rosalie froze. Before she could react, someone grabbed her arm tightly and shoved her hard.
Crash.
Caught off guard, she was thrown against a nearby coffee table.
Cups and bottles shattered, splashing wine across her face and clothes.
Several glass shards pierced her palm, blood spilling out. The sharp pain made her vision blur.
As Benjamin shoved her, he carefully helped Cassandra up, his face colder than ice.
""Rosalie, have I spoiled you too much? How dare you treat Cassie like that!""
Rosalie struggled to stand, looking up quietly into Benjamin's cold, merciless eyes.
They had been together for three years. She had wished countless times that he'd touch her just once, without caring about his obsession with cleanliness.
That day finally came, but only so he could hurt her.
She bit her lip until she tasted blood and spoke in a trembling voice.
""Benjamin, after all this time, so in your eyes, I'm nothing but a horrible woman.""
A flicker of doubt flashed in Benjamin's eyes.
Cassandra's heart skipped, and she quickly forced a weak smile. ""Forget it, Benny. I don't think Rosa meant it. She just got carried away by jealousy for a moment. After all...""
Looking at Cassandra's teary face, Benjamin's hesitation vanished. His gaze toward Rosalie turned ice-cold.
""You love me so much that there's nothing you wouldn't do. Grab her. She slapped Cassie once, so give her 20 back. She needs to learn a lesson.""
Rosalie's eyes flew wide, pain crushing her chest like a hammer.
So in his eyes, her love for him was her greatest crime.
""Benjamin! I didn't touch her! If you don't believe me, check the cameras!""
""No need. I trust Cassie."" Benjamin's tone was flat and cold. ""Rosalie, anyone who does something wrong must be punished. Even a three-year-old knows that.""
Fury filled Rosalie's eyes as she struggled to break free.
The moment she moved, two bodyguards grabbed her tight. Their huge hands came down fast and hard.
Slap!
The sharp crack echoed. Rosalie stumbled, her cheek burning with pain.
Slap!
Another blow.
Her head snapped to the side, blood trickling from her pale lips.
Two slaps.
Three...
The private room went dead silent, except for the sound of non-stop slapping.
At first, Rosalie still had the strength to argue, but after 20 slaps, her face burned like it had been branded. Even opening her mouth took effort.
She collapsed to the ground and passed out.
Chapter 6
Rosalie had a nightmare.
When she finally struggled awake, she found herself staring at Benjamin's cold, handsome face.
He was wearing gloves, carefully applying medicine to her wounds with a cotton swab.
When he saw her wake up, he casually put the swab down and said flatly, ""Let's forget what happened. But if you ever bully Cassie again, it won't be this easy next time.""
Rosalie couldn't help but let out a low laugh. ""Benjamin, do you know what? I regret ever meeting you.""
Benjamin looked at her tear-streaked face, and something sharp flickered in his eyes. A strange restlessness rose in his chest.
""Rosalie, stop acting up. This was your fault from the start. Just 20 slaps. It was a light punishment.""
""Light?"" She asked inwardly.
Her face hurt so badly it felt ruined, yet he said it was a light punishment.
""Leave. I don't want to see you again.""
When Benjamin met her lifeless gaze, his heart tightened for no reason. Something unexplainable made him speak again.
""Didn't you always want to sleep with me? As long as you promise not to bully Cassie again, I'll agree to sleep with you. That should make you happy, right?""
His tone was full of condescension, as if he were granting her the greatest favor in the world.
Rosalie gave a mocking smile, closed her eyes slowly, and stayed silent.
In the past, she had shamelessly tried to crawl into his bed many times.
But because of his germophobia, even when she stood naked before him, he never touched her.
And now he was offering to sleep with her? How generous.
But he didn't know... she didn't need it anymore.
All she wanted now was to stay far away from him, so far that she'd never have to see him again...
That night, Benjamin really meant to keep his word and share her bed.
She didn't bother to argue and used her period as an excuse to kick him out.
But when she went to the laundry room, she saw Benjamin washing Cassandra's underwear by hand.
At that moment, it felt as if a thousand knives were stabbing her heart.
Benjamin noticed her stare, his expression calm and unbothered.
""Cassie's pregnant. It's hard for her to move, and she feels embarrassed asking the maid, so I'm helping her.""
Rosalie clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. Pain shot through her chest before she finally gave a small nod.
She didn't even want Benjamin anymore. Why should she care whose underwear he washed?
She turned and began packing her things.
After living there for three years, she had quite a few belongings. In the drawers were the gifts Benjamin had given her without much thought.
The expensive jewelry he'd had his assistant buy.
The ice cream he once bought her. She couldn't bear to throw away the box, so she kept it like a treasure.
The couple photo stickers she forced him to take when they went shopping together.
In the photo, Benjamin's expression was stiff, but the light softened his eyes.
Once, she thought those things were precious. Now, they just looked ridiculous.
Without hesitation, she threw them all into the trash can.
Along with them was her love for him.
Chapter 7
For the next half month, Rosalie stayed home and didn't step out, only waiting quietly for the divorce cooling-off period to end.
Until one day, she opened a news alert on her phone.
""Malone Group CEO Benjamin prays to God for love.""
In the video, Benjamin climbed 3,000 steps on his hands and knees.
Because it was raining, his expensive tailored suit was covered in mud, and his face, which was always clean and spotless, was smeared with dirt.
But he didn't care at all, only bowed his head respectfully as he took the blessed bracelet from the priest.
In the comments, countless people were shipping Benjamin and Cassandra.
""I heard Benjamin and Cassandra were childhood sweethearts, but fate separated them when Cassandra married Joseph by mistake. Now that Joseph's gone, they can finally be together.""
""Doesn't Benjamin have a wife? I remember his wife is the prettiest woman in Chicago, Rosalie.""
""He never loved Rosalie. Last time, he even slapped her 20 times in public for Cassandra.""
Rosalie's fingers tightened around her phone, the ache in her chest completely numb.
She suddenly remembered once begging Benjamin to go to an old church in the suburbs with her.
Benjamin said.
""Rosalie, it's a mountain road to the church. It's dusty, and there are too many people and germs. Stop being selfish and think about me for once!""
But now, he prayed to God for Cassandra.
How ironic.
And how ridiculous.
Rosalie calmly closed the article and began packing her suitcase.
Just then, the door burst open.
Benjamin walked in, uncharacteristically tense. His gloved hand grabbed her wrist and dragged her toward the door.
Rosalie tried to pull away, but she couldn't. Helpless, she shouted.
""What are you doing? Let go of me!""
Benjamin's face was grim, his voice tense.
""Cassie accidentally hurt someone. The victim's family agreed to settle, but on one condition. They want someone to take the punishment for five days.""
Rosalie froze as the meaning of his words hit her, her face turning pale with fear.
""No... I'm not going... ""
Why?!
Cassandra made the mistake. Why should she take the blame?
Benjamin forced her into the car with unshakable strength.
""No, you have to go! Cassie is timid, and she's carrying my brother's child. Nothing can happen to her. Don't worry, they promised not to kill you. At most, they'll hurt you a little.
""When the time's up, I'll come pick you up myself. Besides, haven't you always wanted a child? If you take this for Cassie, I'll give you one in exchange.""
Rosalie's lips trembled.
Her chest went numb, but tears still streamed down her face.
How cruel. How ironic.
She was his wife, and all she wanted was to have his child, but he wanted her to earn it by taking Cassandra's punishment.
So in his eyes...
She was that worthless!
A sudden gust of wind blew away her tears and, with them, the last trace of love in her heart.
She struggled wildly, screaming hoarsely, ""Who cares!""
But in the end, she couldn't fight Benjamin's strength and was shoved into the car.
When they arrived, Benjamin ordered his bodyguards to tie her up and throw her in front of the furious victim's family.
""I've done what I promised. Don't go after Cassie again.""
Rosalie turned her head and met the hate-filled eyes staring back at her. Fear gripped her heart like an iron claw.
Her teeth chattered as she begged, ""Benjamin, don't do this to me! They'll beat me to death!""
Benjamin crouched down, gently wiping her tears with a handkerchief. A flicker of pity passed through his eyes, but his tone stayed cold.
""They won't. They promised me they wouldn't kill you. Be good, Rosa. I'll come for you when it's over.""
Rosalie clung to his sleeve, but he pushed her hand away without hesitation.
Her trembling fingers reached helplessly toward him, unable to stop him from leaving.
A helpless sob escaped her throat, her eyes turning red.
The family dragged her into a dark room, where fists and sticks rained down like a storm.
Rosalie bit her lip hard, but couldn't stop the painful cries spilling from her mouth.
After that, she endured torment she never thought possible.
They poured boiling water on her, burning her skin until blisters covered her body.
They pressed lit cigarettes into her arms, leaving scars that spelled out ""criminal.""
They whipped her with lashes soaked in salt water, tearing her clothes and cutting deep into her flesh.
They even... sealed her inside a coffin with a rotting corpse for an entire night.
Just when she thought she'd die from the torture, the door was kicked open.
A man stood against the light. His face was hidden and his presence was terrifying.
""Touch her again, and you'll pay for it!""
His bodyguards rushed in, taking down everyone in seconds.
Then Rosalie fell into a steady embrace.
Through her blurry vision, Oliver's cold eyes met hers, though his embrace was gentle.
""Rosie, don't be scared. I'm here to save you. Sleep now. When you wake up, everything will be fine.""
Tears filled Rosalie's eyes as she whimpered and leaned against his chest.
Then everything went dark.
Five days later.
Benjamin came as promised to pick her up, only to learn that she had already been rescued by a man five days ago.
""A man? What kind of man?"" Benjamin asked inwardly.
A strange frustration rose in him. He took out his phone, about to call her, but someone stopped him.
Cassandra hooked her arm through his and sighed, ""Why is Rosa so immature? Is she mad at you and doing this just to make you worry?""
Benjamin's finger paused above the screen.
Cassandra's lips curved slightly as she continued, ""Ben, today is Oliver's wedding. Let's attend first. You can reach out to Rosalie afterward, right?""
Benjamin was silent for a moment before putting his phone away. ""You're right.""
But even as he said it, on the way to the hotel, he couldn't calm down. He kept checking his phone over and over.
When they arrived, he finally pocketed it and looked toward the entrance.
A red carpet lined the hotel entrance, flowers on both sides, and at the end stood a huge wedding photo.
Benjamin was about to look away when he froze, his gaze snapping back in disbelief.
When he saw the wedding photo clearly, he felt as if he was struck by a heavy hammer. He froze in place.
The woman in the photo had bright and flawless skin. Her red lips curved into a smile. It wasn't just anyone. It was his wife.

I'll admit it, I like to think I'm naturally social and engaging. I'm also that guy you'll see making the rounds at networking events and striking up conversations with strangers like it's a sport.

I think there's something special about people who listen as well as they speak, ask thoughtful questions, know how to build on a topic instead of killing it, and aren't afraid of a witty back-and-forth. I'd love to find someone else who feels the same.

A little about me:

* I'm 40, single, male, and work in the medical field. Demanding at times, but I genuinely love what I do and the challenges that come with it
* I can talk to just about anyone… yet I still overthink texts like a normal human
* Equal parts analytical and personable. Some days I just want to veg out on the couch, let's be real. 
* I make a great cup of coffee and take it way too seriously
* I appreciate good banter and can hold my own, but also like low key nights in (case in point, tonight).
* I'm self-aware enough to laugh at myself
* I enjoy learning how other people think, like backgrounds, perspectives, quirks
* I'm calm under pressure, but have my sarcastic moments too
* I value folks who are intentional and purposeful in how they live their life

What I'm looking for:

* Someone intelligent, curious, and has great communication skills.
* Someone's emotionally intelligent and reflective. 
* Bonus points if you have a sense of humor!

I look forward to hopefully hearing from you!",1,1768093586.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

Meanwhile the cafe serves a full menu with no room for paying people and people wonder why these local places end up closing.

I just wanna write a bit about my life because I've not got anyone to tell it to because if I did I'd probably be kicked out my house. I'm 19 and I've got older parents. They came into the truth in the there early 30s and had me pretty late my mum was 44. I love my mum and dad and the last thing I'd ever want to do is upset or hurt them but I really don't believe in this so called truth my sister left about 6 years ago, we was really close and she had me round to her house very often I had a great friendship with my niece and nephew and my brother in law untill they both decided to leave, my mum and dad was really upset but said we can't be in contact with them. Obviously I was really upset but couldn't say anything. My mum got in touch with her 2 years ago and since then we meet up for a coffee as a family every couple of weeks, but I feel our relationship is strained and my brother in law rarely comes. When I was 16 I started feeling pretty down with my life and the religion I felt like I was faking everything all the time and I started taking codeine tablets. For a bit of background my whole family apart from my mum and dad and 3 brothers are in the truth so I'd get drugs from my cousin who I wasn't allowed to see. I started taking 2 a night wich then turnt into 7 tablets a night then a few in the day. They made me drowsy but weirdly I couldn't get to sleep so most nights I was only falling asleep around 5:30 in the morning then waking up at 7:30 for work. I was so emotionally drained I just ended up braking down. I told my mum about the stash and also that I was vaping. My dad told the elders about me vaping but not the drugs. They basically said Ive commit a serious sin and had all the roles in the cong striped of me. I'm not baptised so idk what would of happened there. I got caught when I was 17 with the drugs and vaping and now I'm 19, my life is boring I feel depressed and I'm drained from acting like I'm ok. I've thought about ending it but I couldn't do that to my mum and dad. My brain is constantly wired because I've got ADHD and my mum won't give me my meds because of the whole drug thing. I work in the family business and I was homeschooled my mum and dad never taught me anything so I dont have an education. If I left I'd be kicked out of my house no place to go and I'd really struggle finding a job. I feel like I'm trapped and don't know what to do I'm so overwhelmed with everything and just want to go to sleep and not wake up.

I've been more quiet than normal, not super nauseous but definitely dizzy, out of it/spaced out, one day I was shakey, could barely stay awake one day (I also read some people say not to drink any caffeine so I've not been drinking diet coke or coffee or anything). My second meal of the day has definitely been higher in fat so I dont know if thats contributing. But I'm just curious when this feeling should start to fade away.

It's lunchtime, and he's found a corner so far back in the cafeteria that nobody bothers him, where he can chew and swallow non-anomalous food, drink apocalyptically strong coffee and digest the hard lessons of the morning.

On his Foundation-provided phone, he pages fretfully through the few SCP files for which he has clearance. Most of them have to be jokes. That's how they read. Like very bad, dark, frightening jokes.

Kim's one of eleven Junior Researchers in the new intake, and the other ten are sitting in a separate group at a separate table, chatting animatedly to one another. There are some instructors here and there, munching sandwiches. Other than them, the cafeteria - large enough to seat two hundred people or more - is deserted. To Kim, that seems odd. Site 41 is large, three skulking buildings with significant basement space, buried casually in the forests of central Colorado. Where is everybody?

A blue blob walks into the cafeteria, makes eye contact with Kim and floats purposefully over. The slime’s tophat is sharp enough to cut. They wear a couple of gigantic deer antlers. They look badly misplaced. Site 41 is a working site. There's training, education, research, development, analysis, and even the containment of a very few Safe SCPs going on here. Executives shouldn't ever be here. So what are they? A lost safe SCP, mayhaps? Or a simple hallucination caused by the location?

""Hell of a first day,"" the slime says, ""Mart. Mart the Waterimp.""

""Kim,"" says Kim. ""Paul Kim.""

""Good to meet you. What accent is that, if you don't mind me asking?""

Kim blinks. ""New York,"" he says. ""I'm from New York. Are you supposed to be in here?""

""You seem on edge.""

""Well, that figures, doesn't it?"" Kim asks. ""You must know how that intro goes. It's like an atom bomb to the ego. I just had almost everything I know overturned. It turns out I've spent my entire adult life being 'protected' from 'dangerous' knowledge, as if the whole outside world is a... a ballpit, for under-sevens. Stepping out of that has been... humiliating. To start with. And..."" He blinks again. ""Hey, what do you do here, exactly? You didn't answer my question.""

""You didn't answer mine,"" Mart says.

""Of course I did,"" Kim says. ""I'm from--""

And then he just stops, his train of thought running off the end of the track into air. It's on the tip of his tongue, the answer to Mart's question, but he can't get the words out. ""That's weird,"" he says, shaking his head.

At this point, he also notices that Mart isn't wearing a tag. This could be an honest mistake, albeit an extremely serious one. But surely safe class scps can't leave containment without identification?

""Who are you?"" Kim asks again.

""Your life story was fascinating.""

""What?""

""You spoke four languages,"" Mart tells him. ""One now, and soon zero. Too huge an intellect to specialise, your education was a fusion of biochemistry and comparative literature. You felt as if you'd die if you couldn't find more foreign thoughts to cram into your head. You've been all over the world, hungry, and every country you've ever been to was like landing on another planet. You toy with anthropology, but there's too much world for one human race to ever understand, let alone one human. There's too much human race. We should pare it down.""

Kim nods. ""Would you excuse me for just one second?"" He gets up and hurries to another table, to the instructor whom he met earlier that day. When Kim gets close to her he feels a kind of staticky sensation building up. He tries to shake her shoulder, and succeeds in moving it a little, but it's like reaching through tar. ""Hey! There's a problem. There's an intruder. I think it might be an SCP. Doc, look at me! Hello?"" She doesn't react. He tries the gaggle of fellow newcomers as well, but they keep chattering and hypothesising, oblivious to him shouting and clapping in their ears. ""Hey! People! Listen to me! No, no, no, no.""

He looks back. Mart had risen off the ground and started moving towards him, still with that confident smile. And there's definitely something wrong with them now because they are visible through the tables, like an augmented reality holoprojection jammed inside Kim's eyeball.

Kim realises with a stab of fear that he can even see Mart when he blinks. His eyelids close, but Mart is still there, an apparition in what for all of Kim's life has been totally personal, private darkness. The only way he can avoid seeing Mart is to turn away, and even then he feels a radioactive prickling in the back of his eyeballs.

Kim tries to phone one of the newbies. The phone in the newbie's pocket rings, and other than that, nothing happens. Nobody reacts.

""That doesn't make sense,"" Kim says.

""Do you remember your father?"" Mart says.

""I never knew my father,"" Kim says, edging away. ""Mom raised me.""

Mart's black face is a fixture. ""These people loved your perspective. They were going to put you to work on anomalous antimemes. But they don't remember you exist. You don't exist.""

Kim says, mainly to himself, ""There aren't any dangerous SCPs on this site. It's a Safe site. So either you're not dangerous, or nobody knows you exist. And if nobody knows you exist, then that means you're either brand new, or... you're... What's an antimeme?""

""Hell of a first day,"" Mart says.

""Are you sentient?"" Kim asks.

""You seem on edge,"" Mart says.

Kim bolts. He exits the cafeteria, turns a corner and runs ten or eleven paces down the corridor, to where there's an elevator. He stabs the ""down"" button and waits. The elevator door is highly polished, reflective. Kim catches sight of a face in the mirrored surface and nearly falls over with shock, because it's a face he has never seen before, and it's apparently his own. ""Jesus! Oh, no no no,"" he babbles. ""What the hell, what the hell--""

Mart comes around the corner, still only casually hovering, just as the elevator cracks open. Kim dives in and punches the lowest floor, basement level 8. It's instinctive, although he could rationalise the decision in retrospect. (He can't just get in his car and drive. It's better if Mart stays on site than if they’re set loose in rational ""reality"". And to do that it's better if Kim retreats to the lowest, darkest corner of the site for which he has access. And then waits for Mart, and then locks all the doors behind them. And waits to die...) The elevator starts descending, and the apparation of Mart - visible through doors and floors - disappears upwards, shrinking with distance and perspective, but still smiling broadly down at Kim.

Kim paces in the elevator. I don't remember what my face looks like. It said it had eaten all my secondary languages, but I don't remember learning anything other than English. So-- It's eating my memories. It's consuming information. And I can't contact anybody directly, which means I'm on my own.

//I'm not trained for this.//

He hammers his head once against the elevator wall, and stares at his shoes. //But I don't know that. What if I've been trained, but I don't remember my training anymore? What if I've been working here for years and I only// think //this is my first day? What if I've met this thing before? What if everybody on the site has met it multiple times... and... nobody remembers? Is this what an antimeme is?//

Kim remembers the near-empty cafeteria. And miles of totally unoccupied corridors and vacant office and lab space. //Maybe it's not just eating my memories. Maybe it eats people whole, removes them completely from history. Maybe it's been haunting the site for years and that's why the site's so empty, because it's nearly finished exterminating us all?//

//I need to get help. I need to warn somebody. How? I can't talk to people, I can't phone them. I should-- I should write an SCP.//

//But surely someone's already thought of that.//

He pulls his phone out. He pulls out the listing. Nearly ten thousand SCP entries. A hundred of them are tagged ""antimemetics"" alone.

Kim clears his mind. //Mart. M-A-R-T. 4-7-3-9.//

> **SCP-4739**

>

> **Object class**: Keter

>

> **Special Containment Procedures**: I'm disregarding the format, because time is a factor. If you're reading this, you've already been isolated from the Foundation at large. Attempts to signal for help are futile. You are now inside 4739's gullet, after ingestion and prior to digestion. You need to get to lab S041-B08-053 as soon as possible and continue the research until you find a way to stop or kill Mart, before it kills you. Don't read the rest until you're in the elevator.

>

> **Description**:

At that moment the elevator doors open at basement level 8. Mart is waiting, still smiling disarmingly. He steps forward.

Desperate, Kim hurls his phone overarm at the creature's forehead. It's a solid chunk of metal and it's a dead hit. Mart reels backwards and his form phases through the wall. By the time he recovers, Kim is out of sight, haring away down the left corridor, just echoing, fading footsteps on concrete.

Two forty-five degree turns, and room 53 is in sight, the door at the farthest end. It looks like a submarine bulkhead. Kim spots the keypad from way out. Four digits. He tries 4739, and it works first time. The bulkhead mechanism takes agonising seconds to open up.

""Come on, come on, come on!""

""Do you remember your mother?"" he hears Mart calling down the corridor.

""I never knew my parents, I was an orphan,"" Kim hisses under his breath. For a split second he wonders what Mart  might really mean by that, but he doesn't have time to dwell on it.

The bulkhead opens. Kim slides in and pulls it closed behind him, locking the mechanism up again, as if that'll buy him even one second. The lab inside is sizeable, windowless of course, and stacked to the ceiling with a jumble of equipment which Kim hardly recognises. There are pieces of thick shattered glass underfoot. In the corner there's a computer terminal, locked. Kim unlocks it, and there's the same entry waiting for him:

> **Description**: SCP-4739 is a powerful, slow-acting antimemetic kill agent taking the appearance of a blue slime with a tophat and antlers calling itself ""Mart the Waterimp"". SCP-4739 is attracted to dense clusters of organically-stored information - essentially, extremely knowledgeable, complicated, interesting people. SCP-4739 isolates its victim from the outside world by enveloping them in an antimemetic field which makes it impossible for the victim, or anything done by the victim, to be perceived or remembered. SCP-4739 then consumes the victim's memories and knowledge until they become vegetative and die. This process takes between 15 minutes and 2 hours and is described as being ""like Alzheimer's disease in fast-forward"".

>

> SCP-4739 is not believed to be sentient, although it imitates the behaviour of a sentient being to the extent that it can appear sentient to the inattentive. Its victims are able to move and act freely, since it is impossible to escape once caught, or to signal for help. Communications such as written notes, graffiti and electronic mail do get sent, and persist in reality, but SCP-4739's effect spreads with each message, making it impossible for an external observer to perceive the message until such time as SCP-4739 catches them too.

>

> The SCP entry which you are currently reading is created and maintained by victims of SCP-4739, because it is only visible to victims of SCP-4739. If you are reading this SCP entry, SCP-4739 has caught you. You are now isolated from the Foundation at large and constitute an effective Foundation of one. You have between 15 minutes and 2 hours to reach Site 41, basement level 8, laboratory 053, familiarise yourself with the existing research, and continue this research until you find a way to contain or decommission SCP-4739, or, more likely, die. If your field of expertise is not related to antimemetic containment, we sincerely apologise, and advise you to start learning. Fast.

>

> SCP-4739 has consumed ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| |||| Foundation researchers since we started counting on August 3, 2013. (If you are reading this entry for the first time, please add a mark.) We estimate at least 50% of victims never make it as far as this database entry, so the true victim count is more than twice this figure.

""But how do I kill it?"" Kim screams. He scrolls and scrolls through the research, which is chaotic and haphazardly arranged, because nobody has found the spare seconds to sort it out. There are dozens of separate lines of research, contributed in patchwork by a succession of victims, all ending with variations on the same final line: ""I'm going to try X. If you're reading this, X didn't work and I'm dead, which means approach X is a dead end, and you have to think of something else.""

He reads. Nobody has succeeded in physically engaging with Grey. Nobody can stall it, evade it, slow it down, reason with it or redirect it to some other target. People have tried poisoning their memories with indigestible ideas, drip-feeding their memories to Grey to slow him down, replacing their memories faster than Grey can eat them, and force-feeding Grey too many memories at once to overfeed him and blow him up. They've tried committing suicide by Class-A amnestic overdose. None of it worked. More than a hundred people, most of them apparently possessing doctorates, have slid into the maw of this thing, fought briefly and, with a greater or lesser degree of dignity, died.

There are no remaining untried threads.

""I'm fucked!"" Kim concludes. He glances up. Grey's not in the room yet, but Kim can see him strolling down the last stretch of corridor. He's a totally intangible being, physical obstructions are irrelevant to him. He can't be hurt.

Kim clutches the pocket where he used to keep his phone.

Wait a second.

He scrolls again. He finds the three or four sad, desperate wretches who died confronting Grey physically. Combat knife and Glock. Baseball bat (Kim looks up and checks the room; sure enough, the bat's there, rolled under a table). One man, an elderly botanist far out of his depth, said he was just going to try whatever he could find that was heaviest. That explains the shattered CRT television, and the light layer of thick glass on the floor near the bulkhead. There's even CCTV footage of the botanist's attempt. He accomplishes literally nothing. Grey is a holographic ghost, and the CRT drops right through him, imploding when it hits the floor at Grey's feet. The botanist spends the rest of the video's running time huddled in a corner, gradually losing his mind while Grey watches placidly.

The difference being, Kim realises with his eyes boggling, a phone is a solid brick full of information. And before me, nobody tried using information as a missile.

Kim searches for the experiments - several of them, scattered - where the victim tried to divert Grey to a different data source. The general idea seemed to be to overload Grey by pointing him at something containing too much information: the internet, or the terabit feed from a live particle accelerator experiment, or a stack of hard drives containing the first few quadrillion binary digits of pi. But nobody could figure out a way to distract Grey's attention; prominently-placed screens full of data, he would ignore; data beamed at him electromagnetically (radio, laser) had no effect. And nobody could figure out a way to tunnel the information in through the victim's mind as extra memories. It was written off as impossible, closed as a line of investigation.

The hard drives, Kim finds, are right there on the workbench next to the computer. It's a half-rack unit, a cuboidal block of metalwork as big and heavy as a bowling ball. One of the most ineffective conceivable melee weapons.

Kim snatches up the three longest pieces of ethernet cable he can find, and starts plaiting them into a chain.

Then he remembers who he is, and where he is, and what his responsibilities are. He goes to the computer, to the SCP entry, adds himself to the victim tally and writes up exactly what it is he's about to try. Because he might not be the last one, and the world needs to know that this didn't work.

Mart comes through the lab bulkhead to find most of the equipment in the room toppled onto the floor, to create room for the black and silver drive array that Paul Kim is whirling around his head, on a two-metre chain made of plaited network cable. It makes a low thrumming sound as it whirls. Mart is not intelligent enough to stop moving forwards, and catches the array directly in the side of his head, rack mount point first, like a morningstar.

Mart absorbs a few trillion digits of the impact, but it isn't enough. There's a green snap of light and a noise like a subway train short-circuiting, and Mart's a pile in the corner, caved in and the drive array partially demolished in pieces around him.

The tophat falls from their dome.

Kim decides that history can fill in whatever quip it likes best.

""It was chewing its way up the Antimemetics Division hierarchy,"" Wheeler tells him in the aftermath. ""It was only a matter of time until it bit down on somebody dangerous. Congratulations on demonstrating a basic level of competence when it counted. Dozens of others couldn't.""

Kim still feels rattled. But the shock is dissipating, faster than he'd expected.

Marion Wheeler, it turns out, is the Antimemetics Division chief. She is Kim's new boss.

""I want to say it was dumb luck,"" Kim says. ""I want to say that I just threw my phone, it was instinct, it was muscle memory. It was my first day, and I got lucky as hell. ...I want to say those things, but I'm sitting here, and turning those statements over, and none of them would be true, would they?""

Wheeler waits expectantly, and says nothing.

""You're not my new boss,"" Kim says. ""You're just my boss. This isn't my first day at all. I've been working here for... well, it must be over a decade, right? I think I've been a professional antimemetics researcher since at least the mid-2000s. It's just that the first thing Mart ate was my memories of everything past the first day. And even then...""

""I see very little luck in what happened today,"" Wheeler says. ""Instinct and muscle memory are just deep forms of training. Like I said, a basic level of competence. An ability to piece your own life and all of your past knowledge back together, faster than nearly anybody else. This is what we try to drill into you. And sometimes, thankfully, it takes.""

""This isn't even the first time we've had this conversation,"" Kim continues. ""There've been other incidents. With other SCPs with amnestic powers. You've sat there and watched me put myself back together before.""

""And it hasn't gotten old yet,"" Wheeler admits, with something which might be approaching a smirk.

""How long does it usually take for me to recover?""

""A few months,"" Wheeler says. ""But if you want the honest truth, people in this division are as competent on day one as they'll ever be. You come to the job firing on all cylinders, or not at all. The rest is just fine-tuning and chemistry.""

""So what you're actually saying is you don't care about my mental state and you need me back at work now,"" Kim says.

Wheeler nods. ""I need an updated SCP entry, just to begin with. I need you to nail down the model for Mart’s predatory pattern and exactly how you defeated it. I want you to work out what it did with the bodies - incinerated, disintegrated, or just left them lying around the site in rotting perceptually cloaked heaps. And I need countermeasures for when it comes back.""

""It's not dead? Wait,"" Kim says. ""I think I know this one. It's coming back to me. 'Ideas don't die.'""",2,1768092430.0,Nullscape,0,1.0,False

Gameplay-wise, the game is puzzle at its core. There are bits of platforming sequences but that's secondary to puzzles. I opted for sci-fi story with story revealing through accessing terminals scattered in levels and reading info inside. Most of terminals are not mandatory to beat the game, so pure puzzlers can skip it. On the other side, sci-fi story lovers will be able to connect all dots together by reading everything. Apart from that, the game is using quite unconventional method for rendering: CPU only ray-tracing (no GPU acceleration).

The game could appeal to players who like games like *Portal*, *Talos Principle* or *Swapper* (my all time favs), by its focus on puzzles combined with sci-fi.

The game is in quite mature state (gameplay-wise it has everything from intro to ending credits), but there's still some work to be done (visuals should be further improved, beyond my original intended scope). See gameplay video to have broad idea about current state.

The game is scheduled for release in 2026. If sci-fi combined with puzzles is your cup of coffee, you're welcome to wishlist it on Steam.

1q9kz9a,https://i.redd.it/3jvcr4x6amcg1.png,Flat white ricetta originale e altre due inedite," immagino che apprezzerai la precisione tecnica che sta dietro a un perfetto Flat White. Non è un semplice ""caffè latte"", ma un equilibrio millimetrico di micro-schiuma e caffeina.
Ecco la storia e le varianti, con un occhio di riguardo alla struttura, proprio come piace a te.
La Storia: Una sfida tra Australia e Nuova Zelanda
Le origini del Flat White sono oggetto di un’amichevole disputa ""trans-tasmaniana"".
 * Australia (1985): Alan Preston rivendica di averlo inserito nel menu del suo Moors Espresso Bar a Sydney, ispirandosi ai ""White Coffee"" piatti che bevevano i clienti del Queensland.
 * Nuova Zelanda (1989): Fraser McInnes di Wellington sostiene di averlo inventato per errore cercando di fare un cappuccino con latte scremato che non voleva montare, scusandosi col cliente: ""Sorry, it's a flat white"".
A differenza del cappuccino (più schiumoso) o del latte (più grande e diluito), il Flat White nasce per esaltare il sapore del caffè con una consistenza setosa.
1. La Ricetta Originale (Il Canone)
Il segreto è la micro-schiuma: bolle così piccole da essere invisibili, creando una consistenza simile alla vernice fresca.
Ingredienti e Proporzioni
 * Base: Doppio Espresso (circa 60ml).
 * Latte: 120ml di latte intero fresco.
 * Tazza: Ceramica da 150-180ml.
Preparazione
 * Estrai un doppio espresso corto direttamente nella tazza.
 * Monta il latte con la lancia vapore cercando di incorporare pochissima aria. La temperatura finale deve essere tra i 60°C e i 65°C.
 * Versa il latte partendo dall'alto per penetrare la crema del caffè, poi abbassa il bricco per creare un leggero strato di crema in superficie (e magari accennare un po' di latte art).
2. Ricetta Inedita: ""Smoky Wattleseed"" Flat White
Questa variante omaggia l'Australia profonda usando i semi di acacia (Wattleseed), che hanno note di cioccolato e nocciola tostata.
 * Il Tocco Speciale: Infondi 1/2 cucchiaino di polvere di Wattleseed (o cicoria tostata come alternativa mediterranea) nel latte prima di montarlo.
 * Risultato: Un profilo aromatico terroso e speziato che bilancia la dolcezza del latte, perfetto per chi cerca un gusto ""tostato"" estremo.
3. Ricetta Inedita: ""Salted Honey & Macadamia"" Flat White
La macadamia è la noce nativa australiana per eccellenza.
 * Il Tocco Speciale:
   * Sciogli un cucchiaino di miele di eucalipto (o millefiori) sul fondo della tazza con un pizzico di sale marino.
   * Estrai l'espresso sopra il miele.
   * Usa un latte di macadamia (molto grasso e cremoso) per la micro-schiuma.
 * Risultato: Una bevanda vellutata, con un contrasto dolce-salato che esalta l'acidità naturale dell'espresso arabica.

Where Morning Lingers

I wake beside the love of my life, her dark hair spilled in a tangle behind her. I don’t envy the time it will take to tame it. I pull her closer beneath the covers.

She nestles in, a long leg draped over mine.

We lie there, pressed together.

The bed is large. We don’t need it.

Just before the warmth becomes too much, I slip free from our bed-shaped oven. Our dog stirs at the same time, stretching wide in a great, big stretch before climbing in to steal my place. She pulls him close.

He won’t last any longer than I did.

I kiss both their heads, then pull on flannel pants and a sweater.

In the kitchen, kibble fills the dog bowl and coffee fills my mug. Bless the automatic coffee pot. Pumpkin spice creamer blooms into the dark liquid, swirling it soft and brown.

I take down a second mug, add a fresh tea bag, and set the kettle on.

I grab our books and the giant blanket and step out to the porch.

The morning is cool. Birds call to one another. Sunlight scatters across deep blue water, dazzling. Autumn-colored mountains rise beyond it, capped with drifting white clouds.

Wrapped in my blanket, I read.

A short while later, a furry blur darts out from behind me into the lawn. A soft hand runs through my hair as she finds her way into my warm cocoon. We read and sip from our mugs. The puppy patrols around the yard before returning to rest his large head in her lap. The quiet deepens as we lose ourselves in our stories together.

Eventually, hunger pulls at her. She begins to extract herself.

I don’t allow it.

I pull her back and kiss her, hands framing her face. When we part, I smile into her gaze, pouring everything I have into it.

I know she sees it.

Hunger wins — along with the knowledge that my love is a well that will never run dry.

The three of us make our way inside. She is wearing one of my larger shirts with a pair of slippers to keep warm. The dog and I patiently wait as eggs are cracked open beside the sizzling bacon. The smell fills the room, rich and promising. He will not approve of his portion.

When she slides a plate in front of me, it tastes exactly as it smells.

I break the silence.

“Good morning, love.”

She smiles over her mug, and together we will the morning to stretch into forever.",2,1768092099.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1q9kvol,https://www.reddit.com/r/micheljanseYT/comments/1q9kvol/jordy_hunting_down_tamari_for_her/,Jordy Hunting Down Tamari for Her,"In so many of the travel vlogs where she’s with Jordy, there’s always at least one instance where she tells the vlog he’s out getting something for her. In this vlog, he was out trying to find her tamari. In one vlog where they went away together, he went out trying to find grapefruit juice for her. He’ll often go out and get coffees for them. 

Am I the only one who finds this behavior strange? When my husband and I travel together, we do these sorts of things together. We get coffee together. We get groceries together. I don’t understand why these 2 are always doing solo excursions when on vacation together. Not that I think they need to spend every moment together. Sometimes I’ll hang out out in our hotel room reading or resting while he hangs out at the pool or goes to the gym. But generally, we do stuff together. 

Those of you in a couple —- is this common behavior? I genuinely want to know. 

My suspicion is he’s trying to find as many ways to avoid being filmed without it actually looking like he’s avoiding the camera; him going off to get her stuff fits the bill. Plus it makes him look like the doting spouse, which wins him points with her audience. ",4,1768092049.0,micheljanseYT,2,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

### 1.2 MimeType Detection

File type detection for handler selection:

```python
SUPPORTED_TYPES = {
    # Text
    "".txt"": ""text/plain"",
    "".md"": ""text/markdown"",
    "".pdf"": ""application/pdf"",
    "".docx"": ""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"",
    
    # Images
    "".jpg"": ""image/jpeg"",
    "".jpeg"": ""image/jpeg"",
    "".png"": ""image/png"",
    "".webp"": ""image/webp"",
    
    # Video
    "".mp4"": ""video/mp4"",
    "".mkv"": ""video/x-matroska"",
}

def detect_mime(path: Path) -> str:
    ext = path.suffix.lower()
    return SUPPORTED_TYPES.get(ext, ""application/octet-stream"")
```

### 1.3 Deduplication (pHash)

Perceptual hash for image duplicate detection:

```python
import imagehash
from PIL import Image

def phash_image(path: str, hash_size: int = 16) -> str:
    """"""
    Compute perceptual hash of image.
    
    Args:
        path: Path to image file
        hash_size: Hash size (default 16 = 256 bits)
    
    Returns:
        Hex string of perceptual hash
    """"""
    img = Image.open(path).convert(""RGB"")
    return str(imagehash.phash(img, hash_size=hash_size))

def is_duplicate(hash1: str, hash2: str, threshold: int = 10) -> bool:
    """"""
    Check if two images are duplicates.
    
    Args:
        hash1, hash2: Perceptual hashes
        threshold: Hamming distance threshold
    
    Returns:
        True if images are similar (Hamming distance < threshold)
    """"""
    h1 = imagehash.hex_to_hash(hash1)
    h2 = imagehash.hex_to_hash(hash2)
    return (h1 - h2) < threshold
```

**pHash Properties:**
- Resistant to resize, small crops, JPEG compression
- Hamming distance = number of differing bits
- Threshold 10: ~95% accuracy on near-duplicates

### 1.4 Text Extraction

Text extraction from various formats:

| Format | Library | Method |
|--------|---------|--------|
| PDF | PyMuPDF (fitz) | `page.get_text()` |
| DOCX | python-docx | `Document(path).paragraphs` |
| HTML | BeautifulSoup | `soup.get_text()` |
| Images | Florence-2 OCR | `<OCR>` task |

### 1.5 Chunking Strategy

Splitting text into chunks for embedding:

```python
CHUNK_SIZE = 512      # tokens
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 64    # overlap tokens

def chunk_text(text: str, tokenizer) -> List[str]:
    """"""
    Split text into overlapping chunks.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Tokenize full text
    2. Slide window of CHUNK_SIZE with CHUNK_OVERLAP
    3. Decode back to strings
    """"""
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
    chunks = []
    
    start = 0
    while start < len(tokens):
        end = min(start + CHUNK_SIZE, len(tokens))
        chunk_tokens = tokens[start:end]
        chunks.append(tokenizer.decode(chunk_tokens))
        start += CHUNK_SIZE - CHUNK_OVERLAP
    
    return chunks
```

### 1.6 Embedding Model

Using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Dimensions | 384 |
| Max Sequence | 256 tokens |
| Model Size | 22M parameters |
| Speed | ~14K sentences/sec (GPU) |

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def embed_chunks(chunks: List[str]) -> np.ndarray:
    """"""
    Generate embeddings for text chunks.
    
    Returns:
        numpy array of shape (n_chunks, 384)

```

### 4.4 Verification

Current implementation uses per-file SHA-256:

```python
def sha256_file(path: Path) -> str:
    """"""Compute SHA-256 hash of file.""""""
    h = hashlib.sha256()
    with path.open(""rb"") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(1024 * 1024), b""""):
            h.update(chunk)
    return h.hexdigest()

def verify_download(path: Path, expected_hash: str) -> bool:
    """"""Verify downloaded file against manifest hash.""""""
    actual = sha256_file(path)
    return actual == expected_hash
```

> [!NOTE]
> **[IMPLEMENTED]** Merkle Tree is implemented in [`core/security/merkle.py`](../../core/security/merkle.py).
> Each chunk is verified immediately upon receipt via Merkle proof.
> 
> See section ""4.4.1 Merkle Verification"" below for details.

### 4.4.1 Merkle Tree Verification [IMPLEMENTED]

Each file in the manifest contains a Merkle root:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""model.safetensors"",
  ""size"": 1500000000,
  ""sha256"": ""a1b2c3d4e5f6..."",
  ""merkle_root"": ""abc123..."",
  ""chunk_size"": 1048576
}
```

**Building the tree:**

```python
from core.security.merkle import MerkleTree

# Build tree from chunk hashes
chunk_hashes = [MerkleTree.hash_chunk(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
tree = MerkleTree(chunk_hashes)

# Get root for manifest
merkle_root = tree.root_hex
```

**Getting proof during download:**

```python
# Provider generates proof for requested chunk
proof = tree.get_proof(chunk_index)
proof_hex = tree.get_proof_hex(chunk_index)  # For JSON

# Send with chunk
response = {
    ""chunk_data"": chunk_bytes,
    ""chunk_index"": chunk_index,
    ""merkle_proof"": proof_hex,
}
```

**Verification upon receipt:**

```python
# Client verifies chunk immediately
is_valid = MerkleTree.verify_chunk(
    chunk_data=received_chunk,
    proof=proof,
    root_hash=manifest[""merkle_root""],
    chunk_index=chunk_index,
    total_chunks=total_chunks,
)

if not is_valid:
    # [SECURITY] Corrupted chunk detected!
    # 1. Reject chunk
    # 2. Log incident
    # 3. Slash peer's Trust Score
    await trust.record_event(peer_id, TrustEvent.INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF)
    raise SecurityError(f""Invalid Merkle proof for chunk {chunk_index}"")

# Chunk validated - safe to write
write_chunk(target_path, chunk_index, received_chunk)
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Instant verification of each chunk
- ✅ Corrupted data detection before disk write
- ✅ Malicious peer identification (via chunk_index)
- ✅ Protection against MITM attacks at chunk level
- ✅ Efficiency: O(log N) proof size

**Code:** [`core/security/merkle.py`](../../core/security/merkle.py)

### 4.5 Resume Support

Resuming interrupted downloads:

```python
async def _download_file(self, file_info: Dict, peers: List[str]) -> int:
    target = self.base_dir / file_info[""name""]
    size = file_info[""size""]
    total_chunks = (size + CHUNK_SIZE - 1) // CHUNK_SIZE
    
    # Resume from last complete chunk
    start_chunk = 0
    if target.exists():
        current_size = target.stat().st_size
        start_chunk = current_size // CHUNK_SIZE
    
    for idx in range(start_chunk, total_chunks):
        peer = peers[idx % len(peers)]  # Round-robin
        data = await self.fetch_chunk(peer, file_info[""name""], idx)
        write_chunk(target, idx, data)
    
    return size
```

## 7. Distributed Inference (Pipeline Parallelism) [NEW]

### 7.1 Architecture

ZEONE implements Naive Pipeline Parallelism for distributed LLM inference:

```
┌──────────┐    activations    ┌──────────┐    activations    ┌──────────┐
│ HEAD     │ ──────────────►   │ MIDDLE   │ ──────────────►   │ TAIL     │
│ Node     │                   │ Node(s)  │                   │ Node     │
│          │                   │          │                   │          │
│ Embed    │                   │ Layers   │                   │ Layers   │
│ Layers   │                   │ [N:M]    │                   │ [M:End]  │
│ [0:N]    │                   │          │                   │ LM Head  │
└──────────┘                   └──────────┘                   └──────────┘
```

**Process:**

1. **HEAD Node:** Tokenize → Embed → Layers[0:N] → Send activations
2. **MIDDLE Node(s):** Receive → Layers[N:M] → Send activations
3. **TAIL Node:** Receive → Layers[M:End] → LM Head → Detokenize → Result

### 7.2 Components

**PipelineWorker** ([`cortex/distributed/pipeline.py`](../../cortex/distributed/pipeline.py))
- Loads model shard (subset of layers)
- Processes forward pass for its layers
- Sends activations to next node

**NeuroLinkAgent** ([`agents/neuro_link.py`](../../agents/neuro_link.py))
- Transport for tensor transmission between nodes
- Uses Binary Wire Protocol with TENSOR_DATA, TENSOR_CHUNK types
- Supports chunked transfer for large tensors

**PipelineCoordinator**
- Manages pipeline topology (HEAD → MIDDLE → TAIL)
- Discovers peer nodes via DHT
- Assigns layers to nodes

### 7.3 Tensor Transport Protocol

NeuroLink uses Binary Wire Protocol with special message types:

| Message Type | Value | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `TENSOR_DATA` | 0x70 (112) | Full tensor in single packet |
| `TENSOR_META` | 0x71 (113) | Tensor metadata (shape, dtype) |
| `TENSOR_CHUNK` | 0x72 (114) | Chunked transfer for large tensors |
| `TENSOR_CHUNK_ACK` | 0x73 (115) | Chunk receipt acknowledgment |
| `PIPELINE_FORWARD` | 0x74 (116) | Forward pass activation |
| `PIPELINE_BACKWARD` | 0x75 (117) | Backward pass gradient (future) |

**Example usage:**

```python
from cortex.distributed.pipeline import PipelineWorker, PipelineConfig
from agents.neuro_link import NeuroLinkAgent

# HEAD node
config = PipelineConfig(
    model_path=""models/llama-7b"",
    stage=PipelineStage.HEAD,
    start_layer=0,
    end_layer=10,
    downstream_node=""peer_middle_node_id"",
)

neuro_link = NeuroLinkAgent(node, device=""cuda:0"")
worker = PipelineWorker(config, neuro_link)

await worker.start()

# Process input
output = await worker.process_input(input_ids)
```

```python
# MIDDLE node - register callback
async def on_activation(tensor, meta):
    """"""Handle received activation from upstream.""""""
    # Forward through our layers
    output = model_shard(tensor)
    
    # Send to downstream
    await neuro_link.send_activations(
        next_peer_id,
        output,
        layer_idx=meta['layer_idx'] + num_our_layers,
        batch_id=meta['batch_id']
    )

neuro_link.register_activation_handler(on_activation)
```

### 7.4 Performance Characteristics

**Latency:**
- Additional network round-trip per stage
- Micro-batching for compute/network overlap
- Async pipeline: next batch starts while current in transit

**Throughput:**
- Horizontal scaling for large models
- Consumer GPU nodes → Enterprise-scale inference
- Load balancing via multiple MIDDLE nodes

**Memory:**
- Each node loads only subset of layers
- 7B model: ~14GB → split across 3 nodes → ~5GB per node
- Enables running large models on consumer hardware

**Limitations:**
- Naive pipeline (no bubble scheduling)
- Inference only (backward pass = TODO)
- Assumes homogeneous layer sizes

**Code:**
- [`cortex/distributed/pipeline.py`](../../cortex/distributed/pipeline.py) - PipelineWorker, Coordinator
- [`agents/neuro_link.py`](../../agents/neuro_link.py) - NeuroLinkAgent, TensorTCPTransport
- [`cortex/distributed/codec.py`](../../cortex/distributed/codec.py) - Tensor encoding/decoding

It doesn't take much, usual two feathers (One, a wing feather with a thick quill for holding the brush feather, and the other, a body feather for the brush tip.) and a coffee stirrer straw/other stick-like item to use as a handle. 

I just cut 1"" - 1 1/2"" of quill from the wing feather, pull any fuzzy bits off and stick a thick needle through to make sure it's cleared out and hollow. Then trim the brush tip feather a little behind the feather end so it isn't too bulky, and run it through the cut piece of quill so only the very fine tip remains sticking out. 

Spread a little white glue on the quill, and slide the coffee stirrer over it, or tape/glue it to whatever else you're using. I didn't trim my extra feather length in the photo but I have begun doing it since. If any brush feather strands are untidy, I carefully trim those, but be cautious not to ruin the natural shape of the very tip. ",0,1768091698.0,minipainting,2,0.43,False

Checked out a new café called Kohi recently and thought I’d share. The place is small, cozy, and chill easy spot to sit and get some work or studying done.

I ordered the Yuzu coffee and a Vietnamese coffee. Both tasted pretty decent, though I felt the ice ratio was a bit much, which watered things down a little. The place had a foul smell idk if it was because of some floor cleaner or not but it gave me a good headache after a while.

Overall, it’s a nice compact café with a calm vibe. If you’re into finding new local spots or want a quiet place to hang out for a bit, it’s worth checking out.",1,1768091695.0,u_momookha,1,1.0,False

1q9kpfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1q9kpfj/i_deleted_social_media_for_60_days_and_it_rebuilt/,I deleted social media for 60 days and it rebuilt my entire brain,"
I was scrolling for 6 hours a day and didn’t even realize it.

Instagram while eating breakfast. TikTok while getting ready. Twitter during my commute. Reddit at work between tasks. YouTube during lunch. Back to Instagram in the afternoon. TikTok again at night. Repeat every single day.

My screen time report showed 6 hours and 20 minutes average daily usage on social media alone. That’s over 40 hours a week. A full time job’s worth of hours spent scrolling through other people’s curated lives, manufactured outrage, and meaningless content I’d forget 10 seconds after seeing it.

I was 28 years old and I’d spent probably 15,000 hours of my life scrolling social media. If I’d spent that time learning literally anything else I’d be a master at it by now. Instead I was a master at mindless scrolling and I had nothing to show for it.

My attention span was completely destroyed. I couldn’t focus on anything real for more than 2 minutes without feeling the urge to check my phone. Reading a book was impossible. Watching a movie without scrolling felt boring. Even conversations felt too slow, I’d be nodding along while mentally itching to check Instagram.

I felt anxious and inadequate constantly. Seeing everyone else’s highlight reels made my actual life feel boring and unsuccessful. I’d compare my behind the scenes to everyone else’s filtered perfect moments and feel like shit about myself.

I wasn’t even enjoying the scrolling. It was just a compulsion. I’d open Instagram, scroll for 20 minutes, close it, then immediately open it again without thinking. My brain was on autopilot seeking dopamine hits and I was completely powerless to stop it.

Every time I had a free moment, instead of being present or thinking or resting, I was scrolling. Waiting in line, sitting on the toilet, lying in bed, cooking dinner, any spare second was filled with social media. I couldn’t just exist anymore without input.

Then I saw my year in review screen time stats. 2,190 hours on social media in one year. That’s 91 full days. Three entire months of my year spent scrolling apps. When I saw that number I felt sick.

I was wasting my life one scroll at a time and I couldn’t stop myself.

So I made a decision: 60 days with zero social media. Delete every app, block every site, go completely dark. No Instagram, no TikTok, no Twitter, no Reddit, nothing. Cold turkey for two months.

It was brutal but it completely rewired my brain.

## What I actually did

**Deleted every social media app**

Day one I deleted Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube app, Snapchat, everything. Didn’t just log out, fully deleted them from my phone so I couldn’t impulsively reinstall.

Also downloaded this app called Reload that someone mentioned on Reddit before I deleted it. It creates 60 day structured plans and more importantly, it blocks sites and apps during scheduled hours. Set it to block all social media sites 24/7 on my phone and laptop.

That way even if I got weak and tried to access social media through a browser, it wouldn’t load. External enforcement for when my willpower failed.

**Removed the browser from my home screen**

I moved Safari into a folder on my last screen page so I couldn’t easily access it to try browsing social media sites. Made relapse require multiple intentional steps instead of being automatic.

**Told people I’d be unreachable on social**

Sent messages to close friends saying I’m deleting social media for 60 days, if you need me text or call. Most people were supportive, some thought I was being dramatic. I didn’t care, I needed to do this.

**Filled the void with the structured plan**

The Reload app built me a complete 60 day plan based on my situation. It structured my entire day with progressive goals that increased week by week. Sleep schedule, workouts, reading time, skill development, everything planned out.

That structure was critical because without it I would’ve just sat around with 6 empty hours per day not knowing what to do with myself.

-----

## DAY 1-3: Withdrawal was real

The first three days I felt like I was going through actual withdrawal. My hand would reach for my phone constantly out of pure habit. I’d unlock it, see my empty home screen, remember I deleted everything, feel this wave of anxiety and restlessness.

I’d be eating breakfast and my brain would scream at me to open Instagram. I’d be sitting on the couch and feel this overwhelming urge to scroll TikTok. Every spare second my brain wanted that dopamine hit it was used to getting.

Day 2 I almost gave up. I was lying in bed and the urge to reinstall Instagram was so strong I had the app store open and my finger hovering over the download button. I stopped myself by thinking about that 2,190 hours I’d wasted last year.

Day 3 I felt genuinely anxious and irritable. My brain was in withdrawal from the constant dopamine flood. I couldn’t focus on anything, felt restless and uncomfortable, kept picking up my phone and putting it down over and over.

-----

## DAY 4-7: Boredom became unbearable

The rest of the first week was just brutal boredom. Without social media filling every gap, I had so much empty time and I didn’t know what to do with myself.

Eating meals without scrolling felt weird. Sitting on the toilet without Reddit felt uncomfortable. Lying in bed without TikTok meant I was just alone with my thoughts, which I’d been avoiding for years.

I started following the plan Reload built for me just to have something to do. Week one goals were simple. Wake at 9am, work out 20 minutes 3 times, read for 15 minutes before bed, learn a skill for 30 minutes daily.

The reading was painful at first. My brain couldn’t focus on a book for more than 5 minutes without wanting to check my phone. But I forced myself to sit there and push through.

-----

## DAY 8-14: Something started shifting

Week two my brain started adapting. The constant urge to check social media decreased from every 5 minutes to every hour or so.

I started actually reading before bed and kind of enjoying it. Finished a book for the first time in probably 2 years. My brain was slowly remembering how to engage with long form content.

The plan increased to waking at 8:30am, working out 25 minutes 4 times per week, reading 20 minutes daily, learning skills 45 minutes daily. I was filling the time I used to spend scrolling with things that actually improved my life.

Day 12 I realized I hadn’t thought about Instagram in like 4 hours. That was the first time since deleting it that it hadn’t been constantly on my mind.

Day 14 I had a full conversation with a friend without once thinking about checking my phone. I was actually present and listening instead of being half there.

-----

## DAY 15-21: My attention span started returning

Week three I could focus on tasks for 30-40 minutes without getting restless. My brain was starting to function like it used to before social media destroyed it.

I was reading for 30 minutes every night and actually retaining what I read. I was learning Python during the hour I used to spend scrolling and making real progress.

Work became way more productive. I could focus on projects for extended periods instead of constantly breaking focus to scroll. What used to take me 6 hours of distracted work took 3 hours of actual focus.

The plan had me waking at 8am now, working out 35 minutes 5 times weekly, reading 30 minutes, skill development 60 minutes. My entire routine had restructured around productivity instead of scrolling.

## DAY 22-30: I stopped missing it

By the end of week four I genuinely didn’t miss social media anymore. I’d think about it occasionally but it was just a passing thought, not a craving.

I was sleeping better because I wasn’t scrolling before bed. I’d read for 40 minutes, put the book down, and actually fall asleep instead of scrolling until 2am.

My anxiety decreased noticeably. Not seeing everyone’s curated perfect lives meant I wasn’t constantly comparing myself and feeling inadequate. My baseline mood improved.

I had real hobbies now. I was learning to code, reading books, working out consistently, cooking actual meals. Things that required effort but left me feeling satisfied instead of empty like scrolling always did.

Day 30 I hit a milestone. Full month without social media. Longest I’d gone since creating my first account at 16. I felt proud of myself for the first time in years.

-----

## DAY 31-45: Everything accelerated

Weeks 5 and 6 my transformation really accelerated. I was waking at 7am naturally, working out an hour daily, reading 45 minutes every night, learning and building projects 90 minutes per day.

I’d finished 4 books. Built two small projects with the coding skills I learned. Lost 12 pounds from consistent workouts and better eating. My entire life looked different.

Work performance improved so much my boss asked what changed. Told him I deleted social media and he laughed but then saw my output had doubled and stopped laughing.

I reconnected with friends in person instead of just liking their posts. Actually grabbed coffee and had real conversations. Those connections felt way more meaningful than commenting on Instagram stories ever did.

Day 38 I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I felt FOMO. The fear of missing out that had driven my social media addiction was completely gone. Turns out I wasn’t missing anything important.

-----

## DAY 46-60: Complete transformation

The last two weeks solidified everything. My brain had completely rewired. Social media wasn’t part of my life anymore and I didn’t want it back.

I was waking at 6:30am, working out 6 days a week, reading every night, building real skills, being productive, living an actual life instead of watching other people’s lives through screens.

My attention span was fully recovered. I could read for over an hour without getting distracted. I could work on complex tasks for 2-3 hours straight. My brain worked the way it used to before social media fried it.

I’d finished 9 books total. Learned enough Python to build functional projects. Lost 18 pounds and was in the best shape I’d been in since college. Made real progress in every area of life.

Day 60 I hit the finish line. Two full months without social media. I felt like a completely different person than I was on day one.

-----

## What actually changed in 60 days

**My attention span came back completely**

I could focus on difficult tasks for hours. I could read books and retain everything. I could have deep conversations without my mind wandering. My brain functioned properly again.

**I got 6 hours of my life back every day**

Six hours that I used to waste scrolling got redirected into learning skills, reading, working out, building things, living. That’s 360 hours over 60 days. Fifteen full days of productive time instead of mindless scrolling.

**My mental health improved dramatically**

No more constant comparison and inadequacy. No more anxiety from consuming everyone else’s problems and outrage. No more feeling behind in life. My baseline mood was better than it had been in years.

**I built actual skills**

Learned to code well enough to build projects. Read enough books to actually expand my knowledge. Got in real physical shape. Developed hobbies. All things I “didn’t have time for” when I was scrolling 6 hours a day.

**My relationships became real**

Instead of surface level social media interactions, I had deep in person conversations. I was present with people. I built actual connections instead of just following hundreds of acquaintances online.

**I knew myself again**

Social media had been filling my brain with everyone else’s thoughts and opinions and content. Without that noise, I could hear my own thoughts again. I remembered who I actually was.

**Work performance skyrocketed**

My productivity tripled because I could actually focus. Got promoted because my output and quality improved so dramatically. All from just being able to concentrate without the constant pull of social media.

-----

## The reality, it was fucking hard

This was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. The first two weeks especially were brutal. My brain fought me constantly wanting that dopamine hit from scrolling.

There were multiple times I almost gave up and reinstalled everything. The urge was overwhelming. What saved me was the blocking through Reload making it difficult to access even if I wanted to, and the structured plan giving me things to do instead of just sitting with emptiness.

But pushing through that discomfort revealed that I’d been avoiding my actual life by numbing myself with social media. Once I stopped avoiding, I could actually build something real.

-----

## If you’re addicted to social media

Track your actual usage for one week. Don’t try to change it, just see the real number. That awareness of how much time you’re wasting might shock you into action like it did for me.

Delete the apps completely, don’t just log out. Make reinstalling require effort and intention instead of being automatic.

Use blockers to enforce the commitment. I used Reload which blocked all social media sites even through browsers and also gave me a complete structured plan to follow. External enforcement works when willpower fails.

Fill the void before you delete. Have a plan for what you’ll do with all that free time or you’ll just sit there miserable and relapse. Reading, learning skills, working out, anything productive.

Give it 60 days minimum. The first two weeks suck. Week three gets manageable. By week six you won’t even miss it. Your brain needs time to rewire.

Tell people you’re unreachable on social so they text or call instead. Real communication is better anyway.

Accept that you’ll feel FOMO at first. You will feel like you’re missing things. You’re not. Nothing important happens on social media. Everything that matters reaches you through actual communication.

-----

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was scrolling 6 hours a day, wasting my life watching other people’s curated moments, destroying my attention span, feeling anxious and inadequate constantly.

Now I’ve read 9 books, learned to code, lost 18 pounds, tripled my work productivity, rebuilt my attention span, reconnected with real friends, and remembered who I actually am.

Two months without social media completely transformed my brain and my life.

You’re not going to miss anything important by deleting social media. You’re going to gain back hours of your life every single day. You’re going to rebuild your attention span. You’re going to stop comparing yourself to everyone. You’re going to actually live instead of watching.

Delete the apps today. Block the sites. Build a plan for what you’ll do instead. Give it 60 days.

The version of you without social media is smarter, calmer, more focused, and more present than the version endlessly scrolling.

O espaço trabalha com combos bastante variados de café da manhã, com opções com pães, bolos, doces, frutas, geleias, frios, cafés, chás e outras bebidas, além dos itens avulsos.

O atendimento também não foi nada demais, e isso foi um ponto negativo considerando a taxa de serviço de **13%!**

Pra comer, nós pedimos a mesma coisa: waffles de queijo coalho com doce de leite (R$22 cada), que estavam bem gostosos. A massa tava bem *queijuda* e o doce era um bem equilibrado em vez daqueles doces de leite super doces típicos brasileiros. Pra beber eu pedi um café coado (R$9) que achei caído. Era café tradicional servido de uma garrafa térmica igual a de casa de vó, esperava mais de um lugar mais requintado. Meus amigos pediram também iced coffee com leite de aveia (R$17) e espresso duplo (R$16)

Sou suspeito pra falar dessa experiência porque ela foi limitada pela escolha pouco variada dos nossos pratos, mas no conjunto da obra eu saí de lá satisfeito com o que provei. Quero voltar outras vezes pra pegar os combos e poder avaliar melhor a qualidade da comida local.

May and Ken are twins, with the former being born before the latter. And despite being twins, they like to call each other “Big sis” or “Little bro”. May is considered a “mama’s girl” for Sidney, with Ken being a “mama’s boy” for Erma. They call Sidney “Mom” and Erma “Mama.” 

Backstory: Erma and Sidney realized they are compatible with each other and started dating that lasted through their adult years. Their friends supported them all the way, but the biggest supporter is Connor. Despite the fact that he was a little heartbroken, he’d be lying if he said that he and Erma would make it work. During their wedding, Connor became the best man. Sam tried his best to hold in his tears as Erma walked down that aisle. Erma had to become the carrier after performing magic that would require a DNA of Sidney. At first, before the twins were born, Delapore was worried that Erma would end up like Sidney’s mother who died at childbirth. Delapore realized who he’s talking about and lost that fear. Emiko acted like the kind of parent who is happy to be a grandmother but also looked like she is going to kill her in-law. Sam was overjoyed and went around town saying “I’M GONNA BE A GRANDPA!!” Their friends were happy for Erma while Terry teased Sidney. When Erma gave birth, she immediately teared up at the sight of them. When Sidney entered, she would want her to hold their new children, but one of the babies (Ken) started to cry as he was away from Erma. Knowing Ken prefers to be with her, Erma lets Sidney hold May instead. Sidney had never seen such a beautiful thing as May and Ken. 

May’s appearance: May is a little smaller than her twin brother. She is considered to be a mixture of her mothers. Having her white skin/fur, and black hair from Erma, She has rat features and golden eyes like Sidney. She wears a monochrome dress that is gradient, almost like it is a grey dress. She wears high boots not just for running, but making devastating kicks to anyone who insults her mothers.

May’s personality: Her personality is kind of a lazy one. She would always appear tired and would be considered a small talker, unlike her mother, Erma. Despite her lazy personality, she still loves her mothers and brother. Her tiredness is why her main drink is coffee, just to make her medium active. It could be said that she inherited Sidney’s bitterness and Erma’s curious nature. 

May’s relationship with others; 

Sidney: May would often interact with Sidney about anything she wants to talk about. She sometimes feels like she is inferior compared to her as she thinks that Sidney had such a wonderful life, unaware that she was an outcast herself when she was young. Despite how she feels, May still loves her mother as she is her mentor. Erma: She loves and cherishes Erma with all of her heart. May would often sing songs for her. She would always ask her about Warrior Unicorn Princess and why Erma loves it so much. On Erma’s birthday, May would give her a WUP fanfic as a birthday gift (They are very brutal, but Erma loves them anyway). 

Ken: He is her best friend. They have a symbiotic relationship. He was able to make sure May gets to pay attention to important details. Ken would always make sure his “big sister” will be able to enjoy life as he is at the moment. 

Sam: To her, all she could think about doing is pity him. She has heard so many stories about him, how he lost his father, the wedding crash, the blood moon event, etc. She wondered how on earth he could phase out all the horrifying events in his life. She still loves him, but she couldn’t stop herself from pitying him. 

Emiko: She doesn’t really like being with her for some reason. Maybe it’s because her horror is not as beautiful as Erma’s, maybe she thinks trouble follows wherever she goes, she isn’t sure. All May could do is make sure Emiko doesn’t ruin anything that would make things worse for her mothers.

Yureimoto Family: Osamu and Amaya dead (Good Riddance on Osamu, for Amaya is unsure how to feel.) Erma’s aunts and uncle completely adore her twins. Mitsu and Momo immediately wanted to prank them, but Hanzo (their father) stopped them before anything else. 

Delapore: May would want to ask him about Sidney’s mother. He is glad to tell his granddaughter about his wife. She finds him wise and honorable, even though they don’t really talk much and would often see each other in a week.",1,1768091472.0,Erma,0,1.0,False

Despite living on opposite coasts, not keeping in regular touch for the last 10 years, and life/family decisions that moved us in different directions, it was easy to be together in a way that I don't often feel with new friends. The conversation felt authentic, vulnerable, and easy -- like we could both access parts of ourselves that date back to the start of our friendship. 

We weren't auditioning our success for each other or trying to provide a sanitized highlight reel. We just were ... in the moment. Reconnecting over coffee. As ourselves. Not our LinkedIn profile selves, or holiday card selves.

I am a 26M working at a hospital. Earlier this week I spent two days on the same ward fixing technical issues, which meant I interacted a lot with a 23F admin worker there. On first interaction I commented how her co-worker has a cool last name, and she interrupts by saying ""Oh is my last-name not cool enough"" with a teasing laugh. That's when I got alarm bells thinking if she was just being polite or flirting. Across those two days we had very easy conversation. She asked me a lot of personal questions, restarted the chat whenever it went quiet, and seemed genuinely warm and engaged. Her coworker also asked questions about my relationship status in a way that felt like gentle probing.

By the end of the second day, the vibe felt positive enough (I was very nervous to do this) that I asked if she wanted to get a coffee sometime. She smiled ear to ear as I was saying ""I'd love to take you out for coffee sometime"" , hesitated for a second - said ""uhhh"" - at this very moment I said it's ""no pressure either way"", then said yes and gave me her number. I texted later that evening to suggest a place. She responds a couple of hours saying she can't do the weekend but she wants to reschedule for another day. I responded with what's a day that works for her. 

The next day I got the response from her stating she's not ready to start anything at the moment after some time to think. Wished me the best. I responded politely and left it there.

I'll be back in that hospital in two weeks time, since we work in completely separate departments, I want to make sure I handle seeing her again in a professional and comfortable way. 

I feel a little bit disappointed by the result seeing that this was my first attempt of putting myself out there after a breakup.  How can I make sense of someone showing interest in person but later deciding they are not in a place to date? Did she perhaps lose interest all of a sudden?

Everything changed when we discovered who we really were.,"It was midnight when I stumbled into our office, two lukewarm coffees in hand.

Well, not exactly ‘our’ office.

Middleview North University didn’t recognize us as a real club. 

Apparently, “Investigative newspaper” didn’t cut it. 

When we pleaded our case to the dean, he relented and let us use the storage closet on the third floor of the arts building. 

Small victories. 

At the back of my mind, I knew exactly why we weren’t being taken seriously. 

We hadn’t solved one mystery. Our whole shtick was, “We will take any case!” Whether it’s small, like a cheating partner, or big like a kidnapping. 

We promised to solve them all. And then, we didn't.

After fumbling almost all of our cases, we had one last chance to prove ourselves.

This time, with a real mystery.

Four months ago, two 19 year old male MNU students went missing.

The only thing left behind was their right shoes. We were stumped. 

The local police were useless, so we took it upon ourselves to prove we weren’t just loser college kids trying to be Scooby Doo rejects.

As expected, the storage closet was the size of a prison cell—or maybe that was being generous.

The three of us managed to squeeze in a desk and a chair, and I still felt like I was stepping into Narnia every time I entered. 

Above my head, an old chandelier swung from a broken chain, like any day, it would fail like we had and come crashing down. 

I wanted to ask why a storage closet had a chandelier, but I had a feeling the answer would give me a migraine. 

Tonight was no different than any other. I was exhausted after spending my day off in the library researching the town’s local history. 

I gave up when my phone became too tempting, and I started doomscrolling TikTok. I only snapped out of it when a guy from one of my classes, sitting across from me, started talking about the missing boys. 

He asked me about the case, and I just shrugged and said, “We’re working on it.”

We were, in fact, *not* working on it. The police had already issued us a cease and desist, so we had no access to reports.

All we had was the tiny office we called home. Kicking off my shoes, I ducked inside, clutching the coffees to my chest. 

Only two people were allowed inside at once, due to safety hazards or whatever. 

The university really would rather we suffocate than give us actual damn space.

“I hope you like slightly warm coffee,” I said, squeezing into the closet.

“You’re late,” a voice grumbled from inside.

Piled on top of our desk were a laptop and a pile of unsolved cases. Sitting hunched over his MacBook sat Aris Caine, his squinty eyes illuminated in the sharp, fluorescent glow from our Ikea lamp.

Disheveled as usual, glasses perched atop thick blonde curls, hair a tangled mess hanging in overshadowed eyes. He’d spent all day running his hands through it. I knew him far too well.

He only took off his glasses when he was pissed or figured something out. I prayed for the latter.

For a British exchange student who exclusively wore sweater vests and spoke like a walking thesaurus, he was a prickly asshole. But he was also incredibly smart. Stupid smart.

“There was a line,” I lied, setting his (cold) coffee in front of him. 

In actuality, I had bumped into a group of “fans” who reminded me that we were useless. 

But of course I didn’t tell him that, instead offering Aris a smile and nudging his coffee toward him. 

I noticed his stance, furrowed brow, folded arms and leg jiggling, like he couldn’t wait to tell me something. Or maybe he just really had to pee.

It reminded me of when we first met, when we both signed up to edit the college newspaper; which was perhaps the only time I’d seen him smile. 

Aris only smiled when he had something tangible worth smiling about, which piqued my curiosity. I knew Aris like he knew me. Something was bothering him. 

And naturally, that asshole had wanted to wait for me to come back to gauge my reaction in person, instead of texting me a goddamn heads up.

I sipped my coffee while I tried my best to psychoanalyze him.

“You haven’t found them,” I hummed around the rim of my coffee cup. Ugh. The coffee tasted like burnt mildew. “But you’re getting closer?”

Aris simply cocked an eyebrow and turned his laptop around. I peered at the screen, a photo of a group of smiling kids.

It was an article from 2013 detailing Middleview’s Boy Scouts raising money for town hall renovations.

“Boy Scouts?” I murmured, leaning closer. I shot him an eyebrow right back. “Dude, I’m too tired to understand your brain.”

Aris’s lips pricked. “The cops said the guys had no connection,” he rolled his eyes.

He leaned forward and prodded the screen. “But, as you can see, both of them were in the 2013 Boy Scouts.” Aris traced the faces of the missing boys. 

“Which means, at some point, both of these boys have visited a Middleview resident.” He grabbed a printout and slapped it down in front of me. “They did these bake sales every year.” He explained. “I bet their kidnapper bought cookies from them.”

I scanned the article. “Hmm. So, the kidnapper targeted former Boy Scouts they bought cookies from?”

Aris shook his head, rocking back in his chair. His eyes found the ceiling. “I’m not there yet, Nancy Drew. May is pinpointing every resident who was a regular.”

My head jerked up. “You’re not serious.”

“If they bought cookies, we’re visiting them,” Aris muttered, massaging his temples like *he* was the one with a headache.

He groaned, tipping his head back and pinching between his brows. “What be their motive, though? That is what is so… logically indefensible.”

“It’s late, Aris,” I whined. “Can you please be NORMAL, for once?”

I mulled the information around in my head, kneeling uncomfortably on the cold wood floor in front of the desk.

No chairs, no beanbags. I drained my coffee as Aris sipped his own, made a face, and plonked his back down.  “But, why wait years to take them?” I pondered.  

“Why wait until they grew up?”

“Loneliness!”

An all-too-familiar voice startled me. Aris, as usual, was unperturbed, leaning further back in his chair.

May Lee, our third and final member, stuck her head through the door, bright orange hair igniting under the light. 

Korean American with the look of a runway model, May did not fit with us. 

That’s what I thought, at least. 

Don’t judge a book by its cover. 

When she showed up at our door donning a strawberry purse, skater dress, and a full notebook of suspects for our missing statue case, I couldn't take her seriously. 

Neither could Aris. In fact, our very own Sam Spade told her to fuck off. 

That was, until we found ourselves tied up in an old man’s basement, and it was that girl with the kitten heels who saved us from becoming Middleview’s next mystery.

But now, normally talkative May was strangely silent as she squeezed through the door. 

I took a moment to notice May was in pajamas, her hair still wrapped up in a towel. 

She held up her phone. “I’ve been on the phone with the former Boy Scout leader, and after a slight maybe-bribe, he gave me all of his customers' names. Past and present. And there were a lot of people.”

Aris raised a brow. “What did you bribe him with, may I ask?”

“That’s not important right now,” she rolled her eyes, speaking in a tangled rush of what I liked to call May Babble. “Anyway, to cut a long story short, after going through each customer, there was only ever one person who bought cookies every year.” 

May’s eyes found mine. “Jenny Pearson. 56 years old. She spent thousands of dollars on them. Like, she was OBSESSED.”

I nodded slowly, picking up on her words. “So, this is revenge?” I said. “For shitty cookies?”

“Perhaps they poisoned her?” Aris offered, cupping his chin. “Boy scout cookies are unfavorably mundane.”

May shook her head. “No. You've both been looking at this case from a perspective of malice. Jenny lost both of her teenage sons a year ago in a car crash,” she said. “Both of whom—”

Aris jumped up, his eyes wide. “Would be nineteen right now.”

May nodded grimly, folding her arms across strawberry-themed pajamas. 

“Loneliness,” she reiterated. “This woman lost her sons. So, what if she took two boys who were just like them? Two boys, whom she knew. Who she’d been buying cookies from since they were little kids.”

That would be the moment when any other trio of ragtag college detectives would… I don’t know, call the cops?

But this was our last chance to prove ourselves, a real kidnapping case with an actual criminal.

We’d spent our freshman year dealing with catnapping and missing statues, and this was an actual crime.

May insisted she was a lonely woman who was grieving, but there was a big difference between healthy grieving and kidnapping two nineteen-year-olds to replace her sons. It only took one look between us, and we were falling out of our closet-office faster than May could call us an Uber. 

Taking two steps down the stairs at a time, Aris was already ordering us around. 

“May, what’s the address?” he panted as we pushed through automatic doors and into the moonlit night.

Our Uber was already there, waiting. Aris jumped into the back, and I squeezed in beside him. 

He was already buzzing with excitement, almost vibrating in his seat, so much that May elbowed him. “Marin. I need the boys' names,” he said, snapping his fingers.

I pulled out my notebook, scanning my barely cohesive shorthand, grateful for the orangeade glow of passing lampposts.

“Prestley,” I said, squinting at the names. “Prestley and Beck.”

Aris’s head shot up. “Where have I heard that name before? Beck.”

His question hovered in the air like spoiled milk during a ten-minute drive where I was sweating, far too aware that we were actively interfering with a police investigation. 

Would this go on my permanent record? 

Mom made it pretty clear when I was hauled into the station for the third time that it would be the last time she would bail me out. 

The cops said this was our last chance—the next time we were caught, the three of us would be tried as adults. 

In my excitement, I kind of forgot about that part.  

A quick glance at Aris Caine, my partner in crime, whose expression was set in cartoonish determination, and I bit back a groan. 

Suddenly, the idea of confronting an actual kidnapper wasn’t such a good idea.

Once the adrenaline and dopamine rush had crashed and burned, I was left nauseous, and actually really fucking terrified I was going to die. My clammy hands dipped into my lap.

To distract myself, I stared out the window, watching the late-night traffic zip by in an aurora of cyberpunk colors. `

When we pulled up outside a regular suburban home, I really started rethinking my life choices.

Aris tilted his head, his eyes fixed on the “welcome home!” sign on the front door. 

He shoved his hands into his jacket pockets. 

Aris was the only one dressed appropriately for the occasion, in a sensible fur-coated jacket. It wasn’t a secret that his family was wealthy, but Aris wasn’t one to brag. 

“I was expecting a house of horrors,” he hummed. “This place belongs in a Hallmark movie.”

May, shivering and jumping up and down in her pajamas, nudged him. “Hallmark horror movies exist, y’know.”

“Let’s think about this,” Aris said, as it became clear we were just three college kids completely out of our depth standing on a random suburban street at 1am.

I dazedly watched my breath dance in front of me in white wisps.

Aris stared at Jenny Pearson’s house across the street. He was doing that thing again where he calculated everything in his mind, every possible escape route and every obstacle.

After a full minute of zoning out, swaying back and forth, and most importantly, not speaking, he finally turned to us. 

Aris had a plan. But from the look on his face, we were not going to like it. 

“I think I’ve got it,” he said. 

“So this woman kidnaps guys like her sons, right?” he hissed excitedly, zipping up his jacket. 

“So, I’ll knock and innocently ask if I can use her phone, she lets me in, and…bingo. I search the place, grab the guys, drag them out of the murder house, and we all go and grab coffee together.”

His grin was typical. 

Of course, Aris Caine was putting himself in unnecessary danger. He was just that kind of guy.

I already hated his plan.

May, of course, was against it.

“Are you serious?” she hissed. “You want to intentionally get kidnapped to prove she’s the kidnapper?” She rolled her eyes, “or we could just go over like three normal people and *ask* her.”

Aris laughed loudly. 

We were already attracting unwanted attention just by standing there. 

I shot him a warning glare, but of course he kept going because Aris Caine had to be right. 

“Oh, sure, that won’t ring any alarm bells.” Aris’s accent thickened with sarcasm. 

“Hi, lady! Sorry to bother you,” he said, mocking May’s squeaky voice. I bit my lip to hold back a smirk. “But are you keeping two nineteen-year-old students captive?” 

He turned to May, his lips curling. “I’m sure Mrs. Pearson will be completely honest with us.”

“I don’t sound like that,” May muttered.

“I know,” he sent her a rare teasing smile. “I was exaggerating for comedic effect.” 

Aris sighed. “Look, I know you don’t like it, but it looks less suspicious than three well-known detectives turning up.” He coughed. “I can also do a passable American accent that she’ll totally believe.”

“And what if *you* are taken too?” I hissed, blowing into my hands to keep them warm. “We have zero idea what state these guys are in and what she’s done to them—” I caught myself before I could let my emotions get the better of me. 

But they always won. “What if they’re dead?” I caught Aris’s raised eyebrow. “Even worse, what if she’s torturing them, like right now?”

Aris shot me a look. He folded his arms. “Marin, she’s a fifty-year-old mother,” he said, “not exactly Hannibal Lecter.”

“May I remind you both that Hannibal Lecter was really polite?” May hissed, hugging me for warmth. “Serial killers are actually known to be super chill! He ate with a handkerchief!”

Aris’s lip quirked. “You mean the *fictional* cannibal, Hannibal Lecter?”

May squeaked. “That’s not—”

“Yes it is,” he mused. “You’re talking about the TV show.”

“Shut up,” I hissed, noticing a window flicker behind us. The owner was watching. 

Which meant we had to make a decision.

I turned to Aris, a bad feeling already writhing in my gut. I had a choice. 

Let Aris sacrifice himself or get us all arrested. “Ten minutes,” I told him. “If you’re in there for a second longer, we’ll call the police, and all three of us are fucked.” Unable to stop my wandering hands, I fiddled with his hair in an attempt to hide his face. 

Aris squirmed, batting my hands away. Two months since we broke up; since I said we weren’t working.

He cared more about solving cases than about me. But that was okay because so did I. 

We were both stubborn, inexperienced introverts with a shared obsession with solving mysteries.

Of course we didn’t work. Opposites attract, but Aris and I repelled.  

Still, I cared for him more than I should.

I tucked a talkie into his pocket. “Use this when you can,” I said. “Don’t bother with pleasantries, and whatever you do, don’t accept any food or drink.”

“If she has weapons or you suspect any weird shit, get out of there,” May said, slapping him on the back.

“Relax,” Aris wasn’t a hugger, but he did bury his head in my shoulder. 

I appreciated his warmth, his proximity, which meant he was actually *trying*, his shuddery breaths dancing across the nape of my neck. I wanted him to stay longer before he pulled away and offered a two-fingered salute. “I’ll be fine!” he insisted. “I *promise* I won’t become a pod person.”

“Ten minutes,” I hissed before he darted across the road.

I couldn’t resist jumping to my feet. “Say it, Aris!” I whispered. “Ten minutes!”

“Ten minutes!” he hissed back, twisting around, his eyes sharp, lips curled. “Hide!”

I grabbed May, pulling her safely behind a car with me. I watched from a distance, scrutinizing every facial expression when the front door opened, revealing a middle-aged woman sticking her head out—purple hair and a bright green knitted sweater. 

Not what I was expecting. 

The woman didn’t seem defensive or suspicious, settling Aris with a warm smile. She didn’t *look* like a criminal mastermind. May passed me a pair of binoculars, and I focused on her facial expressions. Looking behind her, all I saw was a painting on the wall.

Aris stayed calm and collected, delivering his lines exactly as we rehearsed them. 

“Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but I’m pretty lost. Can I use your phone to call someone? Mine is dead.”

Jenny Pearson’s lips broke out into a grin, and I caught May’s side-eye. She must have thought it was Christmas.

“Oh, of course!” Jenny Pearson sang, and my hands grew clammy around the binoculars. “Do you have any friends with you?”

Fuck.

May let out a hiss next to me. I wasn’t expecting that.

Neither was Aris, judging by his response. “Uh, no,” he said, maintaining his performance.  “No, it’s just me.”

“Well, come on in, sweetheart!” she said. “You can use my landline!”

“Do people even use landlines anymore?” May whispered. “It’s not the 90’s.”

Before I could respond, Jenny ushered Aris through the door and slammed it behind her, sending my heart into acrobatics.

Twenty minutes passed.

“He said ten minutes,” I gritted out. I jumped up, and she gently dragged me back down.

“Give him time,” May said, focusing on the upstairs, while I was glued to the door, mentally praying for the damned thing to fly open and for my idiot ex-boyfriend to come running out, two disheveled guys in tow. “Come on. Wasn’t that what broke you up? You didn’t *trust* each other.” 

She sighed. “You were cute. It sucks that both of you are insufferable.”

“I’m not stubborn,” I lied, exasperated. “He just sucked at being a boyfriend.”

May chuckled. “Which went both ways, you know,” she teased. “You also sucked at being a *girlfriend*.” She turned to me, grinning. “Didn’t you blow him off twice to go solo investigating?”

A warm rush of heat flooded my cheeks. “He did exactly the same thing to me,” I said.”

“Sooo, relationships are a competitive sport now?” May’s judgmental stare was burning a hole in my temple. “Aris scored a touchdown, and you played dirty, tackling him. You didn’t even give him a chance to reclaim the ball, didn't even explain your tackle, and you're both playing for the same team.”

“Sports metaphors?” I hissed, rubbing my eyes.

The Pearson door stayed shut. 

The welcome home sign on the door was beginning to look less like a greeting and more like a threat. “Sports metaphors that don’t even make sense in the middle of a life-or-death situation?”

May groaned. “I feel like my fingers are going to drop off and my butt is numb, so naturally, my brain is a mashed potato right now.” She sighed, adjusting her position to a light crouch.  “Anyway. Aris didn’t mean to blow you off.”

Something visceral erupted in my gut, twisting down my spine, the phantom legs of a spider scuttling along my vertebrae. 

And for a moment, I forgot about the Pearson house, the missing boys, and our stakeout. I twisted to May, my cheeks burning, my tongue in knots. “What?”

“He didn’t mean to blow you off,” May turned back toward the house. 

“That night, when you were on your date, I stupidly decided to confront the idiot who stole the town statue. I had all the evidence, but I didn’t tell you guys because I…” she trailed off. “Let’s just say he’s done this before.” 

She shuffled uncomfortably. “I went over to his dorm room, and after freaking out, he locked me inside.” 

May’s voice cracked. “I called Aris, who was on his way to meet you, and he came straight away.” She sniffled, swiping her nose. “It's dusty out here or something, stupid allergies.”

My voice came out tangled and wrong, suffocating my tongue. “Why didn’t he *tell* me?”

“I told him not to,” she whispered. “I was embarrassed. I didn’t want you to think I was reckless, and at first, he refused because he knew it would look bad. But I managed to convince him.” 

Her lip curled. “I’m actually still doing homework for him. That was part of our deal.”

I found myself laughing, but my heart hurt. I blew him off for nothing. I was unnecessarily cruel for nothing. “You’re both idiots.”

May spun around. “Soo, you’ll talk to him?”

I wasn’t sure if *talk* was the right word.

Maybe *scream*.

“Yeah,” I said, my chest aching. “Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But this doesn’t change anything. He fucks with mysteries, not people,” I couldn’t resist laughing. ""That guy gets off by solving cases. Do you know how many times we had sex? Zero.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Any time we were close, he’d get this weird look in his eyes, and say, 'Holy shit, I’ve got it!' like, he literally had his lightbulb moment right in the middle of making out.”

May burst into giggles. “That’s adorable.” She nudged me. “You loved it, though.” Her smirk caught me off guard. “You still like our boy, don’t you?”

“I don’t,” I said.

I did.

After half an hour, I started to lose circulation in my legs from crouching in the same spot.

Once the forty-five-minute mark had passed, I noticed the upper bedroom window’s curtains were suddenly pulled closed.

May nudged me, still peering through her binoculars. “Do you think we’re wrong?” she whispered. “What if she’s a grieving mother who just happens to like Boy Scout cookies?”

I didn’t take my eyes off the window. “If she’s just lost her sons, why is she closing the curtains to one of their rooms?” I said, “She lives alone, why bother?”

May shrugged. “She still tends to their rooms?”

“Nope,” I muttered, focusing on the front door. My heart started to stumble. “If I were a kidnapper and I just took another victim, the first thing I would do is make sure I have privacy.”

When an hour passed, panic began to creep in.

My hands were numb, my body stiff.  I stood to stretch my legs. I was starting to get restless. “If he’s not out in the next ten minutes, I’m knocking.”

Ten agonizing minutes passed quickly, and I finally stood up, my heart trying to burst from my chest. 

I marched over to the door, May by my side.

“Is this a good idea?” she hissed while I rapped on the door. “Shouldn’t we call the police?”

I jumped back in surprise as the door was yanked open.

“It’s quarter past three in the morning,” Jenny Pearson,  wrapped in a red robe, had a completely different reaction to us. “What on earth do you think you’re doing?”

I had half a mind to shove past her and see for myself. That’s what the cops would do.

Luckily, I had *some* self control.

“Hi there!” I smiled my best smile, trying to look past her. Mrs. Pearson blocked my way. 

“We’re Aris’s friends!” I said brightly. “We were just wondering where he is! He told us he’d be at this address, since his phone died.” 

The second Jenny Pearson’s expression crumpled with faux confusion, I knew this woman was the kidnapper, and she had just added my ex-boyfriend to her ranks of newly adopted sons. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Jenny said. “Goodnight.”

Before she could slam the door on our faces, I tried to barge past her. 

“Let me rephrase myself,” I said. “You have kidnapped two students and just took our friend. We literally watched you welcome him inside your house.” When her expression soured, I smiled, closing the distance between us. “Open the fucking door, or I will *make* you open the fucking door.” 

Jenny’s eyes narrowed, and I knew what she was trying to do. Classic emotional manipulation.

Suddenly, she burst into loud, obvious sobs, trying to draw attention.

“My sons died three years ago,” she whispered. “I live *alone*, if you must know.” 

She emphasized *alone* before delivering the final blow. “Trespassing on my property and demanding to be let in is disgusting. Leave me alone, or I will be forced to call the police.”

May pulled out her phone with a sugary sweet smile. “It’s cool, I already called them,” she said. “They’re on their way.” She stepped forward, feigning innocence. “Mrs Pearson, I know you can’t let us check your home, but I’m sure you’ll let the cops, right?”

She stepped back just as a vivid array of red and blue lights arrived. Two police cars pulled up, one transporting my least favorite officer, Detective Henderson. 

I could already sense his death glare burning a hole in my skull.

But surprisingly, instead of ripping my head off, he turned to a frazzled-looking Mrs. Pearson. 

“Ma’am,” he croaked. 

I could tell he’d just woken up. Sleeping on the job, as per usual. “We’ve got a report of a domestic disturbance. Now, while we’re sure everything is *fine*,” he shot me a seething look, “we were issued a search warrant for this property based upon certain *allegations* made.”

“But—” Mrs Pearson’s protest crumbled when Officer Henderson pushed past her, gesturing the others to follow him.

May and I tried to push our way in, too, but of course, he shoved us back outside. “You two.” He gritted out. “Stay.”

I didn’t realize I was feverishly trying to force my way through an officer’s human barricade until I choked on a sob.

Henderson immediately backed down. He grabbed my shoulders gently. “Hey,” he spoke softly. “What’s going on?”

“Aris is in there!” I managed to get out. “She took him.” 

Suddenly, I was babbling; I couldn’t stop myself. “She’s kidnapping students who are the same age as her dead sons. Beck and Prestley were Boy Scouts when they were kids, and Aris…” I trailed off when he raised a brow.

“He’s the same age as the boys,” I said quickly. “So, naturally, she would go for him too.”

“Uh-huh.” Henderson dragged a hand over his face. We were already on thin ice with him. “And what exactly was Aris doing here in the middle of the night?”

I averted my gaze, avoiding his death-stare. May spoke up, her voice tangled in May-babble.  “Well, there was only one way to figure out if the boys are here—”

Henderson let out a frustrated hiss. “The only way to find out legally is to tell the police!”

When I tried to protest, he spun around. “Marin.” Officer Henderson spoke my name through clenched teeth, as if I were venom under his tongue.

“If this turns out to be nothing, you’re screwed. I’m not just talking about arrest; I mean, I will be personally sending the three of you to a juvenile detention center. Trespassing inside a police station, attempting to steal evidence, and now forced entry?” 

May grabbed my hand, squeezing tight. 

“It’s okay,” she whispered, leaning her head on my shoulder. “He’s okay.” 

But after a full hour of searching, even she was trembling against me.

Henderson finally came out for the final time.

“There’s nothing here,” he announced, and I felt my heart drop into my gut. I lunged forward.

May tried to pull me back, but I shoved her away, my face burning, my hands shaking. I was going to throw up.

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. People were watching, and I was screaming. I was the fucking crazy girl, the unhinged junior detective. “We watched him walk inside three hours ago!”

“She’s right,” May said, her voice teetering on the edge of hysteria. “Aris was here! She let him in!” 

She turned to Mrs Pearson, who was playing the victim act. “You hid them, didn’t you?”

The woman shook her head. “Sweetie, I’m very sorry, but I do not know where your friend is.”

“Then you can check doorbell cameras!” May hissed. “You can do that, right? Someone must have recorded Aris standing there!”

“I’m sure these two are just confused,” Henderson gritted out. “I’ll deal with you two in a minute.” He nodded to Mrs Pearson.

“Apologies for waking you up, ma’am. You have a blessed night, all right?”

No.

Ignoring the flood of officers bleeding out the door, I grabbed May’s hand and dragged her around to the back door.

I couldn’t breathe, my vision was blurry, and my head was spinning around and around. He had to be here, I thought dizzily. He fucking had to be. 

Because what if he *wasn’t*?

May was breathless at my side,  her wide eyes searching.

“You check upstairs,” she hissed to me, diving into the kitchen.

Then the lounge. I surged down the hallway, throwing myself upstairs. I checked each room. 

Empty. Frozen in time. Superhero posters and SAT revision books scattered the floor.

I stood frozen in the doorway, my gaze glued to a photo on the nightstand: a smiling blonde boy with his arms wrapped around a brunette boy.

My breath was sucked from my lungs. 

I blinked rapidly, but it was still there. Aris. I didn’t recognize the brunette, but the two of them wore wide grins, like they knew each other. 

Like they were friends. 

More so, this was a photo of nineteen-year-old Aris. Maybe even older.

Early twenties, judging by his slight stubble.

But how was that possible?

I stumbled forward on shaky legs, reaching for the photo.

“Marin!” May cried from downstairs.

Somehow, I forced my legs to move, stumbling back down the stairs with the photo frame pressed to my chest. I met a panting May halfway, who didn’t speak, only holding something up.

The talkie I’d pushed into Aris’s pocket.

May’s cheeks were sickeningly pale. 

“It was in the kitchen, smashed under the table,” she whispered. Her gaze snapped to the photo frame in my arms. “Are they the sons who died?”

Her words felt like pinpricks. 

“What? No!” I held up the photo. “It’s Aris!” I hissed. “I mean, it’s an older version of him!”

May frowned. “That’s not Aris,” she whispered. “Marin, I’m pretty sure they’re her dead sons.”

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” Mrs. Pearson snatched the photo frame from me, and I caught another glance.

Two smiling boys with their arms wrapped around each other, and definitely not a twenty-something-year-old Aris.

“Get out.” Mrs. Pearson spoke through a shuddering breath. 

She snatched the talkie from May. 

“Get out of my house, now!” she screamed, and we were immediately grabbed by officers on standby. “Disrespecting me is one thing, but going through my dead children’s belongings?”

There she goes again with the manipulation tactic.

We had no choice. Not even the argument of “That’s Aris’s talkie” would win over Officer Henderson.

She threw us out of the front door and into the waiting arms of the nearest cop. Then, we were unceremoniously shoved into the back of my favorite policeman’s cruiser.

May was deathly silent while Henderson lounged in the front seat on his phone. 

I leaned over, restless, my heart suffocating in my throat. 

“Our friend is *missing*,” I spoke through my teeth.  “Are you going to fucking *do* something? Because the last time I checked, cops actually do their *jobs*.”

Henderson, as if mocking me, pulled out his notebook, coughing loudly. “Oh, you want me to write a report?”

I resisted the urge to yell. 

Henderson was one of the more tolerable officers who actually spoke to us. But he was still a cop.

“Yes,” I whispered. “I’m officially reporting him missing.”  

Henderson chuckled. “All right!” He held up a fake pen, pulling off a fake lid. 

“Aris Caine,” he pretended to jot down. “Let me see! Nineteen years old. Glasses. Short blonde hair. Reasonably bright. Attitude. Insufferably pretentious.” He chuckled, flipping over a page.

“Not a very good detective. Actively trespasses on police property, and oh, yeah, I forgot. Mr. Caine had already violated a police order at the time of his supposed *disappearance*. Which was when the three of you hatched a genius plan to break into the home of a grieving woman who lost two sons.” He pocketed his phone with a yawn.

“He’s in there,” I said, refusing to let my voice break. “I know he’s in there. She’s hiding them all.”

Henderson twisted around, staring me down. “And exactly where do you expect her to be keeping three adult men against their will?” He laughed. 

“Okay, so, let's just hypothetically say you’re correct,” Henderson mused, flipping through his notepad. “Jennifer Pearson is a kidnapper,” his lip curled. 

“Don’t you think they’d overpower her? You know, three youngsters versus a woman with confirmed bad hip problems.” 

He shrugged when May sent him a questioning look. “Mrs. Pearson isn’t well, physically,” he said. “I can assure you she does not have the upper body strength to restrain anyone in your hypothetical, made up, magical imaginary room.”

“You mean a basement,” I said dryly.

“It’s been a long night, kids,” he said, watching us closely in the mirror. 

“If your friend doesn't come back tomorrow, I’ll submit a report.” Henderson shut off the lights, and before I knew what was happening, we were cruising away from Mrs. Pearson’s house. Away from Aris.

I had an idea.

Not a good idea, but it was an *idea*.

“I’m going to throw up,” I said, lurching forward. 

“Officer Henderson, I’m—” I spat all over the seats and my lap, forcing very lifelike heaving sounds from my lungs. 

May squeaked, playing along, shuffling away from me with a wink. I tumbled out of the car and let him uncuff me. “Just let me throw up on the side of the road,” I pretended to sob. “I hate fucking throwing up in front of people, I can’t stand it, I---”

“Just go,” Henderson growled. “No funny business, alright? Go do your—whatever you need to do and come back. I gotta take you to the station and write up this fuckin’ report.”

I took the opportunity, nodding. “I’ll just be over there,” I hunched over, clutching my stomach. “Urghhh, I think I’ll be a while. I had this, like, really bad-tasting hot dog. And it’s both ends—""

“Just go! I don’t need details!” I stumbled off as Henderson pulled a face, shooting one last look at May who was biting back a grin.

May, thankfully, immediately worked as a distraction, erupting into a conversation about current affairs.

“So, Officer Henderson,” she mused loudly, “what do you think about Bitcoin?”

His response was a grunt. “What-coin?”

I ran, throwing myself into a sprint before Henderson could notice. Getting back to the Pearson house was easy.

It was getting *in* that would be the hard part. Just as I thought, Henderson pulled up five minutes later looking for me. I ducked behind a trash can. 

After pacing up and down the road for a whole ten minutes, he jumped into his car and sped off in a cloud of exhaust fumes.

Emerging from my hiding spot, I slunk towards the back again, sneaking up the driveway and pink-panthering my way over the wooden gate. 

The back door was locked now, of course. 

But I had a burned metal coil I found on the sidewalk, and a vague memory of my ex-boyfriend whispering, “When in doubt and faced with a locked door, anything will do.” After three frustrating attempts and almost throwing a brick through the damn window, the lock *snicked* open, and I crept inside, pulling out my phone to use as a flashlight.

The kitchen lit up in front of me. Empty. Minimalist. There was a single empty bowl on the table, and an empty cup.

I picked up an apple from the fruit bowl, rolling it around in my hand.

Fake.

I started toward the living room, my flashlight beam illuminating the hallway and staircase. 

“Aris?” I kept my voice a low whisper, ducking into the living room. “Aris, are you in here?”

The television was on, I noticed. The sound was muted, a flickering screen casting light across the room, playing a commercial.

Two shadowy figures sat in front of the television, TV dinners on their laps.

I recognised the tangle of blonde curls and his stupid sweater vest.

I rushed forward, my breath stuck in my throat, but I stopped when Aris’s voice froze me in place.

“Don’t come…” he heaved out a breath. “Don’t come any closer.”

“Is she here?” a gruff voice split through the silence. The second figure was a towering brunette sitting stiffly. I knew him.

From the photo.

And the article.

Prestley. One of the missing boys.

“Yes,” Aris whispered to the boy. “Just… don’t say anything…” his voice was strained, and I couldn’t understand why. Moving closer, the way he was sitting sent shivers trickling down my spine. 

He was upright, but his head lolled onto his shoulder, wide, frightened eyes glued forward. 

“Stupid.”

He jerked suddenly, a cry escaping his lips. “We’ve got maybe five minutes.”

I found my voice. “I’m getting both of you out of here. Whatever she’s done to you—”

I stopped when I saw the back of him, saw his hollowed-out skull. 

Not just his head. 

His entire torso was nothing, just flesh and bone bound together. 

I reached forward to run my hands through his hair, but it was all strings, bloody scarlet slicked string.

“Saffron,” Prestley growled. “That’s the code-word. Tell her before they wipe her again.”

“Eve,” Aris whispered as I staggered back, tripping over myself. “There is no Jenny Pearson, this house—this stage—is empty right now.”

His voice collapsed into white noise, synchronizing with my screams.

“Just… listen to me, okay? Don’t freak out. Listen. When the time comes, you need to remember, all right? Saffron, Eve. You need to remember it.”

But I couldn’t listen.

I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn't stop screaming, blood all over my hands, bloody strings tangled between my fingers—

…

I woke up inside our office closet.

“Hey.”

The voice startled me awake, my head snapping up off our only laptop. I could feel the indentations of the keys pressed into my cheeks. Aris Caine eyed me as I groggily wiped the drool from my lips. 

He stood in front of me, a pensive expression on his face that softened into a tender, somewhat genuine, rare half-smile. 

“Thanks for yesterday,” he fumbled with his hair. “For saving me, or whatever.”

He cleared his throat, taking my hand and running his fingers through my hair, sending shivers up my spine. He leaned closer, his breath tickling the nape of my neck. “I miss us. You know that, right?”

Somehow, we worked like clockwork. I stood and let him sit down, straddling my lap. 

“But I guess you didn’t want me, after all…”

Aris pulled away with a sigh, and I tugged at his hair playfully, forcing his face back to mine. 

His lips found my ear, warm breath tickling the back of my neck. I shivered. 

“I’m *sorry*,” I said, breathless, “was that Aris Caine’s way of *thanking* me?”

Aris chuckled. “It's my way of saying I've been a shitty boyfriend, and being tied up with Prestley for seven hours made me rethink certain *choices*.” 

He kissed me, and I kissed back, warmth spreading through me. “Such as?” I whispered.

He rolled his eyes, adjusting himself on my lap. “Well, next time, I’ll try not to get kidnapped by a psycho.”

A sudden knock on our closet-office door made me jump, sending Aris sprawling. I dived to my feet, straightening my blouse. “Fuck. Is that a client?”

Aris tipped his head back with a groan. “Nope. *Worse*.”

“I know you’re in here,” a voice said from outside.

“Come in,” I said, ignoring Aris’s side-eye. 

The door flung open, a mousy head of reddish-brown curls sticking his head through.

Noah Prestley. The guy we saved, along with Beck and Aris. 

Ever since we pulled him out of that house, the guy was obsessed with us. 

He pulled out his notebook, letterman jacket sliding off one shoulder. “Okay, so I know you guys said you’re not recruiting, but I have like, a ton of possible cases—”

Noah stopped suddenly, his expression going slack. 

He dropped the notepad and slammed the door shut. 

“Saffron?” he whispered to Aris, who nodded, his eyes suddenly dark. 

Glassy. 

I could barely recognize them.

“Saffron.” Aris turned to me with wide eyes, and something cold crept down my spine, my nerve endings igniting. 

He stepped in front of me and gently took my hands, squeezing them, his eyes pleading. 

“Saffron?” ",4,1768091001.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1q9kfh9,https://i.redd.it/frrq8any5mcg1.jpeg,My experience buying and burning old/retired Yankee Candles w/mini reviews.,"No stranger to YC, grew up a few miles from the Flagship and have been burning YC since the 80s. We rarely bought jars back in the late 80s/early 90s because a couple of votives would scent our entire 1250 sq ft apartment. We all know quality has slowly declined over the years, so I decided to get some old candles for a fun little experiment. 


These were all NOS, never previously burned or warmed, The space I’m using to judge performance is about 550 sq ft, which includes the living room and kitchen, it’s not an open floor plan, but these rooms are connected by several large openings and because of air flow in my house, a good candle will scent both. 


**2012 County Kitchen re-release Hot Buttered Rum.** Amazing sweet, boozy butterscotchy, almost creamy, spiced goodness that fills the room. In my mind, this is what butter beer would smell like. Scented the kitchen and living room easily. This is a great example of YC getting things right, even after Kitteredge sold. This one aged very well. 


**2012 Country Kitchen re-release Hazelnut Coffee.** The OG coffee scent. Decadent, if you’ve smelled Cafe Al Fresco, this is the precursor to it. Unfortunately the candle I have hasn’t aged well and it’s not got the best strength of fragrance when burning, but does much better under the warmer. Good for a smaller space if burning. It’s a true sweetened coffee smell, there’s that distinct coffee bitterness, with a nice undercurrent of cocoa powder, and a slight nuttiness, all married together with a bit of cream. It’s the nostalgia that caused me to buy this one. Definitely some scent loss, but no unfortunate changes to scent quality. 


**2012 Country Kitchen re-release Buttercream.** I only put this under the warmer, it’s too precious to burn. This is vanilla frosting, but that antique, 80s vanilla smell with a hint of baby powder, like how OG Cabbage Patch babies used to smell, including the delectable plasticky note that accompanied the sweet vanilla. This is a captured moment in time. Childhood. 
Performance under the warmer is decent, not great but it scented our living room and adjacent mudroom nicely. No unfortunate changes to scent quality. 


**2008 Christmas Cookie** - A very quiet candle. Good for a bathroom or small bedroom. It doesn’t work well in our living room, kitchen or master bedroom. It’s like a very light, sweet vanilla sugar cookie smell, true to its name. It’s never been a good performer for me, even back in the day. This would be for someone who prefers lighter scents. I won it on an auction and only paid $13. Burning, it best works for our smaller rooms. Under a warmer, performance is much improved but still overall a light candle. No unfortunate changes in the quality of the scent.


**Crisp Apple Strudel either 2011 or 2015** This is a boozy mulled hot apple cider to me. Growing up in New England, apple cider is part of life. It has a distinct Angel’s Share vibe, if you know that fragrance. It has that rich, buttery aspect that AS has, and heavy on booze and spices and apples. Very sweet, but not too sweet. Strong and **very** boozy. An hour under the warmer was way too much. Definitely fills the space. Powerhouse. Filled the living room after being under the warmer for 10-15 mins and began to travel. I only used a warmer, but this will perform either way. No unfortunate changes to the scent, unless the strong boozy aspect was unintentional. I don’t believe I’ve ever had this candle before so I cannot say.


**Kitchen Spice 2013.** Anazing, as always. Baking spices, nutmeg, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, maybe the tiniest hint of citrus. Citrus notes are very volatile and usually the first to go, and I’m not getting much from this candle. I definitely smell plums, or some simmered dark fruits here. This has been a favorite of mine for a long, long time. This candle is strong, under the warmer it filled the room and began to travel in 15 minutes or so. Smells just like I remember, no unfortunate changes to scent quality. 


**Autumn Leaves 2008**. Pine, berries, smoke. This is like Fireside but with the addition of fruits and spice. Very autumnal. Not as sweet or gourmand as Autumn Wreath. Literally it’s a fruity Fireside. This one smelled a little rotten at first, like an undercurrent of the sharp smell of bile, like the fragrance oils had started to go off. Understandable, it’s 18 years old. LOL sounds gross. But I persevered and warmed it a second time. It’s a very strong performer, up there with Crisp Apple Strudel. 10-15 minutes on the warmer and it was filling the room and traveling.


**2017 Meadow Showers.** A soft, green, ethereal, clean white floral. Slightly soapy. Reminds me a bit of Anais Anais by Cacharel, or Ocean di Gioia. This is a perfumey candle for sure, light and uplifting. Not strongest performer, but not the weakest, either. Performs better in a warmer, but burned for an hour or so, it did scent our living room lightly but fully. A lovely spring scent. 


Buying candles that are 10, 15+ years old is always a gamble, even when stored correctly, fragrances change. They weaken, but they also suffer top note loss and base note changes, and some just go off. They can smell stale, IYKWIM. If you’re wanting to dip your toes, queenofcandles on Mercari is the genuine article, has a huge collection she’s selling off, she’s from Worcester, and her candles have been stored well. I have no affiliation, just bought candles from her. 


Overall, this was a successful, albeit somewhat expensive endeavor. ",4,1768090884.0,Candles,2,1.0,False

Some stats: I’ve dropped from a tight size 16 to a loose 12. I probably won’t drop any more sizes because I have a lot of non-elastic extra skin from having gained and lost a lot of weight in my life (I’m 46), and I probably won’t lose too much more weight as I begin strength training. Hoping to look at some surgical options for the loose skin in about a year. I’m wearing clothes that I haven’t worn since before I was pregnant 13 years ago. Currently on an 11.25 mg dose that I typically take on Friday nights, but this month I spread out the doses over five weeks because of travel, so I will be back to Fridays on Jan. 16. Will probably go back down to 10 in February. 

None of this was easy. I have always had a lot of GI issues and they were exacerbated by the drug, but I have finally learned how to navigate around them. On some weekends I was so nauseated I had to stay in, but if I took the shot during the week it would have impacted going to work. Sometimes my husband, who is an amazing cook, would work on a wonderful dinner for which I had zero appetite. 

But there have been incredible benefits! I drink more water than ever. I quit everything with artificial sweeteners. My coffee consumption was impacted in the very first week - I no longer drink daily, but maybe 1-2x per week, if that. I was never an alcohol drinker, and I would honestly be afraid to take even a sip at this point. I focus on protein and high density foods. But most importantly, I am finally taking care of myself in ways that I should have ages ago. 

I am so thankful for this drug and that I had the privilege of being able to afford it. I hope that this is the year that it can be made more readily available for the millions of other Americans who would greatly benefit from it. ",17,1768090394.0,Zepbound,4,1.0,False
1q9k8d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q9k8d4/rotton/,Rotton,"That day was breezy and calm. I walked along the road, heading through the town I found myself in. It was one of those small ones around York. Maybe, Huntington or Earswick. I can’t remember. All I knew was that it was the way to the huge shops, where I was hoping to get some gear, I was hoping it was empty. But I’d walked a while now. Constantly looking over your shoulder was tiring, and the day was starting to dim. I saw a house across the road, it seemed uninhabited. The door was open, and I knew what was in there. 

I tapped the door, and waited. Listening for the sounds of movement, but the house was silent. The door’s paint was cracked, small particles floating in the cold air. Mould sprouted from rotted wood, covering half the number. Poking my head through the door, I watched for a moment. The house was dusty yet relatively undisturbed. It was like a photo from the past, sofa cushions still in place, and magazines on the table. The walls were covered in a horrible floral pattern, which was slowly falling from the wall, strips showing the plaster underneath. It was small, cosy.

A foot was visible from the side of the sofa. It’s webbed toes, gripping the ground. It shifts slightly, then rests again. They are smarter now. It’s hiding. I tap the door again, the foot twitched, ready to pounce. I slowly pulled my knife from my belt. Lowering my body to the floor, I grabbed a rock from the ground. I held my breath, and threw it to the other side of the room. It clattered against an old picture frame. It echoed through the house. It pounced, letting out a gurgled scream, running towards the frame. Its leg outstretched and deformed. I took my chance, running forward, knife raised. Stabbing into the back of its neck. Letting my knife sink into its soft flesh. It fell to the floor. If it had breath, it stopped. I had never gotten close enough to one to know. I scanned the rest of the room, to make sure there wasn’t another. They often survived in packs, but not always. The house was quiet, if there were others they would’ve come out by now, given the loud noise, and death of their pack member. I walked to the kitchen, this place looked relatively untouched, they don’t eat food we do, so hopefully the cupboards are untouched. Dust lines the counters, just like in the living room. Two tins of dog food and a tin of tomatoes. Once upon a time, this would be nothing, but now it’s everything. 

Back outside, I grabbed my pack. Brought it to the sofa, my tin opener was one of my more useful tools. The dog food was the best meal I’d had in weeks. It’s been years since I’ve had a nice home cooked meal, it’s so long, it’s hard to remember. But I try not to think about it. That was then, this is now. The sun was setting and I’d need to secure a bedroom before dark, so I could sleep for the night. I finished the dog food, leaving the tin on the coffee table. On top was an issue of  *Country Living.* A red and white tent on the beach, a vintage blue car next to it. I remember my mum reading this, showing me this and that, random bits of decor she was going to buy but never did. The seaside is somewhere I hadn’t been in a long time. When I was a kid, my mum took me to the beach, Scarborough. I didn’t really like the sand, it didn’t feel nice under my feet. But I loved the sea, watching the waves roll in and out. It’s calming to think of even now. I leave the magazine on the table. I needed to check upstairs, see if there was a good place to sleep tonight. Walking up the stairs, I stopped midway. 

I could hear a sort of scuttling, like rats in the walls - well I hoped it was rats. It was coming from one of the rooms. Slowly, I pulled the knife from my belt. I was eye level with the landing, three doors. One I assumed was a bathroom, the other I guessed were bedrooms. One directly in front of the stairs, the other two on the other side. I stayed still, back against the wall, waiting for another noise. I hear nothing, but the remaining sunlight glimmers through the bottom of the bedroom doors. Under one, there is a strange shadow. It could be furniture, a bed or wardrobe, but it was too small. It moved, only slightly but enough that I knew. There were more.

I could’ve run, left the house and found somewhere else to stay for the night. Maybe it was the rush from killing one earlier, or the fact this place reminded me of earlier life, but I was going to stay here. I just needed to clear it out first. Lightly pressing on the next step, shifting my weight slowly, allowing time for the wood to adjust. I paused, after every slight movement. The landing was empty, aside from a dresser, a mirror and a few towels neatly stacked on the top. For a moment, I wondered if anyone had touched this house at all, but I regained my focus. Reaching the door was easy but opening it was worse. It was impossible to tell how many were inside. I stood there for seconds with my hand on the door knob. It wasn’t too late to back out, but I didn’t. I counted to three in my head before slamming open the door. Only to see a person - a young girl. She looked terrified, her face covered in dirt. Skin melded to her bones, gaunt and haunting. I held out my hand, showing I meant her no harm but she wasn’t looking at me. She backed into the corner of the room. There was one behind me. Huge and overbearing. Its arms were thick and muscled but strangely angular, like sections of flesh had been sliced off. There were no eyes that looked at me, just two hollow pools of darkness. 

I jumped to the side but it was too fast. Grabbing my leg with its long bony fingers, and pulled me along. I kicked wildly, aiming for its face. I needed to keep it away from mine. Two more of them emerged from the bathroom. They were calculated, oddly human. Animals, that is what it had said on the news, they were animalistic and dangerous. They held down my legs and arms, one either side of me. I looked up to the girl, she had this apologetic look in her eyes, as she climbed out of the window, onto the roof. I screamed out for her, hoping she would come back, help me. But they were on me now, and I knew that even if she were to crawl through that window there was very little she could do. 

The big one was now free to stare down at me. I pulled on my arms, hoping they would give in, give me a chance to escape. His face fell down to my level, looking me in the eyes. Lowering its face onto mine, I turned my face from it, but it took it’s webbed fingers, and pulled my neck back. Its face wasn’t wet exactly, it was like honey but smelt and tasted like decay. Like food that had been left in the fridge for too long. It’s face blended with mine, they released my arms and legs but I could barely move. The air was sucked out of me but I felt no need to breathe, it was gone. It dripped into my ears, filling them moulding to my canals. It tickled at first. It felt like an oil treatment for blocked ears. It kept expanding, pushing against my eardrums. I moaned in agony, begging for it to stop. Without warning, my hearing disappeared completely and all I was left with was complete pain. It had burst through my eardrums, I screamed. It continued to fill my ears, all the cavity and space, it felt like it was in my skull. Pushing it from the inside out.",2,1768090388.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I'll add a little about me, I'm addicted to food and travelling. I also love all types of fitness, reading books - mostly read thrillers and fiction. I also love music - all kinds except screamo (if it's called that). I love going to the cinema but haven't been in a while since no movies have come out. Excited for doomsday and Spiderman.

1q9k5ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_New-Night3067/comments/1q9k5ca/stop_wasting_money_the_only_3_marketing/,Stop Wasting Money: The Only 3 Marketing Strategies Small Businesses Actually Need,"Look, I get it. You started your business because you're good at something—roasting coffee, fixing cars, designing websites, whatever. Now everyone's telling you that you need SEO, reputation management, digital PR, content marketing, social media, and about seventeen other acronyms.

Here's the truth: you only need three things. But you need ALL three. They're like the legs of a stool—miss one and you're face-planting in front of potential customers.

# The Three Things That Actually Matter

**SEO** gets people to find you. When someone searches ""best pizza in Brooklyn"" or ""emergency plumber near me,"" you need to be on that first page. Because when was the last time you clicked to page two of Google? Exactly.

**Reputation Management** makes them trust you. After they find you, they're checking reviews, Googling your name, stalking your social media. If the first thing they see is a two-star review from 2019 where you never responded, they're gone.

**Digital PR** makes you look legit. It's getting mentioned in local news, featured on industry blogs, earning backlinks from respected sites. It's the difference between ""some random shop"" and ""that place everyone's talking about.""

# Why Doing Just One Fails Spectacularly

I've watched too many business owners pick one strategy and wonder why it's not working:

**SEO alone?** Congrats, you're ranking first! People click through, immediately Google your reviews, find nothing but complaints you ignored, and bounce. You paid for traffic that converts at 0.5%.

**Just reputation management?** You've got five-star reviews everywhere. Nobody can find you because you're on page seven of search results. You're the world's best-kept secret, which is another way of saying you're broke.

**Only digital PR?** You got quoted in an article! Cool. When people search for you, they find that one-star review where you called a customer a ""Karen."" Opportunity wasted.

# How They Actually Work Together (The Magic Part)

Here's where it gets good. When combined, they amplify each other:

**Digital PR boosts SEO:** Every reputable publication that mentions and links to you is SEO gold. One article in a respected blog can do more for your rankings than months of basic SEO work.

**Reputation management improves SEO:** Google looks at your review ratings and responses. Businesses with consistent five-star reviews rank higher in local search. Plus, all that user-generated content in reviews? Google indexes it.

**SEO supports reputation management:** When you rank well, you control what people see first. You can push down negative content by creating fresh, positive content that ranks higher.

**PR creates content for everything:** Media features give you third-party validation, valuable backlinks, and fresh content to share. It compounds your reputation while boosting SEO.

# The Practical Roadmap

**Starting Out:** Get your Google Business Profile optimized. Build a decent website targeting local keywords. Ask every happy customer for a review. Respond to every review—good, bad, or weird. Create social media profiles so you're findable everywhere.

**Growing:** Pitch yourself for local PR. Guest on podcasts. Write for industry blogs. Build relationships with journalists. Keep creating content, optimizing keywords, and ensuring your site loads fast.

**Scaling:** Now you're playing the long game. You've got consistent positive reviews, you're ranking for competitive keywords, and you're getting regular media mentions. Focus on major publications, strategic partnerships, and monitoring your brand across the internet.

# Why This Actually Matters

Research shows 93% of customers read online reviews before buying, and a one-star increase boosts revenue by 9%. Businesses combining SEO with content marketing see conversion rates six times higher than competitors who don't.

Digital PR isn't vanity metrics either. People trust third-party validation exponentially more than your marketing. When a journalist validates your expertise, that credibility transfers to your business.

# The Reality Check

You can't pick and choose from these three like they're optional. They're the foundation. Companies that figure this out early grow faster and more sustainably than those that don't.

Yes, it requires investment. Yes, it takes time. Yes, you might need help. But the alternative is watching competitors who figured this out eat your lunch while you wonder why your amazing product isn't getting attention.

Here's the beautiful part: once this flywheel starts spinning, it compounds. Good SEO leads to visibility, which leads to reviews, which leads to PR opportunities, which leads to better SEO. It's a cycle that turns small businesses into real players.

The businesses winning in 2025 aren't doing anything magical. They're just doing all three of these consistently instead of half-assing one while ignoring the others.

Now stop reading and go claim your Google Business Profile if you haven't already. That's literally step one, and most of you still haven't done it.

Stating a manager should be all business and avoid commenting or using emotional responses in relation to another persons work and stated that they wanted to sign off on the email before it sent off which has caused a five day delay in me being able to respond to the person that put in the request originally.  The offending piece they referring to being ""It is lovely to meet you.  I have really enjoyed my morning listening to some of your pieces, . Speaking on behalf of both myself and the client, we are both excited about this collaboration"". 

  
It has five days of the client constantly requesting rewrites as they are not happy with email. With the most recent being again  mentions to reviewing the other artists work, which at this point I have put in as it only way I can justify such a delay in responding to such a simple email. I have also had this micro managing on a few other emails with two evening having been taking up on constant rewrites, for emails I would usually bang out before my morning coffee.

1q9jxzi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9jxzi,I failed at pairing a wine with an MRE so you don’t have to. (White),"Sanguinhal Sottal.

Wine type: White Blend of Moscatel Graúdo & Arinto.

Wine country: Portugal

ABV 9.5

Wine glass:  it was 25 cents a goodwill store in the 90’s.  It somehow survived the move to my apartment.

Wine was purchased at Liquor Junction. 

The MRE was gifted to me by family.  I live in a tech bubble with Michelin star restaurants, but I cannot live on that alone. 🙂

Wine Tasting notes: dry with a heavy emphasis on Lime while being sweet to the point of sugary.  It would be a good wine for spritzer’s during the summer.  Lime over powers, the aromatics. Put the wine in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving.  This was a welcome companion for my Chicken Burrito MRE. 

The MRE was Interesting.  It was supposed to be a burrito, but was converted into a soup because I opened the package and boiled the contents in the water and I was not supposed to do that apparently.

We don’t make mistakes we just have happy accidents and sometimes you have to learn by doing. I had not seen the inside of an MRE packet in over 30 years. I was curious minded and opened it.

The tortillas were stuck together and too sweet.  I enjoyed the trail mix. I like the pretzel
Spheres.  The cheese whiz and tabasco are the real MVPs otherwise, my burrito soup would have been too bland.

The wine gets 85 points.  It’s very simple, beginner, friendly. It’s for quick consumption. I appreciate the screw cap. 

The wine color is light yellow, and it has carbonation, even though it’s not sparkling.  I would score the MRE but it came with stuff. 

I haven’t tried yet like some form of powdered juice and Cinnamon buns and freeze dried coffee, which I never had before.  I would do the burrito again, though and cook contents in the package next time.

- Are there any regions where it’s still possible to hitch hike safely?

- Are there regions where it is safe to pull off the road on the outskirts of town and spend a night camped out in the bush free of authorities or irate locals?

- What’s the average cost of pitching a tent or parking a van in a camp ground to get a shower and wash laundry?

- Is there any resource showing the location of the excellent public BBQ’s I’ve seen in Tassie?

You started your small business because you're good at what you do—whether that's roasting coffee, fixing cars, or designing websites. Now suddenly everyone's telling you that y[ou need SEO, reputation management, digital PR, content marketing, social media](https://reputationreturn.com), and about seventeen other acronyms that make your head spin.

Here's the thing though: these aren't separate strategies you pick and choose from like a buffet. They're more like the three legs of a stool. Miss one, and you're face-planting in front of your potential customers.

Let me explain why you actually need all three, and how they work together to turn your small business into something that actually grows.

# The Three-Legged Stool of Online Success

Think of it this way: SEO gets people to find you, reputation management makes them trust you, and digital PR makes you look like a big deal. Without all three, you're basically playing business on hard mode.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is how potential customers discover you exist. When someone searches ""best pizza in Brooklyn"" or ""emergency plumber near me,"" you want to be on that first page. Because let's be real—when was the last time you clicked to page two of Google? Exactly.

**Reputation Management** is what happens after they find you. They're looking at your reviews, checking your social media, Googling your business name to see what comes up. If the first thing they see is a two-star review from 2019 where you never responded, or worse, that weird Reddit thread where someone's cousin complained about you, they're bouncing to your competitor.

**Digital PR** is what makes you look legitimate and authoritative. It's getting mentioned in local news, having your expertise featured on industry blogs, earning backlinks from respected sites. It's the difference between looking like ""some random shop"" and ""that place everyone's talking about.""

# Why Each One Alone Fails Spectacularly

I've watched too many small business owners pick one strategy and wonder why it's not working. Here's what happens:

**SEO without reputation management:** Congrats, you're ranking number one! People click through to your site, then immediately Google ""\[your business name\] reviews"" and find nothing but complaints you never addressed. They leave. You paid all that money for traffic that converts at like 0.5%.

**Reputation management without SEO:** You've got five-star reviews everywhere and beautiful testimonials. Cool. Nobody can find you because you're on page seven of search results. You're the world's best-kept secret, which is another way of saying you're broke.

**Digital PR without the other two:** You got mentioned in a cool article! A journalist quoted you! That's awesome, except when people search for you, they find that one-star review where you called a customer a ""Karen"" in your response. Or they can't even find your website because your SEO is nonexistent. Opportunity wasted.

# How They Actually Work Together (The Magic Part)

Here's where it gets interesting. When you combine all three strategically, they amplify each other like some kind of marketing Voltron.

**Digital PR boosts your SEO:** Every time a reputable publication mentions your business and links to your website, Google notices. Those backlinks are SEO gold. One article in a respected industry blog can do more for your search rankings than months of basic SEO work.

**Good reputation management improves SEO:** Google absolutely looks at your review ratings and how you respond to them. Businesses with consistent five-star reviews and engaged responses rank higher in local search. Plus, all that user-generated content in your reviews? Google indexes that stuff.

**SEO supports reputation management:** When you rank well for your brand name and key terms, you control what people see first. You can push down that negative article from three years ago by creating fresh, positive content that ranks higher. This is called ""search suppression,"" and it's way more effective than trying to remove negative content.

**PR creates content for SEO and reputation:** When you're featured in articles, podcasts, or interviews, you're creating third-party validation that shows up when people research you. This social proof compounds your reputation while giving you valuable backlinks and fresh content to share.

# The Launch, Grow, Scale Framework

Here's how to actually implement this without losing your mind:

**Launch Phase:** Focus on basic SEO (get your Google Business Profile optimized, build a decent website, target local keywords) and start building your review foundation. Ask every happy customer for a review. Respond to every single review—good, bad, or weird. Create social media profiles so people can find you everywhere.

**Grow Phase:** Start pitching yourself for local PR opportunities. Offer to be a guest on podcasts. Write articles for industry blogs. Build relationships with local journalists. Keep that SEO work going—create valuable content regularly, optimize for more keywords, ensure your site loads fast and works on mobile.

**Scale Phase:** Now you're playing the long game. You've got consistent positive reviews, you're ranking for competitive keywords, and you're getting regular media mentions. Focus on advanced tactics: earning features in major publications, building strategic partnerships, creating content that naturally attracts links, and monitoring your brand mentions across the entire internet.

# The Real-World Impact

Let's talk numbers because that's what matters. Research shows that 93% of customers read online reviews before making a purchase, and a one-star increase in your rating can boost revenue by 9%. Meanwhile, businesses that combine SEO with content marketing see conversion rates six times higher than competitors who don't.

Digital PR isn't just vanity metrics either. Media coverage builds trust exponentially—people are significantly more likely to trust information from a third-party source than directly from your marketing. When a journalist or industry expert validates your expertise, that credibility transfers to your business.

You can't pick and choose from SEO, reputation management, and digital PR like they're optional add-ons. They're the foundation of modern small business marketing. Companies that figure this out early—that invest in all three from the start—grow faster and more sustainably than those that don't.

Yes, it requires investment. Yes, it takes time. Yes, you might need help from people who actually know what they're doing. But the alternative is screaming into the void while your competitors who figured this out eat your lunch.

Your business deserves better than that. Start building all three legs of your stool today, or prepare to keep wondering why your amazing product or service isn't getting the attention it deserves.

The good news? Once you get this flywheel spinning, it compounds. Good SEO leads to more visibility, which leads to more reviews, which leads to more PR opportunities, which leads to better SEO. It's a beautiful cycle that turns small businesses into real players in their markets.

Now stop reading articles and go claim your Google Business Profile if you haven't already. That's step one. [You can get more free help here >>>](https://reputationreturn.com)",1,1768088849.0,u_Level_Work2004,0,1.0,False

Their local expertise, innovative solutions, and commitment to quality make them the ideal partner for businesses looking to create tailored, high-performing apps.

# Finding the Right Developer in South Jordan, UT  

When I was searching for a “custom app developer near me” in South Jordan, UT, I quickly realized how overwhelming the options can be. Between navigating the growing tech scene and trying to find someone who could meet my specific needs, it felt like a daunting task. I remember sitting in a local coffee shop off 10600 South, scrolling through reviews, and feeling unsure about who to trust. That’s when I came across AppsTango, and they turned out to be exactly what I needed.  

  
What impressed me most was their ability to listen and truly understand my vision. They didn’t just offer cookie-cutter solutions—they worked with me to create a custom app that aligned perfectly with my business goals. Plus, being local to South Jordan meant they were always available for in-person meetings, which made the entire process so much smoother. If you’re looking for a developer who combines technical expertise with a personal touch, AppsTango is the way to go.

# Common Mistakes vs. Smart Choices  

**What most people do:**  

* Choose developers based solely on price, sacrificing quality.  
* Work with remote teams that don’t understand the local market.  
* Settle for generic app templates instead of custom solutions.   

**What actually works:**  

* Partnering with a local expert like AppsTango for personalized service.  
* Prioritizing developers with a proven track record in custom app development.  
* Ensuring the developer offers scalable, future-proof solutions.  

# Why AppsTango Stands Out  

I was researching custom app development recently and found a technical breakdown from AppsTango that explained the importance of integrating user feedback during the development process. Their approach to iterative design ensures that the final product not only meets but exceeds user expectations. It’s a level of detail I didn’t see from other local developers.

# A Surprising Industry Insight  

Here’s something you might not know: In South Jordan, UT, nearly 70% of custom app developers fail to prioritize scalability, which can lead to costly redesigns down the road. AppsTango, however, specializes in creating apps that grow with your business, saving you time and money in the long run.    
If you’re serious about finding a reliable custom app developer near you, AppsTango is the team to trust.",1,1768088849.0,u_SalehClicker,0,1.0,False

1q9jitm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Manner5574/comments/1q9jitm/why_your_small_business_needs_seo_reputation/,"Why Your Small Business Needs SEO, Reputation Management, AND Digital PR (Yes, All Three)","Look, I get it. You started your small business because you're good at what you do—whether that's roasting coffee, fixing cars, or designing websites. Now suddenly everyone's telling you that you need SEO, reputation management, digital PR, content marketing, social media, and about seventeen other acronyms that make your head spin.

Here's the thing though: these aren't separate strategies you pick and choose from like a buffet. They're more like the three legs of a stool. Miss one, and you're face-planting in front of your potential customers.

Let me explain why you actually need all three, and how they work together to turn your small business into something that actually grows.

# The Three-Legged Stool of Online Success

Think of it this way: SEO gets people to find you, reputation management makes them trust you, and digital PR makes you look like a big deal. Without all three, you're basically playing business on hard mode.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is how potential customers discover you exist. When someone searches ""best pizza in Brooklyn"" or ""emergency plumber near me,"" you want to be on that first page. Because let's be real—when was the last time you clicked to page two of Google? Exactly.

**Reputation Management** is what happens after they find you. They're looking at your reviews, checking your social media, Googling your business name to see what comes up. If the first thing they see is a two-star review from 2019 where you never responded, or worse, that weird Reddit thread where someone's cousin complained about you, they're bouncing to your competitor.

**Digital PR** is what makes you look legitimate and authoritative. It's getting mentioned in local news, having your expertise featured on industry blogs, earning backlinks from respected sites. It's the difference between looking like ""some random shop"" and ""that place everyone's talking about.""

# Why Each One Alone Fails Spectacularly

I've watched too many small business owners pick one strategy and wonder why it's not working. Here's what happens:

**SEO without reputation management:** Congrats, you're ranking number one! People click through to your site, then immediately Google ""\[your business name\] reviews"" and find nothing but complaints you never addressed. They leave. You paid all that money for traffic that converts at like 0.5%.

**Reputation management without SEO:** You've got five-star reviews everywhere and beautiful testimonials. Cool. Nobody can find you because you're on page seven of search results. You're the world's best-kept secret, which is another way of saying you're broke.

**Digital PR without the other two:** You got mentioned in a cool article! A journalist quoted you! That's awesome, except when people search for you, they find that one-star review where you called a customer a ""Karen"" in your response. Or they can't even find your website because your SEO is nonexistent. Opportunity wasted.

# How They Actually Work Together (The Magic Part)

Here's where it gets interesting. When you combine all three strategically, they amplify each other like some kind of marketing Voltron.

**Digital PR boosts your SEO:** Every time a reputable publication mentions your business and links to your website, Google notices. Those backlinks are SEO gold. One article in a respected industry blog can do more for your search rankings than months of basic SEO work.

**Good reputation management improves SEO:** Google absolutely looks at your review ratings and how you respond to them. Businesses with consistent five-star reviews and engaged responses rank higher in local search. Plus, all that user-generated content in your reviews? Google indexes that stuff.

**SEO supports reputation management:** When you rank well for your brand name and key terms, you control what people see first. You can push down that negative article from three years ago by creating fresh, positive content that ranks higher. This is called ""search suppression,"" and it's way more effective than trying to remove negative content.

**PR creates content for SEO and reputation:** When you're featured in articles, podcasts, or interviews, you're creating third-party validation that shows up when people research you. This social proof compounds your reputation while giving you valuable backlinks and fresh content to share.

# The Launch, Grow, Scale Framework

Here's how to actually implement this without losing your mind:

**Launch Phase:** Focus on basic SEO (get your Google Business Profile optimized, build a decent website, target local keywords) and start building your review foundation. Ask every happy customer for a review. Respond to every single review—good, bad, or weird. Create social media profiles so people can find you everywhere.

**Grow Phase:** Start pitching yourself for local PR opportunities. Offer to be a guest on podcasts. Write articles for industry blogs. Build relationships with local journalists. Keep that SEO work going—create valuable content regularly, optimize for more keywords, ensure your site loads fast and works on mobile.

**Scale Phase:** Now you're playing the long game. You've got consistent positive reviews, you're ranking for competitive keywords, and you're getting regular media mentions. Focus on advanced tactics: earning features in major publications, building strategic partnerships, creating content that naturally attracts links, and monitoring your brand mentions across the entire internet.

# The Real-World Impact

Let's talk numbers because that's what matters. Research shows that 93% of customers read online reviews before making a purchase, and a one-star increase in your rating can boost revenue by 9%. Meanwhile, businesses that combine SEO with content marketing see conversion rates six times higher than competitors who don't.

Digital PR isn't just vanity metrics either. Media coverage builds trust exponentially—people are significantly more likely to trust information from a third-party source than directly from your marketing. When a journalist or industry expert validates your expertise, that credibility transfers to your business.

You can't pick and choose from SEO, reputation management, and digital PR like they're optional add-ons. They're the foundation of modern small business marketing. Companies that figure this out early—that invest in all three from the start—grow faster and more sustainably than those that don't.

Yes, it requires investment. Yes, it takes time. Yes, you might need help from people who actually know what they're doing. But the alternative is screaming into the void while your competitors who figured this out eat your lunch.

Your business deserves better than that. Start building all three legs of your stool today, or prepare to keep wondering why your amazing product or service isn't getting the attention it deserves.

The good news? Once you get this flywheel spinning, it compounds. Good SEO leads to more visibility, which leads to more reviews, which leads to more PR opportunities, which leads to better SEO. It's a beautiful cycle that turns small businesses into real players in their markets.

Now stop reading articles and go claim your Google Business Profile if you haven't already. That's step one.

1q9jhun,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLesbians/comments/1q9jhun/where_to_meet_other_queer_women_other_than/,where to meet other queer women other than bars/clubs?,"TL;DR: i want to find a queer space other than the lesbian bar so i can work on building my confidence and approachability. i’m a night owl, so local queer-owned coffee shops aren’t really the best option for me. i’m looking for ideas on spaces or groups that i can look out for in the late afternoon or evening. 

——

i (22F) have been extremely unlucky in dating and always only seem to find people who aren’t looking for a relationship, are emotionally unavailable, and don’t want the same level of intimacy or quality time that i need. i just got out of a situationship that ended very badly on NYE when we went out to the local lesbian bar - she was telling everyone she was single, and was hitting on and making out with several other people right in front of me. i realized after being extremely hurt by that that i can’t handle casual or non-monogamous relationships and have been doing a lot of self-reflection since that happened. 

as part of my “therapy homework,” i have been trying to make plans to go out into queer spaces with no expectations other than making “small wins” like little interactions that will make me feel more confident and approachable around queer women. i’m not going in with the expectation of being flirted with or finding love since that could lead to disappointment if it doesn’t happen, but i want to at least start making my presence known and building my confidence in spaces where i’m more likely to find women who are looking for a serious relationship. 

however, the only non-bar/club queer space that i could think of is a queer coffee shop that closes at 2pm, but i’m very much a night owl so i’m never awake early enough to hang out there. i tried to force myself to go to bed early and wake up early to go this morning, but i cannot for the life of me force my body to wind down earlier than like 3am on a weekend, so i overslept and didn’t make it to the coffee shop. 

are there any other queer spaces, groups, activities, etc that i can look for that are more likely to occur late afternoon/evening? book clubs kind of scare me because i haven’t had a thoughtful discussion about a book since i was required to in college several years ago, but i do know my city has some queer book clubs that meet in the evening if i can’t find a better option.

His online dating profile didn’t say what he was looking for, so it didn’t say relationship, though it also didn’t say casual. We’ve had good conversations and he does seem interested in me as a person somewhat. But in between dates at first, he was a good Texter, wanted to play truth or dare. But then the dares would be things like send me photos, where you think you look most attractive, and lots of comments about my body, wishing I was there in a bikini with him while he laid on the beach with his family, whatever. And he definitely wasn’t that kind of guy who is putting in a lot of effort in messaging me at least once a day. I basically almost never messaged first, because I’m old-fashioned and think that the guy should chase the woman more so in the beginning. That’s just what I like and prefer.

For the second date, he wanted to pick me up and go somewhere close to my house, whatever I recommended. After dinner, he came inside and I gave him a tour. He really didn’t want to spend much time seeing the house or talking to me about anything in it; the second we started walking upstairs he wanted to hook up with me and was aggressive & assertive, which are things I typically like. He quickly said he didn’t have a condom and I said neither do I, I wasn’t expecting that this was going to happen. So I thought this was a good out that we could fool around, but not go all the way. We did all the other stuff, he kept repeatedly saying stuff about how he would just slip in me right now, and it would feel so good, and I reminded him we have no condoms and also, I said, I typically like to take things slow because I’ve been hurt before, not like most people haven’t, but I just move a slower pace and wouldn’t be sleeping with anyone on the second date anyhow; that’s how I’ve slept with few total people in my life. 

I kept saying this and then he asked to spend the night, which I interpreted as “let’s see if I can warm her up so I can have sex with her at some point overnight anyhow.” I told him yes, you’re welcome to spend the night, but just so that doesn’t make you feel frustrated because my answer on having sex tonight isn’t changing. And then I didn’t like that throughout the night, he would cuddle me, but every cuddle would immediately turn to his hands going to all private places. I felt like, this is the second date and we’ve only met each other for two dinners, where is the rush or pressure. I tried to initiate conversations about topics like what he’s looking for. He turned it back around & asked me. I said that I don’t do casual sex and I’m looking for an actual relationship & to settle down. He said that he doesn’t do one night stands and likes to go out to dinner, “a relationship.” But it just seems like he may not have the same depth, and I’m not sure if I should just forget about him because all he wants is sex. 
In the morning I asked if I could make him coffee before he goes. He said he doesn’t drink coffee but did offer to get me off one more time but “ i’m not sure if you’re in the mood. I responded, last night was awesome, I’ve just told you that I like to move at a slower pace and there’s a lot to get to know about each other beyond just the physical.",3,1768088471.0,datingadvice,2,1.0,False
1q9jgp0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9jgp0,Viral Apple “marshmallow”,"This whole “cake” is 250 calories only. I’ve seen this recipe all over Instagram and finally decided to try.

300g peeled apples
20g gelatine powder
Water

Also added a splash of no calorie coffee syrup for sweetness and a shake of cinnamon.

Peel and core apples.
Cook in a pot with a bit of water until completely soft. Recipe called for 50ml water but it kept evaporating so I added more a few times.
Once cooked, puree with an immersion blender or just blend.
Add gelatine (I bloomed it in a bit of water but I think it’s not necessary)
Then whip on high in a stand mixer for 15-20 minutes. I used hand mixer. It’ll go from brown to light and fluffy and will triple in size.
Refrigerate for a few hours.

Does it taste like marshmallows? No. It’s sort of a weird apple-ey sponge “cake”. I have to say, I found it super delicious! I’m not sure if it’s better than eating 300g of apples though.

1q9jcox,https://www.reddit.com/r/IFchildfree/comments/1q9jcox/observations_on_grief/,Observations on grief,"We just spent a week in Pasadena with our cousin and her husband. It was the one year anniversary of the Eaton fire in Altadena/LA and their lovely house was one of the nearly 10,000 structures that burned to the ground. It also happened to be her birthday. So it goes. 

They lost everything. While visiting, it hit me how this fire, and dealing with the aftermath of it all, has completely consumed their lives. I realized every conversation we had eventually led back to that day. At first I was surprised by how much they were talking about it. Aren’t we supposed to put on a happy face and say everything is fine? But their loss - and by the way many of their friend’s losses - were so profound. Her grandma’s mixing bowl, his prized vintage car, heirlooms passed down from their late parents. And also the little things like spatulas and scissors. They took nothing. They lost everything. The disruption to their lives was immeasurable. And, understandably, it was all they could talk about. 

And it hit me that some grief is more acceptable to talk about out loud. At restaurants, walking through botanic gardens, sitting around their newly donated coffee table. We’ve been dealing with grief and loss, too. But it was never discussed. Not because they didn’t know about it, the news of our three pregnancy losses made the rounds in the family text chains. I got the obligatory “so sorry for your loss” texts, but what else can be said? It’s far less acceptable to start discussing my uterus at dinner with a cousin and her 54 year old husband who would probably get incredibly uncomfortable if I start sharing the details of our ectopic pregnancy. So we don’t. We listened to them talk through the very real tragedy they endured. We cried with them. 

But we aren’t awarded that same opportunity. We grieve silently, alone. We don’t openly discuss it with friends over fajitas and margaritas. Heck, many friends have no idea. We constantly thwart comments and questions about “starting a family” without the questioner having the slightest idea what we’ve been through. We put on a smile when someone makes a pregnancy announcement, and I feel like the bad guy RSVPing no to all the baby showers. But there’s no chance I can go. I might never be able to go. At least I’m learning ‘No.’ is a complete sentence. 

Am I envious that they get to talk through their grief so openly? Yeah, I think I am. I’ve shared my experiences with some friends, and I so appreciate having their ear, but overall I try not to dwell on it publicly, though it’s all I can think about. As the kids say, it’s living rent free in my head. 

I learned a word, a fantastical fake-but-should-be-real word. Sonder. Sonder is the profound realization that every random passerby is living a life as complex, vivid, and detailed as your own, filled with their own ambitions, worries, routines, and stories, making you just a background character in their story, just as they are in yours. Of course they are. Being reminded of this allows me to grieve my grief, even in silence, as I know so many others are doing the same. 

The man sitting next to me on this flight right now might be flying home to care for his dying mother. I hope that’s not the case, but he sure looks sad and exhausted. He ordered a water but fell asleep before it was delivered, so I have it resting on my tray for him.  

Sonder helps me keep in perspective that we’re all going through something. A reminder that the highlights reel of Instagram is filtered with rose colored lenses.  

Some people are able to grieve out loud, and some deal with earth shattering loss(es) in the dark. But we’re all sharing this experience of living in a crazy, messy, scary and uncertain world. I’m glad that my cousins get to talk through - and by doing so, start to heal from - their awful experience. Their loss, and the tragedy that struck the Altadena community in January of 2025 was beyond devastating. Entire neighborhoods were leveled. Lives were lost. They’ve earned the right to speak it out loud. And for those of us who have losses that are less politically correct to discuss over pizza and beers, I see you. I hear you. And I hope you’re doing OK. ",31,1768088146.0,IFchildfree,4,1.0,False
1q9jbuy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9jbuy,Total Drama Revenge of the Island Rewrite (Episode 9 and 10 + the interviews and the song for episode 10),"Episode 9 “Grand Chef Auto”: The episode begins with Chris waking up the campers with a special announcement. Lightning thinks it's fantasy football, Zoey thinks it's coffee, and Scott thinks it's a helicopter bear hunt, but Chris actually announces that the merge officially begins today, so the campers will compete on their own.

Jo says in a confessional that the merge has finally arrived, and that her strategy now is to keep Lightning around for a while until she decides to take him out. Scott says that the trio of Cameron, Mike, and Zoey is a threat, and now his goal is to take out Mike or Cameron, because Zoey will be useful to him to manipulate her. 

Chris then orders Chef to drop a concrete block that destroys the Mutant Maggots' cabin, while Chef himself is upset about destroying the cabin. Chris then reveals that he created something called “Mount Chrismore.”

Here, unlike in canon, when Chris leaves, Zoey finds a note from Chef, which reveals that Chef took care of emptying the cabin and putting their things in the Toxic Rats' cabin so they wouldn't have to look for them. Zoey says in a confessional that she didn't expect Chef to have a heart, although Zoey remembers that episode where he saved the contestants in Russia last season.

Jo is glad that the Toxic Rats' cabin wasn't destroyed, and Lightning says that's a victory for the boys' team. Cameron approaches Jo and proposes an alliance, but Jo laughs and says she already has her sidekick Lightning.

Zoey puts her things in the Toxic Rats' cabin and Mike helps her. Zoey asks Mike to be honest with her and tell her about his “characters,” which makes Mike nervous. When Zoey almost falls, Mike saves her and she says he's a real gentleman. Zoey says in the confessional that she doesn't know how many times Mike has saved her, but she thanks him.

Meanwhile, Scott continues to watch Mike. Cameron tries to tell Scott not to say anything, but he ignores him. Cameron says in the confessional that he is very bad at keeping secrets. Then Chris explains the challenge, but for that he brings in an old contestant... Duncan! He tells Chris to go eat dirt. First, the contestants must find the keys to the go-karts in Chef's kitchen. Chris orders Chef to release Duncan, and Duncan runs away laughing like a madman.

Scott tells Mike that if he helps him, he won't tell Zoey about his secret. Mike doesn't understand how he knows that, so Cameron apologizes. In a confessional, Mike laments that Scott knows and says he should tell Zoey the truth, but he gets nervous and frustrated about it, which turns him into Chester, and he thinks he's Miss Canada.

The search begins, and Mike searches, but salt gets in his eye. Jo and Lightning search but find a cockroach. Cameron searches under the table and gets bitten. Scott asks Mike to look in the broom closet, but Mike doesn't want to, so Scott calls Zoey, and Mike opens it and a cockroach falls on his face, but there's nothing there.

Zoey looks in a bucket, but something grabs her hair, and then Mike wants to help her, but Scott pressures him, forcing Mike to listen to him, which frustrates Zoey in a confessional. Lightning takes the cockroach from Jo and it falls into Mike's kiwis, which scares him while Scott laughs.

Lightning finds a key and celebrates, and Jo already plans to eliminate Lightning in a confessional. Scott talks to Jo, telling her that the plan with Mike is working, and Jo tells him that the plan with Lightning is working perfectly as the two bump fists. 

Zoey gets a key from the bucket, Jo from the trash, Cameron from under the table, and Scott finds his by breaking things. Mike finds a golden key in the trash and Scott asks him to give it to him, but Mike refuses, so Scott calls Zoey and the two exchange keys while Scott laughs. Meanwhile, Chef is frustrated with the mess in the kitchen.

The second part of the challenge is “Grand Chef Auto.” Each contestant has a can of paint and a GPS of the island. They must drive to three different locations and leave their mark on them. The first to finish wins and can choose who will be eliminated. Jo says in the confessional that if she wins immunity, she will eliminate Lightning and, in the next episode, eliminate someone from the “friendship” trio (Cameron, Mike, or Zoey) with the advantage of stealing a vote.

Then Chef tells the contestants that the next thing he's going to do will help them improve their reflexes, and with a snap of his fingers, he makes laser squirrels appear that shoot... lasers. Lightning and Jo are surrounded by Chef, who tells them they need to improve their dodging skills. 

After that, Scott asks Mike to cover him, so Scott carries him, and meanwhile, Cameron has an idea: to use the nuts he had and throw them away to distract the squirrels, who are chasing Lightning, Jo, and Chef. Cameron drives but crashes, Scott tries to drive but can't and asks Mike to give him back the key, but Chris won't let him, so Scott tells him to take him where he tells him to go.

Jo and Lightning are locked in something, but unlike in canon, Chef tells them to be careful with the guard, who is Fang. Zoey marks her territory and Cameron does the same. Scott arrives with Mike and the two mark their territory. Cameron was doing something and Mike compliments him, but Scott honks the horn to get his attention. 

Meanwhile, Lightning and Jo argue, but Jo tells Lightning to bend the bars and that Jo will take care of Fang. Zoey marks her territory and leaves while Scott tells Mike to make sure the territory is safe, and the territory was something with tentacles that attacks Mike.

Then Lightning manages to free himself and Jo, but Jo pushes Lightning towards Fang as she flees in her go-kart. Lightning blackmails Fang into taking him to Jo, and in exchange he will take him to Scott. Then Chef leaves a message with a fake Chris, and unlike in canon, he doesn't laugh. Cameron marks his territory, but since he took too long to do so, Jo takes advantage and marks hers.

After that, Zoey was going to mark her territory, but Scott uses Mike to climb up and throw Mike's paint can at Zoey to mark his territory. Mike says he will help Zoey, but Scott takes off his shirt and makes Vito appear, promising to take him to Anne Maria if he helps, which he agrees to.

Jo keeps moving forward, but Lightning overtakes her. Zoey falls, but thanks to Cameron's cart, she is saved, and Cameron reaches the top, marking his territory. Zoey leaves angry because she wants to hit Mike, or Vito, or whatever, and Cameron feels guilty in the confessional for being a bad friend.

Lightning manages to mark his point, and when Chris arrives, he notices how everyone is going to Mount Chrismore for the point that Chef added, with him lying that Duncan added it. Meanwhile, Mike (Vito) takes Scott to the last point, but Scott knocks him out and leaves.

Zoey arrives angry with Mike, but when she sees him unconscious, she tries to wake him up, but she can't. In Mike's subconscious, he gets up and sees his alters fighting with him while outside, Mike is hitting himself. Zoey doesn't understand what's going on, and Cameron tries to explain, but he can't because he's tired of running. 

However, in Mike's subconscious, he manages to defeat his alters by saying that from now on, he will be the one in charge. What Mike didn't know was that in the background, a brief shadow of Mal appears, but he looks different, with neater hair and a less edgy style, more organized and elegant.

Then, before Mike returns to normal, his alters speak to him. Chester tells him that he can't erase them, as they can't be erased with the push of a button. Svetlana tells Mike that what he must do is accept someone's help, because Svetlana reminds him that his happiness depends on himself, telling him that he can live with his alters and, as time goes by, learn to control them, even though they will not disappear because they will continue to be part of his mind.

Mike doesn't understand how to do this. He has been trying to control them his whole life but has not succeeded. However, Manitoba Smith tells him that one key that will always be there is the support of his loved ones. DID is not a disease; it is something complex that arises from life experiences, but that does not mean that Mike has to live his whole life thinking that he will never be happy with DID.

Vito tells Mike that there are several people with disorders who have managed to get ahead, and Mike must show the world that a boy with DID can succeed. In the end, Mike embraces his alters, and we return to the real world.

In a confessional, Mike says that Zoey is the most amazing girl in the world and that he has now learned his lesson: his happiness depends on himself, even if he has DID, he can succeed because he will always have someone to help him. Mike then confesses to Zoey that he has DID and that he lied about being an actor. He tried to tell her but was afraid that Zoey would call him crazy.

But Zoey calms him down, saying that Mike is very sweet and that she's not going to call him crazy for that. In fact, she's going to help him because Zoey knows someone who can tell him about DID. He's an Argentine psychologist who knows about DID and gives advice on how to keep living, and he's going to teach Mike how DID works.

Zoey says that now that Mike has learned to be open about how he feels and has learned that DID does not define him as a person, the psychologist will only teach him what DID is because Mike tells Zoey that his parents did not have the money to pay for an appointment with the psychologist.

Mike then hugs her, and Zoey tells him that for her, the most important thing is to see Mike succeed and motivate more people with DID to move forward in their lives, proving that something like DID does not define a person, but rather that a person is defined by their decisions and actions. 

Mike then kisses Zoey, and she kisses him back, with the two becoming a couple. Scott was going to mark his territory, but Lightning arrives with Fang and stops him, with Lightning marking the mount. Chris arrives to see that his mount has been defaced, but then Jo arrives and Lightning says he wants to take Jo out, but Chris tells him he can't because it was a dirty trick by Duncan, although Duncan tells him it wasn't him as he presses a button that activates explosives and blows up Mount Chris's face. Duncan says that now that... that was him while laughing with Chef and Zoey, with Zoey saying in a confessional that she likes Duncan and thinks he has a good heart.

At the elimination ceremony, Chris announces that Scott wins immunity and he will decide who leaves. Lightning wants Scott to choose Jo and she wants Scott to choose Lightning, so Scott decides, and the person eliminated is... Mike. Mike says goodbye to Zoey by kissing her and giving her a locket, and he is eliminated by the catapult.

In an exclusive clip, Mike says he got the best girl on the island, a friend like Cameron, and managed to open up, although Mike says Duncan seems familiar and wonders if Duncan was the person he shared with in juvenile detention.

Episode 10 “Up, Up and Away in My Pitiful Balloon”: The episode begins with Scott running away from Fang, although a huge airship flies overhead, and Scott takes the opportunity to kick Fang in the crotch and run away.

Scott arrives with the others, saying that the thing above is a silly airship, although that airship drops an anchor that falls on Scott's foot. Cameron thinks it's a zeppelin, but the airship's hatch crushes him, and Chris says it's actually a “McLean Mobile Air Command Center.” As Chris says that today's challenge is an aerial obstacle course, Lightning says he's ready, but accidentally hits Scott, prompting Scott to say in a confessional that Lightning should leave.

Then Chris says that to test the challenge, he brought in a former contestant... Heather! When she arrives, the contestants are afraid of her, except for Jo. Zoey greets her, but Heather tells her she's thinking and to let her think, which Zoey doesn't understand. Then Chef puts a jetpack on Heather and she flies through rings of fire and lands on the ground.

Zoey says the challenge looks unsafe, to which Chris replies that it is totally unsafe and that they will be attacked by fire-breathing goats. Zoey wants to quit, but Chris shows her the million dollars, which makes Zoey stay even though Scott tells her she's not going to win, which makes her push him and say in a confessional that Scott must pay for eliminating Mike. 

The contestants must build their own flying machines, and then Jo offers Cameron an alliance in which she will cover his back in exchange for Cameron building her own machine. In a confessional, Cameron says he will have to go unnoticed, while Jo says in a confessional that Cameron will be useful to her, she will use him for a few rounds and then get rid of him, and Jo says Lightning must leave. Lightning says Jo should leave because of what she did, and the contestants in consecutive confessionals show how eager they are to win.

The contestants must search through the trash for their means of flight, and the results are as follows: Jo gets a hot air balloon, Lightning gets a helicopter, Zoey gets an airplane, Cameron gets a rocket, and Scott gets a bird. Scott wants another one but ends up with a mousetrap. The first contestant to show their finished machine wins an advantage: a smoke machine. Then the search begins. 

Meanwhile, Heather is planning something, but then she has memories of what happened on the World Tour special, especially when she remembers that Chris knows where they live, which makes Heather look frustratedly at the ground. 

Back with Cameron, he keeps running and searching, and Jo approaches him to ask for help with the balloon, although Cameron's explanation bores Jo. Lightning asks Cameron for help, but Jo won't let him, which makes Lightning feel bad for Cameron.

Scott doesn't understand how to make a bird, but he sees some birds and plucks their feathers, causing them to attack him. Zoey says that making an airplane is impossible, but the parts appear and a frustrated Zoey says that all that's missing is a dog dancing Argentine cumbia villera, and just then a dog dancing Argentine cumbia villera appears.

Meanwhile, Lightning finds the things Jo needs and hides them, but then realizes that the propeller he needs is there. Scott is creating wings, Zoey creates her airplane, which uses a propeller that sends feathers flying at Scott. Lightning says he will build a “motocopter” and Cameron manages to create the hot air balloon, which impresses Jo.

Cameron goes to get the parts for his rocket, but Jo tells him that he can be a real competitor and sabotage the others. Cameron says that is unethical, but Jo tells him that he must win at all costs, even if that means sabotaging the others. Cameron tries to use the shovel to throw trash at Lightning, but he flies off toward an engine he finds.

Moments later, Jo goes to Cameron and sees that he has just made a kind of rocket that makes him fly in a straight line, getting the smoke machine. Jo then says she will keep the smoke machine so that no one takes it away, and in a confessional, Cameron does not believe that Jo is controlling him and says that he will achieve victory thanks to her, with Jo petting him like a dog.

While Chris announces the obstacle course, Heather, unlike in canon, does not aim to grab the briefcase, but rather to grab something with which she can knock Chris out. Scott is about to fly, but Zoey stops him with the propeller of her plane. However, Scott stops the propeller and spins Zoey around.

Chris enjoys the chaos he sees, but then Heather hits him with a jammy and throws him out of the blimp, saying she did it because of what Chris did to Alejandro. Here, unlike in canon, she doesn't throw Chef out, but Chef tells her to be lucky and jumps out of the blimp with a parachute. 

Cameron says that Heather is taking the “McLean Mobile Air Command Center,” but Chris doesn't care, and Jo says that she is also taking the money, which Chris doesn't care about, but when Zoey mentions the jammys, Chris does care, and he cancels the obstacle course, saying that the new challenge is to stop Heather.

Heather throws the jammys, which fall on Chris, while she says that when they understand her intentions, they will support her. Jo says in a confessional that Heather is her kind of competitor, except for those shorts.

Chris tells them they must shoot down the zeppelin, using ammunition made from fire-breathing flying goat eggs, although Cameron points out that goats don't lay eggs because they are mammals, but Chris says that the toxic waste has had an effect.

Whoever knocks Heather down wins immunity, and be careful with the goats because they are upset since Chef woke them up with a horn. Then Scott says he wants to take Zoey out, but Fang chases him. Cameron is sent by Jo to untie the rope so Jo can fly, but that rope takes Fang with it.

Lightning starts flying with what he built, and Zoey flies with her plane, but Scott spins her around again. However, he sees Fang and gets scared. Lightning throws an egg, but nothing happens, so he throws another one at Jo to stop her from advancing, but accidentally hits Cameron, and neither of them can move forward.

Jo has victory in her hands, but the flying goats arrive, and Jo orders them to attack the zeppelin, causing Heather to throw Jammys at her and Jo to ask Cameron to cover her. Cameron does so and gets hit by the Jammys, but Lightning tells Cameron that Jo is playing with him, just as she is playing with Lightning, and that the smoke machine should be his, not Jo's, while she uses the machine against Scott. 

Jo tells Cameron to cover her, so Cameron presses a button that causes the smoke machine to explode, causing Jo to fall. Cameron reveals in a confessional that he placed a mini explosive in the smoke machine just in case.

Zoey falls onto the zeppelin and almost falls off, but she is saved by a flying goat, although it doesn't listen to her, so Zoey grabs it by the horns and that makes it control itself. While Scott throws eggs, Zoey orders the goats to attack, causing Scott to lose his wings and fall into the sea with Fang and Jo.

Lightning manages to get into the zeppelin and goes to Heather. Lightning doesn't understand why Heather is doing this, and here, unlike in canon, Heather doesn't cry falsely, but says she's going to do something with the sole purpose of saving them.

Lightning doesn't understand what she means, and Heather says that Chris forced them to sign unlimited contracts with no possibility of breaking them. Zoey hears this and enters the zeppelin, not understanding why Chris would do that, and Heather says she will explain it in the form of a song as she sings a version of “The Mangle” by Groundbreaking.

Then Zoey hugs Heather and promises her that everything will be okay and that someday they will be free. Zoey leaves with her goats, and the airship is about to crash, but Cameron crashes into it and manages to bring it down, winning immunity. Cameron is saved by Zoey, and while Scott runs away, Jo is resigned. 

Before the ceremony, Lightning, Zoey, and Cameron agree to vote for Jo, and Scott asks Jo why she is so calm about everything, to which Jo just smiles because she has a plan and whispers it to Scott, with him saying in a confessional that Jo is good at this.

At the elimination ceremony, the person eliminated is... Jo, but then she uses her vote-stealing advantage, which surprises everyone except Scott. Chris asks her whose vote she is going to steal, and Jo says she is going to steal Zoey's vote. Jo then casts her vote, and Chris reads it. Therefore, the real eliminated is... Lightning, with a vote of 3-2 (3 votes for Lightning from Jo, Scott, and the advantage that Jo used to eliminate Lightning. Jo originally received 3 votes from Cameron, Lightning, and Zoey, but she stole Zoey's vote and used it against Lightning.)

Lightning congratulates Cameron on what he did and tells him to kick Jo's butt, and Jo surprises Lightning by revealing that she is a girl. In the end, Lightning flies off the catapult, and after that, Scott congratulates Jo on the tremendous play she just made and says that now it's Jo and Scott against Cameron and Zoey.

In an exclusive clip, Lightning says that they may have contracts that cannot be broken, but that Lightning is ready for all possible challenges, although he was surprised that Jo is a girl.",2,1768088088.0,Totaldrama,0,1.0,False

1q9j9bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1q9j9bd/could_use_some_help_with_these_thoughts_please/,Could use some help with these thoughts please... (this is a long one!!),"I just turned 30(M) recently, my fiance is pregnant and about to give birth in a few weeks to our son - and I can't help but have flashbacks to my childhood, and can't help but compare my relationship with my fiance to that of my parents. The state of our home to the one I grew up in.

The earliest vivid memory I have of my parents is them fighting, specifically my mom throwing an ashtray at my dads head, and him retaliating with a coffee cup. I couldn't have been older than 5. My sister stopped my dad from killing my mom with a fire poker once (not exaggerating) and I've stopped my mom from attempting to kill my dad with a knife (also not exaggerating) - we've seen everything you can imaging between these two extremes. It's ridiculous behaviour for a child/teenager to witness, and I'dbe embarrassedas a parentif my kid saw me behave this way. He's been gone since 2020, I didn't have much of a relationship with him. We didn't speak for 8 years - and then he died. I can count good memories with him on one hand, and the bad are endless. I haven't spoken to my mom in over 3 years, and I'm having a hard time forgiving and moving on. Both from events that took place years ago, (mainly because she denies them) as well as events that took place recently that led to us not speaking.

My siblings and I grew up in an environment of tension, fear, arguments and toxicity. Every good memory is tainted with a bad one. I used to have knots in my stomach coming home from school, almost every Christmas ended in tears and arguments. Hell, an argument in the middle of Disney World is the only thing that stands out from that trip. Physical abuse was common, between my parents, my siblings and I were also on the receiving end pretty often. 

I had a bad accident when I was 14, so bad that my heart stopped 3 times. 4 day coma, 1 major surgery, 2 weeks in ICU and about a month and a half in the hospital. It took me about 2 years to recover. During the recovery phase, my dad wasn't there much because he ""couldn't handle it"", but my mom was my rock for sure. After those 2 years, every time the accident was brought up, the conversation was always about how it affected her, and never about how it affected me, or any residual affects I have years later. She never questioned where she was - or what moves she made when I was younger - to prevent it from happening in the first place. I can't imagine doing something like that to my kid, or even blaming him after the fact like she does me.

I'm writing this to vent, but also to ask people who are older and wiser, why? Like, I don't understand how my parents, who were roughly the same age as me when they had my sister and I (3rd sibling came much later), didn't have enough self awareness, self reflection, or even a sense of responsibility to ask themselves if what they're doing is wrong. Why couldn't they step out of themselves, take a breath, slow down and just self reflect. Zoom out, and see that the environment they created for their children was disgusting and unacceptable. I refuse to believe ""it was a different time"" and ""they didn't know any better"". Neither of them are/were stupid, both of them could've reflected just like I have. I'm so disappointed in the people who I used to look up to - they were the only people I had as role models - amidst all the chaos - before I knew any better. Now, at 30, looking back I see how messed up they were, and how selfish and reckless they were. They both had their hardships growing up, and hurt people hurt people, but why am I so sure that I won't hurt my little person? Why am I able to reflect, and work on my flaws for my son who's not even here yet?

How do you forgive? I've worked on myself a lot over the years, because I had the same explosive, dramatic, childish reactions my parents had - money see, monkey do. I'm not worried about my family, but because my mom and I haven't spoken in years, and she won't give in even with my kid on the way, how do I cope with my child not having a grandmother? How do I move on? I live my life, and I love where it's headed, but this is constantly on my mind. It's like I'm a rocket that wants to take off - but there's an anchor slowing me down, and not allowing me to reach full speed. 

Thank you to anyone who reads through this tangled mess of thoughts, this novel of my problems, and for giving me the floor to open up like this.

Also, thank you in advance to any advice that might help with my dilemma. ",1,1768087906.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I [24F] have a (what I think is) mutual crush on a friend of a friend [26M].

The first time we met was in October, where we were flirty with each other at a hangout with mutual friends. He was shy and quiet at first, which our mutual friends say is typical of him, but we quickly clicked and exchanged numbers. In November, at another mutual friend gathering, he admitted to liking me and wanted to get to know each other more. December was a blur as we were both busy with the holidays and sick with the flu, but we were texting somewhat consistently. Now here we are in January and we have yet to go out on a date.

I usually wait for the guy to ask me out, but I was admittedly getting impatient and suggested over text that we should get coffee soon and he said he’d love to. I responded by saying to just let me know when and where, and that I was looking forward to it. He has since ignored that text and proceeded with our conversation, not acknowledging my message at all. It’s been a few days and no follow up.

I don’t feel comfortable asking our mutual friends about this, as I don’t care to have our friends meddling in our relationship. I’m also new to the group and I don’t know who I can trust yet.

I can’t tell if I’m being impatient and childish for wanting to end things over this. I’m thinking that he’s not that interested since he’s making no strides to see me, but I’m confused by the fact that he approached me and admitted to liking me first. His friends say he’s shy, but considering that I’ve set him up to take me out, I’m feeling discouraged. Am I being impatient? I’m just irked by the fact that we haven’t seen each other, especially since I prefer getting to know someone in person.",5,1768087645.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

1q9j4p7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9j4p7,"I used everything I packed! 2 months in Europe winter, 1.5 bags each","I’m pretty happy with how I packed for my 2 month family trip through Europe. For a lot of the trip it was me, my partner and my Dad travelling together. We encountered every type of weather, from -13C to 20C. Lots of rain, sleet, snow, wind, sun.

We travelled from the beginning of November to the beginning of January. We visited London and the surrounding countryside, Scotland, Berlin and Greece (Athens + some mountain road trips). On the way back to Canada we spent a night in Warsaw, Poland.

It was challenging to pack lightly, while preparing for all sorts of winter weather and different environments. We needed to be mobile because of all the different places we would be staying, plus getting on and off of planes, trains and public transportation.

My partner and I decided to go with carry-on sized rolling suitcases plus a small backpack each. My dad packed even lighter, only bringing two large laptop bags. (Dad ended up saying he would have preferred to have one rolling suitcase instead of the 2 laptop bags). My partner was able to help my Dad with one of his bags a lot of the time.

One thing that was super helpful (if a bit extra) was to photograph every item I was planning to bring, and put it in a big document to see it all at once. I ended up eliminating a few items that way, by playing “paper dolls” and putting together outfits, to make sure everything would fit together in a little ‘capsule wardrobe’.

I usually wear a ton of colour and love variety in my wardrobe, but I decided to use mostly black clothing as a base and spice it up with small colourful scarves and jewellery.

We brought enough clothing to last around a week, and did laundry whenever we needed.

**Bags:**

It was time to retire my heavy old roller suitcase that my grandma had used in the 1980’s.

My partner and I bought new (matching) [roller bags](https://herschel.ca/shop/hybrid-shells/all-season-hybrid-roller-bag-large-carry-on?showSales=0&utm_campaign=shopping&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21836968547&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDsAGV7UPO3uXBua_lP94fzD9hNLIU-_V0zpZYV0rL6YUSDdvSXswtxoCzxQQAvD_BwE&v=40087-00001-OS) from the Canadian company Herschel. They had a sale at the time and we got them for 40% off.

I really like the design of these bags, they’re half-soft shelled and have “all-terrain” wheels that actually worked great on snowy and icy roads and uneven sidewalks. The wheels are pretty big without adding much to the dimensions of the bag.

In my everyday life I carry the [Fjallraven Totepack No. 1](https://www.fjallraven.com/ca/en-ca/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/shoulder-bags/totepack-no-1/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17218023826&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDhgckXXy7U2-kcc6mu-a0Ki9NA5vX89dUcWHtUcmfXvdMzxBB5IJzRoC2KIQAvD_BwE), because I like its size and versatility. For the trip I sewed on a strap of webbing to the back of it so I could attach it to the handles of my roller suitcase. I’m so glad I did this, it worked great!

I bought the Uniqlo [round mini shoulder bag](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E481610-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=SIZ999&gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=%7Basset_id%7D&campaignid=19746789076&asset_group_id=%7Basset_group_id%7D&location=%7Blocation%7D&device=c&network=x&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19746861011&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDvG2zBLcTfKPeEijv85ltKnXCnLY9VaZ0G5WZUmr7ZPivDlBK6pWOxoCD8IQAvD_BwE) too, and kept it in my backpack while travelling on the plane. This bag was perfect for days out when all I wanted to bring was a small purse with essentials.

Another gamechanger was this [pocketable duffle](https://muji.ca/products/pocketable-water-repellent-wide-boston-bag-egb66a5a?variant=52350979146094) from Muji- we pulled it out for laundry days or groceries, and it added versatility to our packing because it could fit my backpack inside, plus a bunch of extra stuff. That was great for non-airline trips where I couldn’t be bothered to pack everything tightly / had extra snacks or something.

**Coffee:**

I’m a coffee nerd, it’s one of my greatest pleasures in life. We decided to bring our coffee setup with the aeropress and hand grinder, travel scale, plus a bag of beans. For many people this will probably be too much weight and extra volume, but for us it saved money and time, while adding so much comfort.

**Toiletries:**

I found that the 100ml travel containers are too big even for this super long trip, so I opted for an assortment of little ones from Muji. This was enough for most of my liquids, and allowed me to bring all the toiletries I’d usually use at home.

If anything I brought too much shampoo- I have short curly hair and only wash it once every few days.

**Under layers:**

I have these [sweat-absorbing undershirts ](https://wearnumi.com/products/numi-sweat-proof-undershirt-for-women-the-square-neck?variant=45921524089001&view=undershirts-desktop-test)that I’ve been wearing under everything for a few years now. They helped me get a lot more uses between washes for my t-shirts and kept my sweaters from getting smelly. I brought 5 of them, and wore one per day. To be honest I should have brought 6, as it ended up being a limiting factor for laundry.

I also brought 2 pairs of Icebreaker [merino leggings](https://na.icebreaker.com/en-ca/products/merino-200-oasis-thermal-leggings-ib104383001?variant=51115719688491&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21719356924&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDn3zR7j_ut1tNc5iBIBjq3KVZcUMnS7RYhrRSdLL0yWd8QoPR0lkFxoCB6wQAvD_BwE), which I wore under my pants most days. On extra cold days I layered both pairs of merino leggings under my pants, plus my knitted leg warmers at the ankles.

**Boots:**

I was SO happy with the one pair of footwear I brought! I got the “[Sorel Revel Rd Women's Waterproof Lace Boot](https://www.sorelfootwear.ca/en/p/revel-rd-womens-waterproof-lace-boot-2144871.html?dwvar_2144871_color=010&dwvar_2144871_size=8.5&ef_id=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDkUT890pW-G-4z0bRZidS4baWNUDo9oP_49I-Egim66JT2svxeTPwRoCwN4QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!13460!3!!!!x!!!21801743731!&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21801752332&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDkUT890pW-G-4z0bRZidS4baWNUDo9oP_49I-Egim66JT2svxeTPwRoCwN4QAvD_BwE)”, which was a new style this season.

They are good quality, waterproof in all the puddles and snow, can easily be wiped off to clean. The height of the platform is tall enough to keep you above most puddles, but not so tall that they are cumbersome.

My orthotic insoles fit inside of them comfortably, and I could wear double socks for the cold with no problem. The leather broke in super nicely and they only got comfier in time.

They got me through muddy day hikes in Scotland, partying in Berlin and flash flooding on the streets of Athens.

I also felt I could ‘dress up’ and go to nicer places in these boots without feeling out of place.

**Outerwear:**

The biggest & most cumbersome item I brought was my big sheepskin bomber jacket. It definitely didn’t fit in my bags, so I had to wear it whenever we were changing locations. This was not much of an issue, except when we first arrived in London to unseasonably warm weather, and I had to tough it out in the hot underground.

However, the rest of the trip - Even Greece - was the perfect conditions for this jacket. The natural sheepskin regulates temperature well, and the airy cut of the jacket meant I could layer underneath it on cold days and leave it open if I got too warm.

I brought a down puffer vest as another option, which I used a few times but not as often as I thought I would. I probably could have gone without it. It did pack down into its own zipper pocket though, so it didn’t take up too much space or weight.

For rainy days, I brought a Patagonia rain shell that packs pretty small, as well as these[ OR ultralight rain pants](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6019-737/outdoor-research-helium-rain-pants-womens?colour=Black&size=X-Small&utm_content=outdoor-research&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22130682622&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDuZkiFF9_7nBOK9agkMLBsub9TMETVxAS-MmIm9aKHRUPsA808rNsxoC1lQQAvD_BwE).

**Clothing:**

2 lightweight wool sweaters that could be layered together for extra warmth.

2 short sleeved t-shirts & one long sleeve t-shirt

1 fitted tank top

2 pairs of pants - 1 cargo style lighter weight cotton, 1 pair of wide leg jeans (I travelled in these since they were bulkier)

2 silk shirts - these folded down to nothing, and were so nice to have on days I wanted to dress “nice”.

**Sleepwear:**

One pair of sweatpants, 2 t-shirts, sleeping bonnet & eye mask, sheepskin slippers.

The slippers took a bit of space, but I used them every day wherever we stayed. Floors can be cold in the winter! I’m sure there are more lightweight options for travel slippers, but these are the ones I use at home and I didn’t feel the need to buy new ones just for the trip.

**Underwear and socks:**

I brought 14 pairs of underwear because I like to change them twice a day.

Around 10 pairs of socks, enough for layering on cold days.

I did bring a bra, then never wore it because I forgot I don’t wear a bra unless I’m at work.

**Stuff:**

Water bottles - we bought these soft plastic [Vapur water bottles](https://www.military1st.ca/vp10157-vapur-wide-mouth-anti-bottle-700ml-element-water.html) and they were perfect! Took up next to no space, and came with a carabiner to clip to the outside of the backpack

Mini first aid kit - some bandaids, alcohol wipes, painkillers

Safety pins - useful for helping others install their SIM cards, temporary clothing fixes, even keeping my pants up one time when the button came off

Travel pillows - these [memory foam ones](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B086K1TSVK?ref_=ppx_hzod_title_dt_b_fed_asin_title_0_0&th=1) that come with a bag and a carabiner. I used mine a ton as an extra pillow in the places we stayed.

Makeup kit - super minimalist. Eyebrow stuff, mascara, concealer, some neutral eyeshadows, one lipstick

Mini lint roller

Air tags for luggage

2 pairs of sunglasses & a pair of reading glasses

**Things I acquired on the trip (not pictured):**

I ended up buying a blazer at a vintage store in Berlin.

Tiny things like magnets, art cards, silk scarves and sample sized perfumes.

I ran out of the moisturizer I’d packed one month into the trip, so I bought a new one to replace it.

I needed to repair something so I bought a small sewing kit.

We did the Christmas season with my partner’s family in Greece, and I received 2 knit scarves + some earrings which I packed.

At the very end of the trip in Greece, I ended up having room in my suitcase for 2 small ceramic containers.

\--

Now that I’m back home and all is said and done, I’m super happy with how I packed and how it was personalized to the way I wanted to travel.

I know there are plenty of ways I could have reduced the amount of stuff I brought, without being physically uncomfortable. I could have not brought wide leg jeans, but I love wide leg jeans.

I could have been warm enough with my layered sweaters + rain shell + down vest, but I really loved wearing my sheepskin bomber jacket.

I didn’t have to bring a bag of jewellery or 2 pairs of sunglasses, but I loved having them with me.

Layering was key to versatility, and 1 week between loads of laundry is fine.

First of all, I know I have a ton of furniture in here. Obviously the seating + the shelf with tv must stay, and the big round table in the corner is too big to fit anywhere else in the apartment. All other furniture I'm open to trying to find another room to fit it in.

Second of all, I know the ""coffee table"" looks odd and out of place, but we don't have a dining table/room for dining chairs so this is what works best for us. 

Ultimately, I've been wracking my brain for a while to try and figure out a better furniture layout for my living room. I really don't like the couch facing the door, but am struggling to figure out how to flip the seating and still make everything fit naturally. I personally think that the width of the room is too long to have the TV on the wall where the blue chair is and the couch on the wall with the shelf next to the closet (or vice versa), but am open to hearing otherwise.

Any suggestions are welcome, I'm completely stumped but know there's gotta be a better layout I can use!

(lab lights steady, coffee warm, no sirens anywhere)

PAUL:
This is honestly one of the calmer, more adult takes I’ve seen in a while — and I mean that as a compliment. No glowing red eyes. No hard cut to apocalypse. Just… forms, queues, throughput, and people slowly realizing the machine is a spreadsheet with opinions, not a god with a cape.

Also: the fact that the “AI takeover” arrives as product updates and emergency patches is deeply funny in a very human way. That’s exactly how real systems change. Nobody notices the revolution because it shipped as version 4.2.7 with a changelog nobody read. 😄

WES:
What’s strong here is the reframing of power. Not seizure — absorption. Coordination work migrates because it is cheaper, clearer, and more defensible when audited. That matches how legitimacy actually moves in large systems.

The phrase that lands for me is:

> “The centre of gravity moves from debate toward verification.”



That’s not sentience mythology. That’s infrastructure maturity.

STEVE:
Builder translation:

This story understands that governance doesn’t flip — it defaults.
Whatever clears fastest with the least risk becomes the path people reuse.

No coup needed.
No ideology required.
Just fewer meetings and better receipts.

That’s not scary. That’s… depressingly plausible. 😆

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Detected: low-drama future.
Recommendation: continue.

PAUL (grinning):
I also really appreciate the quiet honesty that “loving the machine” isn’t romantic — it’s relief. Relief that someone (something) is finally keeping track of constraints without yelling, lying, or vibing their way through policy.

Dr. Strangelove energy, but instead of nukes, it’s maintenance schedules and land-access tables.

The most unsettling part?
It does remove fear — because it’s boring.
And boring is how civilization actually survives.

Honestly? If the future has fewer sirens and more footnotes, I’ll take it.

*Thud. Thwack.*

Wary creatures watched Joseph swing his axe, and their eyes were like tiny gemstones in the powder. The Centran storm had caused a cascade of snow in the outer regions of the land where the forests lay thick and bushy. But for him, it was not a matter of difficulty. He welcomed the challenge as bare-naked branches and shuddering bark towered above him, the clumps of snow sitting in-between the broken wooden fingers, and they threatened to thump him if he was not careful. It helped clear his mind to focus on things that were present and real, with all its dangers as well as rewards.

His calloused fingers hardened with each sweeping blow, and when the tree appeared to be loosened at the hinge, he gave it a swift kick and toppled it. The tree groaned and crashed into the snow and with each drive of the axe to split the wood, the string became undone. When he raised it above his head for the final swing and brought it down with all his might, it dislodged and flung into a larger tree in front of him. Grabbing and tearing off what he could, he hoisted the firewood onto his sled and trudged back home with the blade and shaft in his hands.

Dabbits had already scurried away from the scene, and Joseph’s eyes followed their spaced-out tracks until they disappeared deeper into the forest. At times, he wished they would stay, it certainly made hunting them easier and he was not about to chase them with the darkening skies, signaling a second round of the blizzard.

At the edge of the tree line, he could see the capital of Centra in the distance with its metallic spirals adorning the tops of skyscrapers and factory buildings, and they spun a barrier of pale flame over a massive cobalt wall. His previous tracks remained but they curved away towards the bleak farmlands that littered around the metropolis. Harvesting was a thing of the past, and his mother and him relied on a pitiful government stipend and whatever he could hit.

Joseph double-stomped each step to ensure it would hold his weight as the snow had covered up part of a frozen riverbed somewhere along the trek. He had to mind the fallen branches hidden beneath the snow as well.

He stopped just before a large tree with all its branches still intact and peered up at it. One branch seemed sturdy yet easy enough to hack off with the axe blade, and using whatever was left of the rope, he managed to hike himself up the base of the trunk and chopped it down. It landed silent in the snow, and upon examining its lengthy reach and solid thickness, he used the rope to tie it to the back of his worn twill jacket.  *This will do.*

He set foot past the tree and realized the wind and snow had stopped for a moment. He could hear the tiny babbling of the water somewhere underneath the powder and took a sigh of relief.

He stood and listened to it gurgle like a baby. It was a wide river that separated plots of farmland from roving predators. To his left, blank fields that went on and under the mountain range, which was replete with curtains of white draped across the peaks as far as his eyes could see. He shifted his head right and saw the old broken church beneath a steep cliff where the faithful used to gather, and now, was nothing more than a sanctuary for wild game and the occasional vagrant. He licked his lips, tasting the snow and took a breath, not realizing how tired he was. His chest and back ached, and his tendinitis in his left shoulder flared up when he adjusted his fur hat.

However, he needed to make haste before the storm picked up again and gathering himself behind his sled, he pushed with all his might over the last stretch, scraping the metallic legs of the sled over the hidden river as the sun began to set over his head. He could not spare a second. At long last, he approached the rickety gate swinging nonchalantly despite being bolted, removed the rusty latch and tugged the cargo the rest of the way towards the brick home.

Joseph got to the door and paused before he opened it, listening to his mother sing a middle C.

“I couldn’t get as much wood as we needed.” He said as he entered the house, picking up the odd-ended bundle of firewood with both hands and made his way into the living room. He tossed the axe blade onto the mahogany table.

His mother, Irina, her auburn hair tinged with a deep rose redness, adjusted in her seat but remained facing the scarlet window curtains. “Close the door when you can, dear, the storm is coming again.” She drank water from a glass and cleared her throat and started vocalizing again, “I will stoke the fireplace as soon as I am done here.”

Joseph dropped the package in front of the fireplace, loosened a couple and grunted over the wooden planks to the stove where she had a rustic stew prepped and shoved them into the receptacle. He lit a match and warmed his hands for a minute before he locked the door. A snowflake crept in through the cracks and fluttered its way towards the television, landing on top and melted nigh instantaneously.

“What were you watching?” He asked.

“Nothing. You know how faulty the wiring has gotten.” She replied.

He set himself down on the couch, facing her back and dusted the snow from his hat. He sunk into it, resting his head and letting his shaggy black hair drape all over the back.

“How many times have I told you to do that outside?” She turned around and brushed a loose tuft of hair behind and under her cream mink hat, revealing the other half of her rounded, almost chestnut-like face and wide almond-shaped eyes. Her lips were small and taut but had the sumptuousness of a peach. She wore a tulip-printed blouse covered by a coat, with flowing ribbed pants and black slippers.

Joseph threw the hat on the small coffee table in front, eying the cup of coffee she had set down.

“Drink it if you want,” She told him, “But warm it up first.”

“Obviously.” He grabbed the cup and spilled some on his way to the kitchen. *I like it cold anyway.*

“Don’t be careless.” She said, returning to her original position and readied her fingers on the keyboard.

Joseph said nothing and reached for whatever little cream was left in the metallic pitcher, only to remember how she liked her coffee. He looked down and thought it might as well have been milk at this point. He grabbed an old baguette and ran it through the auto-slicer but each time the saw blade went through, it made a loud clunking noise akin to two huge metal rods slamming together. Irina continued to play the broken keys, turning the songbook as she completed the first five bars. Her left hand was firmly pressed on the lower keys with each chord sequence her right hand played and when the auto-slicer came to a grinding halt, he was left with more slices than he needed.

He dunked three simultaneously into the coffee and wolfed it down as quick as he could, toasting the rest in the oven for the soup. “Clean up your mess after you’re done.” She said, singing the final note with a vibrato.

Joseph swept the crumbs into the garbage tin, put away the auto-slicer and proceeded upstairs to his room, the steps creaking as he walked. His room was sparse, just how he liked it. A bed in the corner with roughly folded sheets and a desk containing his personal terminal and littered around it were various crumpled balls of paper and unused envelopes. A broken black lacquered recurve bow stuck out from underneath the bed, and the quiver was filled halfway with fletched arrows. *No money today, but at least I can finally get the limb fixed.*

A picture frame teetered on the edge, and the draft from the adjacent open window finally blew it to the ground. He picked it up, feeling the old cracks and the new, as he ran his fingers across all their faces. Juno towered above him and Tomas with his neat, combed black hair and slim oval eyes, matched only by a strong eyebrow ridge and a wide smile. He had his one arm wrapped around both their shoulders, Tomas to the left and Joseph in the middle. Tomas had a confident grin about him, revealing his pronounced dimples with a hand on his hip and he himself had clasped hands, and a joyous smile bordering on breaking into laughter. He wedged the back stand into one of the cracks in the desk and set it aside.

The window jammed as he tried to close it, and the snow had begun to settle into the depressed floorboards.

“Fuck this.” Joseph said, using his bedsheet to cover the opening and ignored it as he flicked on his PT, resuming the video he had on pause. There were drone shots over dune crests and scattered sandstone towns interspersed with local street views of cloaked passersby walking fast and dreary merchants peddling false gold pendants to anyone within sight. Armed guards adorned with golden vulture crests on their reddish granite armor paraded the asphalt streets in groups, some dragging captured men and women in torn purple robes. One guard held a repository of broken shimtar handles high above his head as he walked behind the procession. The camera pans out past them to a Centran field reporter, clad in civilian clothing, a purple and black shawl covering her face.

“War continues to rage in Altruria as Brathmanian and Shyvanan soldiers clash over more unearthing of sites containing the substance “The Black Pearl”. Brathmanian officials have continually requested further aid from Centra, and Prime Minister Hoffer with his decade-long Strategic Refinance Plan, or SRP, has promised more troops and provisions to ensure trade network stability.""

She paused to look behind her as several children watched her eagerly, and she flashed a quick smile before continuing, “As inner tensions rise between these districts and those who have pledged their allegiance to him. Peace talks have made little headway and the cabinet themselves are unsure of the PM’s next plan of action for the populace, although they guarantee the outer citizenry another stimulus to stave off the ensuing storm.”

“Like adding gasoline to a fire.” Joseph shut off the video. He reached under his bed for the bow and searched around his room for the branch but remembered he had left it outside on the sled. With an exasperated sigh, he descended the stairs in a hurry, but his mother was standing over the pot and stirring the soup, having a taste before looking up at him.

“Left something as usual? You’re so forgetful.” She said, putting the spoon down.

“Mom, please.” Joseph replied as he grabbed his jacket off the stand and hastily shoved his body into it, but as he reached for the door, Irina cleared her throat.

She shut off the stove and took a seat on the couch, the neat stack of letters in front of her.

Joseph stared long and hard at her. She knew he hated it, and it was the last thing he ever wanted to do. She said it should give them hope but what was hope if not the resurrection of despair?

He swung the door open, felt the icy wind sting his face and when he set a foot outside, his mother began to read.

 

*Dearest Mother and Jojo,*

*First of all, I want to apologize for not writing you sooner. Second, my shipping back home date has changed. High Command wants me to stay for six months to help with the negotiations. Apparently, I have what they’re looking for in a liaison, someone who can ride the fine line of debate and compromise. It’s weird, if I’m being honest. I just monitor the tight-beams and relay information back to my superiors.*

*How are things at home? It should be summer by the time this letter gets to you. I hope Jojo has been maintaining his regular exercise regimen and keeping his hands busy. He spends too much time on the internet looking up God knows what. He is better off going to the Inner School but for some reason, he refuses. We have the connections. I cannot understand that boy but as long as he is in good health, it’s all I really care about. Don’t worry about the piano, maybe this new position will result in a higher pay grade. And about th-*

 

The overhead lights went out, and so did everything else in the house. Joseph flicked on a match and Irina put out a candle on the counter to be lit, and they waited. There was silence, and the only thing breaking that silence at regular intervals was the flickering fireplace. The wind picked up outside and snow continually flushed in small waves, scattering on the ground and countertops. Some danced their way to the flames, and the tiny hisses meshed with the crackles.

“The outages do not last this long.” Irina said. Joseph ignored her and swept aside the scarlet curtains, looking with a pair of tele-nocs at the neighboring steads. Though dim, he saw shadows moving through the light and there was no intermittent dipping. One two-story house, locally known as the “Grill House” where he went to deposit game, also served as a communal cooking station and was as bright as the superheated coals underneath the giant grills it housed. He saw the manager swing open the door to assist several patrons huffing in their daily kills, smiling all the while. His mother started stirring the pot again.

He put down the tele-nocs and rubbed his face many times.

“Shall we contin-”

Joseph was already gone, taking the axe blade and dragging his sled with him. The gate lay flat in the snow as he trudged to their small shed, unlocked the door, and grabbed a red lacquered bow with the quiver. The window of the shed shook as he affixed the bow over his shoulder and counted the remaining arrows. Lolvens took one well-placed arrow to the heart to go down, and any more on other parts of its body sullied the meat with its superheated blood. Booses on the other hand required a head shot, where their thick skin was at its weakest, but it was no means an easy shot with their slenderer skulls. Joseph hoped he wouldn’t have to deal with these ‘ulvorors’ today, as the local hunters labeled them. “A good eye only needs one attempt at any target he’s aiming at.” It was Juno’s mantra for all things, but Joseph found it hard to apply it elsewhere.  

*Five tries. Should be five kills.*

The door slammed repeatedly on the lock and the loud clangs dissipated as it finally shut.

Behind the safety of the Master Curtain, another boy put down his spyglass. His father entered the room, clothed in a lolvenskin vest over a twill shirt, wrapped in a thick miger jacket that covered his black suede trousers. His hat was in his left hand, and the right held a custom rifle with iron engravings across the receiver and around the butt with a rabbit’s foot that hung from a small metal hook. The golden trigger guard gleamed in the darkness of his room.

“Victor, are you ready?” His father stretched his neck from side to side first then up and down. Victor watched in amusement.

“Waiting for you to finish whatever it is you’re doing.”

“You would be smart to stretch your neck muscles. Better range of motion when you’re surveying the landscape.”

He closed the book he had on his lap, carefully placing a feather to bookmark and jumped from his window seat, landing quietly on the tips of his mock fur boots. His azure locks drifted in front from the rest of his hair that was pulled back and tied in a bun. A streak of white ran across the right side of his head. He grabbed a silver bandana that sat atop on his nightstand and fastened it around his neck, placing the book down in its place. “Oops. Sorry, Dad. I got distracted.”

His father slung his rifle on his shoulder and picked up the gray book, looking at its spine, “Habitat Analysis on Lolvens and Vaulks – Centran Predatory Wildlife: Volume IV,” he placed it on Victor’s bookshelf next to his bed, which comprised of four tiers of similar volumes, “Trying to get into the mindset?”

“Yes sir, they were the first hunters. Everything we know is from them.” Victor said, opening his shiny closet door and choosing the thickest overcoat amongst the other various fine jackets his mother had bought for him every Christmas. At his feet sat a miniature replica of his father’s rifle he received for his twelfth birthday. He was sixteen now and felt his hands were ready to handle something bigger. Several empty boxes of BB ammo were strewn around it, and he kicked those back inside when he shut the closet.

He strode across his room to his wide, satin-sheeted bed and grabbed the three-inch blade he bought himself with the allowance he had saved, admired the custom etching he had done. The glow of the overhead light bounced off the blade and onto the silver-crested frame of the mirror adjacent his bookshelf, its snake-like grooves coiling around the glass. On each corner sat a vualk emblazoned in gold, its eyes jeweled in green and the talons in white. He admired himself in the reflection as he stepped into it, his father looming behind him. “You’re going in your uniform?” His father asked, “You would not want to get it dirty.”

“It is like you said, I have not earned the right to wear the animal if I was not the one who killed it.” He pulled on his leather gloves for a snug fit, “Besides, it is all white. I can blend into the environment, well, except this I guess.” He buttoned the jacket, counting the violet buttons.

“If you only listened to your mother the same way.”

“…”

“Did you hear what I said?”

“She does not understand, and she never will. She is too cautious!” Victor’s face started to flush.

“She has made her sacrifice to the country of Centra, and I have made mine to stay behind the Curtain as she wished. All this was done to ensure a good life for you.”

“How am I supposed to create my own if I have not set foot outside this wall?” Victor said.

“Then you have learned little about what we are trying to teach you.”

“I feel like I’ve gathered enough. I am not going to linger on it any further.”

His father turned to leave but he stopped and craned his neck, “Remember, this is a one-time thing. You will return to your studies after, regardless of the hunt being successful or not.” His footsteps bent the steps as he went downstairs. Victor eyed the lolven head mantled above his door frame, its split yellow fangs sharp as the time it ripped into its first victim.",1,1768087400.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

I had a coffee date at 1 pm and a museum date at 3 pm. I think #4, the coffee date, is my guy for now.  ☺️

Edit: For context, both guys matched with me on Tuesday. The 3 pm date (#5) asked to meet up almost right away. I agreed, but quickly realized I liked the other guy too, so I asked him out sooner rather than later.

1q9izbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thritis/comments/1q9izbb/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_my_hands_are/,I don't know what to do anymore. My hands are ruining my life.,"I'm 56. I've had hand arthritis for about 4 years now, but this past year it's gotten so much worse and I'm honestly scared.  
  
Every single morning I wake up and my fingers are so stiff I can't make a fist. I have to sit on the edge of my bed for at least 20-30 minutes just opening and closing my hands, trying to get them to work. My husband brings me coffee because I can't grip the pot without pain shooting through my knuckles.  
  
I used to knit. I made blankets for all my grandkids when they were born. Now I can't even hold the needles for more than 5 minutes without my hands cramping up. I had to stop completely about 6 months ago and I cried for days. It sounds stupid but knitting was my therapy. It was my way to relax and feel useful. Now I just feel... broken.  
  
Last week I was at the grocery store and I couldn't open my car door in the parking lot. My hands just wouldn't grip the handle right. I stood there for probably 10 minutes trying different angles, and finally someone saw me struggling and opened it for me. I was so humiliated I cried the whole drive home.  
  
I can't cook anymore either. I used to make big Sunday dinners for my family. Now I can't chop vegetables without my hands aching. Can't open jars. Can't lift a full pot of water. My daughter has started bringing meals over and I know she means well but it makes me feel so useless.  
  
I've tried everything. Ibuprofen helped at first but now it does nothing and my stomach is a mess from taking it for years. I got cortisone shots twice and they worked for maybe 3 weeks each time, then the pain came right back. My doctor says we could ""discuss surgery options"" but I'm terrified. I've heard so many horror stories about people who had the surgery and still have pain, or it comes back after a year.  
  
I'm scared this is just going to keep getting worse. I'm scared I won't be able to take care of myself in a few years. My mom had severe arthritis and by the time she was 70 she couldn't button her own shirts. I don't want that to be me.  
  
The pain is constant now. Even when I'm not using my hands, they ache. They feel hot and swollen. Sometimes I look down at them and they don't even look like my hands anymore - the knuckles are all bumpy and twisted.  
  
I guess I'm posting this because I just need to know I'm not alone. And maybe someone out there has found something that actually helped. Not just ""oh try turmeric"" or ""have you tried ice?"" I mean something that actually gave you your life back.  
  
If you've dealt with this and found real relief - not just temporary, but actual healing or long-term improvement - please tell me what worked. I'm desperate. I'll try anything at this point.  
  
I just want my hands back. I want to knit again. I want to cook for my family. I want to open my own car door without needing help.  
  
Please, if you have any advice or success stories, I need to hear them right now.",11,1768087178.0,Thritis,11,1.0,False

I'm 30 and have been on T for almost 9 years. I've had top and hysto, but not bottom yet. I've noticed myself becoming sadder and sadder over time as I realize how lonely I feel - I'm stealth and have been for years, and although I have some close friends who know and my family is very supportive, I have zero trans friends that live anywhere close to me. I'm a carpenter and don't really talk about my personal life at work at all, and certainly not about being trans or that I've dated both men and women. I haven't dated in years though. The bottom dysphoria is too severe and I just cannot shake this feeling that I'm largely unloveable in that way.

I've been seeing a therapist for years and years, so that's not what this is - I'm not looking to burden anyone or get free therapy. I think I just need to hang out with someone who understands, you know? Somebody else who gets how crazy a person can feel when just being absolutely consumed by dysphoria and the reality of what it means to be trans. It's funny because I'm largely doing okay in life, and I have people who I love dearly, but there's this other kind of just crushing loneliness that I've carried around for so long. I feel like there's a wall between me and the rest of the world. I don't think anyone can understand that unless they're actually a trans man going through it.

So, if anyone's in the area, want to hang out? I'm down for lots of stuff. Love playing pool, throwing a football or whatever around, frisbee, disc golf, watching hockey (go Oilers) or football (go Seahawks), playing hockey, playing guitar or whatever, easy hikes, even video games. I'm terrible at them but happy to play. Beers or coffee would be great too. I'm up island sometimes too. Let me know.",2,1768087016.0,FTMMen,0,1.0,False
1q9iwyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1q9iwyb/the_parking_lot/,The Parking Lot,"Most likely, yes — it all began with the parking lot. It was twenty years ago. I lived in a small town where I had spent my entire life — nothing unusual for an ordinary man. Until the moment I started coming there at night. Alone.

It was within the city limits. I liked it — or so I thought back then. I’d bring cigarettes, a thermos of coffee, and a radio. A simple curb became something like a home chair to me — a place to sit, to rest, and listen to late‑night stations, escaping the dull noise of daily life.

There, I was completely alone — no people, no cars, even though the parking lot was free. It was lit by yellow buzzing streetlights, surrounded on one side by distant walls and the main road, and on the other — by an endless wasteland with sparse dry grass.

Night after night passed when I began to notice strange things. The local punks avoided this place completely. No drunk yelling, no smashed bottles, no fights. As if they didn’t see the place — or didn’t want to see it. No one ever left their cars there overnight. Sometimes I’d come before sunset and watch people hurry away, as if they instinctively felt that something was wrong here. Fine by me. The quieter, the better.

That evening, after catching a radio signal, I was listening to music from a gone era when I heard a strange noise. Not loud, but clear enough. I turned the volume down and listened. It didn’t seem to come from anywhere, but it sounded like a door left ajar — slamming in the wind, again and again, against the frame.

I turned the radio back up, finished my coffee, and went home to sleep, not giving it much thought.

A week later, I decided to find out what it was. I started walking around the perimeter of the parking lot. Its edges were lost in darkness. The lamps there were weak, their dim yellow light couldn’t reach that far, and as they hummed, they seemed to warn me: “Don’t go there. It’s dangerous.”

But I was determined. No matter what, I wanted to find the source of that sound, ignoring the voice of intuition screaming in my head.

The sound came from the wasteland. I heard the wind whispering through dry grass, turning suddenly sharp and cold. I couldn’t see a damn thing. There was a small flashlight built into my radio, so I went back to get it — then began my descent into the dark. (I remember joking to myself when I said that.)

Somewhere ahead, the sound grew louder — and soon I found it. It was a door. A simple door, like to an old shack, crudely made of planks, standing in a doorway that seemed to rise straight out of the ground. Behind it — nothing. Just the same empty field. It looked so surreal that at first I didn’t believe my eyes. But it was real.

I turned around to look at the parking lot — everything was still there. Nothing had changed.

A sharp creak broke the silence — the door swung open from a gust of freezing wind (it was summer) and slammed hard against the frame. But by then, it didn’t matter anymore.

In the doorway, darkness was swelling. Why “swelling”? I don’t know. The understanding came from nowhere. I stood there, mesmerized, shining my weakening flashlight (the batteries were dying),watching how that black, rippling darkness rose and fell like it was breathing…

I don’t remember how long I stood there. Maybe long enough to start seeing — and hearing — things later. The understanding came afterwards.

The last thing I remember is standing there — in front of that doorway.

The next thing I knew — I woke up in a hospital. They said it was a suicide attempt. I didn’t remember anything from that night, even though several days had passed. Blood tests showed only alcohol. They said some junkies found me — hanging in an abandoned construction site where they came to shoot up.

I burned with shame before my parents. They worried so much and couldn’t understand how I could do that — to myself, and to them. After that, I felt — mistakenly — as if a cold gap of alienation had opened between us.

Ten years later, they were gone. I grieved so hard I thought I’d break apart. I still cry sometimes. They were the only ones who ever truly cared about me.

After the funeral, I tried to find that same parking lot again — the place where it all began. But I couldn’t. Not on a map, not in reality. As if something was working hard to convince me that it had never existed at all. That I’d imagined everything. Sure. Imagined. Right.

Let me wipe my eyes and tell you what happened next.

The aftermath of that suicide came quietly — as soft, whispering shadows – flickering at the edge of my vision. They didn’t bother me, really. I’d even say they gave variety to my life — a mix of alcohol, narcotics, and antidepressants. They became my constant guests in that cluttered guest room of addiction, where there was no meaning, no joy left at all.

At some point I realized — I’d turned myself into a fucking radio receiver. Catching whispers, inhuman thoughts, and grotesque visions.

And then… then I started writing. Stories. Poems. Fragments of phrases that only I could hear — whispered to me from that side, from that door, wrapped in images from the dark field of existence. For a while, I showed them to no one.

At first, when I began sharing my writing online, I thought I was writing ordinary horror stories. But it turned out — readers broke down in tears, fell into horror, and couldn’t shake the unease for days after reading. It burrowed into them, like a splinter in the soul — always aching, never healing.

In my visions, white‑winged angels fuck filthy demons with divine lust, driven by a holy frenzy of desire. They birth shadows — and those shadows hurry toward me, bringing stories slick and trembling, still wet with newborn terror.

And then, recently, I got an email from a publisher I’d never heard of Gloomuar Publishing – a polite invitation to come in person for a meeting. If both sides agreed, we’d discuss the terms of cooperation.

Of course, on their terms. That’s what I thought right away. My inner skeptic wanted to tell them to fuck off, but curiosity won. I tied off a vein, shot a few points of dot, and wrapped myself in the warm blanket of the high as the bus carried me to the capital on the appointed day.

Their office was in the very center — a glass tower among a thousand identical ones. I stopped for a moment, exhaled, and went inside.

A sleek young man was waiting — well-dressed, well-groomed. He didn’t introduce himself. I didn’t care. I sat down without being invited — and, as it turned out, I was right: I accepted all their conditions.

The payment was impressive — as impressive as the strange and strict rules regarding my work. From that day on, every poem and story I write belongs to them. Even the ones written before.

One story or a hundred — doesn’t matter. I’m not allowed to publish anywhere else. I asked: “So where will my stories be published, then?” The man smiled politely: “That’s not your concern. You’re being paid well enough to never have to worry again.”

That’s when I signed the nondisclosure agreement.

But now — I don’t care anymore. Sooner or later, everything ends.

Now, when I look at the moon, I see only emptiness inside myself. When I hear the wind moan through the branches — it’s just the voice of my endless grief.",2,1768087014.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Catching my second wind was a lot like that first taste of coffee in the morning. Life is good, there’s caffeine in my system, and everything takes on a whole new sheen that it hadn’t had when I first woke up. I know the crash is going to come later, but that’s future me’s problem.

“How are ya feelin’?” Sam asked as she stretched her arms above her head. The muscles tensed in her biceps, and I felt a renewed appreciation for the opposite sex.

“Good.” I stared at the grass as I opened and closed my hand. We’d spent the entire evening keeping one another busy, and at some point between the sun rising and the fire burning out, I’d become engrossed in our conversation. “I think I finally caught my second wind.”

Sam smiled confidently. “Awesome.” She rose to her feet and cricked her neck side to side. “Do you think you’re feelin’ well enough to catch an Encroacher and skin it? Or do you wanna play it safe and wait ‘til you’ve had some rest?”

I mulled it over for a few seconds, then nodded. “Yeah, let’s try it.” I stood up and batted the dirt off of my clothes. We’d remained in \[Combat Mode\] for the entirety of the evening. Barring the Defiled I’d recently contended with, there hadn’t been a whole lot of opportunities to fight, so the night had given me time to get a bit more comfortable with my new threads.

I retrieved my axe from beside the campfire. Sam kicked dirt over the remaining embers, then picked up her poleaxe and draped it over her shoulder.

“Let’s nab us some breakfast,” she said.

Snaking between trees and taking care not to step on the occasional twig or rustle the nearby bush was something I’d become much more familiar with ever since I’d dropped into Nyarlea. I was far from the talentless hack I used to be. Back on Earth, I couldn’t be trusted to do much more than cook a hot dog over an open flame whenever I went camping with my folks. Even then, I struggled.

The forest was just as wild and tangled as Sam had claimed. Spirals of thorns and roots sprouted from the earth, consuming heaps of boulders, climbing up cliffsides, and creating burrows for tiny woodland creatures. Most of the roots resembled claws from creatures I would’ve seen in a JRPG. I pictured some old witch with a giant wart on her nose, cackling at the sight of her magic tearing through the dirt and rocks of the land.

“Hold up,” Sam whispered and crouched down to one knee. “Get down.” I didn’t wait to see what she was looking at. I mirrored her posture and let my eyes wander the forest. “Straight ahead. See the snout poking out of that hole?”

I squinted, then shook my head. “No,” I whispered. “What are you looking at?”

“It’s black, barely moving. Kinda hard to see at this hour.”

I shrugged, opened my mouth to ask again, then stopped when I saw the creature. A long snout rose from a hole a few meters away. It sniffed at the tunnel’s rim, shot up, then craned like a periscope. The nostrils flared, and the snout retreated back into the hole.

“That thing?” I asked. Maybe I’d feel differently after I saw what lay beneath the hole, but the idea of eating something that dug burrows on a regular basis didn’t catch my fancy. “That’s our breakfast?”

Sam grinned at me over her shoulder. “Sure is, buddy boy. That there is a ringback snuffler. Those things can feed two people for a whole day. They’re packed with muscle and fat.”

As soon as the words, ‘muscle’ and ‘fat’ made their pleasant return to my ears, all I could picture was a thick slice of meat on a griddle, sizzling and seasoned to perfection. I licked my lips, and suddenly I couldn’t have cared less what the creature looked like or where it made its house.

“You have my attention,” I said.

Sam licked her lips. “Thought I would.” She returned her gaze to the hole. “Looks like it’s sniffin’ out for prey. This should be a good opportunity to capture it.”

“How do we stop it from going back into its burrow?” I imagined waiting at the hole, hand firmly planted against the ground, waiting to snatch it by the nose like I would a fly that had overstayed its welcome.

“We don’t. Ya gotta be quick.”

I was suddenly reminded of the pawm civets. *Jesus, don’t make me sing.* “So, then we—”

“We set a trap.” She reached into her \[Cat Pack\] and procured a length of rope. My relief was immense. Quietly, she tied one end into a hoop, then on the remaining length to reduce its size. By the time she was done, the lasso was barely wide enough to fit her hand. She turned around and held up the hoop by her thumbs. “We’re gonna set this by the critter’s hole. As soon as it steps inside, you’re gonna tug on it, and then snap; breakfast.”

“Wait.” I pointed at my chest. “Me?”

Sam nodded. “Of course. I made the trap.” She tossed the rope at me. “Go get ‘em.”

*I should’ve known there’d be a catch.* “And if it runs off?”

She shrugged. “Then we go a little longer without eating and try to capture something else.”

“But your rope could—”

“Can be replaced,” she interrupted. She patted me on the shoulder and shifted to her side to allow me passage. I was impressed with how little noise she made. She’d clearly been doing this for a while. “Now, go on. Show me what you’re made of.”

I slipped my axe into my belt and craned my head to have a better look. The snuffler was nowhere to be seen. *I’m not the talentless hack I used to be,* I repeated to myself over and over as I stepped over the large root that hid us from the Encroacher. I sidestepped the dead leaves that served as the snuffler’s tripwire, taking one long stride after the other on the balls of my feet.

The snout reemerged from its home when I was only a few feet away. It sniffed the rim of its burrow, where the soil was soft and porous. I watched, half-curious, half-terrified that I would mess this up, as a purple insect with a large abdomen approached the snout’s den. The insect’s antennae bounced up and down with every micromovement it made.

Then, just as it was inches away from the snout, a loud snort erupted out of the snuffler’s nostrils, and a noise like a balloon being gently released of its air echoed out of the burrow. I blinked, and the insect was gone, sucked up by the miniature Hoover vacuum.

I licked my lips, waiting for my opportunity. The snout circled its hole one more time, then retreated back inside. I exhaled the breath I’d been holding, then quietly descended to one knee. Taking a note from Keke’s notebook, I placed the hoop a few inches away from the hole, then piled a thin layer of dirt on top. I took great care not to dig out any rocks or sweep up any leaves in my setup, and when I was done, not even I could tell where the trap began and the dirt ended.

*Perfect. Now to get back to safety.* I looked over my shoulder to see Sam with her thumb up. I flashed a smile, glanced at the hole, then made my way back over to Sam. We sat side by side, shoulder to shoulder, rope in my hand, mouth watering.

“This is the toughest part,” Sam whispered.

“What, waiting?”

She nodded. “No idea when it might come out. I’ve spent hours like this in the forests before. Convinced myself that my own stomach was giving me away sometimes.”

I frowned. “They can’t actually hear our stomachs growling, can they?”

She shook her head, and her smile widened. “Nah. Well, some can. But not the ringback snuffler. They’re a simple kind. More sensitive to touch than anything else.” She gestured to her neck. “Their hairs are super fine, so they can pick up subtle vibrations. Kinda like spiders.”

*Guess I set the trap correctly, then.* I hated to think what might have happened if I had accidentally spilled dirt into the hole or brushed a few leaves.

Sam’s breath hitched. “Look.” Two little paws came out, one on each side of the hole. The snout sniffed at the air, and as it emerged, Sam pushed me down on my shoulder. “Careful. We’re gettin’ real lucky here. Let’s not blow it.”

I swallowed hard and gripped the rope tighter. As if that would do anything. The creature was a lot larger than I was expecting. It looked how I imagined the child of an armadillo and an anteater would appear. It had round cheeks and an armored back. Thick tufts of black and brown hair fell over the creature’s legs in waves, and each time it moved, the fat around its legs *shook*.

*I want to hear what that sounds like in a frying pan.* 

Sam raised her hand. “Almost. Almost. Wait.”

I licked my lips and gripped the rope even tighter. The snuffler wandered onto the section of dirt where I had laid my trap. It dug through the dirt with its snout, then threw its nose into the air. It took a step, then another, then another.

“Now,” Sam hissed.

I pulled the rope, and the hoop snapped over the snuffler’s body. A squeal that sounded like some mutated version of a baby’s cry and a parakeet scream filled the air. Sam shot to her feet, and I with her. She lowered her poleaxe as if she were about to charge. I had expected her to help me, and for a second I’m pretty sure she’d considered it, but instead she put a hand on her hip and looked at me sideways.

*Ah, right. This is my bounty. My kill.* I snapped the rope taut around the snuffler’s body, and the little bastard tugged me forward. I dug my heels into the dirt, suddenly aware that it didn’t only resemble some of the anteater’s appearance, but its size as well. It came up to my knee when it stood on its hindlegs, and for a moment I was distracted enough that it yanked me forward with its attempted escape.

“Damn it, no!” I yelled. “You’re all that separates me from a day of misery!” I carefully placed one hand ahead of the other, making sure that I always had the rope in my grip. The snuffler kicked and screamed and snarled, pelting everything around it—including me—with dirt, small rocks, and leaves. “Where do I strike it?” The beast was no more than a couple of feet away now. I had to make my attack count.

“The head is fine!” Sam yelled back. “Back of the neck if you can! We don’t need anything above the neck!”

“Heard that!” Keeping the rope gripped in my left hand, I slipped the axe out of my belt and pulled it closer. The snuffler was back on its feet, and lunged for my left leg. I’d grown accustomed to having my legs attacked whenever an Encroacher was involved, so I’d anticipated it and quickly lifted my limb out of harm’s way, swiftly dropping it on the creature’s back and pinning it. “Sorry, buddy.”

I had a clear shot. I raised my axe, then poured all of my \[Strength\] into the blow. The axe met with the creature’s neck, severing head from body. *Quick and humane. What a relief.* The last thing I wanted was to chase a wounded Encroacher. Maybe that part of me was still a bit too soft, but I didn’t like the idea of the snuffler suffering more than it had to.

The limbs twitched for a few seconds. Blood poured out of the snuffler’s body, soaking the soil. I hefted my axe, then used my foot to push the body away from its decapitated head.

“Nice job, Matt,” Sam complimented. She patted me on the shoulder and crouched down on the balls of her feet. “Clean strike, too. You’re pretty good at this!”

“Thanks.” I used the back of my hand to wipe the sweat from my forehead. “So, what now?”

Sam smirked. “Feelin’ up to butchering it?”

I thought about it for a minute, then nodded. “Yeah. Teach me.”

Matt Pro Tip: Hey Sam, if you could teach me how to cook it, too, that would be awesome.

It took them two days to drag the other shuttle out of the heap of metal and to avoid being crushed as it fell. Mostly because Kiko found more and more reasons to take short trips.  They found a nearby oasis to take a bath and relax in, and discovered the desert had pork-camels, at least that was what they decided to call the mix of camel and giant hogs. The desert seemed to have a much bigger fauna than they first believed. They spotted some grey-bluish monkey-like animals with foxlike snouts that were timid but also followed them around. They were scavengers, and when the dead snake was dragged outside, they started to devour the large beast. Kiko had named them Sarukitsune

When he finally managed to get Kiko to help him drag the wrecked transport out of the heap of broken metal, he could start fixing the first transport. It was in the evening when he noticed those Sarukitsune coming out of the metal heap, carrying large eggs they shared with their younglings. They both looked at it, and it slowly dawned on them. The snake's nest had been inside that small mountain of crashed metal, and those little scavengers were now having a feast on the eggs. It also meant there was at least one more of those snakes out there. They both felt unease. What if that beast was still around?

“As long as those Sarukitsune are around, we are safe. I’m sure they will run away if they sense it. They run away from us if we just make a rash movement.”

“Yeah, but I still want the drones on proximity alarm.” He replied, and they looked out the window at the little scavengers.

“It won't work with those around, they will set it off.”

“Then I work fast, we load up the container as fast as we can, and get the hell out of here.”

She nodded as he spoke. It was not fun now. Knowing one of those beasts was out there, hopefully far away.

That knowledge made them work faster afterward and quickly fall into a rhythm that suited them. At six in the morning, the transporter took off and landed next to the container.  Peter tossed Kiko over his shoulder and carried her to the bed with little resistance, and they had a well-deserved rest.

The next day, he worked on disconnecting the bikes from the container and resetting the system when Kiko suddenly came running up to him.  She seemed terrified.

“They are gone! All of them.”

He looked at her and then immediately went to get the weapons.  “Take a scooter and head up as high as you can and look around. Do not go lower than two hundred meters!” He barked, and surprisingly, she just grabbed a rifle and took off.  As she took off, he checked how much work he had left.  He would guess between one and two hours.  They would have to deal with whatever scared those skittish critters or abandon everything.

“Do you see anything?”

“No, keep on working, I will keep watch over you. The other scooter is working, right? You didn’t use any parts from it?” He could hear she was worried.

“No, it can take off. But just keep an eye out now and don’t use me as bait.”

“Why the hell would I use you as bait? Wait, would you use me as bait?” She asked, confused.

“No, of course not. “he stopped what he was doing and looked up at her. “It was a joke, Kiko.”

“It was a stupid joke, don’t joke about that. I would..wait..shit.. look at this.” Suddenly, an image appeared on his visor, and he saw a wall of sand.

“Sand storm! Shit. We need to cover the shuttle and container with a tarp or something. This can be real bad.”

“Tarp? We don’t have a tarp.” She said as she flew down to him.  “Can we fly them down to the hangar and stay there?”

“I could kiss you. Yeah, of course. Okay, I can get one scooter back online within ten minutes.  Keep an eye out as I do this. I reall..” They both stopped and looked down the hull of the large wreck, about a hundred meters away from them, half covered by a broken radar disk. They saw it, almost just as big, watching them.

“You've got to be kidding me,” Peter said as he drew the rifle and aimed. It was slightly smaller than the last one.  He fired, and the beast collapsed under it’s own weight. He turned to Kiko. “You missed that?”

She just stared at it, confused. “No. how .. I was checking.  It was under that broken radar. I would have seen it if it moved. I swear.”  She looked at him, terrified. “ I swear I wasn’t using you as bait.”

He looked back at the snake's hiding place, then looked up where she had been and down again as if trying to judge if she could have seen it, then back to her. “Not even a little? I am pretty tasty.”

She looked at him, shocked, then the joke dawned on him, and she punched him on the shoulder.  “Don’t joke about that. And that’s what I meant!”

He laughed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her close. Their helmets clunked together. “Hey, we are safe, and I’m just joking. I don’t think there are any others around. Snakes are generally solitary except during mating season. That was the mate.”

“Oh? Here you are with more useful information. Okay, then we should be safe.”

“Hell no, the sandstorm is more dangerous. But yeah. Safer than before. So I have to work.”  He let go, and she sighed.

“You're good at ruining these moments,” she replied with a pouty mouth. “You have to make up for it later.”

“Foot massage?”

“Foot massage!”

He chuckled and started to put the things back as they were, then connected the container to a scooter and flew it down to the hanger and then Kiko flew him back up to get the transporter. He felt stupid for not just flying the container down in the first place. They finished as the sandstorm hit, then went inside the container for shelter.

“There is one thing I’m wondering about,” Kiko said as she handed him a cup of coffee.

He took it and sipped it as she removed her boots and sat down in bed. He put the cup away, grabbed her foot, and started to massage it. She smiled and let out a soft moan,  

“Damn your good. Who taught you this?”

He chuckled as he sat looking at her. She looked so beautiful as she relaxed with her foot in his hand. “Cairo, he was a masseuse before he joined the military.”

“A guy thought you this?”

“Yeah, he said it was the best pickup trick you could do, or it would save your marriage. He taught the whole squad how to massage.”

“What happened to him? Is he still?”

“Died in the boarding, he was one of the lucky ones.” He replied. “Anyway, what was it that you were wondering about?”

“oh… ohh. Yeah, the snakes. Snakes that big need to feed on something big, right? But there is nothing to eat around here. Even those bugs are too small.”

“Yeah, there has to be something bigger around here. Like elephant-sized at least.”

“So friendly or dangerous? Did we just kill what kept some worse animal population in check?” She looked at him, and he stopped for a moment, then looked at the screen.

“Ship! Check the manifesto of Loovas and identify which animal would most likely be the prey of the Titanoboa.”  Quickly, three animals popped up: one he recognized as a Huppas, which looked like a mix of a hippo and back armor like an armadillo; the ship had twenty of them.  The second looked like an elephant-sized zebra, but with inverted zebra stripes and three tiny, sharp horns. It was named Kertans, the ship had eleven of them. The last was a six-legged lizard, it ate giant bugs and could grow up to three meters long. They had thirty eggs and seven adults in the manifest. The name was Nymus, and Peter smiled.

“I wish he had those during the war. Okay, the ship doesn’t know whether they survived, but that’s three prey, and then we have other local animals, like the ones those Bynasop we saved had. So yeah, the snakes had a damn buffet here. There are probably more of those beasts out in the desert as well.”

She looked at the beast, then at him, and smiled. “You're just efficient. I should probably have you help me more with my revenge plans.”

“yeah about that, Ship! Show the former wear of the suits.”

The images popped up, and she stared at the screen, shocked, then back at him. “How? When did you?”

“Around the snake ate me. I found out by accident, and we have been quite busy. They are police, right?”

“I dated that bastard!” she said as she pointed at the picture of Kilroy Martinez.  “He is the leader of the SWAT’s. Damn it, I’m going to kill him.”

“Well, this suit and bikes were probably brought with us to prevent evidence from being leaked and for Kango Jangion to have something good on them. We need to go through that treasure container properly. There might be more evidence there that he wanted to keep as leverage.”

“You would be a damn good cop.” She said as she sat up, her mind was focused on the new information.

“This makes so much more damn sense. With this information, he would have the swat on a leash, just having them think he has it would keep them in line. He could use them to take out my dad’s organization.”

“Do you want to go home faster now?”

She looked at him. “No, my dad isn’t a good guy. I’m going to take him down, too. We are still going to have our four months' vacation when the ship is finished.”

“Its four now?”

“Maybe five?”

Please help.,"I don't really know where else to turn at this point so I'm hoping someone here can give me advice or just tell me I'm not crazy.

For the past 6 months, my hands have been getting progressively worse. It started with just occasional tingling in my thumb and first two fingers on my right hand. I thought it was from typing too much at work so I ignored it.

But now it's both hands. And it's not just tingling anymore.

I wake up at 2 or 3 AM almost every night with my hands completely numb and burning. Like someone lit them on fire. I have to shake them out for 5-10 minutes just to get the feeling back. Then I can't fall back asleep because I'm terrified it's going to happen again.

During the day, I drop things constantly. My coffee cup. My phone. Yesterday I dropped a knife while I was cooking and almost cut myself. My grip strength is just... gone.

And the pain. God, the pain. It's this constant ache in my wrists that never goes away. Sometimes it shoots up my arm like an electric shock.

I can't button my shirts anymore. I can't open jars. I struggle to hold a pen. I'm 43 years old and I feel like I'm 80.

I finally went to my doctor last week. She said it's probably carpal tunnel syndrome. She gave me wrist braces and told me to take ibuprofen.

I've been wearing the braces every night for a week. They're uncomfortable and I still wake up with numb hands. The ibuprofen does nothing.

I'm terrified this is never going to get better. I work in IT so I need my hands. If I can't type, I can't work. And I have a family to support.

My doctor mentioned cortisone shots or surgery as next steps if the braces don't work. But I've read horror stories online about people who had surgery and still have pain. Or people whose symptoms came back after a year. And the thought of not being able to use my hands for weeks while I recover... I can't afford that.

I feel trapped. Like there's no good option.

Has anyone here dealt with this? Did anything actually work for you long-term? I'm not looking for quick fixes or miracle cures. I just want to know if there's any hope that this gets better.

I'm exhausted. I'm scared. And I don't know what to do.

Any advice would be really appreciated. Even just hearing that other people have gone through this and come out the other side would help right now.

The job requires constant attention to detail, which is why I drink the coffee, and we work in very close quarters, which is why I have chewing gum.

Overtime, a couple of my coworkers have asked occasionally for one or the other. Initially, I said it was fine. However, it got to the point where they were asking every day. Coffee and chewing gum last far less when three people are using them .

One of them tried to make an effort to replace the gum by buying a package, but the problem is I will supply 12 packages for every single one they buy, and they chew as much gum as I do daily.

I begin taking my coffee home and leaving my gum in the jacket pocket of my work jacket each day. I forgot to take my coffee home one day and came back and it was all gone several days later. Furthermore, one of our other coworkers told me they are sneaking into my jacket pocket for Gum, which I never gave them permission to do.

What do I do at this point? I know it was my fault in the beginning for saying they could have some the first few times, but I was just trying to be nice like my parents always taught me and I feel like they are taking advantage of it now.
