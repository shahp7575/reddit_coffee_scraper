1kkwieg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1kkwieg/some_thoughts_on_new_scents_i_just_got/,Some thoughts on new scents I just got,"Not a professional, but I love my new scents. So I thought I’d give some thoughts on them, based off of mostly vibe.

Akro
Awake: The opening is a very very distinct coffee scent. Really gives you the sense of walking in to that coffee shop on the street corner early in the morning. The dry down makes the coffee smell a bit sweeter. To me it feels like drinking an americano with a sugar packet added. Overall, a 8/10, I don’t quite like the sweetness, but I do enjoy it.

Malt: Oh my god, the opening of this scent is so unique. An assault on the common place. The opening is very faithful to its name, it really does smell like whiskey. It is however very very strong. It makes you feel like you just got out of a country bar after drinking way too many shots to drown your sorrows. The dry down again makes it sweeter, almost like Jo Malone’s whiskey and cedar wood. The interesting thing is, the first time I wore this, it genuinely made me feel a little tipsy after a little while. Overall 8/10, probably not a good scent to wear to work, the sweetness can be overpowering, but definitely a very fun scent

Ink: I did not think I would enjoy this as much as I did. This is the first time I’ve smelled an ink note. It’s suppose to be the smell of tattoo ink, but honestly it feels more akin to paint cartridges. It gives me that smell of the English teacher I used to have a crush on. A very pleasant and nostalgic scent for me. The dry down carries the ink note, but is infused with a sweet floral scent, probably from the osmanthus. Again, really reminds me of my teacher’s scent.  Overall 9/10, very nostalgic.

Night: This one is wild. It’s suppose to be the smell of a one night stand. Neon lights and cheap motels, looking over a busy road. And again, it’s quite realistic. Smells like make up and dove deodorant, mixed in with sweat, which is definitely from the cumin. For someone who has no body odor, it was definitely a jarring experience at first. The more I wore it though, the more I enjoyed it. Probably due to the scents cultivation of imagination. Whenever I caught a whiff of it, I just couldn’t help imagining a night of passion with a toxic situation-ship. Overall 7.5/10, the cumin is very very jarring, and requires some getting used to. This is definitely not a scent you want to wear to work, or even a romantic date; best to save it for a more…wild situation (whatever that may be).

Replica, Maison Margiela.
By The Fire Place: This was not what I expected after reading all the reviews on Reddit. Not disappointed, just surprised. The description is quite accurate. It’s a cozy scent that makes you feel like you are spending a winter night in a mountain cabin, making caramel s’mores besides the fire place. The opening has a lot of smoke, but it also has a lot of vanilla. Which in turn, makes the scent feel sweeter. As the perfume dries down, the smokiness fades a little and the vanilla is brought to the forefront. It’s here where the marshmallow effect really takes hold. When I get a whiff, it genuinely feels like burnt s’mores rather than fire place. Over all 9/10, I personally love sweet scents, but it certainly is not what I expected from this scent. Don’t get me wrong, it has its smoke, but the vanilla can be overpowering at times. Still, I love this scent.",1,1747066349.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1kkwi83,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1kkwi83/support_and_suggestions_needed_for_new_coffee/,Support and Suggestions Needed for New Coffee Bean Business.,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently working on launching my own coffee bean product line. I’m planning to introduce around 3 to 5 new flavored options and aim to sell them online through specific marketplace websites, along with my own website in the near future.

I’m starting small, investing around 20,000 INR to begin with — focusing first on developing samples and gradually moving toward final products. This will be a home-based business since I don’t have the resources to launch on a large scale just yet.

I would truly appreciate any advice, ideas, or suggestions you might have to help me move forward. I’m aware that every new business carries risks, and while I hope it will be successful, I can’t be certain how things will turn out. I’ll also be applying for the necessary licenses and permits to keep everything above board.

Your guidance would mean a lot to me as I navigate this journey. Thank you all so much in advance for your support!

1kkwh73,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkOfTruth/comments/1kkwh73/the_prophet_has_no_clothes_a_mormon_reckoning/,The Prophet Has No Clothes (A Mormon Reckoning),"***Dean***

***Washington***

***2023***

It’s not the flame that frightens people. It’s what comes after. The quiet. The *char*. The knowing that something once stood where now there is nothing but soot and memory. Dean understood that now. Fire didn’t destroy, it revealed. Stripped away everything false, leaving only what could withstand the heat. It was never about destruction. It was about clarity. And Dean had never seen more clearly than he did now.

He sat across from her in a diner just off I-15, the kind of place truckers stopped at before slipping back into the dust. The booths were vinyl and peeling, and the waitress refilled cups without asking. Dean wore a hooded sweatshirt, a pair of gas station sunglasses tucked into the collar. The woman across from him had crow’s feet and a notepad. No recorder. No flashy name tag. Just ink, paper, and a tired curiosity sharpened by years of seeing through men with vendettas.

“Aaron Blake,” she said, squinting at the license he’d handed her. “You look more like a Kevin.”

Dean shrugged. “Depends on the day.”

She tapped the table with her pen. “So what is this? Another ex-Mormon revenge fantasy? I don’t know why Maya sends you people my way.”

He slid the flash drive across the table. “It’s a blueprint,” he said. “Of how the Church turns faith into surveillance. And obedience into leverage. It needs to go public in the next few days.”

She raised an eyebrow but didn’t touch it yet. “You want me to publish this? Without verification? Without knowing who the hell you really are?”

“I want you to survive long enough to decide if it’s worth the risk,” Dean said. “That’s why only a portion’s on there. Enough to start a fire, not enough to burn the house down. Not yet.”

She picked up the drive between two fingers. “Give me a reason not to throw this in the trash.”

Dean leaned in. His voice didn’t rise. “Because one of those recordings is from your cousin’s disciplinary council. You remember her, don’t you? Served a mission in South Korea. Came back early. Went missing for three days.”

The pen stopped tapping. Her mouth twitched, but she didn’t speak. He could see the moment the skepticism cracked, the moment the memory hit her like a hook in the ribs.

“You bastard,” she whispered. Not with venom but with recognition. Dean stood, tossing a ten onto the table.

“I’ll be gone by the time you figure out whether I’m lying. And by then, it’ll already be uploaded.” She didn’t stop him or even look up. But her hand gripped the flash drive like it might sprout teeth.

The forum wasn’t flashy. Black background. Neon green text. A holdover from early-2000s hacktivism. But it still lived. Buried in the deep web, but still pulsing, still watched. Dean logged in under a burner account: *N3phiUnchained*. He posted the folder with a line of text:

***The Prophet Has No Eyes , A Whistle Blower’s Testimony***

The files spoke for themselves:

* ***Audio of Ethan Hayes speaking in intimate “gatherings” about “spiritual dominion” and “preemptive repentance.”***
* ***Internal memos from the Strengthening Church Members Committee tracking returned missionaries who’d lapsed in temple attendance.***
* ***Time entries of hours-long unsupervised visits with young women.***
* ***A spreadsheet showing financial rerouting from family services into shell companies connected to land in Hildale.***
* ***Redacted transcripts from bishopric interviews that should never have been recorded, let alone preserved.***

He included a timestamped screenshot of a hidden file structure labeled “Stewardship Oversight – Central” with metadata leading back to a Salt Lake IP address.

Within ten minutes, someone commented: *“Fake. Good fiction though.”* Another user replied: *“Wait. I know this building layout. This is real.”* By midnight, it had 43 comments. By sunrise, 400. Someone cross-posted it to Reddit. Then Twitter. Then someone translated it into Spanish and Tongan. A YouTube video summarized it with a robot voice and grainy screen captures. It trended for two hours before being pulled. Then it popped up again under a new account. Like wildfire.

Dean didn’t watch the numbers. He watched the shadows in his motel room stretch with the moon. He didn’t sleep. Just listened. The kind of silence that hums when the world is catching fire. He sat cross-legged on the motel bed, staring at the Bible in the drawer. He didn’t open it. Just watched it like it might flinch.

The stake center in Washington hadn’t changed much in the last years. Beige walls. Carpet that swallowed footsteps. A hollow-voiced piano hummed prelude music as families filtered in. Dean wore a crisp white shirt and tie slightly loose, waiting outside the main chapel, ready to be called to speak.

He’d scheduled this three weeks earlier through a counselor who had seen his post and asked in the forums how to get in touch with the author. Two days later, they were chatting over coffee about Hayes and his behaviors that never stopped escalating. Nobody checked with the counselor when he added “Aaron Blake – Return Missionary” to the program for the upcoming Stake Conference sacrament meeting.

He sat on a couch in the foyer as the opening hymn played: *High on a Mountain Top.* He almost laughed. The irony tasted metallic.

Then they called him, “First, we have a return missionary to give us a talk. Please welcome Elder Aaron Blake back from the Ukraine Kyiv Mission.” His steps to the podium were measured. He caught sight of Ethan Hayes on the stand, gray suit, red tie, polished demeanor. Hayes had his gaze locked on his flock, a wolf guarding sheep. If he had taken a moment to look at who was walking up, Dean would never have gotten a word out in front of these people. His vengeance would have died before it sparked to life.

Dean took the podium before anyone could intercept him. The mic squealed. Then steadied.

“Brothers and sisters,” he began. His voice was low. Controlled. “My name isn’t Aaron Blake. And this isn’t a testimony. It’s a reckoning.”

A thick, electric pause. Hayes’s head snapped in his direction, recognizing a voice he’d heard in countless private conversations. There were gasps. A woman’s sharp inhale echoed through the chapel like a dropped plate. A toddler began to fuss but was shushed immediately. A teenage boy in the back raised his phone and hit record. Nobody told him to stop.

“One man taught me to be a slave to my faith,” Dean said, locking eyes with every person in the front row. “He taught me to kneel when I should’ve stood. To watch when I should’ve spoken. To serve men who serve only themselves. My father did his best to teach me to break those bonds. I wish he could know how sorry I am that I didn’t listen sooner.”

His voice grew sharper, quieter. Each syllable a nail. Each breath a blow to the foundation. Hayes was slowly getting over his shock and rising from his presiding seat.

“You told us obedience was the highest virtue, Ethan. That the silence of suffering was sacred. That when our friends vanished, it was because they were weak, not because someone had threatened them, or ruined them, or blackmailed their families into exile.”

He gripped the pulpit with white knuckles and zeal. No one moved.

“You baptized us into surveillance and stewardship. You twisted repentance into a leash and called it divine. But it wasn’t God watching us, it was you. A coward hiding behind children, weaponizing callings, blackmailing families, and laundering funds from members of this Stake. And for what, *Ethan*? You’re still nothing more than a man.”

A woman in the third pew covered her mouth. A man beside her whispered, “Is that…?”

Dean didn’t look at them. His stare wouldn’t falter. This was his moment. Hayes grabbed the microphone, not quite taking it out of reach from his voice.

“Dean, you need to leave,” Hayes said, standing now, his voice clipped with authority.

Dean didn’t flinch. “I have no weapon,” he said, voice rising now. “Only the truth. The Church is surveilling its own. President Ethan Hayes made us tools. Some of you in this room, your files are on the internet as of this morning. Interviews. Tracking logs. Surveillance from temple parking lots.”

He scanned the crowd, the words settling like chains on their shoulders.

“You think you’re safe in your callings, your homes, your temples. You’re not. I was one of the watchers. I know the names. I know who signed the memos. He’s not just a fraud. He’s a predator. There are girls, *minors,* whose testimonies he used to silence their families. Confessions he recorded and filed, not to help, but to control. You called it stewardship. But it was misconduct and conspiracy.”

Murmurs rippled. Disbelief. Recognition. One man stood halfway and then sat back down.

“He’s not lying,” said a voice in the back. “I saw it online. This morning.”

Hayes moved toward the podium. “This man is mentally ill.”

Dean didn’t move. Didn’t blink. His voice was calm now, almost reverent.

“So was my father. After you shunned him. After you shattered his faith and called it cleansing. After he learned what you were building and couldn’t live with it. You murdered his spirit. And said you were protecting the flock. You took his son and called it guidance. You ordered his death and made him hollow. But even in his darkest moment, he taught me my most important lesson.”

He looked back at the crowd, fervent with the moment.

“*If obedience is the root of virtue, let it be to God, not the men who pretend to speak for Him.*” Dean’s voice reached a crescendo as he confronted his mentor, his confidant, and his idol. He took another step.

“I was trained to extract confessions from children under the guise of worthiness interviews. I watched men justify cruelty with scripture. I stood in rooms where bishops laughed about broken homes. And every time I questioned it, I was told the Church was bigger than any one man. That obedience would cleanse the doubt.”

His voice shook now, but he didn’t waver.

“But obedience doesn’t cleanse, Ethan. It hollows us out. It poisons us, slowly. It silences the independent and the brave.” Two men from the sides began to rise. But no one gave the signal. No one told them to go. Dean looked around the chapel, at the frozen bodies, the dropped jaws, the glassy stares. And he felt it. The power of it. Not control. Not vengeance. *Release.*

He stepped down from the podium on his own terms. Not a soul tried to stop him as he walked straight out the front doors. The sunlight was blinding after the dim sanctuary. Dean stepped into it like baptism. Like rebirth. The heat pressed against his back, but the fire was behind him now. The real burning had happened in that room.

It took Ethan less than thirty seconds to catch up. But the damage was already blooming behind him.

“Dean!” Hayes barked. “You arrogant, reckless, little, ”

Dean turned slowly, his expression unreadable. His voice was quiet but cutting.

“You should’ve stayed inside, Ethan.”

Hayes marched closer, gesturing back at the building. “Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ve slandered the Lord’s anointed. You’ve torn at the roots of faith. Do you think you’re a prophet now, Dean? A martyr?”

“No,” Dean said simply. “I think I’m my father’s son.”

Hayes froze. Dean continued, his tone glacial, unmoved. “You always underestimated him. Thought a man with doubts was weak. But he saw you for what you were. He just didn’t know how to fight you. I do.”

Hayes’s fists clenched. “You’ve exposed sacred things. Twisted them.”

“No,” Dean said. “I exposed you.” He stepped closer, so there were only inches between them now. The crowd held its breath.

“I want you to remember something, Ethan,” Dean said. “When people start asking questions. When Salt Lake calls. When your stake counselors stop returning your calls. When reporters park outside your house. I want you to remember that it didn’t take a war to ruin you. Just a single voice.”

Hayes’ voice came out tight and strained, “You were a son to me, Dean. I wanted to give you everything Owen couldn’t. He was too weak…” Dean held up a hand to interrupt him.

“You made me your weapon. You aimed me at others. You told me it was God’s will and I believed you. But the only thing we ever served was your fear of being ordinary.”

Hayes’s face crumbled. Rage boiled up from beneath the surface. “You think you’re righteous now? You think this redeems anything? You haven’t fixed any of their lives.”

Dean tilted his head. “No. But it sets the record straight. That’s enough for me.” In the distance, sirens wailed, still blocks away but growing louder. Hayes heard them too. He stepped back, regaining his composure. He looked around, saw the phones raised, the cameras on him now. The same people who called him ‘President’ were watching him flail at this boy of a man.

Measuring his pace, Dean leaned in to speak in Ethan’s ear. The man seemed so much smaller than he had ten minutes ago. Like exposing this monster had somehow deflated his power.

“They’re not coming because you lost the way,” Dean whispered, his throat tight with emotion for this former idol. “They’re coming because you’re too expensive for the Church to keep anymore. They aren’t coming for your faith, Ethan. They’re coming for your files. For the bank transfers, the blackmail, the extortion, the girls called in alone, promising to help mold them for their husbands.”

He paused, breathing sharply and meeting the older man’s eyes.

“You’re not a prophet. Not a savior. You’re Icarus, and your sun was power.” Dean glanced over his shoulder at the street, then back at the crowd. He spotted his mother. Nora looked years older than she had just a few months ago, but there was a fierce look of pride mixed with fear in her eyes.

“Goodbye, Ethan.” his voice carried weight. “I wish you could have known how much I loved you.” He walked toward them, toward the stunned congregation still gathered on the lawn. An older man in a wheelchair shifted forward, blocking the line of sight. A young woman held out her jacket.

Dean slipped into the press of bodies. Hands opened around him. Shoulders shifted. In seconds, he was gone, absorbed into the crowd like breath into mist. By the time the police cars pulled into the lot, lights flashing, all they saw was Ethan Hayes standing alone, sweating in his suit, with nothing to hold on to but silence. And somewhere far away, Dean Geralds smiled for the first time in years.",1,1747066273.0,InkOfTruth,0,0.99,False

1kkwfca,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkwfca,Photo from ~2012 in a supposedly haunted house,"Ok so here’s the context. My family lived in Mexico for all of my childhood before moving to the US

In Mexico my parents and sister claim our house was majorly haunted

Here’s some of the stuff they’ve experienced

- my dad and grandma knocked on the front gate (you couldn’t see through it) and yelled for my sister to open the gate door, she yelled back

they waited and then yelled again and again she yelled back, dad calls mom and it turns out she was never home, no one was home, once my mom got home and opened the door they rushed inside and found no one or anything stolen, but my grandma questioned how the voice sounded identical to my sister

- my mom and dad were having morning coffee when they saw the shadow of a lady in a white dress walk inches from their side, across the kitchen and to the side yard door

They were in shock and didn’t say anything but when the woman “left” my dad checked and no one was there

- my mom heard crying from upstairs, the crying led her to a dark closet with no lights, she reached into a corner and the crying stopped

- my parents had workers outside unloading shipment from a truck, the workers asked if they had a lady living with them, turns out a lady in white somehow made it inside without them hearing and they saw her ignore them calling out to her as the lady walked inside the house

- when my family left my sister stayed behind, she claims that every night she’d lock herself in her room and watch movies because in the empty house you’d heard muffled voices, footsteps and furniture being moved around constantly

And now this photo, my cousin sent it to me (they live in Mexico still), it’s from an old camera my mom had, there’s a few more but this one they noticed this weird face thing

My first guess is a mask or clothes hanging but it’s sorta odd that the whole room would be dark except for that one thing

Hey everyone - was incredibly grateful for this board’s help with our trip, so wanted to share my notes. Just got back (may3-9) and had an amazing time. Cheer crowds were a non issue as far as my experience went. 

Happy to answer any questions

Wilderness Lodge
Water View Room: 5th floor, far wing. Quiet, nice views of pool. Personally I think this was worth the upcharge over standard. I nicely asked for a higher floor at check in and they were able to help.
Geyser Point: Cool waterside bar. Great take on a pina colada. Good drinks overall . But why the hype over the super average burger?  Didn’t try any other food so can’t comment, but burger was a let down based on expectations.
Roaring Fork: Friendly staff, food was  forgettable but better than expected based on reviews. 
Whispering Canyon: not worth the price. Food was below average for price. Kitsch was fun, but I would have been really bummed if I traveled to this restaurant and wasn’t staying on site.
Artist Point: Worth it. Destination worthy. 
Pool: Lovely. 
Boat to MK: Big perk. After fireworks was able to catch the water parade on way home. Secret tip: there are hidden lounge couches just beyond the pickup point on the dock. No one was ever there, and provided a quiet/private spot to view the sunrise/set.
Highly recommend the hotel, despite some culinary shortcomings. Felt like a sensory escape from the craziness of the parks.
Kennedy Space Center
Really Fun day trip if you have a space lover 
Rented a car at car center in Disney. Convenient and quick. Staff here were very friendly. Was way cheaper than uber both ways.
Hollywood Studios
Slinky: awesome, but more intense than expected for our 5 year old. 
Rise: Work of art.
Galaxy Edge: just an incredibly immersive park. 
Falcon: Fun, but a bit of a dud.
Oga’s: Worth it. Probably a blast w/o children.
Fantasmic VIP: Money well spent. Show was incredible and shouldn’t be skipped.
Hollywood Vine: Average food, but fun characters. Happy to have done it.
Build a Droid: For our kid, this was money well spent and the highlight of the trip.
Breakfast Ronto Wrap: lives up to the reviews and was very good.
Epcot
Norway: 
why the hype over the school bread and Viking coffee?? Dunkin’ quality at best. 
Frozen was a fun ride!
Germany: 
Model trains were a huge hit for our 5 year old. 
Why the hype over pretzel bread pudding? And the bratwurst? Not worth it.
France: 
don’t wait until end of day for ice cream brioche sandwich. Line was too long for us and missed out.
Bakery was quite good
Son loved Remy. Also commented that he doesn’t like to have to wear glasses, and I completely agree.
Canada:
Good beer. Maple Popcorn was fine, but again, very confused over the hype for these utterly mid snacks. 
Beautiful spot of the park!
Space 220: pricey, but if you have a space lover, worth it! Food was better than expected based on reviews. The kid drink that comes in a rocket is liquid diabetes so beware.
Illuminlous: Quick, nice show firework show. My least favorite of the 3, but that’s not to say I didn’t like it. 
Magic Kingdom
Premier Pass should be a no-brainer if you can afford it and only have 1 day to do it all. Even w it we missed one or two things. Removed nearly all stress and kept us in the moment. We also did this for Epcot and HS - probably wasn’t necessary for those on the days we went, but we still found value as we didn’t have to worry and meticulously plan our day. With the unpredictability of a 5 year old, it was invaluable.
Cheshire Cat Tail: was good, but same thing - why do people go nuts over these forgettable Dunkin’ Donut-tier snacks?
Fire Work post-show dessert party: if you’re like us and planning one big Disney trip to knock everything out, this is another no brainer. Incredible view, got there 30 min before. The desserts and drinks are fine, and IMO a nice addition for paying to not have to deal w the crowds. 
Casey’s: solid hot dog.
Tron: prob our fave ride. Short but felt like a super hero. Rise and Guardian were also incredible, obviously
So many great animatronic rides that have aged incredibly well. Pirates and Haunted still rock.
Our child loved Swiss family Robinson house
Animal Kingdom
Canteen in pandora for breakfast was lights out. Had the hash bowl and wish I could get it everyday.
FOP was incredible for what it is, but screen rides just aren’t it for me. Makes everything too dark.
Tusker was delicious.
Stunning park, just got too hot on our day there.
Didn’t do premier pass, and wouldn’t recommend it.
Lion King was fantastic.
Odds and Ends
Nearly everyone we met was very nice. 
 All CMs were really great
Premier Pass is well worth it in my opinion if you can swing the cost. 
If you need a car seat, get an inflatable one. Always had it in my backpack and was able to quickly audible into an uber if we missed a bus/boat.
In hindsight, we should have planned rest days into the trip and possibly extended it.

But is it a life-changer for fat loss or a recipe for disaster?

**What is OMAD?** One Meal a Day is extreme intermittent fasting: eat all your daily calories in one meal (1-hour window), fast for 23 hours. Think water, black coffee, or tea during fasting.

**Pros:**

* **Weight loss**: Cuts calories, burns fat (studies show 4-7% loss in 8-12 weeks).
* **Simple**: No meal prep hassle, saves time/money.
* **Health perks**: Better insulin sensitivity, possible anti-aging benefits (autophagy, but data’s thin).
* **Mental clarity**: Many report focus and discipline boosts.

**Cons:**

* **Hunger**: Can be brutal, especially early on.
* **Nutrient gaps**: Hard to get all vitamins/minerals in one meal.
* **Digestive issues**: Big meals can cause bloating.
* **Not for everyone**: Avoid if pregnant, diabetic, or prone to disordered eating.
* **Muscle loss risk**: Pair with strength training to protect gains.

**Tips:**

* Plan nutrient-packed meals (protein, veggies, healthy fats).
* Start with 16:8 fasting to ease in.
* Stay hydrated—electrolytes help.
* Time meals for social/active hours (e.g., dinner).

**Science?** Usually for short-term weight loss and metabolic health, but long-term OMAD data is scarce. Listen to your body, and check with a doctor before trying this or any other diet/exercise plan..

1kkw8zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kkw8zi/explore_if_the_ymmind_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore if the YMMIND French Press Coffee Maker offers the ultimate brew review,"**Stylish Design and Build Quality**

I’ve been testing the YMMIND B-FP-21OZ-S French Press for a while now, and I must admit, its sleek silvery stainless steel exterior looks fantastic on my kitchen counter. The build feels pretty solid, thanks to its thickened borosilicate glass body and top-notch 304 stainless steel accents. It doesn’t just look good; it’s built to resist rust, corrosion, and deformations. The BPA-free plastic components add a touch of safety, which is pivotal for those health-conscious like me. Its compact size, measuring about 7.3 inches tall, makes it a great fit for both cozy kitchens and office desks. I also found it easy to carry during weekend camping trips. Durability paired with elegance? Yes, please.

**Performance That Delivers**

Over the weeks, I’ve brewed coffee, steeped tea, and even frothed milk, testing every recommended use this coffee maker offers. And guess what? It works like a charm in all scenarios. The 4-level filter system deserves special mention. It includes four stainless steel screens, with two replaceable ones that elevate versatility. Whether crafting a robust espresso or a mellow tea, the double-screen filter keeps 99% of grounds from sneaking into my cup. If you appreciate smooth, grit-free coffee as much as I do, this filter design is pure gold.

[Check YMMIND B-FP-21OZ-S price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0cbnsmz1n/)

**Ease of Use With a Manual System**

I’ve always been a fan of manual brewing methods, and with this French press, there’s a certain joy to brewing my coffee the good old-fashioned way. The plunger mechanism is smooth, not requiring too much force, and that’s a win for folks like my mom, who isn’t a fan of overly complicated appliances. It’s simple—add your coffee grounds, hot water, and press. While you can’t rush the steeping process (patience pays off here), the end result is a beautifully rich brew. Plus, its user-friendly configuration ensures that even my clumsy coworkers could use it without much explanation.

**Boons of Its Multi-functionality**

- Works efficiently for brewing coffee, loose-leaf tea, and frothing milk. 
- Designed for diverse environments like home, office, and even outdoor use, which adds to its versatility.
- Can withstand very high brewing temperatures without breaking down or warping, making it reliable during back-to-back uses.
- The portable aspect, combined with its lightweight build, makes it travel and camp-friendly.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The glass body, though durable to an extent, still feels fragile. If you’re as clumsy as I am, be extra cautious during cleaning.
- It’s labeled as holding 21oz, but realistically, after accounting for coffee grounds and froth, the usable capacity feels slightly less.
- I noticed the stainless steel parts, while sturdy, can smudge easily with fingerprints, requiring a bit more care to maintain its clean, shiny appearance. 

**Competitive Options to Consider**

I also recently tested the Bodum Chambord French Press and the Mueller Double Insulated Stainless Steel French Press to draw comparisons. The Bodum boasts a more classic aesthetic, but its glass carafe doesn’t feel as sturdy as the one here. On the other hand, Mueller’s model wins points with its double-wall insulation, keeping coffee hotter longer than this one. However, YMMIND holds its ground due to its multi-use capability and extra filter screens, which neither of those competitors included. If versatility and price-conscious options are priorities, this product edges ahead.

**Worth Every Penny**

From a financial point of view, it holds decent value for its features. It’s not the cheapest option out there but strikes a sweet spot between affordability and quality. Compared to pricier alternatives like premium insulated models, this one offers functionality without making you pay for luxury features you might not even use frequently. I say, for what it delivers, it’s a bang for the buck.

as we all know, yesterday was Mother’s Day. 

Admittedly, it slipped my mind because I was working and didn’t plan anything for my mom. I called her to say happy Mother’s Day and because I didn’t throw a big show for her with flowers dinner and a gift she was NOT having it. 

7 missed calls later from her and 3 text messages with the last one saying “I’m going to your place I need to talk to you” 

I texted my therapist asking what to do and she told me to compromise and maybe go out for “30 minutes of coffee” … she knows the extent of my mother. And she’s telling me to go out for 30 mins with her. 

I did not follow her advice, after my last conversation with my mom over the phone consisting of her saying she feels I don’t want to be part of this family (true) and that she will keep a distance from me if that’s what I want (also true) while she’s in tears; I haven’t spoken to her. 

This morning my father then sends a text saying “for your information your therapist is not God!!!”

did I create a big mess because I didn’t plan anything and could have kept the peace if I did ? Sure. but I’m tired of playing a part. 

I’m debating whether letting it fizzle out because it always does, or if I should go NC at this point ??

I don’t need to explain the discard here; you all get it. It blindsides you and turns your world upside down. By contrast, this recent breakup happened through a thoughtful and honest conversation. I was able to clearly express my needs and ask whether he felt he could meet them. We came to the conclusion that he couldn’t, due to circumstances in his life that were beyond his control. We left that coffee shop genuinely wishing each other well and with a shared understanding of why it wasn’t going to work.

We'd done a little bit of flirty texting leading up to meeting (he mentioned in his profile he'd worked as a professor which I told him I kind of have a thing for) and we ended up meeting for coffee. I didn't volunteer the information that it was my first time meeting someone, but he was able to tell and when he asked I admitted yes. He said it was his first time meeting someone from SA too (a claim which I'd be dubious about, but with later context I'm inclined to believe him). He hadn't shared his photo on Seeking so I was nervous, and was surprised at just how handsome he was. We had what I thought was good, engaging conversation for about an hour. He did note a few times that there was a woman behind me that kept sending dirty looks our way. I didn't mind it but it seemed to be making him uncomfortable. At the end of the meet he said he had a gift for me and walked me to my car. He gave me a copy of Green Eggs and Ham, which I was delighted enough with on its own, but there was an envelope tucked inside. When i checked it later there was a very impressive stack of cash, amounting to what I would consider average PPM. The next day he politely told me that the age gap between us made him more uncomfortable than he had expected we wished one another well. I did my best to temper my expectations and remain humble, knowing my first meet had been an exception, but it did admittedly make the following series of M&Gs pretty disappointing by comparison. When I see wannabe SDs balking at the idea of giving a gift at a M&G, or trying to get the most they can out of an SB for the minimum and offering girls less than half of what I would consider for myself, I remember that first meeting. I wouldn't reach out because I respect most people don't care to hear from a POT SB who things didn't work out with again, but I really am grateful to him and I hope he found a slightly-older SB that appreciates him.

Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow.

1kkw39r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkw39r,$11k Morning Wedding for 100 Guests,"We did it! 100 guests for a grand total of **$11,327.61**. This community helped so much in my own planning, so I hope this helps someone else! For context, we were prepared to serve 100 guests, but about 80 showed up. We held the wedding in the suburb of a MCOL city. Some of the prices below are estimates while some are exact. Prices are listed most expensive to least. I'm happy to answer any questions.

**Food - $2,707.62** Price includes all tips. We advertised a ""light reception"" and continuously told people to expect just coffee and donuts, so no one expected a full meal. However, I think some people ate enough to count this as their lunch. Grocery store sandwich and fruit trays ($739.89), full service espresso bar ($1,067.05), and a variety of bakery donuts ($864.96) were on the menu. We also bought some bottled water. Had a lot of leftovers, but that was just fine!

**Photography - $2,195.00** This price includes tip and the full four hours of time. Our photography timeline was pretty tight, but our photographer moved quickly. This was a category I wanted to splurge on, and I'm really happy with the professionalism of our photographer.

**Venue - $1,700** We used a local church for ceremony and reception. This price included chairs, tables, linens, the officiant fees, lighting/tech, wedding coordinator, and a nursery room supervisor. I highly recommend finding small churches in your area as this was a huge budget saver. The only challenging part is they don't do weddings very often, and they have other priorities. There is a different level of communication compared to venues that ONLY do weddings. Still worth it for us, though. Also, our church didn't allow any alcohol on the premises, which was a good thing for us! Gave us a great excuse not to spend money on that. 

**Wedding Bands - $1,700** This is an estimate, but we both picked out exactly what we wanted. 

**Florals - $753.63** Price includes tip and delivery fee. This is another category I really cared about. We paid a local florist for 7 boutonnieres, 3 corsages, 2 bridesmaids bouquets, one bridal bouquet, two flower crowns (for bride and flower girl), and flower petals. All other florals are under the ""centerpieces"" category.

**Bride's Outfit - $492.74** The dress was from JJ's House with custom measurements ($311.27). I bought a veil on Etsy ($94.50), a dress slip ($17.00), and simple nude flats ($39.97). I spent an additional $30 for my sister to do some small alterations. The $30 was mostly for materials used as she wanted to do the alterations as a gift. I did my own hair and makeup. As a note, the alterations had nothing to do with the fit, and I definitely recommend the custom measurements through JJ's House. I also recommend trying on lots of dresses in stores before purchasing online. Trying things on in real life helped me get a good idea for the elements I wanted, so it was easy to know what I would like when shopping online. Lots of online places offer try on at home options too. 

**Stationary - $417.16** I bought the Save the Dates (70 pieces), Wedding Invitations (80 pieces), and a return address stamp from VistaPrint for a total of $178.16. Bought a huge 100 piece box of Thank You cards from Amazon for $23.00. And the rest of this expense was 3 rolls of stamps. I used the Thank You cards for the showers too, and I still have some leftover. 

**Groom's Outfit - $340** This price is an estimation but includes a shirt, pants, tie, belt, and shoes. He opted out of a vest or jacket, and it worked well with our casual event. 

**Misc. - $299.69** Never underestimate the miscellaneous category! I'm glad I planned $500 for unexpected expenses. We ended up using this category on a wedding guest book, paper plates and napkins, serving trays, and the unity candle. 

**Bridal Party - $238.64** Two bridesmaids and two groomsmen bought their own outfits. We provided ties. The rest of the budget was spent on gifts for the four of them. 

**Musician - $200** I paid a pianist for the rehearsal and ceremony. He played before the ceremony and then three songs during. We did not have a dance, so no music was needed during the reception. We just don't like the dancing part of weddings which is part of why we chose a morning wedding. 

**Centerpieces - $168.13** The only decorations were the centerpieces. I covered 16 tables and three serving tables with this amount. I used borrowed and thrifted vases and got fake flowers from Michael's end-of-season 70% off sale. I actually really enjoyed crafting these together, and it was a fun DIY thing I could do really far in advance. I didn't do much other DIY stuff cause I didn't want to feel too overwhelmed. 

**Marriage License - $115**

And that's it! Everything went smoothly, and we stayed under our $12k budget. I am thankful I had some help picking up food orders and had the church's wedding coordinator keeping things running. Definitely hire a coordinator or have a friend you trust walk around with the schedule because I didn't have to worry about a THING the day of the wedding. Again, let me know if you have any questions, and best of luck, budget brides! ",23,1747065380.0,Weddingsunder10k,1,1.0,False
1kkw2qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1kkw2qh/a_bit_weirded_outbumble_experience/,A bit weirded out....Bumble experience,"So here goes...

I am a man from India in my early 40s and have been chatting with a woman on Bumble since the last month or so. After some chats, we exchanged numbers and have indulged in banter primarily around fitness, gymming and memes as that were her interest areas. Since this woman was in to banter and was looking for something long term, I was also keeping it light and fun. The idea was to have more focussed discussions after meeting once and determining whether we connected in general. So, we met a couple of days back at a movie screening as she had 2 tickets for the same. We met a couple of hours prior to the event, walked around, had coffee and had general discussions but nothing that hovered around love, relationship etc, as wanted to keep that for later once it was clear that there was an interest from both sides and did not want to freak the other person out on the first meet itself.

After the meeting, text sent the next day elicited a tired response from her and then got the usual IG funny reel from her 2 days after the date. After the initial LOLs and a bit of banter, I asked her whether she sensed any connection and if she didn't, to let me know of the same. I was unsure of a positive response based upon the response or lack of the same the next day after the date( which was a Sunday) still was a bit surprised when she told me that she didn't feel a romantic connection towards me and while we shared many common values, she would like me to stay on as a friend which is the classic trope used by females to get guys to indulge them when they are bored. In a sense, I also didn't experience any romantic connection at the first meeting and the query was to just gauge whether that was a possibility in the future with more in-person interactions as I don't think its that easy to generate any romantic interest in the very first meeting when one is just walking around. I told her that I respected her feelings and that I wished her well without giving her any other feedback or opinions from my side. It was a graceful good bye and it stays that way.

Though I totally understand and respect the other person's views and have moved on, it just made me think on these lines (and I hope that I am not overthinking it, at best it may be a bullet dodged)

1. Can a romantic connection be generated in the first meet itself when the other person has been fairly  non-tender, has to the point discussions and  has been fairly one-track in terms of their interactions prior to the meet?

2. Is generating or expressing something remotely romantic only the man's responsibility? It would also be cute and sexy if a woman flirts and is playful with a man once or more during a date.

3. Can people not gracefully let the other person pro-actively know that there wasn't any connection rather than just playing dead and wait for the other person to bring up this question?

I am over this, but just felt a bit weird with this whole experience as it wasn't the rejection but just the expectation of a romantic connection when it was not built from the other side as well.

Just typing it out there to gather perspectives (that is all), please do not troll.

Will delete the thread shortly as just wanted to understand varying view points. 

I repeat - I respect the decision but its the expectation at such an early stage that kinda surprised me.

  
Cheers and best wishes to everyone!

Nvidia and Intel. I use two monitors, I do not use my laptops screen. One monitor, my main one, is connected right to HDMI port on my laptop. Because my laptop does not have two HDMI ports I use a docking station to connect my second monitor. The docking station connects to my laptop via USB A. Because of that I use a software called DisplayLink together with evdi. Displaylink relies on evdi to create virtual framebuffers and then capture those frames to send them over USB to the actual hardware display (e.g., a monitor connected via a USB docking station).

  
The first issue was that my main monitor was laggy, the cursor, the animations, low fps...

As you can see, evdi also has a like a virtual card of their own or smth. Its the card0. I set nvidia primary then evdi then intel. Why am I showing this? ""For example, `card0` will be the primary renderer, but if it isn’t available for whatever reason, then `card1` is primary.""  If I am thinking right, when Nvidia is not availiable to show video on my second screen because that's evdi's/Displaylink's job, evdi card should take over and make my other monitor work. 

THIS is the issue. My second monitor won't work when Nvidia is set as primary. Without that command both of my monitors work but the main one that is connected through the HDMI port to my laptop L A G S.

**Why This Pick?**

The Marlins offense is severely outgunned here, friends – and they certainly don’t hold the pitching advantage in Cal Quantrill (7.11 ERA). To boot, Miami is coming off of losing two games in a series to one of (if not the…) worst teams in the league (the White Sox). The Cubs should bag a comfortable win here at home – my money’s on Chicago to cover the RL.

1kkvyfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kkvyfg/trying_to_improve_my_coffee_game_using_my_basic/,Trying to improve my coffee game using my basic [De'Longhi Dedica EC685],"Hi all,  
I've had my Dedica for a couple of years and have been using the default pressurized basket, but now I'm trying to up my espresso game before investing in a better machine and grinder.

Here's the equipment I currently have:

* De'Longhi Dedica EC685
* De'Longhi KG 520.M grinder
* IMS Precision 16–18g basket
* 51mm bottomless portafilter
* The coffee beans I'm using were burned 5 weeks ago and are medium roast.

I've set my grinder to its finest espresso setting and typically dose about 17–18 grams for a double shot. The Dedica is set to its highest temperature, and I use the double shot button (should I be using the single shot button instead?).

Here are the problems I'm encountering:

* My yield is consistently way over 32 grams, sometimes even reaching 100 grams in just 26–28 seconds.
* The puck isn't solid after extraction.
* Sometimes the portafilter/basket sprays everywhere (is my grind too fine?).

I’d appreciate any tips or advice!

1kkvxts,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkvxts,Suggestions based on blood work?,"Got blood work done recently. Would love some opinions or anecdotes from people of things to implement.

I am a 26M. 6mo ago I took some of these same blood tests. My vitamin D went from 18 then to the measure today using premier research labs vit D at 10,000iu daily. Cholesterol was 260 and has lowered closer to the range as well. My liver enzymes came back elevated in the test 6mo ago but that value was also much higher than it was with my recent blood test. I’m concerned with the low T. Unfortunately, don’t have prolactin or estrogen at the moment but I’m going to meet with an endo to try to have them order that test so insurance will cover it. 

I know blood tests for thyroid aren’t held highly but my TSH was .67 six months ago and t4 was 1.13. My TSH has more than doubled and I’ve gained 15lbs mostly on midsection and chest, my hair is super dry and shedding like crazy and has receded on the temples a bit and I am experiencing fatigue.

I think the liver may be a huge cause since it’s consistently coming back elevated. I eat pretty peaty but have been cheating more than I should be. I definitely have digestive issues that I can keep under control by eating the foods that agree with me. Im thinking digestive issues, liver issues, pufa and nutrient deficiency are creating most of my issues. As of last week I’m really consistently implementing:


Supplements:
Vitamin D 10,000iu daily (have been doing this)
1/2 gram of thiamine HCL (will work up to higher doses)
B complex 
200mg magnesium glycinate  
325mg aspirin tablet 2-3x per week. Just taking the aspirin as I remember basically 

Diet wise I’ve been eating mostly full fat a2 dairy, potatoes, OJ, white rice , eggs, broth/gelatin, coffee, grass fed ground beef, Haagen dazs,  tropical fruits as I crave them.

I eat a can of crown prince oysters weekly. I can’t stand liver but as of last week I have been mixing in a few ounces of liver into my ground beef.

I have experience with supplementing thyroid but I would prefer to hold off until I meet with this new endo in a couple months. I saw he prescribes Armour and t3 so I’m hoping he’s one of the few good doctors in that industry. 

Any suggestions, ideas , critiques etc are all welcome!

1kkvx9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1kkvx9a/exigence/,Exigence,"So, yesterday was Narasimha Chaturdashi. 

I took my son to the temple in the morning. I wore my dupatta like a mantilla. I never do that. 

~~But it felt right at the time.~~ (<----A lot of (~~right~~, ~~wrong~~, ~~ambivalent~~) complex feelings and reasonings around concepts of gender, culture, heritage, and religion being left unsaid. I just mention it at all as a note for future me. To recall that the day being described is the mother's day I wore my dupatta like a mantilla.)  
  
Took darshan and prayed with my son. 

Ran into an old friend. Guru P. or Guru B., but I'm not sure which -- as they are identical twin sisters. She was wearing the end of her sari like a mantilla. As both of them often do.   


Let my son play on the playground outside the temple a while. Called my mom in the psych ward and wished her a happy mother's day. 

  
I went to the movies with K. that evening. We saw Sinners. It was good. The main characters were identical twins. Like Guru P. and Guru B. 

I ate a rehydrated meal in the gym lobby yesterday. My gym has a hot-water dispenser for making tea. 

The other day I bought a bunch of ""just add hot water"" foods. I had been looking online for ""vegan M.R.E.s"" and ""vegetarian M.R.E.s"". They're all so costly. 

But, if you look in the supermarket, you can find plenty of pre-portioned, dehydrated, individually packaged, shelf-stable veg meals. Lots of variations on cup noodles, porridge and rice and veggies. 

Last year I did a thing -- planned my meals by eating four boxed frozen meals a day. But that sort of tied me to home. 

Now I can go out and about. Explore the city like a stray cat. And as long as I can find a coffee shop where I can buy a cup of hot water, I an rehydrate my lunch.

I upgraded to a bottomless portafilter and better tamper. I’m getting frustrated because I can’t seem to figure out how to get a good shot. I started with the OXO Brew Conical Burr grinder but even on the finest setting I think it was too coarse for espresso and shot were over extracted and coming out super fast.

I then purchased a 1zpresso J-Ultra hand grinder. I’ve been making a shot every day and I can’t seem to find the right setting and now I think I’m under extracting and I’m choking the machine and it’s taking a while for the coffee to come out. The most coarse setting I used so far is 1.6. Due to the time it takes to like make an espresso shot I’ve only been making one per day and I’m getting frustrated with this process. Yeah since you can dial in with such precision, this is making it challenging to find the right grind. I also can’t tell if I need to purchase a better machine or if I can try to figure this one out first to get decent espresso.

* Ever felt like the earth is trying to tell you something? Listen, a solo exhibition by artist Jim McKeon is an artful reminder of the profound connection indigenous peoples share with our planet. It is a touching invitation to slow down and listen. Can you hear the whispers of the caretakers and the cries of the protectors? Enjoy the varied works of nine Triangle-based artists in a range of media including painting, sculpture, fused glass, and mixed media.

[**James Keul ""A Painter's Life""**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/opening-reception-james-keul-a-painters-life-2/) at **Craven Allen Gallery**  


* James Keul’s new show, A Painter’s Life, examines our connection to nature. Keul is an accomplished artist who has taught painting around the world, working in a variety of mediums to develop the deft, painterly technique seen in his work.
* The exhibition includes a selection of plein air works from his native North Carolina and abroad, as well as large-scale paintings which explore the impact humans are having on the natural world. In these paintings, Keul includes figures, both adults and children, to invite us to consider how our actions will impact future generations.
* Keul values art not only for its own sake, but also as a meditative practice which has guided his life. “Having had an unconventional adolescence, flying back and forth between parents and coasts, and being sent, at age 16, to a therapeutic boarding school in Western Samoa, art has been true north on my life’s compass, helping to guide me through some turbulent events and teaching me the value of patience, perseverance, and humility” he says.
* Keul’s work can be found in important public and private collections around the world. As an educator committed to empowering the next generation of artists, he will be teaching a group of Savannah College of Art and Design students at their campus in Lacoste, France this summer.
* May 17-June 21

[**Art Exhibit — Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-by-dawns-early-light-2/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**  


* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective. Cargo cults developed as a result of Western military campaigns that sent crated, often airdropped, supplies to foreign lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples. This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled “The Keep”, three of the artists' “Transportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)” works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

Hello All,

At the moment I am using a Flair Neo Flex, but I'm hoping to eventually get a machine as well to make my mornings slightly easier. I'm contemplating saving up for a Gaggia Classic Pro, but this older Gaggia Evolution Espresso showed up on Facebook marketplace for $30. The few sources I see online (I can't find a ton of info about it) say it's essentially a classic without a 3 way solenoid valve in a plastic shell, if that's the case does that mean I'd be able to do the 9 bar mod, a PID mod, and maybe even something like gaggimate? It would certainly save me money. Would it be worth it?

Thank you for your advice!

1kkvqvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1kkvqvr/betterme_lowcarb_intermittent_fasting/,BetterMe: Low-carb Intermittent Fasting,"Struggling with stubborn fat, low energy, or constant cravings? A growing number of people are turning to 

low-carb intermittent fasting (IF)—a combination that may supercharge fat loss without the misery of crash dieting.

Here’s what it’s all about—and how to make it work.

# 🔄 What Is Low-Carb Intermittent Fasting?

It combines two popular strategies:

* **Intermittent Fasting (IF):** Eating only within a specific window (e.g., 16:8 = fast for 16 hours, eat in 8).
* **Low-Carb Diet:** Keeping carbs below 50g/day to encourage fat-burning (aka ketosis).

Together, they help regulate insulin, reduce cravings, and boost your body’s ability to use fat for fuel.

# 🥑 What to Eat (During Your Eating Window)

Focus on **nutrient-dense, satiating foods**:

* **Proteins:** Eggs, chicken, beef, tofu
* **Healthy fats:** Avocados, nuts, olive oil
* **Low-carb veggies:** Spinach, broccoli, cauliflower
* **Drinks:** Water, herbal tea, black coffee, bone broth

Avoid:

* Refined carbs (white bread, pasta)
* Sugary snacks/drinks
* Processed foods
* High-starch veggies (potatoes, corn)

❔❔ What’s your go-to low-carb meal that keeps you full during fasting?

Hello everyone,

I’m a married man who once shared a great friendship with my wife, but sadly, that connection has faded. While I’m not looking to change my marital situation, I’d love to find an authentic, platonic friendship where we can both share our thoughts and feelings openly - without judgment. Whether it’s over coffee in a cozy cafe or a peaceful walk by the lake, I’d cherish the chance to connect meaningfully.  

A bit about me: I work in IT, come from an Indian background, and stay active and fit. People say I look younger than my age, and I’ve got a lighthearted sense of humor that keeps conversations flowing. I’m open to friends of all ages and walks of life.  

This summer, I don’t want to spend it alone and I believe no one should have to. If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out. Maybe we can start with something simple and see where it leads. Wishing you a wonderful day!

1kkvosr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1kkvosr/why_i_regret_joining_a_pmba/,Why I regret joining a PMBA,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.. this will be long, so thanks for bearing with me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Background:*

I'm 38 years old and have lived a long, winding life. I was never really interested in education growing up. I graduated with a 2.6 GPA and started working right away, making $40–45K for a couple of years before eventually progressing to my current salary of $75K.

For a long time, that felt like a lot. I never grew up around wealth, and although I daydreamed about living a ""rich life,"" I never seriously thought about how to get there. My mindset was always: work hard, stay loyal, and your company will take care of you. No need for an MBA or fancy degrees.

But things changed once I got married and had kids. My expenses started growing faster than my income, and I realized that just “working hard” wouldn’t cut it anymore. That’s when the MBA idea really started to take root.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Enlightenment:*

Initially, I just wanted to go to any program that would let me skip standardized tests. A friend who had completed an MBA from a no-name school told me rankings mattered. I scoffed.. why pay six figures when I could get the same degree for less?

Then I stumbled on this subreddit.

Reading through stories here, I realized I had to reframe my thinking. If I truly wanted to pivot into a more strategic, higher-paying role, I needed a school with solid recruiting and name recognition- not just a piece of paper.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Why I Chose a PMBA:*

Being frugal by nature (and necessity), I wasn’t comfortable taking out massive loans, especially with kids and a spouse. I had no undergrad debt, and I didn’t want to start now, particularly not for living expenses.

So, I targeted a top 25 PMBA program that offered the same on-campus recruiting (OCR) access as their full-time MBA. This way, I could keep earning an income, minimize debt, and still make the career switch I was aiming for.

Thankfully, I got in. It was a huge moment for me. My passion for education was reignited, and I’ve maintained a 3.6 GPA (a major improvement from my 2.6 undergrad). But… here’s why I still have regrets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Why I Regret Choosing PMBA:*

This past year has been brutal.

While internships aren’t required in a PMBA, I knew it was essential for me to make a meaningful pivot. That meant I had to recruit just like a full-time student, but without the flexibility. Between working a demanding job, raising kids, and managing MBA responsibilities, I was stretched to my limits.

I’d bring suits to work, do interviews or coffee chats during breaks, and change clothes in my car. I had to skip work for happy hours and recruiting events, even though I’d already used all my PTO for family or school-related obligations. Most school events were during work hours, and even with Zoom or Teams, it was hard to stay engaged when my job needed my attention.

It’s been exhausting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Final Thoughts:*

I don’t regret pursuing an MBA.. not at all. But I do wish I had understood how much more demanding the PMBA route would be for someone trying to pivot careers and juggle work and family at the same time.

I’m hopeful that this summer internship leads to a return offer (starting salary more than double!) and a new chapter for me and my family. To anyone else out there navigating a similar path- good luck. You're not alone, and it can be done.",10,1747064424.0,MBA,15,0.78,False

When I got it, I decided to use all the coffee grounds I already had before buying cafe bustelo, which has always been my favorite brand. 

I used up all the coffee I had, got cafe bustelo and it’s brewing a little differently? I’m assuming it’s because it’s finer than my other coffee grounds and maybe I’m putting too much in the moka pot? 

Normally what I do is get water almost boiling before putting it in the pot. When I put grounds in it, I’m not packing it in. I scoop with a tablespoon and try to evenly spread it. It’s full, but not packed. 

Put the top on it, put it on medium heat and wait. When it started brewing coffee, I either cut the heat and wait a few seconds and take it off or just take it off the heat completely. I’ve never had it sputter or spit, it’s just a steady flow of coffee. 

With cafe bustelo it’s like… a very slow trickle. With bubbles and some spitting going on. If I took it off the heat like I normally do, I think it’d stop brewing coffee all together. With it being so fine, I guess I’m putting more in it than I should? Can I leave a little room where the grounds go or will that screw something else up? 

My thought process is, if I am putting too much of the cafe bustelo, it’s finer and easier to clump up together, it will have less room to expand and water can’t get through to be brewed.  I could be wrong though. 

Even with the weird way it’s brewing, it tastes fine. 

But, I would like opinions. Has this happened to anyone else?

1kkvlx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1kkvlx3/how_often_are_your_llm_agents_doing_what_theyre/,How often are your LLM agents doing what they’re supposed to?,"Agents are multiple LLMs that talk to each other and sometimes make minor decisions. Each agent is allowed to either use a tool (e.g., search the web, read a file, make an API call to get the weather) or to choose from a menu of options based on the information it is given.

Chat assistants can only go so far, and many repetitive business tasks can be automated by giving LLMs some tools. Agents are here to fill that gap.

But it is much harder to get predictable and accurate performance out of complex LLM systems. When agents make decisions based on outcomes from each other, a single mistake cascades through, resulting in completely wrong outcomes. And every change you make introduces another chance at making the problem worse.

So with all this complexity, how do you actually know that your agents are doing their job? And how do you find out without spending months on debugging?

First, let’s talk about what LLMs actually are. They convert input text into output text. Sometimes the output text is an API call, sure, but fundamentally, there’s stochasticity involved. Or less technically speaking, randomness.

Example: I ask an LLM what coffee shop I should go to based on the given weather conditions. Most of the time, it will pick the closer one when there’s a thunderstorm, but once in a while it will randomly pick the one further away. Some bit of randomness is a fundamental aspect of LLMs. The creativity and the stochastic process are two sides of the same coin.

When evaluating the correctness of an LLM, you have to look at its behavior in the wild and analyze its outputs statistically. First, you need  to capture the inputs and outputs of your LLM and store them in a standardized way.

### You can then take one of three paths:

1. **Manual evaluation:** a human looks at a random sample of your LLM application’s behavior and labels each one as either “right” or “wrong.” It can take hours, weeks, or sometimes months to start seeing results.
2. **Code evaluation:** write code, for example as Python scripts, that essentially act as unit tests. This is useful for checking if the outputs conform to a certain format, for example.
3. **LLM-as-a-judge:** use a different larger and slower LLM, preferably from another provider (OpenAI vs Anthropic vs Google), to judge the correctness of your LLM’s outputs.

With agents, the human evaluation route has become exponentially tedious. In the coffee shop example, a human would have to read through pages of possible combinations of weather conditions and coffee shop options, and manually note their judgement about the agent’s choice. This is time consuming work, and the ROI simply isn’t there. Often, teams stop here.

### Scalability of LLM-as-a-judge saves the day

This is where the scalability of LLM-as-a-judge saves the day. Offloading this manual evaluation work frees up time to actually build and ship. At the same time, your team can still make improvements to the evaluations.

Andrew Ng puts it succinctly:

> *The development process thus comprises two iterative loops, which you might execute in parallel:*
> 
> 1. *Iterating on the system to make it perform better, as measured by a combination of automated evals and human judgment;*
> 2. *Iterating on the evals to make them correspond more closely to human judgment.*
>     
>     [Andrew Ng, The Batch newsletter, Issue 297]


An evaluation system that’s flexible enough to work with your unique set of agents is critical to building a system you can trust.

I have lunch with my colleagues etc, go out for coffee or dinner, it is so so fun, and I can't believe how lucky I am to have a life like this. I am literally living my dream. 

For the next few months I am planning on ""glowing up"" and doing more exercise, eating better, doing skincare so I can feel even better. I will also try to study more to become better at my job, study my boyfriend's language and try to use less social media. 

I'm excited for what's to come and I wish everyone could experience the happiness I feel!",3,1747063243.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

1kkv6gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1kkv6gf/dealing_with_grief_and_an_heds_flair_up_feeling/,"Dealing with grief and an hEDS flair up. Feeling raw, physically and mentally.","I’m having one of those days where life is being extremely unfair to me. I have hEDS and fibromyalgia. I’ve had a terrible flair up of allodynia up my back for the past week. At this point it feels like I took a baseball bat to my entire left side, back, and pit. It is unbearable to wear bras. I keep expecting to look in a mirror and see awful bruising but nope, my skins sitting pretty. Then I found out my grandfather died yesterday. It’s my first experience with grief (god bless my luck all my life). 

So this morning I woke up 30 mins late because I’ve been taking sleeping pills to navigate the pain of my back. Being late already had me overwhelmed. Cried trying to put on my bra from the pain. On my way to work the unbearable grief hits me. I called my boss and said there’s no way I could work. I can’t even see I’m crying so hard. She was very kind and told me to take the day off. I walk into the house crushed, and my husband gives me the biggest hug (I already hate hugs but whatever). I screamed from the pain. Now I’m in bed, sobbing from pain and grief, and have an ice pack on my back. Pain meds, heat, ice, tens machine. Nothing helps 

Im raw. Inside and out. Everything hurts. My husband just ordered me coffee and breakfast. I’m so thankful to have good people around me. 
 
My Step- Grandfather died on Sunday. He’s been in the hospital for a year now. He came in to have surgery for osteoporosis. The surgery went well, but the hospital and my grandma never put in the effort to get him into physical therapy. They focused more on giving him opioids instead of building him up to go home. My mom has been pressuring her mom to bring him home. She offered to pay to have a nurse come in, but my grandma declined. From bed rotting in the hospital for so long he picked up infections, which turned to sepsis. They put him in hospice Saturday, and he passed Sunday. 

I guess I’m just angry they didn’t do more. My extended family is horrible at discussing anything health or mental health related. They prefer to pray it away. My aunt on the other side had a stroke last year and decided to pray it away. She now has no control over half her body. My immediate family and I have spent years learning how to ask for help, but my extended family has no interest. My uncle and his family refused to see my grandfather or support my grandmother during this time. They disowned her during Covid because she “wasn’t careful” and got Covid. Their son “is immunocompromised” (he’s not he has autism…) and her “selfishness”  could’ve risked his life. My grandma is more mad at my family for leaving the south than her son’s family who is holding a petty grudge, and lives 15 mins away. 

I’m tired of loosing people due to stupidity and I’m tired of EDS. Please send me good vibes. I am not looking forward to the 4 hour flight down to the funeral with how my skin has been. ",1,1747063192.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1kkv3fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kkv3fy/does_hyted_ac120v_voltage_converter_deliver/,Does HYTED AC120V Voltage Converter Deliver Reliable Performance? Detailed Review Inside,"The HYTED AC120V and its 1600W Voltage Converter is something I’ve genuinely been getting a lot of use out of these days. Its promise to safely power American appliances overseas is a game-changer for anyone like me who loves to travel and work globally. On a surface level, it’s sleek and compact. However, peeling back the layers of functionality reveals the real perks, as well as a few areas for potential improvement.

**Design and Portability**  
True story—I almost lost this converter in my suitcase because it’s so compact. Measuring at just 6.4 x 3.5 x 2.3 inches and weighing 1.6 pounds, the size is perfect for a traveler who’s always on the go. It fits snugly into my travel bag without hogging space, leaving room for, you know, actual clothes. The black finish gives it a professional and sturdy appearance, which I personally appreciate. However, sometimes I wish there was a carrying case included, as keeping the device and its interchangeable plugs organized requires a bit of effort.

**Ease of Use and Compatibility**  
Plug, play, and relax—it’s seriously that simple with this device. Using the four included international adapters (Type C, G, I, and E/F), I was able to power my coffee grinder and curling iron in France, Israel, and even Australia without a single hiccup. The fact that this converter works across more than 160 countries makes it feel like a backstage pass to the world of voltage. However, make sure you double-check the wattage of your devices. Although it supports most appliances within the 0-1600 watt range, my friend tried using it with her heavy-duty microwave and... let’s just say the error indicator light wasn’t subtle.

**Grab [HYTED AC120V] at the best price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Safety Features**  
During extensive use, I’ve been reassured by the advanced safety mechanisms packed into this device. Between overheating, overloading, short circuiting, and even unfair power surges, my appliances have been completely protected. The fuseless design is also way more modern compared to those old systems where you’d need to replace fuses like you’re retrofitting a 90s Walkman. The auto-disconnect feature has been particularly useful—one press of a button later and I’m back in business without wasting time troubleshooting.

**Positives**  
- Compact and lightweight design makes it a traveler’s dream.  
- Compatible with over 160 countries, covering nearly every global destination.  
- Multiple built-in safety features ensure device and appliance reliability.  

**Downsides**  
- No dedicated carrying case, so the adapters can get messy in a bag.  
- Limited to appliances within the wattage range, so heavy-duty equipment isn’t supported.  
- On occasion, the auto-restart feature required a second manual reset.  

**Target User Base**  
If you’re someone who frequently travels overseas, whether for leisure or business, this voltage converter will feel like a lifesaver. From hair straighteners to CPAP machines, I could use every appliance I relied on back home seamlessly. On the other hand, it probably isn’t the best investment for someone with predominantly high-wattage appliances or those who rarely leave their home country.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other voltage converters I’ve tried, this one stands out thanks to its pure sine wave conversion capabilities. For example, with cheaper or no-name alternatives, I’ve noticed inconsistent voltage delivery that led to fried fuses and one too many tears shed over dead coffee makers. The HYTED device feels much more dependable for maintaining appliance longevity. However, other universal travel adapters like those from BESTEK sometimes include USB ports, which this particular model lacks. That aspect might sway people who need to charge multiple devices simultaneously without carrying extra gear.

**Value for Money**  
Looking at how many features this 1600W Voltage Converter packs into its neat little frame, it’s undeniably a solid bang for the buck. While I can’t articulate exact pricing because it varies with discounts and holidays, comparing the value it offers to its competitors makes it a worthwhile investment. The inclusion of a two-year warranty only adds to the product's appeal. From experience, knowing I have that extra safety net has been a comfort. This felt less like spending and more like smartly investing in convenience and peace of mind.

1kkv3a6,https://i.redd.it/qmdt4rh6bd0f1.jpeg,DIY gravel in backyard - help pls,"Good morning- I have an unused corner of my backyard that I want to put my garden bench in.   I’d love a zen little spot to have my morning coffee.   Is there anything I need to know before putting down pea gravel or small rocks or something in that area or do I just have at it?    

Or if pea gravel or rocks is a bad idea, should I just drop some patio slabs to make “stepping stones” leading to the bench?     

Plan to plant on either side of the bench and just have the pea gravel or stones as a “path” to the bench if that makes sense.

Any and all tips appreciated- don’t have much money for this so trying to do on my own.   Thank you!!!!

I’d just appreciate input on the logic and emotional dynamics of the situation.

I’m asking for outside perspective because I can’t tell if I’m overreacting, underreacting, or just not seeing things clearly. I really care about this person, and I’m trying to be as honest with myself as possible.

I’m in my mid-twenties, recently gave my life to God, and have been working hard to stay sober and rebuild after a lot of personal and emotional struggles. I run my own business, which means I create my own schedule. It also requires a ton of time, discipline, and mental strength. Between healing, work, and staying accountable to myself, I’ve made space to be in a relationship again after years of being closed off.

I’m currently dating someone I really connect with. She’s smart, in therapy, studying to become a therapist, and we see each other as emotional and intellectual equals. She told me very early on that she practices ethical non-monogamy. That’s not something I had experience with, but I was open to hearing her out. We agreed to take it slow and focus on building trust between each other before exploring anything beyond the two of us.

A few weeks into seeing each other, she invited me to one of her themed parties. This was the first party I was invited to and the first time I would be meeting her friends or being around her in a social setting like that. A few days before the party, she told me there’s a girl she kisses at basically every one of these parties but said she didn’t want to do that anymore out of fairness to me. I appreciated the honesty.

At the party, she got drunk and asked me, while I was sober and clearly feeling out of place, if she could kiss that same girl. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I said something like, “You’re going to do what you want.” Later on, while we were standing together, that girl started talking loudly about it right in front of us. She said she thought my girlfriend wouldn’t kiss her because she had a boyfriend, but that it happened anyway and now she’s questioning her sexuality. It felt like it was being rubbed in my face.

I talked to my girlfriend after and told her I didn’t feel like I truly consented. For me, when alcohol is involved, especially if only one person is sober, consent gets blurry. I’ve told her before that I wouldn’t feel comfortable being physical with her if she was drunk and I was sober. Not because I don’t trust her, but because of what alcohol represents to me and how much I’ve lost to it.

That moment shook me. We did have a split afterward. It wasn’t clearly defined, but we both pulled away. It didn’t take long for us to repair things. Since then, we’ve been solid. We’ve felt more aligned and connected, spending time together and supporting each other.

Then the other day, I overheard her tell a friend that she was getting coffee with a guy from salsa class. I had gone to that class with her once, and I met the guy there. The next week, she went without me. Now, a couple weeks later, she’s getting coffee with him. I hadn’t heard anything about it until I overheard it in conversation.

I brought it up calmly and asked why she hadn’t mentioned it. She said it didn’t even cross her mind because it felt platonic. She also said she asked a friend whether it seemed platonic, and they agreed. I said that if it wasn’t a big deal, why not just mention it? She said she would have told me afterward if it went well.

That didn’t sit right with me. If someone is going to be in her life regularly, wouldn’t I eventually meet them? I didn’t expect her to ask for permission. I don’t think she should need to. I just think it would have felt a lot better if she had said something beforehand.

She has told me that my insecurity frustrates her. I get that. I’m an overthinker and I have deep rooted insecurities from past trauma. I am working through them, but that takes time. I’m also very self-aware, and she would agree with that. I know this tension probably comes more from me than from her, and I’m not trying to paint myself as a victim. I just want to understand what’s fair to expect from someone when trust is still being built.

We agree on almost everything. The one area we keep clashing is how we hold each other accountable when it comes to attention or interest from other people. For example, I’ve said I don’t think it’s fair to hook up with someone who has a crush on you if you have no intention of taking it further. I’ve been that person on both sides. I think it creates confusion and hurt. She sees it differently.

My biggest fear is being left for someone else. The whole point (or so I think) of building trust, especially in a relationship where openness is possible, is to reduce that fear. Do I just keep trusting in the process although it feels like that fear is growing? Are we just hurting by forcing something?

I really like this girl. I want this to work. I just don’t know if my reaction is valid, or if I’m being ruled by old wounds.

Am I overreacting?

Rookie here. I've been using my Timemore Chestnut C2S for about a month now and after I first disassembled it to clean the insides, I noticed that the grind size is kinda inconsistent (important: the grind size may've been the attention to it).

Not sure if this is visible on the attached photos, but every time there are some tiny particles (coffee dust, and it's usually a lot of it), bigger particles, and the biggest particles (which I assume are what I'm trying to achieve xd).

Could you please let me know if this is expected or if something does not work properly? Can I do anything about it? Please share your thought/experience.

&nbsp;

I'm sick of this. Lack of sleep is affecting my concentration and my mood, not in a dangerous way like I will fall asleep at the wheel, but enough to affect stuff I care about. My problem isn't falling asleep but staying asleep. I can consistently go to my bed and fall asleep, but every night without fail I wake up after about ~2-4 hours. I fall back asleep and wake up on the morning in another ~2-4 hours unrested. 

&nbsp;

I got two sleep studies where the first one was negative and the second one showed mild sleep apnea. I try to wear my CPAP every night, but it doesn't help with the awakenings and my app shows that my apneic events per hour are very low (consistently less than once per hour). To be completely honest, I feel like this sleep apnea thing is a load of crap and treating it doesn't seem to help at all. My doctor refuses to prescribe any medication to help because they think it will either be ineffective for my problems or worsen the sleep apnea.

&nbsp;

I'm not healthy - I'm a male, will be 40 in a couple of years. I eat out all the time and I believe I am overweight for my height, I'm 170 lbs but only 5'6'' and I never exercise. I drink 1 cup of coffee every morning because I'm so tired and I need to focus when I work (I do computer stuff). I tried going for about a 2-4 weeks or so with exercise playing video games like Stepmania, Beat Saber, and Ring Fit (my problem is I get bored/irritated with traditional exercise like running, weights, playing sports, etc.) and completely cutting out coffee but it did nothing, so afterwards I just went back to my old bad habits. I would say I'm a mildly anxious person, but I don't wake up in the middle of the night with racing thoughts of worrying about everything or whatever.

&nbsp;

What do I do here? Do I just need to get healthy fast? I just feel so frustrated and feel like I need any crutch, maybe a medication or something to get me on track. I care a lot about my hobbies in particular and they are impossible to do well without good rest. Are there any exercise gamers who enjoy a game they can recommend?",2,1747062647.0,sleep,4,1.0,False

1kkuvg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkuvg2/aitah_for_walking_away_from_handsome_version_of/,"AITAH for walking away from “handsome” version of my best friend after our trip to Korea, where I realized I was basically his unpaid caretaker?","I’m sad and trying to process what happened — this is long, but I really need outside perspective.

I (30F) went on a 5-day trip to Busan with someone I’ve considered one of my closest friends (30M) for nearly 10 years. He used to be thoughtful, funny, and kind. I genuinely felt safe with him. But ever since he started getting plastic surgery and more compliments on his appearance, I’ve noticed him becoming more self-absorbed, defensive, and superficial.

Two weeks before the trip, I found out from a mutual friend (not him) that he had scheduled laser eye surgery while we were there. When I brought it up, he said:

“Oh yeah, I meant to tell you during the trip.”

I was upset — not about the surgery itself, but about the fact that he didn’t think I even needed to know. I had taken time off from two jobs for this trip. I told him: if I’m adjusting my vacation to support you, at least cover the hotel and meals for that day. Not for the money — but to acknowledge that this wasn’t okay.
He agreed.
He bought me one meal — pizza and fried chicken, both foods he liked. I barely ate. Then he told people he had “bought me a lot,” as if I was freeloading.
And I still paid for the accommodation and the rest of the meals.

Honestly? I was WAY cheaper than any actual caregiver.
And if he had told me upfront that this was going to be his “laser surgery trip,” I wouldn’t have gone. This was my vacation too. I would’ve rather traveled alone than be someone’s free support system under false pretenses.

The rest of the trip, I basically became his unpaid photographer. I took over 600 photos of him. He rushed through every stop, never spent more than 10 minutes anywhere. When I tried to sit at the beach and take in the view, he said:

“You’re just sitting there seeing the view? That’s so weird. That’s a waste of vacation.”
Meanwhile, he was glued to hookup apps all day. During meals. While walking. Even when I was talking.
He also had to pee every hour, and made fun of me for “having a big bladder” like it was hilarious. (Mocking people has become his favorite form of humor.)

And the small things kept piling up:
	•	The “meal” he paid for? I had 3 slices of pizza and a few pieces of chicken. That’s it.
	•	He yelled at his bank for 20 minutes at restaurant and refused my help. It ruined the afternoon.
	•	He overcharged me 1,000 won for coffee, saying we should pay together for a cheaper set — then logged it as more in our split app. Not about the amount — it’s the dishonesty.
	•	He rushed ahead to buses to grab the window seat every time. Never asked if I was okay.
	•	He agreed to take taxis to save time between sites — we didn’t take a single one. Spent hours on public transport and still rushed everything.
	•	He rejected a nice paper bag I offered him for his overweight luggage with, “I don’t want that.” Then later came back to ask for it because he had no other option.
	•	He took over the hotel vanity and sink, left food waste in it, and claimed he “left me space” — in corners he didn’t want to use.
	•	He picked his side of the bed without asking, even though in every past group trip we always asked.
	•	He walked away at the airport check-in when staff asked us to wait to confirm our luggage passed through. Turns out he went to use the VIP lounge (a benefit included with our hotel) — which he never mentioned to me.

After the trip, he told people it was his “laser trip.”
That was the final blow.

This wasn’t a shared vacation.
It was a surgery trip disguised as a getaway with a friend.

And to be clear — this isn’t the first time he’s done selfish stuff. It’s just that in the past, we always traveled with others. There were buffers. Distractions. This was the first time it was just the two of us. And now that I saw it clearly… I can’t unsee it.

During the trip, I kept asking myself: Am I being too sensitive? Should I just go easy on him because we’re friends?
But deep down, I know I was avoiding conflict — because he’s always impatient and irrational when confronted. Fighting with him never works. He just guilt trips me or spins things to make himself the victim.
And I’m honestly just tired of it.

I’ve made it clear over the years what I like, what I don’t like, what makes me feel respected.
He chooses to ignore all of it.

So I’m asking:

Hello, as an introduction I have transcribed an Instagram reel below to sums up how I feel.

""Sorry if I love you too much or seem too obsessed. I'm just trying to give you the love I never got.  If I come on too strong or seem overwhelming,  it's not because I want to suffocate you. It's because I want to make sure you know how special you are to me. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I experienced, and sometimes I struggle to find balance. I just want to give you everything I wish I had. I love that's unconditional, strong, and always present. So if I ever seem too much, it's only because I'm trying to fill the voids in both our hearts with something real. I hope you can understand. I know I may not be perfect, but my heart is genuine,and all I want is to make you feel cherished in ways I never knew. If I come on strong, it's because I believe you deserve the kind of love that goes beyond limits"".

""Never break up when you start losing feelings because that's when real love starts. You can't just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships are not great because they have no problems. They're great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work. So when you're in a serious relationship, you'll have your ups and downs. But talking things over is a better solution than throwing it all away. Because the couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger"".



About me

- Height: 6'0

- Alcohol: Very rarely as in once in a few months and I have never gotten drunk as the moment I feel dizzy, I counteract the effects with apple juice.

- Hair colour: Black

- Skin colour: naturally tanned skin

- Most people describe me as cute

- Always clean shaven

- I have no siblings 

- No tattoos or piercings

- Weight: varies between 70kg (150lb) to 75kg (165lb) depending on how much I eat and active I am. 

- Work out and eat healthy although from time to time, indulge myself with a pie, ice cream ot donut. 

- Finances: I manually keep track of my finances as I enjoy using cash wherever it is accepted. I like to physically feel money.

- Child-free life: never had an interest in having kids. I still remember my age when I made this life long decision, I was 17 at the time.

- Independence: I live alone in a foreign country (this is the second coubtry I am working temporarily with no family. Over the years I have learned to cry alone as I had no one to call and had to force myself to recover from severe depression. Including one very painful break up. I have also learned to take care of myself when I had accidents.

- Anger: I cannot get angry. If I do, I suffer with a headache and overtime my body has learned to associate anger with pain, so instead of gettin[?p0g angry, I get frustrated. To cope with my frustration, I go for a walk, look at the stars or something in the distant like a mountain, cityscape or the Ocean. Taking deep breaths also helps.

When I love someone, I put my partner first where I work out and try to be the best version of myself for my partner. This also goes for the way I dress to everything. 

Exploration of new interest: I take an interest in my partners hobbies, movies, music, food and  what she likes in order to deepen the connection and bond. 

Strong desire to be honest: when I am with a partner I have a strong desire to be transparent and I just feel comfortable being able to speak without thinking twice. 

Social isolation: I only feel a real social connection with a partner. I often feel lonely or withdrawn in social activities as I know that a partner is for life while other people are only their for the moment.

Panic mode: if my partner gets mad at me and starts scolding me I go into a panic mode where I become nervous, scared and my breathing becomes heavy. 

This is because my self-worth and validation becomes dependent on my partner and I am afraid to dissapoint her.


What do I expect from a partner?

Someone who cares in the sense will give me a hug or hold my hand when I need it the most and will be honest with me.

A partner who wants to create memories together, it could be something simple as watching the sunset and just eating a mal together.

I am mentally unable to feel attracted to more than one person due to Limerence which makes me extremely loyal and committed to one person.

Just knowing that I am special to my partner is enough to make happy.



Love Language: The way I express love towards a partner is through;

- Quality time where I give my partner her undivided attention, making memories together, shared activities and doing things together.

Acts of service: I believe that actions speak lounder than words and I have always dreamed of being the one who;
- does all the house chores so that you can relax
- cooking for you
- running an errand
- being helpful in anyway I can
- hold an umbrella over your head
- carry your bag
- serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask


Physical touch: Never experienced this. 
- Hug: Never been hugged by a women, but I long for it so much and would love to have a partner I can hug back.
- Kiss: I have kissed one person I love once loved on the cheek but never gotten a kiss back.
- Holding hands: never held hands, but want to
- Cuddling: Never experienced it, but I guess it must be nice.

Words of Affirmation: expressing affection through spoken or written words, such as compliments, encouragement, and expressions of love (""I love you"").

Photography: Photography is the best way to create a memory I would love to take photographs together and put them in physical photo album. 

Why am I still single? I have something called Limerence which is an obsessive romantic attraction to another person, which only happens if I genuinely 

Past relationships: One and it was a very toxic relationship where I was treated more like a Dog than a partner which ended in May, 2024. Due to Limerence which I didn't know I had at the time, I was unable to just break away from the toxic relationship. 


Things that I don't care about in a partner;

- Hair Color 
- Attitude 
- Career
- Height 
- Tattoos or birth marks you have
- Piercings 
- Race
- Religion 
- Your past
- Cooking: I can cook for you if you don't know how how to cook.
- Alcohol: get drunk if you want to, but if you start acting crazy I will just take you home.


Preferred Partner 

Skin colour: White or Tan

Age range: 24 to 34 

Someone who cares about her long term health. I mean as the saying goes ""health is wealth"".

Values Loyalty and will be transparent and honest with me just as I will be honest and transparent with you.

No smoking or Vaping. I hate the smell of nicotine and the the smoke released from exhaling vapes. Also, I saw my Grandpa suffer in hospital and die as result of a lifetime of smoking.

My interest 

- 35mm Film Photography: Imagine processing film together. 

- Analogue Navigation: Yes, even in 2025 I use a Lensatic compass and map for navigation outside the city, where often times, this ancient technology had proven itself to be more reliable and accurate compared to Google maps.  Believe me, if you get lost in a forest, desert or in the Ocean I am the guy you need by your side.

- Journaling: Lamy Safari,  Parker Jotter or Stencil Pencil 

- Typewriter: I own a Typewriter in my home country and love typing notes or documents on it. It is especially useful for typing out shopping list. 

- Old off-road vehicles: I prefer older vehicles from the 1970's and 80's due to the durability, reliability and such as the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Land Cruiser or a 1970's Land Rover Defender. Personally, due to my job I travel in Bentley, BMW's, Cadillac's, Lamborghini's, Nissan's, Toyota's, Mercedes. 

Watching birds and other animals through my binoculars or photographing them using my 200-500mm lens.


Send me a message and lets get to know each other better.

1kkumei,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kkumei/am_i_overreacting_for_grieving_the_loss_of_my/,Am I overreacting for grieving the loss of my best friend after he became “hot” and shallow during our trip to Korea?,"I (30F) recently went on a 5-day trip to Busan with someone I’ve considered one of my closest friends (30M) for almost 10 years. He used to be warm, quirky, and thoughtful — someone I felt really safe and seen with. But ever since he started getting plastic surgery and receiving compliments, things have been shifting. Slowly at first, but this trip… was a full reveal.

Before the trip, I found out from someone else (not him) that he had scheduled laser eye surgery during our vacation. When I confronted him, he said:

“Oh yeah, I meant to tell you during the trip.”
I had taken leave from two jobs to go with him. And he didn’t think I needed to know?

I wasn’t upset about the surgery itself -I just asked that, since I’d be adjusting my plans to help him recover, he could at least cover that day’s hotel and meals. Not for the money — just to recognize that I was being put in a position I didn’t ask for. He agreed.
He bought me a meal and fried chicken he liked. I barely ate -3 slices of pizza, a few pieces of chicken. And somehow, he went around telling people he “bought me a lot.”

Meanwhile, he could see perfectly fine after the surgery, and honestly didn’t even need a caregiver.
And in the end? I still paid for the hotel and meals. I mean… I was way cheaper than a professional nurse. If he had told me upfront this was a “laser surgery trip,” I wouldn’t have joined. It was my vacation too. I would’ve rather traveled solo than be dragged into someone else’s recovery I never agreed to.

The rest of the trip? I basically became his personal photographer. I took over 600 photos of him. He rushed through every stop, never stayed longer than 10 minutes. When I sat quietly at the beach to enjoy the view, he said:

“You’re just sitting there seeing the view? That’s so weird. That’s a waste of vacation.”
Meanwhile, he was glued to his hookup apps. Mid-meal. Mid-walk. Mid-conversation. He also needed to pee every hour and mocked me for “having a big bladder” -which he thought was hilarious. (It wasn’t. Mocking people has become his go-to personality lately.)

The small things that kept piling up:
	•	The meal he claimed he bought for me? Was really for him. I ate just a little, and he made it sound like he spoiled me.
	•	He argued with his bank for 20+ minutes yelling, smacking the table at restaurant ruining our afternoon. He refused my help even though I tried to calmly help him communicate with the bank.
	•	He overcharged me 1,000 won for coffee after saying we should pay together since it made his set cheaper. Then he logged it as 1,000 won more in our split app. It’s not about the amount. It’s that he wasn’t honest and assumed I wouldn’t notice.
	•	He rushed to buses first to grab the window seat (his preference) every time. Never asked if I was okay being stuck on the aisle or standing.
	•	We agreed to take taxis to save time between sites. We didn’t take a single one. Spent most of the time on public transport, and still rushed everything.
	•	I offered him a nice paper bag from a clothing store to help with his overweight luggage (I had told him my spare luggage was for gifts for my mom). He rejected it with:
“I don’t want that.”
Then came back later and asked for it when nothing else worked-no apology.

	•	He took over the hotel vanity and sink, scattered his stuff everywhere, and claimed he “left me space” -meaning the most inconvenient corner he didn’t want to use.
	•	He picked his side of the bed without asking-which in all our past group trips, someone always asked first.
	•	At airport check-in, staff asked us to wait to confirm our luggage had cleared the belt. He rushed off without a word.
Turns out he went to use the VIP lounge-which was a benefit tied to our hotel. He never told me we had access to it. Didn’t think I needed to know, apparently.

Stuff like these irritates me. 

And after the trip?
He told me-and others-that this was his “laser trip.”
That was the final blow.

This wasn’t a shared vacation.
This was a personal surgery trip disguised as a fun getaway with a friend.

And honestly, these weren’t isolated incidents. Looking back, he’s always done small selfish things-but we used to travel in groups. There were buffers. Distractions. This was the first time it was just the two of us. No filters. No excuses. And now… I can’t unsee it.

I kept asking myself-before, during, and after the trip-am I being too sensitive? Should I let this go because we’re friends?
But I realized I wasn’t being honest with myself. I kept letting things slide because I told myself this was a friendship trip, and I should go easy on him.
And deep down, I was avoiding a fight — because he’s always impatient, defensive, and irrational. Fighting with him never helps. He just beautifies his behavior, flips it on me, and tries to guilt trip me for calling him out.
And honestly? I’m sick and tired of that.

I’ve made it clear over the years what I like, what I don’t like, what I need.
He’s just chosen to ignore it.

So I’m asking:

Has this friendship been one-sided all along?
Am I only now realizing it because I finally had space to feel it?
Am I overreacting for walking away from someone who used to be my closest friend-but clearly doesn’t see me anymore?

And believe me-I’ve tried distancing myself after the trip.
But it’s not working.
Now that I’m away from him, I notice these little things even more.
It’s like once I saw it clearly, I couldn’t go back to pretending it wasn’t there.

Thanks again if you made it this far. I needed to write it out.",3,1747061837.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False
1kkumbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kkumbd/taking_advantage_of_food_poisoning_to_go_decaf/,Taking advantage of food poisoning to go Decaf,"5 days ago I got horrible food poisoning and couldn't keep any liquids or food down for over 24hrs. When I finally could start drinking and eating again, I had a splitting migraine, body aches and brain fog. I had chalked it up as post-food poisoning symptoms but on Day 3 when I was craving an energy drink, which seemed extremely unappetizing, I realized it was actually because of caffeine withdrawals. I have had 400-550mg of caffeine everyday for over 4 years (2 energy drinks, and a coffee/tea per day). 

I have never thought caffeine was bad or that I was addicted. It was just apart of my life. I have to wake up at 4:50 am every day for work so I just assumed I needed my morning energy drink/coffee and then another later in the afternoon. These past 5 days have been pretty eye opening. To be this fcked up over caffeine makes me view it entirely different. This is not normal. This is a stimulant/drug. 

I am finally getting past the brain fog, which I had never truly experienced before. It is really weird how you actually think slower. I have been pretty depressed and low energy since I quit but can tell the winds are changing. The thing is, if I had found this sub a week ago I would be laughing at all of you, calling you dramatic, etc. and I think the majority of people would as well. They have no idea.

I’m feeling really hurt and angry. My husband and I come from different countries, and for our wedding, my family took on everything—they paid for it all, planned every detail, and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. They even paid for my husband’s parents and siblings—covering their hotels, hair, nails, meals, and even took them traveling across the country. Every little thing was handled and paid for by my family without hesitation.

His family isn’t wealthy, and I understand that. But financial limitations don’t excuse a constant pattern of expecting things and never reciprocating—even in small, thoughtful ways.

Now that we’re living in my husband’s country, I’m seeing the same behavior again. His sister came to stay with us for a few days while she had some work in our city. As a gift, because we hadn’t seen each other since the wedding, I gave her a gold ring. But when we went out together, she made us pay for our share—about 30 euros—and kept track of it. That moment really hit me. It wasn’t about the money; it was about the principle, the attitude.

I’ve always been generous without thinking twice—paying for things like groceries, meals, or coffee without ever expecting anything back. But when it comes to me, it’s like that kindness is never returned. It’s exhausting to be surrounded by people who don’t show even a small gesture of care or consideration.

I’m not angry about the euros—I’m angry about the lack of thoughtfulness. The lack of basic decency and appreciation. It’s hard to keep giving when it feels like nothing ever comes back. 

What hurts the most is that after these kinds of situations, I end up in a terrible mood—and even though my husband didn’t directly do anything wrong, he becomes the one who has to deal with my frustration. I don’t want to take it out on him, but I can’t help feeling resentful and misunderstood. Now we’re supposed to go back to my country soon, and he wants to visit his family for as long as possible. But honestly? I dread being around them. They never help, they never give back, and it just drains me. I’m tired of the emotional toll it takes. I don’t know how to keep doing this. I want to find a way to cope—how to shift my perspective without losing myself or becoming bitter. 

The funny thing is, his sister is totally fine coming to my parents’ hotel, not paying for a single thing, enjoying everything, and using it as a way to save money—but still somehow finds a reason to make me pay for a coffee. It’s not even about the money. It’s the attitude. The entitlement. The complete lack of awareness or gratitude. It’s exhausting.

I live in a house of 5. Two flatmates have partners and are rarely home. The remaining three of us are around more often - one of them’s been home a lot recently after a falling out, and drinks coffee around 4x a day, using this kettle often. Another uses the kettle regularly for hot water bottles. Basically, it’s a well-used kettle - and that’s why I left it in the kitchen: to be shared.

It’s a Breville kettle I bought as a set with a toaster for £85 in 2nd year. As silly as it may sound, this was my first big purchase coming out of student halls and theyre a pretty set, and it’s lasted me up to now (I’m in year 4 of a 5-year course). The toaster is also mine but communal - it constantly gets gross because no one cleans under it. Back in January, I actually messaged the group (of the ones who are actually home - not including the ones with boyfriends and aren't home) and asked everyone to be a bit more considerate with my appliances because I wanted them to last me through uni. They agreed.

Now fast forward to yesterday. The electric kept cutting off. Plug sockets weren’t working, lights kept going off, and we were constantly flipping the fuse box (not knowing why). I rang the letting agency who passed us on to someone, and we were trying to figure out what was causing it. By the evening, the tripping stopped - and one flatmate said that it’s the kettle. She said they tested it, and it set off the fuse.

I was really confused and mentioned that it worked fine the day before, and I haven’t used it in over a month — I meal prep in advance and only use the kitchen to microwave food. I spend 8am–6pm most days in the library (I study dentistry). I don’t drink tea or coffee and haven’t used hot water bottles lately either.

She said she’d check it again the next day, but everyone needed internet access so we weren’t switching anything back on yet. I was a bit thrown, because I bought this kettle, shared it with everyone, and now suddenly it’s broken?

I got a private imessage from the girl who said it was broken last night confirming that it set off the fuse. Photo is attached - you can see im upset through this so I emailed the letting agency and they sent over a PAT testing certificate dated 10 days ago - the kettle was down as passing it. I sent this certificicate into the group chat from a flatmate saying it happens and she'd bring hers down \[photo attached\].” Nothing else. No, yeah sorry its broken.. do you want us to chip in?? no “sorry that happened” - just a casual replacement suggestion. Another flatmate messaged me privately saying kettles just stop working sometimes and it’s no one’s fault.

I tried to calmly say that this wasn’t about just a kettle. I haven’t used it in weeks, I paid for it, I shared it, and now I’m expected to just take the hit - no questions asked - while other people have been using it constantly. I even said in January that I wanted my stuff looked after. I just wanted someone to offer to contribute. I would have immediately, if it were theirs. With my white friends I pay them back to the dot because I know they like splitting bills etc.

Instead I got these responses:

[me tweaking out lol ](https://preview.redd.it/zs5t88xx8d0f1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e036f3c3a0bb7a4b45bb95cb4ee134c83bafb32)

It just rubbed me the wrong way. I’m not being petty. I’m just particular about my stuff. They know that. I’ve never been a nightmare flatmate - I let them leave dishes for two weeks, I clean up after myself (and them more than I should), and I barely use the kitchen right now.

And I know they’re talking about me  - timestamps show 2 of them were typing for ages after reading my messages and find my shows three of them are home together. These are the same girls who, for birthdays, I bought gifts for - but for mine, one of them wished me happy birthday on the wrong date and the others just shared a multi-pack of lip oil that cost £4. They also buy multipacks of toilet paper and ask for £3.80 per person on the dot. Meanwhile I just buy it and don't say anything.

I guess I’m realising that i am surrounded by people who just don’t think the way I do. I’d rather cover someone and hope they get it next time. I just want to be around people who treat me the way I treat them. I know this kettle situation won’t matter in two years, but right now, it feels shit. Like I’m asking for too much just to be respected. And now I’m being made to feel like I’m dramatic.

Am I overreacting?  Be brutally honest because this situation tweaked me out majorly today 😭

What I’m looking for: 
- someone who is emotionally available, compassionate and empathetic, open to growth and communication. I’m a believer that you have to be comfortable and secure with yourself and your own life, and that’s when your partner can add to your life and amplify the joy, without causing toxic codependent issues. 
- Self sufficient and stable. Not saying I’m not willing to support you, in fact as a future psychologist I’m very happy to be there for you if you need me, but I also think I thrive best in a healthy level of independence/ self sufficiency esp w emotional codependence with my future partner. I’m currently under therapy and have grown a lot emotionally. Emotional maturity and the ability to regulate emotions on your own is very important to me. 
- Common interests are appreciated, but not a must, as long as you have an open and curious mind and heart! 
- Personality/ character >>> looks/ gender etc (I’m probably leaning more demi/ pan lol) 
- Neurodivergence friendly
- In similar age range as me
- Non smoker. I don’t mind if you drink, in fact I enjoy sophisticated drinking eg checking out signature cocktails, wine & whisky tasting too, but I’m not comfortable with alcoholics/ substance users
- I am going all over the place in the world atm, and I have not yet solidified where I would be eventually settling down, so a degree of comfort with LDR is also appreciated
- Bonus if you speak German- i’d would like language practice buddies! I can offer Cantonese/ Mandarin help in return lol 

A little bit about me: 
I’m studying psychology and music in an Ivy League school in the US.  I’m currently learning German, and i speak Cantonese, Mandarin, English. 

I consider my greatest strengths my creativity, spontaneity and passion. I see an expressive arts therapist, and I’d want to be one someday! The sort of arts I dabble with: i write (poems, stories, prose, etc), I write music, I can growl (I love metal lol), I play the piano and the organ (and in turn do literary writing about them; or write German metal that features the organ). I draw and paint (digital, and also snowman building XD). And I make coffee art (but can’t drink coffee, and make cocktails and am into wine tasting. My hamsters (they are not here anymore :( but there are pics in my profile) & my plushies are very important to me, and form a lot of my creative work

Music taste: symphonic/ folk/ power metal (esp women fronted ones like Delain, Xandria, Arch enemy, Epica, Eluveitie, Lacuna Coil), some deathcore stuff like Lorna Shore, German metal (Equilibrium, Nachtblut, LotL, Erdling) if you like Chthonic we really need to talk! 
& classical music & canto pop/ rock 

I used to be a powerlifter (have a stereotypical powerlifter bod aka short & thick. I have old pics my profile, happy to send you new pics after we talk) and do Thai boxing, but injuries and college got in the way. I do yoga, meditate, I also enjoy being in the nature 

Personality wise, I’m the kind of person who’d delve deep into big deep questions of life, but on the other hand is also an absolute goofy kid at heart lol (I have SO MUCH plushie lore & non canonical stories about them).

But I figured I should start by letting the Aiden do what it's best at, so I've so far been sticking with light-medium roasts and the standard pour-over settings, and I've been happy with the results for connoisseur-style sipping. Expanding one's palate is always good!

Eventually though, I'm going to want to have the option to make the kind of pot that can power me through a workday: something darker and stronger, something that can stand up to milk and won't suffer too much if it cools off a bit at my desk. In other words, a classic pot of (good!) drip coffee.

Has anyone found a combination of profile, grind and bean that can produce something in that neighborhood?

Bean-wise, for this kind of brew I'd usually use a blend of Indonesian and Guatemalan, or Kona if I'm feeling fancy -- but open to exploration, since I can imagine the Aiden might require a different approach.",1,1747061354.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

The discovery of the quantum field has made modern science a mystery. There are several things that make quantum mechanics so challenging to modern physics and even our perception of reality.

**Challenge 1: Superposition**
Imagine that you have a friend who tells you he is going to chill either in the forest or at the beach, both at spots that you know of. You wander around at both places, but find traces of your friend's glasses, his sunscreen, etc, leaving you baffled, as he can't have been in two places at the same time.

Like any reasonable person would, the next time, you sneak into his car and follow him, but nothing strange occurs.

This is how superposition works. Particles can be traced to have been in multiple states flickering in between until you observe them and they switch to only one state. It has been giving scientists a headache for over a century now.

**Challenge 2: Entanglement**
Entanglement, I don't understand that well yet. But from my understanding, it goes something like this:

Imagine that you have 2 coins, and you flip only one of them, because you know that, no matter if the one coin will be heads or tails, the other coin will always result in the opposite.

Now the spooky part is this: it shouldn't be this way. It shows that these particles are, invisibly, entangled within each other, even at a distance which makes it even stranger. It challenges science's understanding of what distance even is, whether it exists at all.

**My theory**
Now you can probably already that I am not a physicist let alone a scientist all together. But here is my theory, it is based on thin air and one too many coffee's.

**Slice Of A Cube**
As you could know, a square is a two-dimensional object. It has no depth, but if we stack a bunch of squares on top of each other, it forms a three-dimensional shape that some might call a cube (<:0!).

You can probably already tell where I'm going with this: the observable universe is only a slice of the cube that makes up the entire reality. It's a well-known theory, but I am building upon it with this speculative work:

**Reality Is A Slice Of A Shape**
The best way I can put my theory is this. Imagine if you have an apple, and you can either eat it or not eat it.

My theory is thus, given what we have discussed, that these two scenario's don't branch out into multiple realities like the multiple-world theory persists on being true. My belief, is that both of these scenario's are more like branches of the same tree, they are part of the same overlapping shape that makes up reality as we know it.

**There is a catch**
This doesn't mean that parallel universes exist, in the contrary, I don't believe in such. I believe that the other versions of us freeze in time, or worse, cease to exist all together.

My speculative work only aims to propose this idea: we know multiple states exist within this reality. We know we can't access them because they vanish when we observe them. It's comparable to seeing in both eyes until you decide to shut one.

**My Greatest Conclusion**
The universe could be like a prism of diffracting realities that are all intertwined, meaning that we are only seeing a reflection of what is actually occurring, which means, that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Furthermore, I believe God exists. Coffee rush is over, this is it for now!

1kkue4e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkue4e,Proven: I Can Control My Actions,"My why: I’ve done on and off dieting and exercise for many years but haven’t reached my goals because I haven’t been consistent enough. I’m tired of feeling like I’m always dieting and fighting my tendencies to overeat and procrastinate exercise. 75 Hard was one phase of my effort to reach my physique goals once and for all by proving to myself that I’m 100% in control of my actions and I have what it takes to get where I want to be.

Results (30/F/5’4”)
Weight: 136.7 lbs > 126.5 lbs = -10.2 lbs
Body fat: 26.7% > 20.9% = -5.8 pp
Lean body mass: 100.2lbs > 100.2 lbs = 0 lbs
The charts’ x-axis is months and shows the monthly average of body fat % and lean mass lbs. 75 Hard was Feb 23 - May 8 and I weighed in daily to get this data.

I’m thrilled with my results - losing that amount of fat while maintaining muscle 💪💪. Now it’s time to build some more muscle to achieve the athletic physique I’m looking for. I have back issues so that will be a slow and careful process.

Easiest part: no alcohol - I’ve become completely confident in saying no to drinks. It ruins my quality of sleep and I don’t actually like how any of it tastes, I’d rather have an ice cream or something delicious. I’ll happily exclude it from my lifestyle going forward. 

Hardest part: water - I love tea, coffee and soda water but didn’t have room for more than 1-2 drinks other than the gallon of water. My body adjusted after the first week but the first few days I felt like I would burst.

What’s next: I’m taking a week off of tracking food but still making the healthy choices I incorporated during 75 Hard. Next week I’ll start tracking food again, increasing my protein and beginning the same lifting program I did in February (which you can see the effects of in my lean body mass chart). It’s a 4-week program on the Peloton Strength+ app and I didn’t pinch any nerves when I did it the first time so I know it’s a safe option for me 😊 I was never a big reader but I will continue to read regularly - I’m going to pick up on some fiction books I’ve wanted to finish for years.

1kkuazb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/1kkuazb/will_it_ever_feel_more_manageable/,will it ever feel more manageable?,"Sitting here on my 3rd cup of coffee, pumping in my office and looking for some support and solidarity (gotta love reddit!) Mother's day has me reflecting on parenthood. We have two tiny kiddos: my son is 3.5 years, and my daughter is 9 months. My husband and I are in the thick of it, and I am worn out - between working full time and parenting two low sleep needs kids, the only time we have for ourselves/each other is during nap time on the weekends (my toddler doesn't fall asleep until 9/9:15 and one of the kids is up by 5:30 every day, and our baby is still waking quite a bit at night -cosleeping and nursing - which I feel is developmentally normal.)

I am so grateful for my beautiful babies, and I did not choose to become a parent because it is convenient or easy. But I am just wondering if maybe there will be a light at the end of the tunnel when my daughter is a bit older and sleeping better. At this point, I am barely hanging on by a thread every single day, trying to hold it together at work on 5-6 hours of broken sleep. I am finding myself increasingly impatient and resentful of my sweet kids when they wake up so early. I feel like all the other parents I know have kids who sleep by 7:30 at night, so they at least have that time to themselves in the evenings....The weekends feel like a hamster wheel of laundry, trying to keep everyone fed, attempting to clean the house, playing catch up from the week, etc.

So for those of you who have multiple kids, does the relentless grind of parenting ever ease up a bit? Will I ever get a good night's rest, will I be able to go for a run without one of my kids in the jogging stroller, will I be able to have a full conversation with my husband? I just feel so worn out that I am not able to be present to witness the magic that is my children's childhood unfolding before my eyes.

1kkuaxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kkuaxg/explore_bialetti_moka_express_stovetop_espresso/,Explore Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker Review for Authentic Italian Coffee Making,"Testing the Bialetti 06800 Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker daily has been an interesting journey, especially since I am someone who craves that authentic, bold espresso taste to kickstart my mornings. As an icon in the coffee world, this stovetop espresso pot has been on my radar for quite some time, and I was excited to see if it lived up to its reputation of delivering the ""real Italian way"" of preparing coffee. Spoiler alert: it didn’t disappoint, but there are definitely things to take into account if you’re considering adding it to your coffee arsenal.

**Timeless Design and Durability**  
The sleek and distinctive design of this moka pot is immediately eye-catching. Its silver aluminum finish, combined with the unmistakable angular shape, feels like holding onto a piece of history—it’s no surprise this design dates back to 1933, crafted by Alfonso Bialetti himself. Beyond its aesthetics, the pot also feels solid and well-constructed. Designed for durability, it has a patented safety valve that ensures peace of mind during use. The ergonomic handle, while practical, strikes a nice balance between form and function. However, the handle does get noticeably warm during brewing, so I’ve learned to keep a kitchen towel nearby—lesson learned after a few near finger burns.  

[Check Bialetti 06800 Moka Express price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00004rfru/)

**Brewing Process: Simple, Yet Rewarding**  
Using this product to brew coffee is almost like a ritual. You fill the bottom chamber with water (up to the safety valve), add finely-ground coffee in the funnel-shaped filter, and screw the top and bottom sections together. Placing it on my gas stovetop ignited this process of slow, aromatic brewing. As soon as I heard the ""gurgle"" signaling the coffee was ready, I turned off the heat, and voila—pure espresso magic flowed into my cup. Cleanup afterward was as straightforward as brewing: simply rinse it out with water. A quick tip for anyone using this for the first time—skip the detergent if you don't want to compromise the flavor of future brews.

**Advantages**  
Some notable perks of this espresso maker made it a rewarding experience to use:  
- Its compact design makes it perfect for travel or small kitchen spaces.  
- It doesn’t require electricity—just place it on a stovetop and you’re good to go.  
- The reusable filter eliminated the need for paper filters, which saves money and reduces waste.  
- It consistently produced rich, flavorful coffee; I particularly loved sipping it from traditional espresso cups for the authentic feel.  

**Hiccups I Found While Testing**  
While the Bialetti Moka Express managed to deliver in many areas, it’s not without its shortcomings:  
- The aluminum material, though classic, is not dishwasher-safe. You’ll need to commit to handwashing.  
- It took a little practice to avoid over-extraction or under-extraction of coffee, as the perfect brew largely depends on the heat level and timing.  
- Not suitable for induction stovetops without an adapter, which added an extra expense for me to consider.  

**What Else Is Out There?**  
In comparison to electric alternatives like Nespresso machines or Aeropress setups, the moka pot stands out as a cost-effective option for purists who enjoy traditional brewing methods. However, if speed and convenience are your priorities, single-serve pod machines might feel more appealing. I’ve also tried the VeoHome Stainless Steel Moka Pot before, and while it has a sturdier build and induction compatibility, it didn’t quite achieve the same rich flavor notes I got from this stovetop coffee maker. So it all boils down to whether you prioritize taste or modern convenience.  

**Quality for Price**  
This espresso pot feels like a solid investment if you genuinely enjoy the experience of brewing your own coffee while having control over the process. Though it takes a little trial and error to perfect the timing and grind size, once you get the hang of it, the results are worth it. Considering its heritage and the craftsmanship behind its design, I’d say it’s priced fairly for the quality it offers. If you prefer something cheaper but aren’t looking for espresso-level coffee, you may find basic French presses more within your reach. That said, for espresso lovers, nothing quite compares to this moka pot.

I think I’m at a stage where asking for some advice might help me. There’s not a small chance that I might know the answer already, but it won’t hurt to check what others might think.

**But before that, a bit of history:**

32M, Polish, living near the largest city, stable job, in good shape.

I’ve been more or less actively trying to find a partner for the last seven years with little to no success, except for several first dates with one second date after which my date has recalled that she needs to focus on herself and her career – the usual one, but better this than getting ghosted.

This was on the dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, FB dating, Hinge not available in PL). I’m done with that, no power is going to make me reinstall it again.

As for approaching – I’m really cautious regarding this one, not preferred option. Tried this several times during bachata classes/parties but the only ones that interest me are either not looking for anyone or already partnered/married.I’m not brave enough to ask for date anyone at work – I prefer to keep that away from my „dating sphere”.

I’ve attended several singles events, however this one turned into a Linkedin networking meeting for entrepreneurs. The only girl that seemed to be interested in me was waaaay below my accepted lowest dating age -10 years junior, so no.

As for my social skills, I don’t think they’re that bad. Being an introvert doesn’t hold me back from having a small talk with strangers, be it in the coffee shop, library, public transport etc. However, I’ve heard that I have intimidating presence being so calm and collected all the time, deep voice doesn’t help either.

**So now, what next?**

I’ve been taking breaks from dating after feeling approaching burnout. For some time I’ve been open to dating, but actively searching and I’m really close to give up completely. I’m fine on my own, I’ve been raised to take care of myself from very young age (don’t worry, therapist has taken care of that…) and people I’ve been encountering recently are so uninteresting to me. Most of my hobbies (except for dancing) are for singles – miniature building, reading, gardening, hiking or baking. It’s like I’ve got all the traits to thrive as a single, but nothing to interest a potential partner.

Is this the end of the road? I really would like to be in a relationship with someone who loves me for who I am and shares my values/worldview, but it seems to be… I don’t want to say impossible, but it’s not far off.

I’m truly in a place where **I don’t seem to realise what to do next**. Like all the solutions I could think of have been used and failed. The final decision is mine to be taken, however I feel I need consulting someone wiser than me, namely you, dear reader. If more info's needed, please let me know (comment, DM, pidgeon post).

**P.S.** Yes, I’ve learned to be happy single. Being alone for that long is a really good spot for deep introspection and working on yourself.",1,1747060889.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Four more months and Raibod would be back in the city. He was the only one who could still make her laugh and bring a bit of colour to her grey world. His broad shoulders and the warmth of his body were the best pillow she could ever want. His support, even when he was mad and annoyed by her constant questions about the Orders and the gods, was the reason she was this bold.

Someone tapped on the door, and dragged Satia's mind back to her office. ""Come in."" She sat up straight and fixed her clothes and capelet.

A man wearing a one-shouldered brown cape over a white robe entered. Both the cape and the robe were adorned with beadwork that shimmered under the lights. ""Hi, Satia.""

A genuine smile appeared on Satia's face. The man who entered was one of the very few people she actually liked. He was not perfect, as no one was, but he had helped her many times even when he was just a mere Altar-minister, let alone after he became the principal of the most famous academy.

Maybe liking him for things he did for her was selfish, but it was what it was. ""Hey, Govad,"" Satia said.

The old man settled down on the other sofa. His small round belly and long grey beard, combined with his peaceful, confident voice, made him look like the kind, caring grandfather she never had. ""I heard about your little conflict with Izadyar.""

Satia made a deflating sound and rolled her eyes. ""Don't tell me she came to you.""

""Oh dear, but she did,"" Govad chuckled. ""While I admire your bravery, you should not expect a fair fight when jackals surround you.""

""Did she make a problem for me again?""

""Nothing that cannot be handled,"" Govad smiled.

Satia didn’t want to think about Izadyar or what she had said to the academy’s board. She redirected her thoughts to the stain on Govad's cape near the small, round, simple brooch. It was fresh and brownish; probably a drop of coffee from his long beard made it... Wait! His brooch was simple, with no hands.

""You aren't wearing your prayer brooch!"" Satia said.

Govad chuckled at the astonishment on her face. ""It's better than wearing it but not praying, like you."" he taunted.

Satia rolled her eyes. ""You're aMinister, not a simple mentor like me. Plus, last time I checked, not wearing a prayer brooch is an indirect way to say you're a heretic. Are you saying that?""

Govad waved his hand dismissively. ""Relax. No one cares if an old Civil-Minister wears his brooch or not."" He sank deeper into the sofa and clasped his hands together. ""Anyway, I came here to tell you something."" That was not good. When someone says they have something to tell you without just saying it, it means they have something you don't want to hear. ""The board needs you to prove your loyalty.""

""I bet they do."" Satia gave Govad a halfway smile.

""Satia, they chose you as one of the ten teachers for Judgment Day.""

""Oh, demon-dung!"" Satia didn't mean to swear in front of the principal. But it was too late. She saw the disappointment on Govad's face. ""Sorry. But do you know how boring and long that day is?""

""I'm sure that's not your real reason."" Govad’s blue eyes got even darker. Yes, that was not Satia’s only reason for disliking Judgment day. 

""Well, if you know the reason, then you know my answer too."" Satia lay back on her warm sofa and watched Govad gritting his teeth.

""Satia, you need to do this or I can't convince the board to keep you in here any longer."" Govad sighed.

Someone knocked on the door. Satia raised her eyebrows at Govad, who shrugged back. ""Come in!"" She shouted.

A guard entered. ""One of the parents wants to see you."" The guard had one hand on the door and the other on her sword as if Satia was about to attack her at any moment. 

""A parent wants to see me?!"" Satia said. The guard nodded. ""Whose parents are they?"" Satia asked.

""How should I know? Bringing messages is not exactly my job."" The guard was annoyed.

""Okay Almaz, get back to your post,"" Govad said, making the guard notice him in the room. She saluted. ""Sorry, sir. Didn't see you there,"" she said. Govad simply waved his hand dismissively again and turned his attention back to Satia. Sometimes Satia forgot how serious and cold Govad could act.

As the guard left the room, Govad began chanting the words of Rashnu —words that sounded like a stone falling into a deep well, echoing as they descended. His irises faded, the liquid in his tattoos glowed brighter, and he froze in place. All three of his vertical eye tattoos on his forehead gleamed faintly.

Satia sat there watching the frozen body of Govad for a few minutes until he blinked again and the warmth of life returned to his body. ""Ah... these stupid Karies’. After centuries of working withMinisters, they still haven't learned to follow orders properly."" Govad stood up from the sofa. ""Well, I only saw a black carriage in front of the gate. There was no heraldry on it either. You should go and have a chat with whoever that parent is. We don't want anyone unsatisfied with our academy, right?""

""Yeah, yeah. The whole world should be happy with us,"" Satia said, pushing herself to her feet.

""Satia,"" Govad said, standing in front of her and placing his heavy hand on her shoulder, ""for my sake, don't start a conversation with them about gods and orders and all that. Okay?""

Satia rolled her eyes. ""Okay, I won't.""

Govad glanced at Satia before leaving the room. ""And prepare yourself mentally for Judgment Day. You are going. It's an order.""

Another ""Okay"" left Satia's mouth as she followed Govad outside. They went in different directions—Govad to his office and Satia to the gates. The corridor and the main hall were no longer empty and quiet. Students of all ages filled the space with their chatter and laughter. She made her way through them, praying that whoever the parent was, they would talk quickly so she could return to her office and get the rest she had been longing for since morning.

The rain had ended, leaving puddles in the grass. However, the sky was still covered with dark clouds. Govad's Karies was walking on the walls with its wings tucked in, dragging its long, black tail behind it like a skirt. One of its heads turned to the guard near the gate, while the other turned to Satia. Its white eyes were fixed on her, watching every step she took. She wondered if Govad was checking on her right now or not.

There was a simple black carriage on the other side of the gate, just as Govad described. Its driver was half asleep when Satia reached the carriage and cleared her throat.

""Oh gods!"" The man jumped out of his state and quickly composed himself. He sat straight and, before Satia could ask anything, said, ""They're waiting for you inside the carriage, madam.""

Satia gave him a kind smile and turned away from him. She knocked on the carriage door and opened it. Two figures were sitting at the other end of the carriage, where the shadows were thicker and it was harder for Satila to see their faces.  She felt a sense of danger.

""Hello, Satia,"" a man with a raspy low voice said. ""Come in, we have a lot to talk about.""

""I was about to invite you into the academy. We can have tea while chatting."" Satia didn't want to get caught up in something amiss.

The other figure shifted in their seat and leaned out of the shadows. It was a woman with a thick black fringe on long hair, a warm smile, and a pair of dimples that looked more like deep lines. She didn't look dangerous. ""We are here because of your parents,"" she said casually as if  talking about the weather. But nothing about mentioning Satia’s parents was casual; they had been dead for a long time. Satia didn't reply. Instead, she climbed into the carriage and closed the door behind her. Curiosity won over fear.

The man squeezed himself more into the corner. He had a hood on and was dressed in black from head to toe. ""We know you have their notebook. And we know you are continuing their work,"" he said with a deep voice.

""What?"" Satia's heart sank. Was this a trap? Were they devotees? Were they here to arrest her? ""Who told you this nonsense?!""

""Don't be afraid,"" the woman said. ""We are here to help you."" She smiled. 

How old was this woman? Mid-twenty? No way. Maybe mid-thirty. Why was Satia even thinking about her age? She cleared her mind from any stupid thoughts. ""Help me? With what? I don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was shaking slightly.

The man continued like she didn’t just deny everything, ""We will give you a Statebinder and a safe building to continue their projects,"" the man said. His voice was familiar, but fear had paralyzed Satia's brain. She couldn't remember who this voice belonged to.

""No, no, no."" Satia might have been studying her parents' theories and she might have been obsessed with them too. But this offer was too scary. She didn't want to end up like her parents. She reached for  the handle and opened the carriage door. But the woman grabbed her other arm before she could get out. ""Don't you want to know if it works?"" she asked.

Satia did want to know, but not at the risk of her life.

""It will be a breakthrough if it works. We can discover things no one has seen before. We might be able to challenge the gods. Or even free the Healers,"" the woman said.

Freeing Healers. Satia’s heart ached. The handle slipped through her hand. ""It might... but what if it confirms the gods' story?"" Satia murmured.

The man considered her answer as confession, ""No, it won't. The gods forbid this science because they're scared of its power in revealing the truth,"" he said.

""And even if it does confirm it, we still can free the Healers"" the woman leaned forward. ""Your parent’s project is the entrance to a new science. One that can turn any ordinary person into a god.""

Satia reached for the handle again and pushed the door open. ""I... I need to go.""

The woman placed a letter on her lap. ""We'll wait for you.""

Satia looked at them both one last time, grabbed the letter, and jumped out of the carriage.

I’ve been living here in Dubai for almost 2 years now, and honestly, it’s just been the same routine — office, then home. I go out sometimes with workmates, but I’m hoping to meet new people outside of work and build some genuine friendships.

I’m a Filipino, introverted by nature, and mostly spend my free time gaming (especially Dota 2) or watching anime. If you’re into Dota or anime, that’s already a huge plus! But even if not, I’m open to just hanging out, grabbing some food, coffee, or exploring what the city has to offer.

Would be cool to find people I can vibe with — whether it’s online or in person. So if you're also in Dubai and looking for a friend to chill, game, or geek out over anime with, feel free to DM me 😊

During the exam time it was literally hard for me perform well, but I tried my best on the tests, pulled overnights, loaded with coffee and flashcards in the last minutes. Looking back I don't remember whether I performed well or worse in the exam which scares me the most. 

Now since it is our vacation, I had a lot of plans like getting my driver's licence, completing a novel that I left halfway, finish the book I read it half, and lot other stuff. But nothing had got done. 

A few days ago my mum, who is a working woman from 10-7 in media sector, asked me to do some chores around the house. In which I forgot to hang the clothes in the washer. After she got home we had a huge fight just because of that, she said that I'm lazy and very egoistic. I know she is stressed and tired with work, I know that. But whatever I do is pissing her off. We keep on fighting for the minute things these days. 

The college admission stuffs are also keeping my head in a constant frenzy. I feel like I'm a failure in life and a burden for my family. 

I don't know what to do. Everything is so overwhelming. I just wanted to rant, don't mind me.

1kku0zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1kku0zf/vitality_after_50_its_more_than_just_physical/,Vitality After 50: It's More Than Just Physical Health,"**Are you over 50 and feeling like vitality is just a distant memory?** 🤔 Trust me, you're not alone! But let’s do a little reality check here—it’s totally possible to reignite that spark and feel fabulous, *both inside and out*!

When we think of vitality, most of us focus on physical health—exercise, diet, and all that jazz. But here's a little secret: **true vitality goes beyond just those mundane gym reps and salad lunches.** It’s about cultivating a fulfilling life and keeping your brain and spirit alive and kicking. 🌟

So, how do you work smarter on your path to vitality after 50? Let’s break it down, shall we?

### **1. Set Realistic Goals**
You might be thinking, “Yeah, easier said than done.” But hear me out! Instead of saying, “I want to run a marathon tomorrow,” try “I want to walk 30 minutes a day this week.” Small achievements build momentum. **Set realistic goals and watch your confidence grow!**

- Focus on quality over quantity.
- Celebrate your small wins. Trust me, they add up!
- Set reminders about your goals (like sticking post-its on your fridge). 

### **2. Embrace Lifelong Learning**
Feeling a little stagnant? 🔄 It might be time to say goodbye to your comfort zone! Whether it’s picking up a new hobby, learning to play an instrument, or mastering that fancy recipe you've been eyeing, **keeping your brain stimulated is key**. 

- Online classes? Yes, please! 🎓
- Join a book club and dive into discussions.
- Share what you learn and make connections. 

### **3. Stay Connected**
Let's face it, our social circles might shrink as we age, but that doesn’t mean we have to be lonely! Engaging with friends, old and new, plays a huge role in our mental health and happiness.

- Schedule regular catch-up calls or coffee dates. ☕️
- Use social media to maintain those connections (even if it takes a little getting used to!).
- Explore local communities or clubs that align with your interests. 

### **4. Mindfulness and Mental Health**
This one’s a game-changer! 🧘‍♂️ Have you ever tried meditation or yoga? It’s not just for the zen masters—anyone can tap into their inner peace, and it’s incredibly beneficial. 

- Practice gratitude! Jot down three things you’re thankful for each day.
- Explore mindfulness apps. (Hey, even your phone can help with this!)
- Remember: mental health is just as vital as physical health. 

### **5. Physical Health Meets Fun**
We all have that image of being healthy as pounding the pavement or crunching numbers at the gym. But why not make it enjoyable? 🕺

- Dance it out! Zumba, line dancing—whatever makes you groove.
- Explore the great outdoors. Nature is a fantastic healer.
- Play games or sports that you enjoy—no competition needed!

It’s not just about living longer; it’s about living better, feeling vibrant, and embracing what life throws your way. So let’s remind ourselves again: **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** And if you’re looking for a little inspiration or community support, I found a gem here: [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/qBribQrKcTb). 

Now, you don’t have to tackle this journey alone! It’s all about sharing experiences and learning from each other. What little steps have you found to keep the zest alive after 50? ✨ Let’s swap stories!",1,1747060387.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1kku0a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kku0a1/caught_the_guy_im_dating_making_out_with_another/,Caught the guy I’m dating making out with another guy,"So I met this guy through some friends about 2 months ago. A bit over 3 weeks ago we decided to hook up and been inseparable since. We’ve been going on 3-5 super cute dates a week. We went on picnics, bike rides, bbqs , movies with lots of cuddling and pda. Very passionate sex . Our friend groups know each other , so everyone was happy for us and associated us very quickly. 

I have to mention, he was in a 12 year relationship and has only been single for the last 6 months. I had been told by friends to be careful as he’s not ready for a relationship. I was aware of that but at the same time, I hadn’t been on such cute dates in so long that I was kind of in denial. 

Friday we went to the movies. At some point he puts his hand on my thigh and holds on to my hand during the whole movie. The next day he invited me to a day party. We had both taken mdma. He was being distant. At some point I see him talk to a guy and get closer and closer . At some point they both disappear for quite a long time. Then I notice they’re hidden in a dark corner and totally making out. I start feeling really uncomfortable. So I wait and wait until he’s done. Then I go to him and tell him I’m gonna leave . He kinda convinced me to stay. Blamed it on the drugs and told me it didn’t mean anything but at the same time he’s really not ready for a relationship and wants to be free and live his life. Told me he was still sleeping with other guys but I was the most special. I decided to stay but it just got awkward after that. I can feel he was staying around me by pity. I could feel that all he wanted was to go around and make out with everyone and that I was holding him back. So I finally decided to leave for real and told him I wanted him to enjoy his night and have some fun without holding back. He told me we need to slow down and that we need to go grab a coffee this week to discuss all this. 

I haven’t heard from him since. We’d text everyday. When it happened, I was heart broken. But now , I’m wondering if this conversation will actually be worth it. He’s a wonderful person but I feel we’re really not at the same place. I’m thinking that if we just leave it, I’ll have good memories of our little adventure together . But if I go meet for coffee, I’m scared that we decide to keep seeing eachother by giving him more space and that I’ll end up getting hurt cause he’ll never be able to give me what I want. Also part of me’s telling me that communication is so important.

I’m really sorry for the super long text . But what do you think about the whole situation?",11,1747060339.0,askgaybros,15,0.82,False

Answers that we may not like, and answers that may not even exist. For the last 3 years now I've been suffering from panic attacks. It was brought on just before my (an wife's) only twin sons graduated and went off for college. All through this time I've been working on a number of issues to help. I work with a counselor monthly, and I was on Wellbutrin for a year, just recentling coming off fully. Here we are exactly where I was a year ago, they come home from college, this time only for a week since they're going back to spend the summer and I'm an absolute wreck. When they're gone, living at their apartment, I'm fine. Really. I go on living, my wife and I have all sorts of fun, I don't ruminate, things don't bother me. But now I'm seriously thinking about going back on my drugs because feeling like this, when they're home just fucking sucks. I love them. They love me, we have the best relationship and I couldn't ask for a better family. 

But I feel like I'm broken. I'm writing this in a coffee shop, litterally fighting back tears on a call with my company for a customer. I do this all time, I work from a coffee shop or home, without issues. But I just want to ball my eyes out, and I know I will ball my eyes out when I get home. Hell, even in the car on the way home. And they'll be there, and it will just be another reminder that they don't live there any more. 

I just want to know why, and I just want to not be so sad when they're home. To be fair, I'm not sad ""all"" the time they're home, just seems like most of the time. Now I'm venting.

She closed her eyes, and let her mind swim in a sea of thoughts, memories, and desires. Four more months and Raibod would be back in the city. He was the only one who could still make her laugh and bring a bit of colour to her grey world. His broad shoulders and the warmth of his body were the best pillow she could ever want. His support, even when he was mad and annoyed by her constant questions about the Orders and the gods, was the reason she was this bold.

Someone tapped on the door, and dragged Satia's mind back to her office. ""Come in."" She sat up straight and fixed her clothes and capelet.

A man wearing a one-shouldered brown cape over a white robe entered. Both the cape and the robe were adorned with beadwork that shimmered under the lights. ""Hi, Satia.""

A genuine smile appeared on Satia's face. The man who entered was one of the very few people she actually liked. He was not perfect, as no one was, but he had helped her many times even when he was just a mere Altar-minister, let alone after he became the principal of the most famous academy.

Maybe liking him for things he did for her was selfish, but it was what it was. ""Hey, Govad,"" Satia said.

The old man settled down on the other sofa. His small round belly and long grey beard, combined with his peaceful, confident voice, made him look like the kind, caring grandfather she never had. ""I heard about your little conflict with Izadyar.""

Satia made a deflating sound and rolled her eyes. ""Don't tell me she came to you.""

""Oh dear, but she did,"" Govad chuckled. ""While I admire your bravery, you should not expect a fair fight when jackals surround you.""

""Did she make a problem for me again?""

""Nothing that cannot be handled,"" Govad smiled.

Satia didn’t want to think about Izadyar or what she had said to the academy’s board. She redirected her thoughts to the stain on Govad's cape near the small, round, simple brooch. It was fresh and brownish; probably a drop of coffee from his long beard made it... Wait! His brooch was simple, with no hands.

""You aren't wearing your prayer brooch!"" Satia said.

Govad chuckled at the astonishment on her face. ""It's better than wearing it but not praying, like you."" he taunted.

Satia rolled her eyes. ""You're aMinister, not a simple mentor like me. Plus, last time I checked, not wearing a prayer brooch is an indirect way to say you're a heretic. Are you saying that?""

Govad waved his hand dismissively. ""Relax. No one cares if an old Civil-Minister wears his brooch or not."" He sank deeper into the sofa and clasped his hands together. ""Anyway, I came here to tell you something."" That was not good. When someone says they have something to tell you without just saying it, it means they have something you don't want to hear. ""The board needs you to prove your loyalty.""

""I bet they do."" Satia gave Govad a halfway smile.

""Satia, they chose you as one of the ten teachers for Judgment Day.""

""Oh, demon-dung!"" Satia didn't mean to swear in front of the principal. But it was too late. She saw the disappointment on Govad's face. ""Sorry. But do you know how boring and long that day is?""

""I'm sure that's not your real reason."" Govad’s blue eyes got even darker. Yes, that was not Satia’s only reason for disliking Judgment day. 

""Well, if you know the reason, then you know my answer too."" Satia lay back on her warm sofa and watched Govad gritting his teeth.

""Satia, you need to do this or I can't convince the board to keep you in here any longer."" Govad sighed.

Someone knocked on the door. Satia raised her eyebrows at Govad, who shrugged back. ""Come in!"" She shouted.

A guard entered. ""One of the parents wants to see you."" The guard had one hand on the door and the other on her sword as if Satia was about to attack her at any moment. 

""A parent wants to see me?!"" Satia said. The guard nodded. ""Whose parents are they?"" Satia asked.

""How should I know? Bringing messages is not exactly my job."" The guard was annoyed.

""Okay Almaz, get back to your post,"" Govad said, making the guard notice him in the room. She saluted. ""Sorry, sir. Didn't see you there,"" she said. Govad simply waved his hand dismissively again and turned his attention back to Satia. Sometimes Satia forgot how serious and cold Govad could act.

As the guard left the room, Govad began chanting the words of Rashnu —words that sounded like a stone falling into a deep well, echoing as they descended. His irises faded, the liquid in his tattoos glowed brighter, and he froze in place. All three of his vertical eye tattoos on his forehead gleamed faintly.

Satia sat there watching the frozen body of Govad for a few minutes until he blinked again and the warmth of life returned to his body. ""Ah... these stupid Karies’. After centuries of working withMinisters, they still haven't learned to follow orders properly."" Govad stood up from the sofa. ""Well, I only saw a black carriage in front of the gate. There was no heraldry on it either. You should go and have a chat with whoever that parent is. We don't want anyone unsatisfied with our academy, right?""

""Yeah, yeah. The whole world should be happy with us,"" Satia said, pushing herself to her feet.

""Satia,"" Govad said, standing in front of her and placing his heavy hand on her shoulder, ""for my sake, don't start a conversation with them about gods and orders and all that. Okay?""

Satia rolled her eyes. ""Okay, I won't.""

Govad glanced at Satia before leaving the room. ""And prepare yourself mentally for Judgment Day. You are going. It's an order.""

Another ""Okay"" left Satia's mouth as she followed Govad outside. They went in different directions—Govad to his office and Satia to the gates. The corridor and the main hall were no longer empty and quiet. Students of all ages filled the space with their chatter and laughter. She made her way through them, praying that whoever the parent was, they would talk quickly so she could return to her office and get the rest she had been longing for since morning.

The rain had ended, leaving puddles in the grass. However, the sky was still covered with dark clouds. Govad's Karies was walking on the walls with its wings tucked in, dragging its long, black tail behind it like a skirt. One of its heads turned to the guard near the gate, while the other turned to Satia. Its white eyes were fixed on her, watching every step she took. She wondered if Govad was checking on her right now or not.

There was a simple black carriage on the other side of the gate, just as Govad described. Its driver was half asleep when Satia reached the carriage and cleared her throat.

""Oh gods!"" The man jumped out of his state and quickly composed himself. He sat straight and, before Satia could ask anything, said, ""They're waiting for you inside the carriage, madam.""

Satia gave him a kind smile and turned away from him. She knocked on the carriage door and opened it. Two figures were sitting at the other end of the carriage, where the shadows were thicker and it was harder for Satila to see their faces.  She felt a sense of danger.

""Hello, Satia,"" a man with a raspy low voice said. ""Come in, we have a lot to talk about.""

""I was about to invite you into the academy. We can have tea while chatting."" Satia didn't want to get caught up in something amiss.

The other figure shifted in their seat and leaned out of the shadows. It was a woman with a thick black fringe on long hair, a warm smile, and a pair of dimples that looked more like deep lines. She didn't look dangerous. ""We are here because of your parents,"" she said casually as if  talking about the weather. But nothing about mentioning Satia’s parents was casual; they had been dead for a long time. Satia didn't reply. Instead, she climbed into the carriage and closed the door behind her. Curiosity won over fear.

The man squeezed himself more into the corner. He had a hood on and was dressed in black from head to toe. ""We know you have their notebook. And we know you are continuing their work,"" he said with a deep voice.

""What?"" Satia's heart sank. Was this a trap? Were they devotees? Were they here to arrest her? ""Who told you this nonsense?!""

""Don't be afraid,"" the woman said. ""We are here to help you."" She smiled. 

How old was this woman? Mid-twenty? No way. Maybe mid-thirty. Why was Satia even thinking about her age? She cleared her mind from any stupid thoughts. ""Help me? With what? I don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was shaking slightly.

The man continued like she didn’t just deny everything, ""We will give you a Statebinder and a safe building to continue their projects,"" the man said. His voice was familiar, but fear had paralyzed Satia's brain. She couldn't remember who this voice belonged to.

""No, no, no."" Satia might have been studying her parents' theories and she might have been obsessed with them too. But this offer was too scary. She didn't want to end up like her parents. She reached for  the handle and opened the carriage door. But the woman grabbed her other arm before she could get out. ""Don't you want to know if it works?"" she asked.

Satia did want to know, but not at the risk of her life.

""It will be a breakthrough if it works. We can discover things no one has seen before. We might be able to challenge the gods. Or even free the Healers,"" the woman said.

Freeing Healers. Satia’s heart ached. The handle slipped through her hand. ""It might... but what if it confirms the gods' story?"" Satia murmured.

The man considered her answer as confession, ""No, it won't. The gods forbid this science because they're scared of its power in revealing the truth,"" he said.

""And even if it does confirm it, we still can free the Healers"" the woman leaned forward. ""Your parent’s project is the entrance to a new science. One that can turn any ordinary person into a god.""

Satia reached for the handle again and pushed the door open. ""I... I need to go.""

The woman placed a letter on her lap. ""We'll wait for you.""

Satia looked at them both one last time, grabbed the letter, and jumped out of the carriage.

Guess that's no more coffee for the next few days until I can get, and fit, a replacement.

I'm not sure how I can put up with them without coffee.",1,1747060140.0,mildlyinfuriating,2,0.6,False

1kktv6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kktv6e/can_mr_coffee_12cups_automatic_coffee_maker/,Can Mr. Coffee 12-Cups Automatic Coffee Maker Deliver on Its Promises Review?,"Testing out the Mr. Coffee 2129927 12-Cups Automatic Coffee Maker was an interesting experience, especially as someone who values a well-brewed cup of coffee to start the day. This coffee machine came highly recommended, and I was curious to see whether it could replace my old, no-frills model. After weeks of testing and making countless cups of coffee for myself and my caffeine-loving coworkers, I’ve gathered some thoughts on its performance, design, and features.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the sleek yet minimalistic design of this coffee maker impressed me. It blends easily into any kitchen without standing out like a flashy gadget, which is ideal for neatly organized spaces. The lightweight frame—just 4.18 pounds—makes it incredibly easy to relocate, though its size (13.7 x 10.9 x 13.55 inches) may require a bit more counter space than a single-serve brewer. The control panel is intuitively laid out, allowing even my tech-challenged uncle to navigate its buttons. However, the plastic body might feel slightly less premium compared to pricier models, but it doesn’t seem vulnerable to wear and tear after regular use.  

**Features that Stand Out**  
The Strong Brew Selector truly sets this coffee maker apart. With a single press, I could enjoy a robust, café-style cup—a noticeable difference that suited mornings when I needed an extra kick. For those who prefer to pre-schedule their brewing (such as my night owl brother), the Brew Later feature is a lifesaver. Setting up the program was simple, and there’s nothing quite like waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the house. The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause also came in handy during breakfast rushes, allowing me to sneak a cup mid-cycle without making a mess.

**Performance and Brewing Efficiency**  
This coffee maker brews up to 12 cups quickly and efficiently, and the bolder brew option truly delivered on its promise. The reusable coffee filter included is a thoughtful and eco-friendly touch, reducing waste while saving on paper filters. I did, however, notice that the brewing temperature could vary slightly—not enough to ruin a cup, but enough to make a difference to sensitive palates. The Auto-Shutoff feature, which activates after four hours, was a relief for forgetful users like myself, avoiding any lingering worries about leaving it running.  

**Advantages**  
There’s no denying that this coffee maker has several strong selling points:  
- The Strong Brew Selector delivers richer-tasting coffee on demand.  
- Brew Later programming is ideal for busy schedules.  
- Reusable, dishwasher-safe filter cuts down waste and effort.  
- Auto-Pause provides uninterrupted coffee enjoyment mid-brew.  

**Critiques**  
Of course, no gadget is without its flaws:  
- The overall plastic build might feel less premium than some alternatives.  
- Brewing temperature varies slightly, which may bother picky connoisseurs.  
- The coffee maker takes up a bit more counter space than I anticipated.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
While testing, I couldn’t help but compare this model to competing products like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Cuisinart model offers a stainless steel design and more customizable settings, but it’s bulkier and less user-friendly for tech newcomers. Hamilton Beach’s dual-functionality makes it versatile, but its single-serve compartment doesn’t brew as strong as the Mr. Coffee machine. Where this product shines is its balance between functionality and simplicity—features like auto-shutoff and the strong brew button make it more practical for everyday coffee drinkers who appreciate a no-nonsense approach.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the features packed into this coffee maker, it’s undeniably a great deal for its price range. You’re getting programmable brewing, reusable filters, and a bold-brew setting, which would typically cost more in higher-end machines. That said, if you’re someone who prioritizes ultra-sleek aesthetics or advanced coffee technology, you may need to look elsewhere. For everyday coffee lovers—and those running on a mid-tier budget—this product offers serious value while keeping things simple enough for stress-free mornings.

Right across the street lived Mr. Rodriguez — retired Army vet, sharp as a tack, and always out front sweeping his porch by 7 a.m.

We got to chatting one morning, and I asked him how he stayed so active and organized. I was juggling a new job at the time and constantly felt overwhelmed.

**He gave me a simple answer I didn’t expect.**

“I don’t do five things at once anymore. I just do the thing that’s in front of me — then I move to the next.”

**A Simple Practice That Made a Big Difference**

At first I brushed it off — I mean, who doesn’t multitask these days? But the next time I found myself eating lunch, replying to emails, and scrolling on my phone at the same time, I remembered what he said.

**So I tried it.**

Just lunch. No phone. No inbox. Just me, my sandwich, and 15 quiet minutes.

I can’t explain it — but that tiny shift changed how my whole day felt.

Mr. Rodriguez Had a Method for Everything

**He even had what he called his “three cornerstones”:**

Start slow,

Stick with it,

**Clean up when you’re done.**

Whether he was pruning a tree or fixing his old Chevy, he never rushed. And somehow, he always got more done than I did, even when I thought I was “working faster.”

**Still Thinking About That Porch Talk**

Now whenever I start to feel scatterbrained, I remind myself: Do the thing in front of you. Then move to the next. No awards for spinning five plates at once if they all come crashing down.

I want to hear your real experiences, pet peeves, suggestions, and stories—especially around how you feel, what you notice, and what could be better when visiting these cafés.
