1hsyfmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hsyfmy/im_losing_it/,Im losing it,"TL;DR: My fiance said she'd be taking a me-time weekend in one city (centre) but she sent a friend a location of a different city in the suburbs with no hotel near. How can I confront her?

Quick context, me (M34) and my fiancie (F35) of 2years (8years relationship) have 2 kids. One from her precious relationship, one our biological son. We live together in an apartement and recently bought a house under both our names. It's a fixer-upper so we are currently paying double burdens.

She told me right before Christmas that she was not feeling herself, and everything was starting to get to her. Being a mom, fiance etc. while never having true alone-time. She also said she was doubting about still liking me, though she firmly addresses she definitely loves me.

I tried to be as supportive as could be because, and I can't stress this enough, I do NOT want to lose her. I told her to take the following Sunday off. Go to the city, be alone. Turn off your phone and just zone out. 

She enjoyed her day out and said it gave her time to read a good book at a local coffee place. She asked if it would be okay if she could take a weekend off, Friday through Sunday. Ofcourse I agreed. She sent me a screenshot of the hotel she'd be staying in (central city). Last weekend was her weekend alone. She took the car without a goodbye and didn't text when she arrived.

Something didn't vibe with me, so I went to check her Whatsapp on her computer (always logged in) and she had a conversation with her friend saying ""he thinks im in the city for the weekend"" and her replying ""so I'm the only one who knows?"". She said yes. The friend then replied that she was nervous and that my fiance should send her location just to be safe in case anything happened. She sent her location and it turned out she's  one city further, in a suburb on the sideskirts. I checked the location, there are no hotels or Airbnb's near there. 

What do I do.. how can I confront her that I know this information? I want to save our marriage but I'm scared she's cheating.",1,1735941882.0,AskMenAdvice,2,0.67,False

1hsy1g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1hsy1g3/neglected_neighbour_led_to_damage_to_our_flat/,Neglected neighbour led to damage to our flat. Small claims? ,"Hello. I am looking for advice! 
I live in Glasgow and my husband and I own our ground floor tenement flat. In late Spring last year I noticed a strange smell in our bathroom. I couldn‚Äôt clean it enough for the smell not to reappear out of nowhere. We then notice small brown stains on our lowered bathroom ceiling. My husband, G, goes upstairs to notify the neighbour L and L says he will tell his letting agent. L is privately renting his flat and is under a social care package. He has four carers a day and a social worker. He is often unwashed and increasingly smelly since we first moved in three years ago. 
I call the factor (JAMES GIBB) and report that there is damage. I leave a voicemail and a woman called O gets back to me and tells me she will be in touch. She never does. We find out later that either that day or the day after she either leaves the company or is fired - and we suspect her notes were never read by her successor. 
This damage then increases to larger stains on the ceiling and I am at the end of my tether. I have MS and we have two small children. The Factors send plumbers, a team of two men. These two men chap on my door and tell me the damage is because L doesn‚Äôt have a shower curtain but not to worry, they have one for him in their van. I am not satisfied. 
A few days later the stains get bigger and unclean water comes through the light fittings. A different plumber (emergency) is sent out and goes upstairs to L‚Äôs flat. He comes back down to ours and RETCHES. He says the bathroom floorboards are saturated in urine.  
I get a knock at the door one weekday soon after at 8am, I‚Äôm getting the kids ready for school. A man says he has been sent by James Gibb and is not surprised that no-one has been in touch with me. He says he‚Äôs there to fix the ceiling. I tell him now is not a good time and he‚Äôll need to come back later. Later that day in the late afternoon, another man comes. He then proceeds to RIP OUT our bathroom ceiling without putting any dust sheets or protection over anything in our bathroom. The lathe and plaster is saturated with urine and goodness knows what else. He proceeds to use our bottle of bleach and splashes it about, informs me that something is still leaking from above and starts putting a new ceiling up. The poor guy is also not wearing any gloves, overalls or goggles. My husband and I later found out that the guy thought he was there for a redecorating job. I call my husband and tell him that someone is putting a new ceiling up. He comes homes and calls the Factor. The new ceiling goes up and unclean water comes though the light fixtures not long after.
I find out who L‚Äôs letting agent is and it‚Äôs 1st Lets. I call and demand to know when they last did an inspection. They refuse to tell me. I tell them there is damage to our flat. I find out who the landlady is and send her an anonymous letter telling her the state of the flat and the damage it‚Äôs causing. 
We are moved to a hotel and promised that the work will take a few weeks, this is mid June ‚Äô24.
 I still need to go back and do laundry in the flat. I see L at his window four roughly four weeks and I know each time I see him, that no work is being done. 
We are finally told that the landlady believed that it was L‚Äôs social worker‚Äôs responsibility to rehome him during the work but the social worker says no, this is a housing issue, they can meet his needs wherever he is placed. 
It gets to the point where I am emailing local councillors to help move things along, looking for answers, trying to stay sane and not be stressed as it can trigger fatigue with my MS.
For the first five days or so, we have to check in and out of hotels each day. The insurance won‚Äôt make a booking for us for more than two days at a time. For six weeks we are living in hotels around the city centre (we live in the Southside). The building‚Äôs insurance paid for the hotels and gave us an allowance of ¬£30 for food. The allure of eating out every night grows stale quickly although we know now the girls love Vietnamese food!
Nearing the end of summer, the insurance finally realises we need somewhere more permanent. I hadn‚Äôt realised Glasgow would be so popular in the summer but we miss out on hotel rooms due to various gigs, conferences and conventions, etc. One horrible night the insurance can‚Äôt find anywhere for us to stay and my husband has to emergency book somewhere for about ¬£350 for us to share a small double bed and the girls to share a pull out sofa bed. 
We are tasked with finding an Airbnb for ourselves with a budget from the insurance. Did you know that people can still have outdated adverts up for Glasgow COP26 on Airbnb? That was dispiriting. We eventually find one in Mount Florida, slightly closer to home but of course not home. 
We are told that the bathroom will be a full rip out. Work has also been stalled because‚Ä¶there is faeces going from L‚Äôs bathroom through the hall carpet into his bedding. Some men have (quite rightly!) refused to work in his flat. I am furious. I‚Äôm furious that a man has been left to live like that, especially when he has a social worker and four carers a day. I‚Äôm furious that somewhere like that was a workplace for people without being cleaned beforehand.
I am so enraged I call AGE UK and ask for advice. At this point I have had complaints against the social worker and care workers batted back to me with excuses of confidentiality and GDPR and having no link to the neighbour. AGE UK tell me that the state he has been left in is possibly a sign of neglect by his social care package and tell me to call the non emergency police number. I do so and have an encouraging conversation with the person on the other end of the phone. I receive a call the next day saying that if the carers job was just to make sure he was taking pills (it was) then he could deny any extra care. I ask when him denying extra care becomes self neglect, she has no answer.  Case closed.
Something in L‚Äôs flat bites the workers, some sort of insect. It needs to be fumigated. The landlady holds up the whole process, thinking the contractors were going to organise the fumigation. 
I send another letter to her, this time not anonymous. I write that our summer has been stolen, it‚Äôs been an increasingly depressing time, that she has been a neglectful landlady to have so much trust in 1st Let‚Äôs who have clearly not been doing their job properly.
Work finally progresses and we are told to pick tiles. We are hopeful. 
And then the move in date comes and we move out of the AirbnB that morning. The kids go to my Mum‚Äôs and I hover in my other neighbour‚Äôs flat watching the workmen come and go and then‚Ä¶go. I let myself in and there‚Äôs no door on the bathroom door, the shower doesn‚Äôt have a door and isn‚Äôt sealed. It‚Äôs not finished. My husband comes home from work and when we look through a new hatch in the new false wall there‚Äôs a bottle‚Ä¶a water bottle. I know instantly. The bottle flashes yellow when I shine our torch on it from a phone. One of the workmen has urinated in a bottle and lobbed it through the hatch. G recognises the bottle, it had been half full of water in the bathroom when he saw it a few days before. 
In the twelve years of knowing my husband, I have never seen him so angry or hurt. We have to book a hotel on our own money. I‚Äôm so stressed I can‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt sleep. He contacts the contractors. They apologise and say they can‚Äôt believe one of their workers would do that. They‚Äôre going to get the job finished.  These contractors were picked by JAMES GIBB. 
The next morning my husband has to leave for work and I confront the three workers who turn up to finish the job. Each deny it, one crossly storms out, one apologises for the one storming out and the third wasn‚Äôt even there the day before. The bottle of urine is removed. They finish the job. G and I move back in and set to making it look like it‚Äôs our home again. 
Then we find out they‚Äôve put silicone on the plastic protective film on top of the tile trim. The ceiling needs more paint. Grouting needs redone on the subway tiles. A contractor boss comes and apologises personally to me about the urine bottle before finishing the work in the bathroom. 
All in all, I think we‚Äôre still reeling from this summer. Quite unimpressed with the work done, the quality of work. The time everything took. I‚Äôm still horrified that L was living like that, that each carer came and went in their 15 / 30 min allocation and left him like that.
We find out that L has been put into sheltered accommodation. His flat was stripped and everything dumped, two men dragged rubble sacks full of his stuff and loaded it into their van. 
I go next door to the coffee shop where I would sometimes see him and tell them he‚Äôs not dead, he‚Äôs been moved. The woman behind the counter almost bursts into tears, she had been told he had died. He would often be waiting for them to open. She had noticed a decline and he would come in covered in various bodily fluids. They has asked him gently if he needed them to shop for him and he had put on slightly cleaner clothes. Eventually they had had to ask him to sit outside as customers were leaving because of the smell. And then one day one his carer‚Äôs came in and was beside herself. She told them L needed more care and gave them all his details and asked them to make a complaint and leave her name out of it. When the cafe owner managed to get hold his social worker, she told him that because of the state L was in, they might have to ban him as they were losing customers. The social worker‚Äôs reply to this? 
‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôre all he has.‚Äù
A man sent to do an estimate for the paint job and possible reflooring of L‚Äôs flat let‚Äôs me in. It stinks, even with everything stripped out. The wooden floor in his bedroom is bowing. There‚Äôs a huge dark mark the size of a dinner plate on the floorboards in the sitting room (directly above our sitting room) and when I realise what it is and what could have been, that everything we love and even us could have been lost in a fire my blood runs cold. When I return to my flat I spray the underside of my shoes and wash my hands even though I hadn‚Äôt touched anything. 
If you have made it this far, I want to thank you.
I want to know - who can I make a small claims against? We thought about taking 1st Lets to First Tier Tribunal but I don‚Äôt know if I have enough evidence. Googling them, it looks like they‚Äôre never out First Tier Tribunal! 
Can we even make a claim against HSCP? They repeatedly knocked back my complaints but it‚Äôs partly due to their lack of care that led to this damage. One of the carers told me that he had been mopping the bathroom floor or urine but this could have caused more damage to us. 
I think I will write to James Gibb and say that those contractors were practically cowboys. I know they won‚Äôt care. I have never felt so vulnerable in my own home, especially not being given the choice of who would work in it. 
Honestly, if my kids want an evil well paid job, I‚Äôm going to tell them to become a factor!

We had no contact during this time and we somewhat recently got back together. 

During our previous relationship it was an important thing to me for us to go away together as I've never had the opportunity to travel abroad besides a short volunteering program, he has travelled many many times. We always spoke about it and his excuse was that he was ""too broke"" or couldn't get the time off work despite having other holidays and trips lined up solo or with his male friends. We had tickets and flights for a festival abroad booked that he got by his own choice (I don't really care for festivals, but they're a big interest for him) as a form of apology for saying some hurtful things during an argument but he gave them both away after we split. 

After taking the 4 months apart i come to learn that during this time he spontaneously went abroad with a female friend, who he described as ""the sexiest friend you'll ever have"" and they shared a bed. He swears that nothing happened between them and that they were both clothed the whole time, and that she was ""too troubled to even go near in that way"". This hurt me as it proved that he can actually spontaneously travel, even under short notice, something that I've always dreamed of and made a point to value in a relationship. He has plans to meet this friend for coffee and I'm not sure how i feel about it, sure he was single and they may not have done anything like he said but I'll always ache knowing that he invested something so valued into another woman so soon after our split while he never did that with me. Besides, i dont think it was entirely okay to describe her as the ""sexiest friend you'll ever have"". 

I get paid a fairly good amount soon and would like to go abroad, so i know he's not got any reason to fret about fronting my side. We used to work together and he owns part of a company so i know he's not short on his end, either. He makes considerably more than i do, too. I mentioned this to him, and said that I'd like to travel this year. The same excuse popped up. ""I'm broke at the moment and I already have multiple holidays planned with my (guy) friends this year"". I pointed out that I'm aware that he can actually spontaneously travel when he wants to so i don't feel that to be a fitting excuse any longer considering how little time it took between our breakup and his travels with his female friend so soon after claiming to be broke the last time. 

This isn't entirely about the holiday, either. Yes it's something i value but it's about a mismatch of priorities. Why is this investment worthwhile on this female friend, but not me? And why continue to make excuses when i already know it's more than doable? 

Has anyone else experienced similar, and how can i explain my hurt in a way that doesn't sound materialistic or jealous? Is my hurt understandable in this situation?

We‚Äôre both NPR libnerds who like art, jazz, coffee, museums, plays, movies, and jeopardy but can enjoy watching a Ween show until our backs hurt. We‚Äôre both active with bikes, hiking, and motorcycles. 

GOALS:

Heavy cyclists and bike commuters. Walking to stuff. Coffee shops, restaurants, music, etc all the basic DINK stuff with no kids. Granola hippy stuff preferred. We‚Äôd like to be near the city center areas VS out on the edge or a long drive away. 

NEIGHBORHOOD:

I recall the state streets in Urbana being pretty great. Is this a good spot? Referring to my map attachments does the neighborhood change much? Looking for a house under 300k that has a safe, friendly, clean, neighborhood vibe to it. The type of place people walk to refill laundry detergent in a recycled glass container and talk about their Grateful Dead shirts together. 

WORRIES:

Is it boring? Will f350 punisher stickered trucks yell ‚Äúlibtard‚Äù because I‚Äôm on a bike? How‚Äôs the diversity and general culture? If I‚Äôm not a student can I still enjoy the campus area? I know it‚Äôs cold and snowy but coming from Albuquerque and Atlanta my wife is nervous. ",1,1735940655.0,UIUC,11,0.6,False

My boss emailed me, asking for a document for a high-stakes client presentation. I was in the middle of multitasking‚Äîchecking emails on my phone, sipping coffee, and scrolling through my group chat. My friend had just sent a hilarious meme: a grumpy cat with the caption, ""Monday mood: Present, but not accounted for."" I laughed so hard that I nearly spilled my coffee.

In my distracted state, I somehow attached the meme instead of the client file. Worse, I titled the email, *""For the Big Meeting ‚Äì Please Review ASAP.""* I didn‚Äôt catch the mistake until I saw my boss‚Äôs reply: *""Interesting choice. Let‚Äôs discuss.""* My stomach dropped.

Panicked, I quickly sent the correct file with a huge apology, but the damage was done. By the time I arrived at the office, the entire team was laughing about my ‚ÄúMonday mood‚Äù email. Apparently, my boss thought it was funny and shared it in the meeting. Thankfully, they all took it as a lighthearted moment, but now every time someone mentions ‚ÄúMonday mood,‚Äù I cringe a little.

Moral of the story: Always double-check your attachments before hitting send‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre juggling work and memes.

TL;DR: Accidentally emailed my boss a grumpy cat meme instead of an important client file. The team turned it into an office joke, and now ‚ÄúMonday mood‚Äù is forever tied to me.",6,1735940404.0,tifu,1,0.71,False

I have already reached the conclusion that Italy will be a multiple trip experience but I have 3 weeks this October to experience the country for the first time. I've narrowed it down to two trips and now at the point where I would like to figure out which would be a better A) first experience and B) best weather experience. I'm not picky, but if I'm spending money might as well get as much out it. 

First 3 weeks of October:

Plan A (South): Naples > Amalfi Coast via ferry > (maybe Pompeii and maybe Sicily via ferry).

Plan B (North): Turin > Milan > Venice

I want to do most if not all of the in country travel by train (doing train research and it looks affordable). That way, I think I'd get a good perspective of the country while not having to drive all around. I want to do food tours to tap into the coffee and pizza scene which drew me to Naples. The North has some interesting stops. Lavazza was founded in Turin (potential good coffee experience)and then my GF has fashion reasons to visit Milan followed by Venice which apparently is sinking due to rising sea levels!? At any rate, I don't think I can go wrong but wanted to gauge whether traveling for the first time to Italy is better from the North or from the South in October. I'll be with my gf.

ORIGINAL COMMENT:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
I read your story. Thanks for sharing your experience.

I notice you‚Äôve mentioned Plato‚Äôs Cave twice now, and I wonder what your thoughts would be on another ‚Äòallegory‚Äô from Plato‚Äôs¬†*Republic*¬†‚Äì¬†*The Myth of Er*.

Here‚Äôs a brief outline and description of why I think it‚Äôs related to dimensionality, NHI, and our purpose in the material world.

**Summary**

Socrates shares his belief with Plato that an impious man can get into Heaven by hiding his impiety behind moral action. Plato‚Äôs response in the¬†*Myth of Er*¬†is that through the process of reincarnation, even the impious will eventually chose to incarnate in a position that makes their impiety obvious.

For example; a stone mason could be a moral actor, and live their life according to virtues. They would thus be inducted into Heaven upon their death. If, however, in their mind, the stone mason was always dissatisfied and thoughtless in their previous incarnation, they would inevitably chose the life of a tyrant or something similar when it is time for them to reincarnate.

To simplify, if someone only goes through the motions of being a pious, moral, and virtuous person ‚Äìwithout awareness to the deeper meaning and purpose behind their action‚Äì then that person is failing to gain the experience of their material incarnation. Thus, any such person would be required to repeat the lessons of material incarnation.

Plato doesn‚Äôt really get into the goals of the cycle of reincarnation, but perhaps the cycle can be seen as a kind of evolution of the soul. In each subsequent incarnation, those that chose wisely in thought and action will inevitably be rewarded with greater and more powerful experiences. Those who are moral in action but immodest in thought will be required to incarnate over and over until they learn the lessons required by the cycle.

**Relation to Dimensionality/NHI**

I would think that the entities (even our own higher self) who guide the cycle of reincarnation would be able to manifest themselves in our material reality. They may do this to help draw our awareness to those lessons that need to be learned.

I wonder if your experience ‚Äìand others like it‚Äì represent a kind of not-so-subtle nudge to help us understand that we are here to learn. If we‚Äôre not learning, or repeating mistakes from past incarnations, perhaps that is when NHI show themselves to us, deliver profoundly meaningful experiences, all in an attempt to get us back on the right path.

REPLY:

  
Thanks for dropping in. I don't wish to abuse and overburn you with my blabbing but given the sensitive nature of the topic you touch , I am afraid this will be the case, thanks for bearing with me in advance. Appreciate your patience.

I see where you are going with this, I wanted to purposely avoid having this conversation - for now at least - someone similarly asked in a comment - to my post ""more than meets the eye"" - what I thought about The Law of One -¬† and I was hoping I could postpone this discussion, for fear of alienating other fellow curious souls longing for answers, same way we all are - myself included - answers which unfortunately I cannot present to you. I can only speak about my personal beliefs and experiences. And that my friend is no good - because the truth on this plane is not absolute - it is but a personal construct of which each one of us chooses to believe.

You see, my main goal (see my posts, let's not distract ourselves) up until now has been nothing but advocating for sparking curiosity and getting people to interact with the phenomenon - ever since the mass sightings commenced.

As I said I have been ‚Äúavoiding‚Äù this topic on purpose because it is one that may cause division and rejection among many - and that is fundamentally against the message I ""sense"" from the presence of these lovely visitors. They advocate kindness, compassion and ultimately liberation. Not division, greed, indifference, false promises or captivity - concepts that seem to be our daily bread. Concepts that some of us have come to accept as necessary on this plane. Some sort of coping mechanism we choose to believe in order to make sense of all the pain in this world perhaps?

But let's get to the point, the reasons why I do not believe cycles of reincarnation to be necessary for breaking the wheel of the ‚Äúsamsara‚Äù being namely;

I believe humanity in essence is all loving, compassionate and kind. The absolute innocence inherent to babies and kids is proof of this, one could argue.

Therefore, I do not believe there is nothing to be learned or achieved on this plane. Only something to remember - an inner journey towards discovering your innate nature. Gnosis, nirvana or awakening according to modern terminology. Which to me is not achieving a state of enlightenment but again, rather a sense of remembering - a state of awareness of your true nature¬† - who we are and where we come from.

Isn't it funny how when you are going through a bad batch in your life the sh!ts0rm comes in the form of a hurricane?

When you are having a bad day, everything seems to go wrong

When you are running late, all the stoplights seem to be red along the way.

Makes me wonder.¬†

In addition, I further suspect this world to be inherently predatory, parasitic and hostile

If we look at the core of life in this universe - we will find cells. Cells are innately aggressive and predatory, a cell will instinctively attack another cell in order to consume ""its essence"" -¬† if you will - in order to further thrive. This principle is a common denominator in this existence.

Plants consume minerals, animals consume plants, bigger animals consume smaller animals, humans consume other lifeforms in order to thrive. See the pattern here?¬†

One life devours another; this is the unbroken cycle that fuels existence, where the end of one is the beginning of another.

And I would dare say the chain doesn't end with humanity at the top, but likewise we serve as *"" an energy source""* for other beings higher up. We can discuss this some other time - there is plenty on our plate right now already.

Let's take a flower for example ‚Äì if you love and admire flowers, would you rip its petal from its being to possess it, or would you let it thrive in all its nature, beauty, and freedom? You nurture it with care, feeding it what it needs to flourish, not forcing it to bend to your will, as per to your needs.

Instead, if you would use your ‚Äúsuperiority‚Äù to bend it to your will, control or manipulate it for a personal desired outcome. Imposing your will to achieve certain outcomes goes against its true free nature, and would be deeply unfair to the flower, wouldn't you agree? Some sort of hidden agenda? Quite literally speaking.

Humans in their turn, know what is best for them innately and by default we can tell right and wrong since we are born, we don't need to experience anything to arrive at this understanding. Innate empathy and compassion are embedded in us as a species.¬†

For example, When you were a kid and you hurt another kid by accident or on purpose, how did you feel about yourself when you saw the other kid cry? Awful didn't you?¬†

Yet, you didn't need anyone to come to talk to you about it, more than likely you were already aware of this before even being capable¬† of speech and that is because again, I absolutely believe us humanity as a collective are kind and compassionate by default.

Yet we are corrupted by the environment. We accept suffering as some sort of survival/coping¬† mechanism we develop to deal with our hostile environment.¬†

Can you stand before your own reflection in the mirror, hand pressed gently over your heart, and honestly say that the suffering you've endured on this plane was truly necessary for something greater‚Äîsomething beyond our current understanding, something that perhaps we barely even grasp? Can you claim, with conviction, that all the pain, loss, and hardship you‚Äôve faced served a higher purpose, a reason that justifies its weight? Well, I can‚Äôt. Not with certainty, nor with peace in my soul. The idea that suffering is an essential stepping stone toward something we know so little about feels like an empty promise to me.

If this is a school of some sorts, how can you graduate if you forget the subject you were supposed to learn each semester?

If indeed, the samsara wheel/cycle of reincarnation is something we need to go through in order to grow, then why do we not see that reflected in our daily lives?

If that were indeed the case, then wouldn't we have ""kind-compassionate"" figures to follow as an example in this plane? Lead the way by example, benchmark sort of speak?

Yet if you look around yourself in this world, the people we ""idolize"" are nothing but the opposite? Look at our leaders, politicians, celebrities, athletes, etc.

When someone ""triumphs"" on this plane, do we celebrate the way they achieved success ? Do we encourage kindness and compassion as ways to achieve ""success""?

Au contraire, we celebrate our idols based on their wealth and fame, we reward greediness and individualism as a society.¬†

This is a dog eat dog world, the process or intentions matter nothing on this plane, only the ultimate result/reward, nevermind the means.

I reject the idea that any being or force requires my submission for truth or learning. We all have divine free will, and ‚Äúthese entities‚Äù need our consent. On the other hand, these other beings - our cousins from beyond - if you will -¬† interacting with us now - respecting our choices, being transparent, present and subtle in their demeanor. Ultimately, we decide where we go‚Äîhere or elsewhere. They are longing to ‚Äúreconnect ‚Äúwith you - if you so wish.

See, all those years ago when I had my first contact experience, the beings that I encountered - our cousins from beyond - reached me , the same way they are reaching out to you‚Ä¶ again in a compassionate and gentle way. I for one can say that I am far from a saint my friend, I am prone to carnal wishes and sins like all of us - and boy have I wronged. I am only human after all.¬†

Yet in spite of my shortcomings, these gentle beings that are visiting us, presented themselves to me in a subtle, loving way - far from casting judgments on my actions and shortcomings and keeping me in the dark, as others would.¬† They are doing the same to all of us on a massive scale. Again, what I¬† am trying to say is if an entity or someone wants the best for you, you can recognize it easily by positive reinforcement/transparency not by tricks, games, riddles or tests you need to complete - with intentions/agenda unbeknownst to you.

I am somewhat familiar with Greek Philosophy/Mythology, you use the Myth of the Er as an example. Take a look at the Myth of Sisyphus - where a man is told to climb up a mountain, only to be told time and time again, he didn't do it well enough, yet he needs to repeat the ordeal with no clues of what he did wrong in the first place. Does that seem fair or productive?¬†

The most important thing we have in this life is our minds .Do not give that power away to any other human, being or entity. Less so, if they appear to be deceiving in their ways.

You have touched a very interesting topic here, my friend. One that we could speak for hours - how I wish we could be sitting over a coffee discussing these interesting topics but now I am short of time and I have returned to my main objective: spreading the message, incentivize curiosity and most importantly - getting people to interact and ‚Äúspeak‚Äù with our cousins from beyond. They are waiting on you out there - if you so desire.

I started this text by pointing out how truth is not absolute but a personal construct of ours and I will finish by repeating that‚Ä¶¬† take what resonates with you. Be it from Plato, Jung, myself or anything else anyone ever tells you.   
  
***What would it look like to live in a world where each of us acts in harmony with our true, compassionate nature, free from the constraints of control and suffering?***  
  
Maybe we are closer to finding out than they would have you believe. Enjoy the show. We meet again soon. Thanks for your time.

1hsxpr3,https://i.redd.it/hhmtcpk4luae1.jpeg,I‚Äôve made a huge mistake,"So I was out picking up some stuff for a NYE party as well as a couple hot sauces as a Christmas present for a buddy of mine when I saw these.

I kind of expected to pop them open at the party as a snack, but there was a lot of food and they were sort of forgotten.

I stood in the kitchen for about a minute, then actually excused myself back to the bedroom where I laid down and just breathed through it. Eyes watering, ears burning, and eventually stomach cramps.

Things I liked: the food, general ease of moving from stage to stage, both indoor and outdoor options, general artsy vibe, relatively clean bathrooms

Things I felt could be improved: I felt things in the walking areas and outskirts of stages could‚Äôve been a bit cleaner. More sitting areas. Coffee!

Best performances (imo ofc):

- Odd Mob: dude really threw down. I‚Äôd never seen him before and didn‚Äôt know what to expect but he‚Äôs a great performer

- Matroda: that 360 experience was something else. Every track was slick. The production of that stage was reallyyy nice, and he was my fav set at it. I‚Äôll def see him again.

- DJ Peewee: pure euphoria and fun, really versatile set that I think everyone was smiling at. The music was great, combining songs everyone loves to sing along to with some new stuff. He commands a crowd well and is just a blast to watch. 

- Shay De Castro: best techno set of the night for me. Me and my entire friend group arrived at the beginning and couldnt bring ourselves to leave the entire set. I would‚Äôve liked to have seen her at the 360 stage but it was super hot and underground feeling in G&M which worked!

Enrico Sangiuliano: dude is a master in every sense of the word. I think I would‚Äôve liked him to have done the countdown but regardless it was amazing. Very cerebral and exciting set, with plenty of tracks I hadn‚Äôt heard before.

When I called Nespresso the first time for technical assistance, they sent me a descaling solution. It worked for a few times when the problem reoccurred going forward. Sometime after that, it started leaking water again. The last time the problem occurred again, the descaler did not work. The machine now does not even turn on anymore.

I called Nespresso today and they cannot service the machine since the warranty expired. They have not offered any option to repair the machine outside the warranty. They only offered me 35% discount to purchase a new one. That is only 5% more on top of the current 30% discount offered to any new online customer right now. I asked for a case number for today's call, but they don't assign case numbers to customer calls. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and they are currently in a ""meeting"".  First time I hear a supervisor is in a meeting when calling customer service and you ask for one. They said a supervisor will call me back within 48 hours. Will see.

I bought other Nespresso machines in 2012 and 2013, never had a problem. Looks like this one is a piece of garbage and perhaps all new models are the same now. The cost of capsules is going up this month. In 10+ years I have given Nespresso thousands of dollars in coffee capsules. It is outrageous that they are pushing customers to buy a machines every 3-4 years since their machines will not last longer than that!

I have seen many people online having the same issue with Nespresso machines. Someone posted on Reddit too. Looks like a scam business model from Nespresso to get you spend even more money on top of the already very expensive capsules.

I read the details on  75 HARD then was like, this is not going to work exactly as is for me where I'm at (50lbs overweight + sciatica flareup + spina bifida + hormone stuff).  I never seem to follow directions but I CAN be disciplined, just wanted some structure so 75 medium I guess is what I'm doing?  Basically trying to not set myself up for failure

1. Drink 3L of water (I'm an actual camel and even when thru hiking often I drink less than this in a day, 4L sounds insane to me so 3 it is).
2. Outside workout, no specified length (but probably 20 min - 1 hr.  We shall see)
3. Where-ever workout, no specified length (probably either yoga class or weights).  These 2 workouts can be any amount of time from each other
4. Diet: 100g protein/day; aiming for <1600 cal but not stressing over it; whole foods/mostly cooking at home (unavoidable for me sometimes to eat out)
5. Diet part 2: if I am tempted to buy a snack etc and I don't, I put the amount it would have cost into a HYSA
6. Diet part 3: I'm trying to use up the food in our house and/or dumpster dive
7. No alcohol- this feels like it's going to be very hard, luckily I have less social engagements this time of year.  Surprised by the amount of resistance in myself I'm already feeling.  I can have mocktails, and I can have bitters (yes technically small amount of alcohol) if I'm out (like bitters in club soda)
8. Self-help book 10 pgs- TBH this is like nothing for me, I read probably a hundred books a year
9. Meditate 10 minutes- I added this bc I want to get back to it, and it's a much harder challenge for me than #7
10. Selfie (ugh I hate selfies)

I am using 75HARD app to track, Headspace for meditation, and MFP for food tracking.

Day 1: I had off of day job for once, woooooo!  I was up late gigging NYE tho, a lil digsausted.  I only slept in an extra hour though despite going to bed close to 3a.  I did a lil hike during the day and on the way home I hit some places I wanted to check out for DD'ing.  One of the places I heard about was absolute gold.  I was a little sketch but I got a huge unopened bag of organic tortilla chips to bring to a band rehearsal as well as unopened/new organic 2lb grape tomatoes, and organic avocados.  I scouted a TON of other healthy stuff but the temps weren't the best.  I was tempted to buy a snack so I put $5 into HSYA instead.  We're expecting colder weather soon so I'm glad I went when store was closed to scout it out and get comfortable.  This is going to be incredible I can't wait!

I was able to go to hot yoga in the evening since I didn't have to work, that was awesome.  The teacher switched his schedule and I haven't been able to go for months.  It was a little hard to hit 100g protein I got it just barely.

Day 2: Strong protein start, I had a bunch of meat sticks for breakfast.  I went for a hike in local tiny woodsy park with a trail in it and a guy was back there hunting w/a rifle, WTF?  Had to call DEA and police.  I finished work a little early and went to gym for 1st time in a while, my sciatica has been bad for a few weeks but last couple days I think I'm on the other side of it.  I used sauna also.  Protein was easier to get today but I had 2 bars and a shake to do it.  Definitely a WIP.

Day 3: this is my longest day of work for day job.  My husband and I stayed up late the night before watching tv, prolly I shouldn't have?  I hope this challenge helps me w/my boundaries.  I got a coffee on my way to work, I was tempted to eat a croissant but didn't, $4.50 -> HYSA.  I did buy lunch but I got it from a healthier place and it was good and not carby/decent protein.  
Work was dead, I had a huge break in the middle.  I came up with outside workout: couple blocks away there are staircases on either side of the road, and a block further there is another longer set.  I made a circuit of these with couple minute walk warm-up/cool down to/from work.  I will keep this in mind: why did I never do it before.  I also did a yin yoga session via youtube.  
Planning my dinner now, I will have buckwheat noodles/canned salmon/grape tomatoes. I wasn't sure I'd be able to have that much of noodles since I was struggling last 2 days with protein but I can as long as I measure olive oil out to 1.5tsp only.

Heavy cyclists and bike commuters. Walking to stuff. Coffee shops, restaurants, music, etc all the basic DINK stuff with no kids. Granola hippy stuff preferred. We‚Äôd like to be near the city center areas VS out on the edge or a long drive away. 

NEIGHBORHOOD:

I recall the state streets in Urbana being pretty great. Is this a good spot? Referring to my map attachments does the neighborhood change much? Looking for a house under 300k that has a safe, friendly, clean, neighborhood vibe to it. The type of place people walk to refill laundry detergent in a recycled glass container and talk about their Grateful Dead shirts together. 

WORRIES:

Is it boring? Will f350 punisher stickered trucks yell ‚Äúlibtard‚Äù because I‚Äôm on a bike? How‚Äôs the diversity and general culture? If I‚Äôm not a student can I still enjoy the campus area? I know it‚Äôs cold and snowy but coming from Albuquerque and Atlanta my wife is nervous. ",11,1735939856.0,illinois,19,0.92,False

I'm looking for a roommate to move into a 2 bedroom apartment in Lower Allston that I have lived in for the last 5 years with someone else. Here are the details:

* **Location:** Lower Allston, close to many parks, Trader joes, HBS, Star market, restaurants, public transit (66, 86, 70 within 5m, red/green line about a 15 minute walk).
* **Availability:** 2/1 would be the move in date, upon moving in the landlord would like us to sign a new lease that would run until 7/31.
* **Rent:** $1200/month + utilities (usually \~$160 depending on season).
* **About the Apartment:** Spacious 2 bedroom with a full living, dining and kitchen space. Washer and dryer are in the unit. Street parking is typically available. The bedroom available isn't huge but has a great closet and the apartment has a good amount of space. It's an older apartment but i've much enjoyed the time I've spent here. Photos are of the furnished room but it would not come furnished (TBD depending on what the person moving out takes). 
* **About Me:** I'm 31 year old guy, I quit my full-time job last year to pursue an undergraduate degree while I work at a local coffee shop. I'm pretty quiet, clean and laid back. I love to cook, take long walks and watch the NY knicks! I don't drink or smoke but do enjoy the 420. 
* **About You:** Looking for a non-smoking someone who is clean, respectful and easy-going. The apartment is not a place for parties but the occasional hang is fine. 

* **Pets:** I have a cat that is extremely cute but also very hyper so cat-lover is a must!

If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to DM me! I‚Äôd be happy to share more pictures and  info.

Looking forward to finding the right fit!

","I am trying my best to brew better coffee at home but i am striking out. ive switched to non bleached filters which has helped some, bought a new burr grinder (Baratza) which has also helped a little and also tried an array of coffee beans as well.  so now that leads me to point the finger at my brewer. 

 I currently have a Braun MultiServr brewer which honestly, ive hated since day 1 outside of the return window. üòë   its supposed to be SCA certified, the gold button, the best brew, and whatever else but all i can get this machine to do is, brew black water, water that smells like coffee and wheat tasting water.  

I stuck my Thermoworks thermapen under the brew head and the temps are bouncing wildly in all directions. 
 Current brew temps in order( all in Fahrenheit): 143, 168, 155, 177, 168, 172,184,184,188/187, 186, 178, 174,174,174.COMPLETED. 

Never once hitting a min. Of 190F im guessing is why im not getting a full flavor of coffee at any bean quality level.   

So now i wonder, if i cant trust the SCA certification then what else should i look for? I drink typical American coffee (auto drip makers) what auto drip brewers would you all recommend for a daily driver?    I love full flavor, chocolate-like  and med/dark brew.  How do i get there? What grind set should i use?      I have alot to learn :/

The suit she was wearing itched.

Not really. It was immaculately tailored by Mama-san on the Jerry's dime. Yet. It felt like it itched, and pinched, and a whole host of other minor annoyances and petty grievances. It made her look great. Official. Imposing even. Almost like a high end bodyguard or lawyer. Still feminine, but clearly a bad bitch. It looked cool, which was more than a lot of women could say for their work clothes. It had all sorts of functions in it that would let her fight and thrive if a fight was pushed on them.

It was great.

Yet. It felt like it belonged to someone else. Like Jab was just cosplaying, an imposter in her own life. This was what she thought she'd wanted after all. She had a real job. Two in fact. One on the commercial side of the Bridger family while serving as an advisor directly to Jerry himself.

This was a great opportunity. She'd gotten to know Jerry over the last few weeks while they'd been in transit to Primus and conducting weapons testing with Cannid Solutions on the surface of the world's moon. She'd worked closely with him. It was delightful, but it still just felt... weird. She was just her. What the fuck was she doing here? Then again, by that logic she should be doing jail time or dead in a dumpster somewhere back on Narkaris, or more likely back on Coburnia's Rest. She was no one. Yet. Somehow. Here she was.

Now whether that meant she was closer to scoring Jerry as a boyfriend, never mind a husband, that was a different story. He was clearly content to let her do her thing, but that also meant he was more passive than many Human men, observing her and letting her make moves as she pleased. More aggressive moves he'd evade, or play off for a smile and a joke between the two of them, but every now and then a more gentle move would see them having a lunch that didn't involve work. Or coffee. Or being invited to the Den for dinner.

Meeting the Bridgers proper had been pretty eye opening too. An honest to the goddess Apuk fucking princess! A battle princess too, which was its own kind of mind-blowing, but like, an actual no shit princess! It hadn't been a marriage meeting or anything, she wasn't anywhere near that yet, she could tell that much, but everyone had clearly been evaluating her in one way or another. The Bridger clan's matriarch Sylindra was even more regal and imposing than the princess! To say nothing of the collection of senior officers, executives, academics and doctors that made up the bulk of the family.

Not that there weren't normal girls in the family too. Even from her kind of former employment. She'd been very surprised to hear that Bari Bridger had been a smuggler, and even held Jerry at gunpoint at one point! An amazing story in that Bari hadn't ended up with a smoking hole in her head, and even gotten a job offer. Not unlike Jab herself really... and if Bari could claw her way up and into Jerry's arms, well surely she could do that right?

First though, she had to prove to herself, if no one else, that she deserves to be here. That this was actually her life and not some charade she was putting on pretending to be a somewhat respectable sapient lifeform.

Part of her wonders though, if that's what she actually wants. This was a long way from running her own crew. From taking her seed money on Coburnia's Rest and going pirate or smuggling or something. Living completely free and on her own terms. The Bridgers and the Undaunted, had a lot of rules. They were quite regimented, disciplined as a society. The sensation of chains rankled her a bit, and that she'd put the chains on of her own volition upset a part of her on a deep fundamental level.

The slight jolt of the Olympia hitting the atmosphere snaps her head back up and she gazes out the window to consider the world they were rapidly approaching.

Primus wasn't Centris, but it did a decent impression, massive arcologies dotting the surface like massive beehives, a world that had once been little thought of was now the 'capital' of one of the largest mega corporations, not just in Cannidor space, but in the galaxy. Cannid Solutions was a pride of the Cannidor people in that sense, employing untold billions galaxy wide, shipping trillions of tons of goods in every possible category...

Jab turns herself a bit and clears her throat, getting Jerry and the rest of the official party's attention. Time to earn her pay.

""Okay folks, we're on approach so let's recap. Primus, formerly Gol'Shak, was purchased by the clans that would form Cannid Solutions a couple centuries ago along with the rest of the star system, and I do mean they bought it, no need for an honor duel, the house that used to own it, which I believe has since been subsumed into one of the Cannid Solutions corporate houses entirely, thought little of this world, but one of Cannid Solution's first major innovations was a suite of surveying and resource extraction tools. They then put that to work and built themselves up on raw materials, both to trade and to fuel their growing manufacturing sector.""

She hooks a finger out the porthole at the massive cityscape expanding below them, the home of trillions of lives from across the galaxy.

""This is the result. Cannid Solutions operates in just about every domain imaginable under a wide variety of names, but they're obviously best known for their work in the defense and security sectors. Some of that's careful image management by the various corporate officers who control their sub branches. Many people don't know that Mei'shen Pharmaceuticals, makes combat first aid kits and systems to allow power armor to repair the meat inside it while in combat along with scar erasing patches, memory retention headbands for healing comas, disinfectant and a host of other medical supplies ranging from daily use, to emergency stock for hospitals.""

Sylindra nods, the imposing gaze of the Volpiri vixen threatening to make Jab shudder for just a moment.

""Intriguing. I did not in fact know that about Mei'shen, and I've dealt with them before. Don't they have a Kobold in control of the company?""

""As director of operations and the public face, the chief executive is a Cannidor. She has a taste for high end cigars and citrus brandy.""

Jerry smiles. ""Regular customer for the Black Khans?""

""Nah. Just the occasional 'gift'. Actual gifts, not really a proper bribe. Girls get hurt, being able to freely buy medical supplies without too many questions is important. No gifts get the Khans weapons on the up and up but the tribute for medical supplies is generally accepted on the down low by most producers. Payment up front covers the rest, and in the end it's just medical supplies.""

Diana sits up a bit and snorts. ""Just medical supplies my ass. You can use the entire list of things Mei'shan manufacturers in nefarious ways, but neither here nor there I suppose. Go on Jab.""

""Right. Anyway, so Cannidor corporate space is also ruled from here. Sorta. 'Ruled' isn't the word. They're a bunch of systems that nominally have a joint board that meets to discuss intersystem or interplanetary issues and agree on various regulations, as well as implementing Cannidor law properly. They don't really have true 'legal' authority but have the power to brutally punish a corporation that looks like it's going to fuck up their special legal status. Being in corporate space gives them a lot of protections and some tax benefits that are quite lucrative on this scale.""

Sylindra smiles. ""Ah, a subject near and dear to my heart. Tax evasion.""

Jerry reaches over and rests his hand over Syl's, an honest moment of pure affection between husband and wife that makes Jab's heart weep with envy before Jerry sets his focus back on Jab.

""So the laws are looser here?""

""Looser and enforcement is far more relaxed. There's some worlds that are practically entirely controlled by a cartel, be it the Black Khans or another group. There's also a couple 'Black Moons' which are hidden smuggling bases that serve as unofficial trade hubs. Pirates offload loot, smugglers drop contraband, that sorta thing and can trade with gray market merchants. They pay heavy tithes to the appropriate sources so they're protected, but it still makes one criminal organization or another filthy rich.""

Jab gestures to the world outside the Olympia's view port again.

""So as 'kinetic' as normal Cannidor society can be, corporate space can be even more rough and tumble. For all the traditionalists can be real bitches when they want to be, the colder corps? If you fall off the radar you're off the radar and on your own. The cracks in this kind of area are deep and dark and the goddess only knows what kinds of monsters lurk in a lot of them. So if we're wandering around we need to be really damn careful. Our average Undaunted is about to be the most dangerous thing on this rock, but keeping the crew to prescribed areas by Cannid Solutions‚Äô staff is the best call if at all possible.""

""Any particular risk factors you're tracking from your connections Jab?"" Jerry asks, clearly considering her words with great seriousness.

""Nothing so far, we got away clean with eliminating the Cruelfang Cartel on Narkaris, and whatever evidence there was is getting lost in the shuffle of Khan Charocan's girls going on a purge, especially after the extent of Madame Cruelfang's slaving operation was leaked. The warrior clans might seem callous in many respects but there's some things they absolutely don't tolerate and that's one of their major hot button issues, especially for the older clans.""

Diana writes a few notes into her communicator with a stylus.

""Why is there such a strong cultural hatred of slavery among the older warrior clans anyway?""

Jab shrugs. ""Simple. Most of them started out as slave clans. A lot of those girl's ancestors were in chains back on Canis Prime, and the first Golden Khan was the woman who led the uprising that crushed the old order.""

""Fascinating, but we're almost on the ground. Anything else we need to know Jab? What about for our excursion to the lower parts of the city later?""

JUST WAIT! I came to my senses, realized celiacs or not that was gross, theres health codes for a reason, got out of the car and walked back in. I explained to the girl my concerns over her eating 'crackers' over my food. I get it I've worked in fast paced jobs and fast food, you gotta eat when you can. ""They were sunchips"". Even worse, I know for a fact just looking at those is gonna make me depressed for a week. Then we go to the opposite extreme.

I had been maintaining pretty well with OMAD but over the past year my weight has crept back up.  Then the recent holiday season and I'd had enough.  So I decided to incorporate some more prolonged fasts into my routine.

  
I'm currently at the 46 hour mark of what I had hoped or planned to be a 5 day fast.  I feel great.  Was not really hungry.

  
The twist is.  I work from home and have two school age boys.  I make dinner for them every evening for when they get home from school.  After dinner, we then usually head out for activities such as soccer, taekwondo, baseball, etc...  I just made a nice dinner for them.  It is sitting on the stove for when the youngest gets off the bus.  I know it is going to be good and I want to eat it.

  
My question is, how do you deal with cooking for other people while fasting?  I've certainly done it many many times in the past.  But I find it harder and harder these days.

We got coffee together almost every day, had chats, and even hung out outside the office a couple of times. 

Last July, our company announced it was shutting down and merging with a sister company. Only 25% of the staff would be retained in the new structure. I was fortunate‚Äîmy position was secured without any competition. Others weren‚Äôt as lucky and had to compete with their peers during a three-month consultation period to prove their worth (or leave with the redundancy package). 

This consultation period allowed all staffs to pitch ideas to management and argue their case for staying in the new structure. Most people focused on showing how they‚Äôd fit into the sister company. My colleague, though? She went all out. Weekly one-on-ones with the higher-ups.m. It was painfully obvious how desperate she was to stay.

At one point, she even accused another colleague of trying to sabotage her chances by saying she wasn‚Äôt qualified for the role. No one had actually said that. Still, it was an awkward situation because, truth be told, her skills didn‚Äôt align well with the new company‚Äôs needs. Everyone knew it, but nobody dared to say it out loud.

I eventually decided to take the redundancy package and move on. I‚Äôd already lined up a new job and felt relieved to leave the chaos behind. She was on the verge of being laid off when my departure freed up my position. Management ended up giving it to her.

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd be grateful or at least acknowledge what had happened. Instead, she stopped talking to me entirely. When I returned from my holiday, she stopped talking to me completely. It was very strange, and I tried initiating conversations when she just simply refused.

By the time my last day rolled around, we hadn‚Äôt exchanged a single word. 

I‚Äôve come to realize that redundancy and layoff periods bring out different sides of people. For me, it was about moving forward. For her, it was survival at all costs. It wasn‚Äôt a great experience, and it definitely changed how I see workplace friendships.",7,1735938401.0,Layoffs,7,1.0,False

I‚Äôve recently upgraded to a Gaggia Classic Pro and I‚Äôm on the hunt for a bottomless portafilter to go with it. I previously had a Normcore bottomless portafilter for my DeLonghi Dedica Arte and loved it ‚Äì it had a really nice weight to it and felt high quality.

Normcore makes a 58mm portafilter for the Gaggia (Amazon) but it‚Äôs on the pricier side. I‚Äôve also come across ones from Shades of Coffee, which is about half the price, and KNODOS (Etsy and Amazon) but reviews seem to be a bit mixed for both.

Has anyone used any of these brands or can recommend a good bottomless portafilter for the Gaggia Classic Pro? I‚Äôm UK-based, so any recommendations that are easily available here would be ideal.

I tell myself I‚Äôm going to pick up as many things as I can or do as many tiny tasks as possible until it boils and shuts off. It takes about 1-2 minutes. It gets increasingly louder as it gets closer to being ready which just adds to the excitement and gamification. And at the end, I get coffee and enough dopamine to get on with life.

1hswpj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hswpj8/service_advisor_against_trucker/,Service advisor against trucker,"I (40F) worked at a truck stop ( a big one) in the shop for about 8 years off and on as a service writer. For those who don't know what that is the best way to tell you is if you have ever taken your car to a shop for work or repairs to be done the people that you talk to that write up a work order for what ever you need done. It's the same thing except for semi trucks. Now that being said to work at a truck stop or any shop for that matter you cannot have thin skin.. you get harassed, teased or even hit on . Flirted with and so for by drivers and sometimes the techs you work with.. 
Yes if you can take it just as easily as you can dish it and you dish out what you take you can't go home crying to your mamma. Sorry... 
Now there are lines that won't be crossed done get me wrong by all parties.  
Drivers come in pissed off because their truck is broken or something and you also need to learn how to handle them also . Again thick skin and you are good..  as long as you greet them with respect and know which ones you can fuck with you will be golden.. 
Now all that said we offer warranties in case one of our techs fucks something up yes we are human and shit happens.. there was a service writer that had a driver come in showed her what we did wrong and asked for us to fix it no big deal . Or so you'd think . Apparently she kept putting him off with no real reason. 
I came into work at 8am now granted the tech that was working overnight wasn't the greatest tech. Again shit happens she informed driver that at 8am our better techs would be in. He was annoyed that he had to wait till 8 but he got over it but kept voicing his thoughts.  
Que me walking into the shop and I talk to the driver inform him that my tech will start on his truck in the next 15min because he had to get his uniform on and get his coffee and I apologized for the BS and waiting that he had done. The service writer that he'd dealt with all night was still in the clock for some dumb fuck of a reason.. he went on to say he's been waiting all night for a simple repair and I let him speak and vent so I could get a better idea of what was going on I had already went and got the parts he needed to be fixed and had them in the shop and his truck staged.  After a few min of him venting she jumped in and went off and started cussing at him . Not in a way a employee should mind you. Drivers are important people also. 
Well she was going on and on and I tried in a professional manner to tell her to talk a walk but. She didn't listen. Whatever she's grown.. she finished off saying to the driver that he kept saying he's a grown ass man but he was sounding like a little bitch.. now in her defense yea he was being a bit of an ass but again we did something wrong so he's allowed to be a little mad . I told her enough and to go home or something.. I apologized to the driver and he informed us that he was in the phone with his wife and recorded the whole thing.. well that was awesome. 

Now this truck stop is a word of mouth advertising so we don't do billboards or TV commercial. So after she went home I went back and tried to calm this man down he said he wasn't going to wait anymore and left I told him he can go to a another site and they'd fix it for free as long as they called me. 
Well after he left I went and told my boss ( no I'm not the type to snitch on people but that was my job) I informed him and if course he couldn't simply take my word for it and I understood he had to make sure I wasn't just trying to get her fired. So he had me call her and put it on speaker because he had to hear it from her. Again I understand why he needed to do that he sat there silently while I talked to her and told her the driver was going to call corporate and complain and everything so I needed to hear from her she tried just saying I was there and I heard everything. I informed her that I wasn't there for everything but she did admit to calling him a little bitch. After hearing that my boss said you can't do that and thanked her for her work that she no longer has a job there . 
So am I the ass hole because I got her fired?

1hswni4,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1hswni4/trip_report_5_weeks_in_se_asia_seoul/,Trip Report - 5 weeks in SE Asia + Seoul,"Previous trip reports helped me immensely in planning this trip so I thought I would give back and post by 2 cents.

**Budget:** $3K

**Trip Length:** 5 weeks

**Destination(s):**

Kuala Lumpur: 3 Nights

Yogyakarta: 2 Nights

Malang: 1 Night

Bromo/Ijen Tour: 1 Night

Canggu: 3 Nights

Nusa Lembongan: 3 Nights

Ubud: 4 Nights

Cebu: 1 Night

Panglao Island: 3 Nights

Siquijor Island: 6 Nights

Manila: 2 Nights

Seoul: 6 Nights

**Accommodation:**

Stayed mostly in hostels except for night hotel in Cebu (had a flight land in the evening and took ferry to Panglao Island the next morning) and 1 night hotel as part of the Ijen/Bromo tour.

3 hostels that really stood out to me were:

Bohol Coco Farm in Panglao Island

Fable Hostel in Siquijor Island

ZZZip Guesthouse in Seoul

**Activities:**

Organized by Destination

Kuala Lumpur: Petronas Towers, Chinatown, Brickfields neighborhood, Batu Caves. Not too much to do for a big city, but a nice place to get over jetlag on the first stop of the trip.

Yogyakarta: Prambanan and Borbodur Temple Tour

Malang + Bromo/Ijen: Base for departure for Bromo/Ijen Tour. I booked a 2 day 1 night tour through the hostel. Was absolutely amazing and worth it.

Canngu: Chilled at beach, partying.

Nusa Lembongan: Snorkeling tour booked through hostel, relaxed at beach.

Ubud: Day trip booked via hostel to see waterfalls, coffee tour, and rice paddies. Monkey Forest in Ubud, Cooking class, day trip to temples and more rice paddies.

Panglao Island: Chocolate Hills, Island Day Trip, Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary

Siquijor Island: Exploring Waterfalls, Apo Island Day Trip, Beaches

Seoul: DMZ tour, museums, food, Inwangsan Mountain hike, palaces, explore neighborhoods

**What Went Right:**

Almost everything! Had solo travelled before, but not for this long, but never felt lonely. Met numerous people at hostels to hang out with. I mostly booked stuff last minute (1 or 2 days before) and there was plenty of availability for hostels and tours. I finally learned to ride a motorbike and didn't get injured so that was a big win!

**What Went Wrong:**

The only complaint was spending 3 nights in Canggu. I'm not a surfer and while I do enjoy the occasional party, I was over it after 1 night. Would have rather spent an extra night in Ubud. The other thing that kind of sucked was that Ijen Crater is known for having blue fire but due to a recent eruption we weren't able to see the blue fire.

**Recommendations:**

Siquijor Island: It is uncrowded and filled with absolutely beautiful beaches. Bucafe is the perfect spot to see unreal sunsets and I went there almost every night. There are also numerous waterfalls for jumping and swimming on the island.

Nusa Lembongan: It's 30 minutes by speedboat from Bali. I stayed at Dream Beach Hostel which was less than a 10 minute walk to Dream Beach and Sunset Beach. Both beaches have a restaurant overlooking the beach selling extremely affordable drinks, making it the perfect spot to spend an afternoon/evening.

Yogyakarta + Bromo/Ijen Tour: While mostly travelers head to Bali, I would recommend spending at least a few days in Java. The temples in Yogyakarta are worth visiting before taking the train to Malang (very easy to book and can be done the day before) for Bromo/Ijen. Even though I couldn't see the blue fire, the sunrise overlooking Mount Bromo is one of the most unreal things I've witnessed.

**Final Verdict:**

This was the longest solo trip that I went on. I was extremely excited for the trip and thankfully it exceeded my already high expectations. While I would have liked to spend more time in each of the countries, I only had 5 weeks and thus wanted to get a taste of as many place as possible.",2,1735937381.0,solotravel,2,1.0,False

Other similar portable ecosystems will creep in from time to time (Steam Deck, Surface pro, etc) but concerns raised will generally be from a DeX perspective.   As always, no money has changed hands, and company providing the review samples has no input on the review, as they will see it as it's released, same as everyone else.    So let's get down to it!



\[UColor O2 Touch - 16:10 Monitor 16 Inch Portable 3K OLED Dislpay 120Hz Touchscreen\](https://www.uperfectmonitor.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor?\_pos=1&\_sid=dda4ee2e1&\_ss=r&sca\_ref=5101392.S1lwRXEetd)

The O2 is a 2880x1800 120hz OLED panel from UPERFECT.  It's a 16"" panel that covers 100% of the DCI-P3 colour palette, is touchscreen, and has a pair of rear firing stereo speakers.  

The speakers are rated at 8 ohm at 1W (aka they're usable, but you'll want headphones)

 The one main thing it does NOT have, is a battery.   More on this later...



The panel itself is very slim, and light.   Dimensionally it's roughly 3.5mm thick at the top, and the bump out at the bottom is about 6.5mm thick.    The folding screen cover/case/stand adds MAYBE 1mm total.

The physical dimensions are 354 √ó 242 √ó 6.5 mm (13.94 √ó 9.53 √ó 0.26 inch)



Quick Size comparison between previous UPERFECT panels we've reviewed in the last couple years:

[14\\"" X lite, 15.6\\"" V, 16\\"" O2](https://preview.redd.it/d0wanppr3uae1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da39adfd8de5295a6e6896a768dbe15038c417f1)



On the left was the weird little \[UPERFECT 14"" X lite\]([UPERFECT X Lite review : r/SamsungDex](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamsungDex/comments/qt7tnj/uperfect_x_lite_review/)).    This was actually my day to day secondary monitor on my Surface Pro roll top desk.   The screen is non-touch, but Matte, and was actually one of the better panels UPERFECT ever produced.

In the middle is the \[UPERFECT 15.6"" V\]([UPERFECT V 15.6"" wireless monitor Review : r/SamsungDex](https://www.reddit.com/r/SamsungDex/comments/11u2yiq/uperfect_v_156_wireless_monitor_review/)).  This was the ""wireless"" monitor that featured mmWave, that while it did provide AMAZING wireless capabilities, you needed a giant powered antenna to make it work.

  
On the right, is the new \[UPERFECT 16"" O2\](https://www.uperfectmonitor.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor?\_pos=1&\_sid=dda4ee2e1&\_ss=r&sca\_ref=5101392.S1lwRXEetd).  

  
The new O2 comes with 2 √ó Full-Featured USB Type-C for Audio & Video Input, 1 √ó mini HDMI for Audio & Video Input (seems to be HDMI 2.0).

  
Contrast ratio of 10,000:1 (yay oled), 1ms response time, and 500 nits of brightness.  the 16:10 2880x1800 isn't 100% supported in DeX, but it's close!

https://preview.redd.it/5h0kpowb5uae1.jpg?width=1460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5797d48a5d7fecb158f91c9cafcdff61f21c841

The 2560x1600 looks great on this panel, no extra black bars.  it'd be nice to have it support the actual native resolution, but it's still pretty good.



Windows and linux (steamOS) will both happily put out the 2880x1600 at 120hz 



But what about Image quality ?     I connected the O2 as well as the other 2 monitors (1 at a time) each to a port on my surface pro, so that I could mirror the same content to both monitors at the same time

  
I simply selected some youtube HDR test videos, and captured the following:



This is the 15.6"" V  vs the 16"" O2

All of these, were with a single usb-c cable from the surface, via tb4 to the X lite, or O2



# So now on to the disappointing bit:

  
A samsung phone is not capable of powering this display.

You will need external battery to make this monitor work for DeX.   To be fair, the Steam Deck can't power the display either...      Surface Pro 8 (or newer) with it's TB4 ports is happy to power it with a single cable though

  
With DeX connected, and external power (a 45w PD charger that came with a lapdock) it does pass thru power to the phone at a good rate:

https://preview.redd.it/er0iwpge7uae1.jpg?width=815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=594b1d45d52bf759d17ec33158efb147ca16049a

I'm still waiting for my USB-C power meter to arrive, but in general, the DeX setup consumes 6w of power during a relatively dark scene, and up to 8w during a brightly lit scene.  This includes powering the screen, and charging the phone all at the same time. 



the 2w difference between light and dark scenes was very consistent, but this relies on the rough measurements provided by jackery ;)

https://preview.redd.it/doqgngk78uae1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb0f06f0528983188ca39d17706d3f7764264c02



I'll revisit this once the actual meter finally arrives (hooray postal strike backlog!)



# The Controls

  
On the left side of the screen are 5 physical buttons for interacting with the OSD

https://preview.redd.it/b1le6nmo8uae1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1771ea545d3379362c75fd2860775e6a8383e55

The top button is the power toggle, while the other 4 are used for moving thru the menus.    You ARE able to toggle between the HDMI and the USB-C inputs, so you can technically use it for 2 different devices, at the same time.



IE you've got your work machine connected via USB-C, and then during your break, and only your break, you toggle to HDMI so that you can play some PS5.   

  
I've actually not fiddled a ton with the settings within, aside from flipping HDR to auto mode.   It just looks spectacular right out of the box



Now while the O2 did come with a nice screen cover, that doubles as a stand, it's pretty soft, and flimsy, and while it works in a pinch, I'd not want to use it daily, if that makes sense.

  
Uperfect was nice enough to also send along a VESA monitor stand, that works with the O2.

  
The O2 is compatible with all 75x75mm vesa standards

If you've got limited space (like I do) for a secondary monitor, this is a beautiful panel.  If you need a portable monitor to carry for work (where you KNOW you'll have a desk/power) I'd highly recommend it.  It's by far the best portable monitor I've had my hands on.    The downside of course is that it lacks a battery, and if you want to use it in the coffee shop, you NEED a battery, a power outlet, or a TB4 device, rather than just your DeX device :(





# Conclusion:



If you're in the market for a smaller, stay at home monitor, this is a fantastic choice.  It does come with a pretty big price tag though.   At the time of this review, it's listed at $399 CAD, reduced from $630 CAD.  I don't love the price

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",1,1735937239.0,StrangeEarth,0,1.0,False

Anxiety, I stopped drinking coffee or energy drinks to get my attention up. The club is too much of an overstimulation anyway.

For me if I only have had less than 5 hours of long night sleep, I see myself repeating basic patterns

The very first dehydration signal, usually happens the first 30 minutes or hour. After spending a whole day in the office to go out and dancing, we all need an hour or so to warm up and hydrate, I do not. But then I'm having too much fun to take a break and drink. Doesn't help when club is humid.

Other causes - Follows feel stiff. I agree it's ultimately up to the lead 99% of the time but some follows even when they're seasoned, just have quite stiff form or arms that I'm afraid to try anything different. When I do, it would feel like I'm trying to show off, when I actually don't intend to. I think the way to better this is to extremely slow down, almost like a sensual salsa. Thoughts?

On some nights, certain accents stick. Like that simple turn for the follow and elbow fold. I'll see myself doing it over and over again in the event. On better nights, I'd not only have this but remember variations, exits and entries to make it way nicer and neater. Some nights, I just don't.

December24 - issue N1

¬£700 as always expenses + ¬£105,000 for the building lol \[ boredom \] 

purchased a cheeky building or two  ( I was bored )

Asset 1 Freehold - 6000 sqft, ( all cash no debt, no loan, no repayment no outgoings this is pure money, a lick a fat tasty lick that replaces my income ).

\-  as is building will generate me ¬£2200 pcm as rental income. 

\- improvements over 3 months, around ¬£3500 pcm rent 

\- spend 3 months on it and repair the building ( imagine a derilict building empty shell corners broken and some environmental damage, no gas/water/electricity and some parts of the roof caved in ) between us my lovely money makers, I can do it all on my own it wont take me 3 months sooner than this date im being generous with myself, ¬£2000 to have it checked to standards and im ok. im resourceful and I can work till its done and this formula works.

  
inside the building there is an array off equipment \[ machinery  total value 10k ( forklift and other bits ) \], this has reduced the cost of the building by another 10% and payed off all refurb work if I pay somone and left extra for a new game. This reduces the total value of the building by 5%. 

  
I can get up to 50k in grants/funds frome the council to bring it into use for the local economy so again its all free money, this would essentialy make the building cost me half the price for this. 

  
Investment / Protection 

simple straightforward efficient. 

TRUST > LTD > SPV > protection mitigation ( creditors divorce lawsuits the everyday BAU expenses as I call them lol ) most times if I do something that causes a fine, its paid into a account and then I begin to make money on this so hopefully by the time they found out the fine has made me money, so far I have only ever gotten one fine.

Investement - no trading lololol { a wealth manager who worked for Citi said terrible stratergy and the data that I have seen and put together or had commissioned on day trading, crypto trading or even trading you loose 51% of the time, one off irregular wins is not a reliable stratergy }. I was thinking something amogst the lines hand picked averaged divident stocks, leave this as is for 1 year and keep all dividents in account just buying more. I dont need this money so it can be forgotten about. All tax free as my ISA/SIPPS nothing has been used in anyway

  
Asset 2 - freehold 1500 sqft  ( ¬£35,000 )

Options 1 >  ( takeaway business all licenses and the EPOS systems, I have purchased the LAND the BUILDING the BRICKS/MOTOR the business comes with it )  15k in equipment, 5k in inventory total 20k. I dont want to flip burgers so Ill give this to one my resources and tell him to run for 90 days maximum no increase this under any cirumstances, you can leave early if you want. no rent pay your bills and wages and keep all the profit. This allows me data to see if its worthwhile in keeping on as a business or rent it out, either way its a cash out asset again not a burden. 

Option 2 > rent it out for ¬£600pm, honestly I just dont want the headache for this its too little for me.  TERRIBLE option not even worth my time on my spreadsheet.

so if I go option 1, play with the cost of items and average the cost and minimise the profit, maximise reach and low ball the figure 45% on ¬£3, I can sell 240 meals a day as a minimum, cost of running it will be bills ( ¬£1200pcm + ¬£100 per day in wages), the cost is nothing on this little cash cow. I've pulled accounts for other business around the area public records and gov website, in essence reengineered the cost of the meal by finding the total and finding the average menu items gives me a good indepth idea) also this area is so deprived its not cash rich it feel like its strapped for cash like they struggle, in favour for long term business goal I wont raise the price higher than ¬£3 per meal. either way im making ¬£900 per day in sales and they are happy with the quality price so Im, cost at ¬£350 total profit at ¬£550 per day. 

If I go with option 1 what do I do with the asset+money, I was thinking of giving it to my brother and let him have his fun, experiance running a business something small before the big stuff he has to manage/maintain/scale/run. hes only 24yrs old, no bills no expenses, no liabilities/dependencies/debt just cash rich also.

  
January 2025 - issue N2 

since I bought this and made a few calls regarding the forklift queryies of sales/maintaince at asset1, someone I worked for in the past wants to make a deal with me regarding a 10 year purchase agreement with him, agreement via solicitors and our brokers ( we have the same ) cant check anything yet as everything opens on the 06-Jan

He wants too ofload 10 cash assets, back to back terraced houses all rented out around ¬£700 pcm for one, so roughly ¬£7000pcm as rental income for this lot; some are 3 bedroom and some are 4 bedrooms.  He has no issues no habits no activities that would cause me to raise my eyebrows at a possible resource mismanaging himself. I checked this several times and nothing popped up everything was good, family good/healthy/smiling nothing on the grapevine and nothing concerning in terms of online acitvies ( consuming tiktok/insta/X  ). 

He has purchased land for 500, 3bed flats to be built planning permission came with the land purchase and currently 4 business operate on this so he is not shy and everything is covered, I think he is prepped if he has issues my cash would be usefull if something happens and I pay soon not later, im known to pay off sooner than later unless your lowell.

Ive said yes to this already, what do I do with this extra income. I'll probably give each of my siblings a house for free just transfer it to their respecitve trusts when they get married, but if I do this theres 4 left, ¬£2800 standard 8% increase year upon year, I'll probably buy more over the next few years.

  
What would you do if you were me. Where would you improve yourself. Also sorry for not making sense, if you need to rewrite it please do. 

I cannot rewrite this it took me 2 hours and I made coffee and I got distracted with music. also please dont say UC I will be sanctioned or payment stopped it WILL NEVER HAPPEN, lol they check bank accounts like halifax not trusts that have been set up years before, on my first year I got a job I paid for this, preparation for success and wins. That being said if you can advise me to better my education alongside my finances structure/organisation I would appreciate it.

My husband and I have gotten into a financial situation and we are not sure what to do. I first got pregnant 3 years ago. I had a serious pregnancy complication and was out of work for 5 months. Then took 8 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. It took a toll on our finances but we were working our way out. 

Fast forward to earlier this year.. found out we were pregnant again (unplanned), had the same pregnancy condition and out another 5 months from work and then could only return part time. Again have taken an 8 week unpaid maternity leave. Then to top it off.. husband is a realtor and had the slowest year of his career. He went from almost 200k a year to around 45k. Through all of this, we have accumulated a lot of debt. 

At this point.. we have gotten all of our expenses down as much as we see that we can.. we‚Äôve refinanced the one car we owe on to get the payment down.. we‚Äôve gotten rid of any special ‚Äúextras‚Äù like Netflix, getting hair done, coffee runs etc‚Ä¶ reduced monthly costs on car insurance, phone bill, internet etc. I shop at Aldi for groceries and BJs for household goods. 

I am returning part time to work this coming week because we were unable to find full time daycare so we have friends helping us so I can work 2 days a week. Our expenses per month are around 10k. Neither of us are offered health insurance through our jobs so we pay out of pocket $1300 a month for the 4 of us for health insurance. Our mortgage is $1950 a month. My husband has about $1200 a month in business expenses. Utilities are about $1000 a month. Groceries and household goods are about $1000 a month. Daycare right now is $740 a month but will double in August when we have a full time spot for our baby. 

With money not coming in consistently we are not sure how we are paying our expenses this month. We don‚Äôt have enough to pay daycare, our mortgage or health insurance. We‚Äôve been putting groceries and gas and everything else on credit cards to try and save our money for those things that we need it for but the money has run out. Husband had a transaction for real estate that was supposed to close on the 10th but we just got news it fell through due to the buyers finances. 

Even with me going back 2 days a week I won‚Äôt make enough to cover everything. I‚Äôm a dental hygienist and my take home paychecks working 2 days a week might be around 2k a month. If I worked full time they‚Äôd be around 4k a month. 

Our current dilemma is do we sell our home and use the equity to pay off debt and then rent somewhere until we can build back up? Or keep our home, possibly miss a few payments for mortgage and other things, try to rent out our basement for 1k/ month, and do our best to get back on track and make more money. 

My concern is our mortgage is so inexpensive and rent is going to be around that or more for a much crappier and smaller place. But at this point nothing has affected our credit, we both have excellent credit. But if we keep our home, our credit will surely start to be affected. We won‚Äôt be able to pay our mortgage, our healthcare or even our credit card minimums for at least one month- maybe even more. Should we get out before we can‚Äôt pay and it affects our credit? 

Eventually I will go back to work full time and hopefully his real estate business will pick back up. He got a vasectomy so no more time off for pregnancies in our future. We didn‚Äôt get into this predicament for being stupid with our finances.. we got into it because of unfortunate circumstances that all happened so close together/at the same time. I‚Äôm sure there are so many more details I could add in here but this is the summary of it. 

My husband is convinced we need to sell, and I am holding out hope we can keep our home. But I also don‚Äôt want to put us in an even worse situation, still not being able to afford everything plus getting into more debt and affecting our credit. At least if we sold, we would pay off debt and some of our expenses would go down and we would possibly even have a small little cushion of money to hold on to in case things don‚Äôt pick back up, and hopefully save our credit from being affected so we can rebuild eventually. It‚Äôs important to note that it‚Äôs really not our spending habits that got us into this. We have made smart decisions financially and don‚Äôt spend too frivolously. It‚Äôs really just ‚Äúit happened all at once and we weren‚Äôt expecting it‚Äù kinda thing. 

We do live in a more costly state. We‚Äôve thought about selling and moving to a state with a lower cost of living.. but we would be leaving our family and support system behind. And also.. lower cost of living typically means lower income as well. Me, being a dental hygienist, making $50/ hr could be $38/hr somewhere else. And husband being a realtor, the cheaper the housing the lower his income- plus having to start over and rebuild his business/connections. So I‚Äôm not sure that would even make sense financially.

Hello everyone, I need some advice regarding my current situation.

About my ex-girlfriend (probably DA or FA):

She had a very difficult childhood. Her father was always working and unavailable, while her mother had extremely high expectations. If she didn‚Äôt meet them, she would be beaten. She told me that her cousin had sexually abused her and published recordings of it. Her first ex-boyfriend secretly filmed them having sex and shared the videos with the entire school, leading to years of bullying. He also cheated on her. Her second ex-boyfriend also cheated on her. Two months later, she met me.

My history with my ex-girlfriend:

We met in June 2023. At that time, I (now M22) had just come out of a relationship where I was cheated on with a celebrity. I was completely broken and only engaged in casual relationships afterward. I met my ex-girlfriend (now F20), and we slept together. Afterward, I told her that I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious and that I was also seeing other women, but I still wanted her in my life. (I know this was wrong; I regret it and have changed.) She was very sad but agreed.

After that, we met multiple times a week, primarily for sex. Meanwhile, I was also sleeping with other women. During this time, she treated me like a god. She even moved to my country for this version of me.

The fact that she moved to Germany for me meant a lot. Something clicked in my head, guilt took over, and I just wanted to be good to her and give her a beautiful life. That‚Äôs how our serious relationship began, in which I was 100% loyal.

That was in November 2023. By January 2024, I already noticed that something was off. Today, I know that she had started considering moving back to her home country. I think this happened because she no longer had to ‚Äúfight‚Äù for me.

Since January, she started sabotaging the relationship. She repeatedly lied and crossed boundaries we had set together. In March, we had a serious conversation where she admitted to having toxic behavior patterns and that she needed to work on them. She promised to improve, but things only got worse month after month.

The dynamic at that time was that I wanted to break up, but she fought for me, and I forgave her. However, due to all the betrayals of trust, I became extremely jealous, controlling, and anxious. In August, her response to this was telling me that she was considering ending the relationship and moving back to her home country. At this point, the entire dynamic shifted.

How I handled it:

I struggle a lot with self-worth issues. I grew up with a narcissistic father, and when I asked him for advice, he broke me down. After that, I tried to please my ex-girlfriend in every way. I stopped setting boundaries and tolerated every bit of disrespect. However, outwardly, I quickly reverted to a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù attachment style, even though I was experiencing panic attacks, intense anxiety, and depression. I didn‚Äôt let her see any of this. I focused on maintaining harmony. We barely fought anymore, and whenever she was disrespectful, I communicated it in a humorous and peaceful way.

I truly improved my behavior and grew as a person. But this secure behavior only pushed her further away. Every meeting was beautiful, but I had to put in all the effort. We had deep conversations, amazing times, great sex, but as soon as she went home and I left, there was only coldness, and I had to fight for every bit of warmth.

In September, I told her that I knew she had mental health issues and that it would be painful for me, but I would stay by her side as long as she worked on them.

Unfortunately, she didn‚Äôt, and things only got worse.

Despite our wonderful moments and lack of fights, she kept making baseless accusations. She ghosted me frequently, and I had to fight for every meeting. But whenever we did meet, things were great.

One day, after not hearing from her for five days, I went to see her like I did every Sunday. She completely ignored me. She barely opened the door and then lay in bed playing mobile games all day. The next day, I went home, and she ignored me again.

The breakup:

On Tuesday, November 5, I made the decision to break up, and two days later, I did.

I surprised her by bringing all her things, flowers, and a letter. Overall, it was a beautiful last meeting. She cried and told me that she had actually planned to move in with me in December. She had hoped I would propose in 2025 and that we would start a family in 2026. Of course, this hit me hard, but I knew she wouldn‚Äôt put in the effort to heal unless I ended things.

After the breakup, I was completely devastated and cried for days.

What happened after the breakup:
1.5 weeks later, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and called her under the pretense that a friend had seen her in town with another guy. She got angry, hung up, and blocked me everywhere. She told me she never even read my letter and hadn‚Äôt thought about me once since the breakup because she had too many problems.
The next day, I called her again from a different number. This time, I confronted her about how badly she had treated me and asked if she would treat her future children the same way. She became extremely aggressive and blocked that number too.
Two weeks later, I messaged her best friend, asking why my ex was so angry at me. My ex then sent me a long text on Instagram. I apologized, wished her well, and was blocked again.

The situation with the other guy:

Shortly before our breakup, she switched jobs and met a guy she got along with well. She went out partying with him on weekends (even during our relationship) and texted with him. They are connected on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and even play Minecraft together.

When I confronted her about him after the breakup, she got defensive, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut. What are you accusing me of? I put him in the friend zone.‚Äù

What happened today:

Today, I suddenly panicked and had to call her‚Äîso I did, with a hidden number.

We spoke briefly. She told me she still hadn‚Äôt read my letter because she ‚Äúhad no time‚Äù and told me to call her again on Sunday. She said we could then discuss whether we should meet for coffee next week.

I need your advice:
I don‚Äôt know if I should call her on Sunday at all.
I don‚Äôt know if she is even interested in meeting me.
I don‚Äôt know if she is involved with that other guy.
I don‚Äôt know if this relationship even has a future.

I treated her badly at first. Then, when I was good to her, she treated me badly. The fact is, we both have mental health issues (I am aware of mine, but I don‚Äôt know if she still acknowledges hers).

My heart is screaming for her. There is no one else but her. I dream of her every night, think about her 90% of the day, and no other woman interests me.

My friends say this relationship has no future. She has to work on herself, and I have to work on myself.

Even if my goal were to get her back, would calling her on Sunday even be the right thing to do? She still hasn‚Äôt read my letter. Would it be better to wait until she reads it and reaches out to me?",1,1735937086.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

Firstly, my step-dad got angry during Mario Party‚Äîwhich yeah it's MP but he's really competitive in a bad way. If he's not in first he's not having fun. He thinks I'm good at MP so he always directs the negativity towards me. In the last game we played, he lost (and tbh we all lost to the CPU) and got really upset and didn't come to an Xmas party (Dec 24). I didn't know it was bad until my mom (44f) asked if we got in a fight during MP or something which we didn't.

Then on Christmas day, my stepdad was disrespectful to my sister and I after the elephant gift exchange (everyone opens a random present, people can steal gifts, that game). My cousin opened a gift and got a set of coffee cups. My sister, ""Dorothea"" (17f) was next and she REALLY wanted the cups and stole them. My cousin's dad then stole the coffee cups back on his turn. When it was my turn, none of the gifts interested me ($15 gifts from Value Village, my family agrees it's more of a joke than a gift) and I decided to take the coffee cups and give them to my sister.

Immediately after, my stepdad told me, Dorothea and my other sister ""Marjorie"" (20f) that the cups would be going with my cousin. My sisters and I were like ""What the heck, no"" and he was like ""Alright alright.."" and walked away quietly. I didn't notice but my cousin and her family left early with the coffee cups. I can't shake the feeling that my stepdad was the reason.

I want to tell my mom how I feel. I don't like how he ignored what my sisters and I wanted (the coffee cups) and did whatever he wanted with them. I don't like that if he doesn't win MP he makes me feel guilty and ruins the vibe for everyone‚Äî and he never wins MP.

However, I think telling my mom would make me TAH. It would likely cause family drama. My stepdad is not a person who takes critiques easily. At the same time, staying quiet feels wrong because this is becoming a pattern and I don't want him to think he can disrespect me.

SO, would telling my mom how I feel about my stepdad's behaviour make me an asshole? Advice would be cool, thanks!",3,1735936904.0,AmItheAsshole,9,0.71,False

I certainly don't recover like I did in my early to mid twenties. Often feel fatigued after I work night shifts longer than I did before.

The difficult arises in that I have no baseline for what my testosterone was in my twenties. I also didn't have the same stressors back then (child, house, finances, etc).

Looking to elevate your home espresso game? The Rancilio Silvia PID espresso machine offers precision brewing capabilities that will transform your daily coffee ritual.  This in-depth review explores its features, benefits, and suitability for both passionate home baristas and small-scale commercial operations.

## Overview of the Rancilio Silvia PID: A Blend of Commercial Quality and Home Convenience

The Rancilio Silvia PID isn't just another espresso machine; it's a testament to Rancilio's legacy of crafting high-quality, reliable equipment. Its robust design incorporates a durable steel case, a solid brass boiler (a hallmark of commercial machines), and a commercial-grade portafilter ‚Äì ensuring longevity and consistent performance.  This isn't a flimsy appliance; it's built to last.  The single boiler efficiently handles both espresso brewing and steam production, while the heart of the machine, the Auber PID controller, provides the precision temperature control that sets it apart.

### The Auber PID Controller: Precision Brewing at Your Fingertips

The integrated Auber PID controller is the key to the Rancilio Silvia PID's superior performance.  PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative, a control loop mechanism that maintains a precise temperature. Unlike traditional espresso machines that rely on guesswork and manual adjustments, the Silvia PID automatically maintains your chosen brewing temperature with exceptional accuracy. This eliminates the frustrating """"temperature surfing"""" ‚Äì the constant monitoring and adjustment needed to achieve the ideal brewing temperature in non-PID machines.  This translates to:

* **Unwavering Temperature Accuracy:**  Achieve consistent brewing temperatures shot after shot, minimizing variations that impact flavor and extraction.
* **Improved Consistency:**  Enjoy consistently delicious espresso with balanced flavor profiles, every time.  Say goodbye to inconsistent results caused by fluctuating temperatures.
* **Enhanced User Experience:**  Focus on your craft, not on constantly tweaking the machine.  The PID controller handles the temperature, freeing you to concentrate on grinding, tamping, and enjoying the perfect shot.


## Key Features: Maximizing Your Espresso Experience

Beyond the PID controller, the Rancilio Silvia PID boasts several features designed to enhance the brewing process:

### Pre-Infusion and Programmable Dwell Time: Mastering the Art of Extraction

Pre-infusion, a crucial step in espresso extraction, gently saturates the coffee grounds before the main brewing phase.  This ensures even extraction and minimizes channeling, resulting in a richer, more balanced espresso. The Silvia PID allows for programmable pre-infusion times, giving you precise control over this critical step.  The programmable dwell time further refines the process, allowing you to customize the duration of the main infusion for optimal extraction.

### Shot Timer: Consistency is Key

The integrated shot timer allows you to precisely control and replicate your ideal shot time.  Consistency is crucial in espresso making, and this feature ensures that each shot is brewed for the exact duration you've determined.  You can save your preferred settings, making the process even more efficient and repeatable.

### Commercial-Grade Build: Built for Longevity

The Silvia PID's commercial-grade components aren't just about aesthetics; they ensure durability and longevity.  The robust construction translates to years of reliable service, making it a worthwhile investment for serious coffee enthusiasts.

## Who Should Consider the Rancilio Silvia PID?

The Rancilio Silvia PID caters to a specific audience:

* **Serious Home Baristas:**  Those seeking precise control and consistent results to elevate their home espresso experience.  The PID controller, pre-infusion, and programmable settings provide the tools needed to master the art of espresso making.
* **Small Cafes or Businesses:**  Its durable build and reliable performance make it a suitable option for small-scale commercial applications where consistency and efficiency are paramount.  It's a compact and powerful machine capable of handling moderate volumes.

## Addressing Common Concerns:  Troubleshooting and Maintenance

While the Rancilio Silvia PID is user-friendly, some common questions arise:

### Temperature Control Issues: The PID's Solution

The PID controller virtually eliminates temperature fluctuation issues associated with traditional espresso machines.  The consistent temperature ensures even extraction and prevents the need for constant adjustments.

### Ease of Use: Mastering the Machine

While there might be a slight learning curve initially, the machine‚Äôs intuitive design and user-friendly features make it relatively easy to master.  Online resources and user manuals provide ample support.

### Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your Machine in Top Condition

Regular backflushing and cleaning of the group head are essential for maintaining the machine's performance and longevity.  The process is straightforward and well-documented in the user manual.

## Rancilio's Heritage: A Legacy of Quality

Rancilio is a respected name in the coffee industry, known for its commitment to quality and innovation. The Silvia PID exemplifies this dedication, combining proven technology with user-friendly design.  The evolution of espresso machines from purely manual to automated, PID-controlled models represents a significant advancement, making precision brewing accessible to a wider audience.

1hswas8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NumerologyforWeddings/comments/1hswas8/how_do_i_choose_the_perfect_date/,How do I choose the perfect date?,"Choosing the perfect date comes down to finding something that feels meaningful, aligns with what you both enjoy, and creates an atmosphere where you can connect. There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer, but a great date usually balances thoughtfulness and comfort, so both of you feel at ease and genuinely enjoy the experience.

First, think about who the date is for‚Äîwhat do you know about the other person‚Äôs interests, hobbies, or favorite activities? If they‚Äôre into art, visiting a museum or checking out a local art gallery could be a hit. If they‚Äôre outdoorsy, a casual hike or a picnic in the park might feel more authentic and fun. Tailoring the date to their personality shows you‚Äôre paying attention, which is always a good move.

Get our Wedding Numerology Guide [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1836864546).

Another key factor is balancing effort with low pressure. You don‚Äôt need to orchestrate something extravagant for it to be special. In fact, sometimes simple plans work best because they allow you both to relax and focus on getting to know each other. A cozy coffee shop, a food truck stroll, or a fun activity like mini-golf or bowling can strike the right balance between engaging and casual.

Timing also plays a big role in how the date feels. Think about whether a daytime or evening plan makes sense for your vibe. Daytime dates often feel lighter and more relaxed, which can be great if you‚Äôre still getting to know each other. Evening dates, with dim lighting and maybe a great meal or live music, can naturally set a more romantic tone if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for.

Pay attention to shared experiences too‚Äîthey can help you bond in ways that sitting across a table and making small talk might not. Doing something interactive, like a cooking class, trivia night, or even an escape room, gives you both something to focus on and laugh about, which takes the pressure off any awkward silences.

It‚Äôs also important to consider logistics. Picking a convenient location that‚Äôs easy for both of you to get to avoids unnecessary stress. If you‚Äôre planning multiple stops, make sure they‚Äôre close enough together that you‚Äôre not wasting half the time driving around or figuring out parking. Little details like this might not seem like a big deal, but they add up to create a smoother, more enjoyable experience.

Don‚Äôt forget to keep things flexible. Plans don‚Äôt always go perfectly, and that‚Äôs okay. If the restaurant you wanted to try has a long wait, being able to pivot to something else without stress can turn what might feel like a hiccup into an unexpected adventure. Plus, it shows that you can roll with the punches, which is an attractive quality in itself.

While the activity or location matters, what really makes a date perfect is the connection you build. Be present, engage in conversation, and make an effort to listen as much as you talk. Asking open-ended questions about their interests or experiences keeps the dialogue flowing naturally. It‚Äôs not about impressing them with over-the-top plans; it‚Äôs about showing genuine interest and making sure they feel comfortable and valued.

At the end of the day, the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù date isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating an environment where both of you can relax and have a good time together. Even if things don‚Äôt go exactly as planned, the thought and effort you put into it will be what matters most. A great date is less about what you do and more about how you make the other person feel. If they leave smiling and feeling appreciated, then you‚Äôve nailed it.

1hswafn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1hswafn/thinking_about_northwest_arkansas_how_do_the/,"Thinking about Northwest Arkansas. How do the cities compare (Fayetteville, Rogers, Bentonville, Springdale)?","We are 40M and 38F, no kids, remote gigs, and originally from the Ozarks, but up in SW Missouri. We've been gone for a decade on the west coast (Seattle, SoCal). We are considering a move back to be closer to family. 

As always, our list of what we'd like might be contradictory between the various cities. Essentially, we are DINKs that want to live a full life of eating out, entertainment and participating in our hobbies, and most importantly, finding new friends to enjoy those things with. The wish list:

* Where is the pickleball scene?
* Where is access for the best mountain biking? Hiking?
* Which city has the best trail system?
* Parks with trees?
* We don't want to live in the suburbs, or rather, we'd like to be in the most walkable areas that have tree lined streets, older, but nice homes, and that have access to things like famers markets, coffee shops, restaurants. Nice sidewalks.
* Where are the most DINKs, which is probably where are the most transplants? I think I know the answer here.
* Just from looking on Zillow, the size of house/lot we'd want seems to be available in all areas, but we'd be looking for a 3/2 at the very least in a neighborhood with a lot of character. 
* We're dog people, so it would be good to know about dog parks. But, if there are good sidewalks, parks, and trails nearby, then this isn't much of a concern.

From our last visit to the area, Bentonville and Rogers didn't seem to have much soul, but it could have been the areas we were in. I'm guessing this is where the DINKs would be (because of transplants moving for corporate gigs) unfortunately. And honestly, people with families can absolutely be great friends, I've just found it to be pretty hard to get things going because of their family commitments. I've noticed just from first glance, the houses / neighborhood I'm drawn to seem to be Fayetteville east and downtown area. Holy sh#$ the housing prices have become expensive. I'm in SoCal in a place worth $1.2M (renting), but I can't believe NW Ark has properties near this same price. Mind boggling. Are there other areas with that character? We are fine to drive if needed, but it would be great to not have to commute more than 20 minutes to see friends.",0,1735936434.0,SameGrassButGreener,7,0.5,False
1hswad5,https://i.redd.it/qnmdksf9auae1.jpeg,Understanding results,"I (M34) recently got bloodwork done out of curiosity. 

Testosterone came back at 18.3 nmol/L.

Free came in at 325 pmol/L.

Estrodial was 64 pmol/L.

SHBG is 43.6 nmol/L. 

I had bloodwork done in May and had similar results.

I am a shiftworker, father to a toddler, 6'1, 225 lbs, follow macros and have been lifting for a decade. I estimate I usually sit anywhere from 13-18% bodyfat. I lift decently heavy (5-6 days per week) and do moderate cardio sessions (3-6 times/week). No alcohol or drugs. Sleep 5-8 hours a night depending on whether I work or not.

I certainly don't recover like I did in my early to mid twenties. Often feel fatigued after I work night shifts longer than I did before. 

The difficult arises in that I have no baseline for what my testosterone was in my twenties. I also didn't have the same stressors back then (child, house, finances, etc). 

I will admit my caffeine intake is too high - coffee, preworkout, energy drinks. I accept this one of my sole vices considering I don't drink, exercise and eat clean. 

I've been advised by a professional that my levels are functionally low but not clinically low. 

Any advice or interpretation of my levels?

Me: 42f, with incisional/ventral hernia at the site of my hysterectomy. Hernia was about 2 inches across and the material rhat had gone through was fat according to doc. It was about the size of my full palm and easily visible but didnt cause me pain in rhe day to day but it def reduced my quality of life and what i could do. Laparoscopic robotic repair.

Surgery was dec 30, 7:30. They didnt ask for bowel prep in advance but i wish i had starred mainlining miralax earlier lol.

After surgery woke up and had difficulty keeping my 0xygen levels up due to sleep apena. Vomited. It was terrible but I felt much better afterward.. Peed and they let me leave. I was home by noon but I was in a lot of pain. Ride home suuuuucked in bumpy roads.

I made it up the stairs and got set up in a comfy chair, took a pain pill and fell asleep.Turns out hydrocodone makes me vomit so that was terrible again. Switched from there to ibuprofen and tylenol only. The pain has not been terrible just persistent and tender.

Was up about ever 2 to 3 hours to pee. Could barely do more than shuffle hunched up down the hall.

NYE: did feel better and walked around the hall as much as possible when i got up for the bathroom. Not much appetite. Had a piece of toast with a bit of coffee and ramen later.  Much the same t.he next day

NYD: Next day became worried about having a BM and started more seriously taking meds to help. Felt ok given the circumstances otherwise.

Jan2: it was time to poop. Dear god. I do not typically have any problems in the bathroom and redditors stories of shits always seems so unrealistic and outlandish to me. It took 2 hours. It wiped me out for the entire day. I felt so much better afterward  but also sort of sick with chills. Do yourself a favor and be on top of your stool softeners and diet and all that. I was very scared I would wreck something. 

Jan 3: my incisions are outrageously itchy. ice is good for it but its limited relief. eating more normally. Haven't taken any pain meds in 24 hours. Still taking softeners. Just laying around.

Any guidance appreciated. Cannot find anything on Google for the EQ9 S700 or S900. 

I rarely drink coffee, like once a week... And I haven't managed to dial in the settings. Coffee at the local caf√© always taste better for some reason. 

I have tried fresh beans, roasted yesterday from a professional. It doesn't matter what beans I feed the machine, it comes out sour / bitter (sorry, not sure what the correct words are to describe). 

The machine has dual grinders with individual grinding settings (fine to coarse), temperature settings between 88 to 96 celcius, coffee strength weak to strong (symbol of beans, not sure what it means), intensity (definitely no idea what this does). 

Anyone have a clue what the settings actually do?
Feels like I have tried everything and still feel lost. As of now for a normal cup of coffee 80 ml , I have it set to fine grinding, 92 celcius, strong (beans symbol) and intense+. Works okay but would hope for better!

**The Report:**¬†

Journal  
  
Day 1 16.9 miles  
Burley is how I would decide the first 40 or so miles. There were buckets of rain the day before and water was everywhere. I never needed to carry more than a liter at a time. Rocks and especially the bridges were slippery and I skated across them.   
  
Day 2 17.1 miles  
After the rigid miles of the day before, today seemed cruisy. It rained all day, and I spent 2 hours at winding stair shelter waiting out the lightening. Crossing Big Cedar Creek was way up, crossed about 60ft downstream and it was up to my waist. I enjoyed the liberty of splashing through the puddles.   
  
Day 3, 17 miles  
Warmer. Nothing dried out overnight, if anything it felt wetter. Hard to dodge the constant drainage. Curious what the rock walls are before the cemetery. Made it to QWSP after a beautiful sunset and showered and did trail laundry, then left it to dry under the sink. Stealth camped below the tent pads to block the wind. More rain than forecasted and very windy but the little tarp did fine. Saw a mouse but he left me alone.   
  
Day 4 17.8 miles  
Drizzled all night and the place was in a cloud in the morning. Retrieved my almost dry clothes from the bathroom and walked to the lodge to get my resupply. Everything went smooth thanks to Dale. I had an hour and some change before breakfast so I topped off my electronics behind the Christmas tree. This is where I contrived the questionable idea to finish drying my clothes on the heater vent in the floor. It worked amazing and there was nobody else in the lobby- this is the off season. Breakfast omelette and biscuits and gravy and a few cups of coffee hit the spot. Incredible wind and dense fog greeted me on the trail, and it's a bit colder than forecasted. I could not see much more than the rocks I was stepping on. After about 1.5 miles the trail opened up and put in come good miles. Met Charlie who thru hiked the OT last March and seemed to enjoy the same type of hiking. He was doing an overnight trip. Foran Gap Shelter had trash but the shelter was in a nice spot. Wind made it frigid out of the quilt, but my clothes were too hot under it.   
  
Day 5 21.8 miles  
The valve came off my sleeping pad! Was hiking at 6:30 and made good use of time. Miles came easy on the feet but seemed endless. The views were great today on blue mountain and I stayed on the ridges. Water still abundant. Almost stepped on a tiny owl, who flew away and then glared at me irritatedly. This makes 4 ticks I've had on me this trip, even though 3 were on the top of a mountain, 45¬∞ and gusty. Trail Magic hit the spot, snickers and cherry cola. Bubbles for the new year. Grabbed a hand warmer as well, supposed to be cold. Incredible day of hiking even though I dropped my water bottles down a waterfall. Slept great at bushy Creek mt shelter.   
  
Day 6 18.1 miles  
Everything is total bliss even with a chilly start. Fantastic day of hiking and the weather was beautiful. Passed mile 100, saw some cool hawks hunting together. I've realized how much focusing on small goals helps me not get in a defeated mood. Met Cheater and trail dog Jake, AT and GDT hikers and shared sentiments and the Suck Mt shelter. Kinda ran out of food but it was groovy.   
  
Day 7 13.1  
Miles came so easy, and I made great time even with a 1.2 mile detour and my flashlight dying. Phone shut down because of the cold. Dale is a treasure and a fantastic guy, Bluebell Cafe was stellar. Lori loves hikers and has a long shelf in her store free for hikers. Made it back to the car, showered, and made the drive home. What a blast. 

**Gear Notes:**

The shining star of the equipment list was my alpha hoodie from Superior Fleece! Wearing it under my rain jacket allowed me to dry out because of the air pockets it creates, similar to how I understand mesh baselayers work. I slept in it each night though it was too warm sometimes and I would have preferred my shirt if it wasn't sweaty. Overall it was very versatile in the changing weather conditions. I run very warm, so the 60 was great; I would have been miserable with 120 or maybe 90 as well.

I brought along a dual port charging block, but I don‚Äôt think I particularly needed it. I was able to plug in at the State Park and at the Lodge. If I was to continue after the Cafe and charged there, it would have come in handy.

I really enjoyed the floating hip belt on my SWD pack as I felt it allowed very natural movement, something I was concerned about coming from frameless/hipbeltless packs.

If I do this trail again, I would definitely still use trekking poles, and I believe removing the straps kept me multiple times from breaking the carbon fiber.

I have had chafing issues for a few years now, and the solution, in addition to losing 45lbs, that has finally proven itself is the exoficio boxer briefs. No chafing issues, and the very lightweight material of the Mier shorts did not incite any extra sweat.

The most exciting gear related event was the valve coming off of my old xlite pad. Weant to let the air out and then there it was in my hand, right before the temps dropped. I have never packed superglue before this trip, but I thought it might be good for medical purposes primarily, but it worked great for the valve.

Speaking of pads, I received an Alpenblow pump for Christmas and threw it in the bag for this trip. Simply incredible for its imperceptible weight. I even accidently stepped on it with no ill results, though I‚Äôm sure its not recommended by Gadget. 

In retrospect, I would not change a single piece of gear. I know there are perhaps better shelter options, but creativity and resourcefulness prevailed. I do think I would have enjoyed a wind shirt for most situations, and that combined with a poncho shelter could have been slightly better for the weather and this trail.

We spend the day together, just sightseeing and eating around. We agreed to meet day after but we never did - I got sick and was waiting for me to get better but eventually had to leave. For 11 months we texted each other and created a lovely bond, morning messages, good night messages.. We could read each other's thoughts and we indeed had an incredible connection, natural, intuitive, I grew to love him a lot. And then he vanished. I had a hard time dealing with it, for months... Eventually I texted him a goodbye message because I needed closure, and he never replied.

2 days ago, in a wake of a very stressful event, I woke up and out of the blue texted him - hey, I am in your city, would you be up for a coffee? And, out of the blue, he replies. But the creepy part is: he had a dream about me that night, that he called me to meet up and woke up with the feeling he needs to reach out. First I thought he is just using this as an excuse but he told me so many details and swore it is true.. And said he was absolutely shocked when he saw my text.

We agreed to meet in a couple of days, we communicate naturally and easily like nothing happened..

But how do I do it? I just want to hug him before anything but we haven't seen each other but once, 3 years ago. We did reach that point where we were gentle with each other, sending hugs, kiss or sth and it was obvious we were bonding.

But there is a fact of ghosting. I believe he did it because he thought he will never return, that I will never come to him (I had financial limitations) and that it just doesn't make sense any more. Not an excuse, I know..

Now I‚Äôm closer to graduating and I‚Äôm kind of panicking? I had a plan before finding out about this baby. I did an assisting position and hated it. I didn‚Äôt like being a coffee maker who only shampoos and does color in the bowl. That program was 2 years and I just didn‚Äôt see myself doing that with a license. I attempted again at another salon that offered me a 6 month assisting program and I explained how I was ready to get behind the chair sooner than later, they offered to let me bring in a model (with a very short notice) and I did, got one that same afternoon. Gave her a cut and blowout and they watched how I interacted and they were very impressed. They were ready to take me in but still wanted me to complete the assistant program even if I checked everything off sooner by bringing in models. Then I got the paperwork to sign a ‚Äúprogram payback‚Äù if I left before 2 years of being with them. Yea I wasn‚Äôt happy with that. How would I pay them back for their ‚Äúeducation‚Äù if I was going to earn $13 an hour at first? Things sometimes don‚Äôt work out and I didn‚Äôt want to be forced to either pay back somehow or stay.

Maybe I‚Äôm too confident but I‚Äôve never had an unsatisfied client at school and instructors don‚Äôt correct my work anymore. I go to a pretty good school where we are very hands on, especially in my area. We take in about 3 clients a day 3 days a week if not more. I‚Äôve learned so much and anything I need to learn I‚Äôm sure I will along the way with practice rather than standing behind a stylist as an assistant and watching them foil (which is what they had me do as an assistant). Now, how would I go about finding a job pregnant. I can still hide it but I‚Äôm starting to show just a little, and 4 weeks from now I‚Äôm sure more lol. Would anyone hire a new stylist who‚Äôs pregnant? How do I go about building clientele if I‚Äôm going to have to abandon them 6 months later?

1hsvwi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1hsvwi4/is_this_meant_to_happen_this_coincidence_freaks/,Is this meant to happen? This coincidence freaks me out,"He was my first Tinder date: a tourist in my town (country), 3years ago. We spend the day together, just sightseeing and eating around. We agreed to meet day after but we never did - I got sick and was waiting for me to get better but eventually had to leave. For 11 months we texted each other and created a lovely bond, morning messages, good night messages.. We could read each other's thoughts and we indeed had an incredible connection, natural, intuitive, I grew to love him a lot. And then he vanished. I had a hard time dealing with it, for months... Eventually I texted him a goodbye message because I needed closure, and he never replied.

2 days ago, in a wake of a very stressful event, I woke up and out of the blue texted him - hey, I am in your city, would you be up for a coffee? And, out of the blue, he replies. But the creepy part is: he had a dream about me that night, that he called me to meet up and woke up with the feeling he needs to reach out. First I thought he is just using this as an excuse but he told me so many details and swore it is true.. And said he was absolutely shocked when he saw my text.

We agreed to meet in a couple of days, we communicate naturally and easily like nothing happened..

But how do I do it? I just want to hug him before anything but we haven't seen each other but once, 3 years ago. And there is a fact of ghosting. I believe he did it because he thought he will never return, that I will never come to him (I had financial limitations) and that it just doesn't make sense any more. Not an excuse, I know..

1hsvv5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hsvv5v/ive_been_single_forever_literally/,"I've been single forever, literally ","Ok I really need dating advice 
I'm about to be really vulnerable but I feel like I'm missing something... I am a 26 yo female. I've never gone out with anyone, nor really dated. I've never kissed anyone nor did I hold hands either (if the last one is even that important...). I've had some boys I really liked but it never happened. 

The closest I've got was a boy from my friend group in secondary school. I tried to gave him hints by going to sit next to him, talking to him more, trying to hang out after school and I even got him a gift for his birthday (that was unusual for our friend's group). 
He reciprocated these moves and was also going out of his way to make me smile and laugh but one day he came to me all smiley and announced he got a girlfriend. I said I was happy for him and moved on. He maybe changed his mind about me, which is cool since we never expressed anything and everything we had could have been passed as friendship. I'm explaining so you know what is my biggest experience. 

I've had some boys try to approach me but they were part of my friend groups or my class and it was so subtle I didn't get it until years later (I was or still am a bit oblivious).

I've always been a bit closed off to flirting. First I rarely find a man attractive at first sight and if I do I feel too weird to approach them flirtingly. I'm worried I'll come off as too forward. I feel like I can develop a real liking to someone after I get to know them so it kinda does not make sense to flirt and give them the impression I already really like them from the get go. But how do I ask someone on a date if I don't flirt? I think I'm overthinking something but I don't know what exactly. Well most of times I end up acting like a bro and I'm not even noticed.

I've never really been hit on, never got my number asked and the only time I've been on 'a date', it was a friendly meeting with a very new friend and he tried moves on me during hours. It was uncomfortable and not what I've signed up for. I even reminded him multiple times I only wanted to be friends but he persisted so much I fled the place and never talked with the creep again.

I forced myself to be brave last year of uni and thought that maybe if I tried to ask out instead of wait I might help. I asked for coffee a boy from my uni class that I found cute and interesting. It went bad as there was no chemistry and I asked questions about him, but he never asked any about me. It was so nerve-racking I shudder at the awkwardness of our two coffee 'dates' even today.

Now that I've finished school and that I've been looking for a job for more than a year, I'm not seeing anyone (I live in a small town with buses only till 9pm to the city). I've also had cancer this year and I'm good and cured but I've been so isolated I've tried dating apps. 
I don't like most people on there and the few I like, I get too stressed about talking with them. I'm stressed they are gonna be forward and have big expectations and it gives me a headache even looking at their profile. Is there a world we can just hang out and be friend without the pressure of acting like romantic partners straight away? Because as much as I would love to do it, I don't have the passion and guts for it...

It's silly because I know that I'm not ugly but I feel so unwanted and weird sometimes and I have trouble taking myself seriously when I try to get closer to a boy (which is in itself really rare). I feel like I'm being too weird about it, it shouldn't be this hard right? Maybe I have standards that are too high but I really don't feel like forcing myself to go out with people if I don't feel their vibe or have some attraction to them.  

I don't know if anyone could give me advice, but I vented at least... I'm sorry it's really jumbled, I guess it reflects my mental state haha. Thanks for reading ",2,1735935328.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Hey marketing fam! I've been diving deep into marketing newsletters lately (yeah, I'm that kind of nerd), and I've found some absolute gems that aren't just glorified spam. These marketing newsletters are seriously changing the game for how I stay updated with industry trends.

Marketing Brew has been my daily caffeine fix for marketing insights - it's like that friend who always knows what's up in the industry but doesn't bore you with the details. And if you're into content marketing, the Content Marketing Institute newsletter is pure gold. They drop some seriously actionable stuff that you can use right away.

But here's my personal favorite - Ann Handley's Total Annarchy. It's like getting marketing advice from your cool aunt who actually gets it. The Hustle is another banger - they make marketing news feel like you're chatting with your buddy at a coffee shop.

Quick pro tip: Don't try to subscribe to all marketing newsletters at once (been there, done that, RIP inbox). Start with 2-3 that match your interests. I'd love to know - which marketing newsletters are you currently subscribed to? Any hidden gems I should know about? Drop your recommendations below! üëá

Only eating at home (unless I get invited out, I don't want to avoid a special occasion). So far, I have been going strong and have enjoyed cooking and making different coffees and teas with what I have in the house.

I cooked almost all of my food during the pandemic, so its also felt therapeutic and more healthy to eat at home for 99% of my meals again. I did a necessities restock last week, and will try to eat through all the non-perishables in my pantry I've neglected (lentils, pasta, chickpeas, etc) like someone on here is doing. So far so good, I've gotten creative and made some yummy meals. 

So far a game changer has been -- avoid cooking food I am just meh about! I made some simple chicken and veggie Pad See Ew, and we cleared out the leftovers of it over lunch the next couple of days because it was something we enjoyed. If it was something we were meh about, some of it probably would have gone to waste. I will try not to burn myself out by eating some junk here and there (like chicken strips, tater tots, hashbrowns) and by not cooking 100% from scratch when I am tired or have a substitute. I am living on a budget, so I am hoping this helps and that I can report back positively in a few months!
