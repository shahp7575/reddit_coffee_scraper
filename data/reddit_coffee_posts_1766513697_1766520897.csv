1pu3uuw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pu3uuw,My First Cookie Box!,"Been baking non stop since Saturday and I am so happy to finally join in the tradition! I started baking last year when I was pregnant and when I had my baby in October I was so overwhelmed by everything I didn’t have time or energy to bake. This year I redeem myself by baking this big ol’ cookie box (tin?)! I’ve baked 144 cookies while taking care of a crazy toddler, I feel like a winner lol From order of assembly: 

- Chocolate chip cookie: I use Claire Saffitz’s recipe, it’s my go to, I’ve been baking Choc chip cookies all year in preparation, and these are so good my husband and I call them “the divas.”

- Gingerbread Latte Snickerdoodle: My family loves coffee so I knew I had to bring some coffee flavor to the mix, I actually love these even though I’m not a massive fan of gingerbread! 

- Chocolate thumbprint cookies: The most chocolaty, fudgey, delightful little treat. When I bake tested these earlier this month we couldn’t stop eating them lol

- Almond Cloud Cookies: I loved the experience of making marzipan for the first time, if you love almond you will love these! 

Happy baking you all, thank you for the people who responded to my post earlier sharing recipe ideas for this very box! I hope you all have a wonderful holiday and a very sweet New Year, or savory, if you prefer it lol

1pu3scf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1pu3scf/sql_statement_does_not_return_all_records_from/,"SQL statement does not return all records from the left table, why?","Note: the purpose of this question **IS NOT** to completely rewrite the query I have prepared (which is available at the bottom of the question) but to understand why it does not return all the records from the passengers table. I have developed a working solution using JSON so I don't need another one. Thank you for your attention!

This question is derived from [AdventofSQL day 07](https://databaseschool.com/series/advent-of-sql/videos/318), that I have adapted to SQLite (no array, like in PostGres) and reduced to the minimum amount of data.

I have the following table:

passengers: passenger\_id, passenger\_name

flavors: flavor\_id, flavor\_name

passengers\_flavors: passenger\_id, flavor\_id

cocoa\_cars: car\_id

cars\_flavors: car\_id, flavor\_id

A passenger can request one or many flavors, which are stored in passengers\_flavors

A cocoa\_car can produce one or many flavors, which are stored in cars\_flavors

So the relation between passengers and cocoa\_cars can be viewed as:

passengers <-> passengers\_flavors <-> car\_flavors <-> cocoa\_cars

Here are the SQL statements to create all these tables:

    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS passengers;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cocoa_cars;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS flavors;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS passengers_flavors;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars_flavors;
    
    CREATE TABLE passengers (
        passenger_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        passenger_name TEXT,
        favorite_mixins TEXT[],
        car_id INT
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE cocoa_cars (
        car_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        available_mixins TEXT[],
        total_stock INT
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE flavors (
    flavor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    flavor_name TEXT
    );
    
    INSERT INTO flavors (flavor_id, flavor_name) VALUES
    (1, 'white chocolate'),
    (2, 'shaved chocolate'),
    (3, 'cinnamon'),
    (4, 'marshmallow'),
    (5, 'caramel drizzle'),
    (6, 'crispy rice'),
    (7, 'peppermint'),
    (8, 'vanilla foam'),
    (9, 'dark chocolate');
    
    CREATE TABLE passengers_flavors (
    passenger_id INT,
    flavor_id INT
    );
    
    INSERT INTO cocoa_cars (car_id, available_mixins, total_stock) VALUES
        (5, 'white chocolate|shaved chocolate', 412),
        (2, 'cinnamon|marshmallow|caramel drizzle', 359),
        (9, 'crispy rice|peppermint|caramel drizzle|shaved chocolate', 354);
    
    CREATE TABLE cars_flavors (
    car_id INT,
    flavor_id INT
    );
    
    INSERT INTO passengers (passenger_id, passenger_name, favorite_mixins, car_id) VALUES
        (1, 'Ava Johnson', 'vanilla foam', 2),
        (2, 'Mateo Cruz', 'caramel drizzle|shaved chocolate|white chocolate', 2);
    
    INSERT INTO cars_flavors
    SELECT cocoa_cars.car_id, flavors.flavor_id
    FROM cocoa_cars 
    CROSS JOIN flavors
    WHERE cocoa_cars.available_mixins LIKE '%' || flavors.flavor_name || '%';
    
    INSERT INTO passengers_flavors
    SELECT passengers.passenger_id, flavors.flavor_id
    FROM passengers
    CROSS JOIN flavors
    WHERE passengers.favorite_mixins LIKE '%' || flavors.flavor_name || '%';
    

As you can see, the passenger 'Ava Johnson' wants a 'vanilla foam' coffee (id: 8), but none of the cocoa\_cars can produce it. One the other hand, the passenger 'Mateo Cruz' can get his 'caramel drizzle' coffee from cocoa\_cars 2 and 9, his 'shaved chocolate' coffee from cocoa\_car 5 and 9 and his 'white chocolate' from car 5.

So the expected answer is:

    +-----------------+---------+
    | Name            |  Cars   |
    +-----------------+---------+
    | Ava Johnson     | NULL    |
    +-----------------+---------+
    | Mateo Cruz      | 2,5,9   |
    +-----------------+---------+

The following query

    SELECT passengers.passenger_name, passengers.passenger_id, group_concat(DISTINCT cocoa_cars.car_id ORDER BY cocoa_cars.car_id) AS 'Cars'
    FROM passengers
    LEFT JOIN passengers_flavors ON passengers.passenger_id = passengers_flavors.passenger_id 
    LEFT JOIN cars_flavors ON passengers_flavors.flavor_id = cars_flavors.flavor_id
    LEFT JOIN cocoa_cars ON cars_flavors.car_id = cocoa_cars.car_id
    WHERE passengers_flavors.flavor_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT cars_flavors.flavor_id 
        FROM cars_flavors
        WHERE cars_flavors.car_id IN (2, 5, 9)  -- More cars in the real example
        AND cocoa_cars.car_id IN (2, 5, 9)      -- More cars in the real example
    )
    GROUP BY passengers.passenger_id
    ORDER BY passengers.passenger_id ASC, cocoa_cars.car_id ASC
    LIMIT 20;

that I am kindly asking you **to correct with the minimum changes**, is only returning:

    +----------------+-------+
    |      Name      | Cars  |
    +----------------+-------+
    | Mateo Cruz     | 2,5,9 |
    +----------------+-------+

I used to eat horribly, all fried foods, heavy carbs, the whole 9. Recently I've changed my diet eating high protein and almost completely cut fried foods out of my diet, began walking 2 miles a day, and started using sugar free syrups for my daily coffee, began taking berberine daily as well as taking ginger shots/ drinks daily. I've been off of my daily 2 mi walks for about a month and half but have maintained the changed diet usually eating only once a day, still do not drink, but vape heavily. 

Within the last couple weeks, I've noticed my watches and bracelets have become very loose, I lose hair (very small amounts anytime I shower, and my bowel movements have also experienced some changes. I've noticed I'm not as hungry, but even when I do eat a lot, it doesn't feel like I'm expelling the amount of what I ate. Very small amounts. I've been told ginger and berberine can contribute to loss of appetite but with everything going on, I'm concerned. The only weight loss I have noticed is the thinning of my wrists but the weight on the scale has only changed 2-3 Ibs. Am I freaking out over nothing or is the change in wrist size a cause for concern for a bigger issue? I suppose I'm worried because I took a break in my daily exercise. Help please!

[Episode I](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pu3j5h/i_found_an_old_star_wars_box_set_1_of_3/) \- [Episode II](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pu3jzo/we_found_a_weird_star_wars_mod_2_of_3/) \- [Episode III](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pu3ks3/my_friends_and_i_found_a_late_night_star_wars/)

Star Wars Day is my ***life!*** You know, if you were to describe the joy, the cheer, the excitement of Christmas Day without mentioning Christmas? In my mind I would probably just assume you were talking about May the 4th. That was ***my*** day. Me and my group of buddies, we would take the entire day off every year to celebrate it.

We had been doing this since high school, and I’m pretty sure both our teachers back then, and our employers now, may have picked up on the fact that our lame ass sick day excuses (which just so happened to fall on the exact same day every year) may not be entirely genuine. But, credit to them, they always let it slide.

This year’s May 4th, was going to be epic. Most years we would have these casual get togethers, we would put on some food, put some beers on ice, and just watch the movies. But this year, we were going to do something a bit more, hands on. You see our friend Kyle, and his girlfriend, Heather, they were avid gamers. They had this amazing setup in their basement.

There were 3 lines of desks set up in perfect unison. At each desk, back to back fully decked out MSI gaming rigs. 12 of them in total.

Why did they need so many for themselves, you ask? Well, they didn’t really. Being passionate gamers, they would often host these social gaming nights for pretty much whoever wanted to come. It was quite a cool incentive for the town and Heather even scored some airtime on the local news to talk about the events they’d put on. We lived in a small town, so they always had enough rigs to cater for the 10 or so people who wanted to come and game.

And if they ever had more, they had random consoles and other handheld gaming systems around the place for people to keep themselves occupied while they waited for a PC to free up. It really was an amazing setup. And this year, for our May the 4th celebrations, we intended to make full use of it.

We had planned to play Battlefront II online literally all day. Complete with coolers full of mountain dew and beer, and the most gut rotting snacks you could imagine, this was set to be a lan party for the ages.

Yeah yeah I hear the groans, I know Battlefront II is not exactly beloved in the Star Wars community, but we just wanted a modern Star Wars game to play together. We thought about booting up The Old Republic, but we had some problems messing around with EA Accounts not playing nice with Steam and, it was just a headache we didn’t want. When you get ONE day off from work to celebrate your favourite day with your friends, you want something that’s just gonna work, you know? So that’s what we settled on. Until I got a call from Heather at around 8pm on May 3rd.

I picked up the phone, and greeted my friend, excited to talk about our plans for the next day.

*“Hey! What’s up?”* I said.

*“Dude… I found something cool.”* Heather replied. *“Let me ask you, do you* ***really*** *want to spend your entire day tomorrow playing Battlefront?! That game’s a shit show at best.”*

*“Ha, yeah I know. But I mean, it was the best pick of a bad bunch. We all decided, right?”*

*“Yeah, we did. But check this out. I found a Fallout mod!”*

*“Um… I mean I guess the setting can be…. Maybe, similar? But, I dunno about playing Fallout on Star Wars Day. Doesn’t really fit, ya know?”*

*“No! Dude… I found a Star Wars mod for Fallout 4!”*

*“Ohhh, Galaxy at War. Yeah I know that one. But it’d still be kinda weird, Fallout 4 doesn’t have any online mode. We’d all just be doing our own thing, would be a bit of a buzzkill wouldn’t it?”*

*“Mate, shut up and listen for a second! I’m looking at the mod right here in front of my eyes. F4- SW-ONLINE it’s called. I had to contact the uploader to clarify but, if this works, this game will essentially turn Fallout 4 into a modern day Star Wars MMO!”*

*“Seriously?! How cool would that be! Do you think you can get it to work?!”*

*“I can sure try! I’m gonna download the mod now and get it all set up for tomorrow! I’ll let you know in the morning if it worked, when you guys get here, otherwise we can always go back to Plan A.”*

*“Sounds great! See you tomorrow!”*

And with that, the call ended. I spent a couple more hours scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, you know, as you for some unknown reason feel the need to do before sleeping. Eventually, noticing the clock tick nearer to midnight, I put my phone onto the charger and going to sleep, excited to wake up and start our Star Wars Day celebration.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My alarm went off at 7am sharp, and I sprung out of bed ready for a day of gaming! As I pulled on my favourite Empire Strikes Back T- Shirt, I was reminded of the phone call with Heather last night, and this mystery Fallout mod she described. I wondered how she’d found it. I had searched plenty of mod sites for Star Wars themed mods, but the only functional ones I’d come across were simple lightsaber mods, and of course Galaxy at War. But that was nothing like what Heather had described. Anyway, hopefully she managed to get it working. It sounded amazing!

The walk to Heather and Kyle’s place was a short one, we lived a couple of blocks away from eachother, a quiet walk through a quiet part of town with not much going on. Your typical urban sprawl, a little convenience store and coffee shop sat halfway between our houses, which made for a nice meetup spot. I stopped in and grabbed my usual, chai latte, no sugar. And I continued on down to Kyle’s place.

Upon arriving, Kyle and the guys had already gathered for our busy day of gaming ahead. Ha, life responsibilities for the geeks and nerdy. Eh, we weren’t bothered.

Star Wars was our passion. You don’t hear us judging people who choose to sit in front of the TV all day and watch football. And plenty of folks do that every weekend! We only do this once a year, and we were gonna make the most of it. As I sipped my chai latte like a pretentious dick, I noticed Heather wasn’t around. I was keen to ask her about the mod, so I called out to Kyle, who was busy on the other side of the room getting the food and drinks prepped for the day. I asked him, *“Hey, where’s Heather? She not joining us today?”*

*“Oh! Nah dude,”* he replied. *“She left this note on her laptop for me.”* Well, that was very Heather style. Being the techie girl, handwritten notes be damned. On the laptop sat a simple word document which read…

*“Morning! I’ve been called into the office, sorry guys! But hey! I got that mod working! It’s up and running on all the rigs! I’ve set up temporary Steam accounts for all of you. Just load up the game and you should be good to go! Have fun!”*

It’s in these moments I need to check myself. There had always been an unspoken, yet very much acknowledged by the both of us, pang of envy that Kyle had been the one to end up with Heather. We had both had a huge crush on her since, well the first day we met her in primary school. She was, and still is, beautiful, in the true sense of that word. But, as fate would have it, she only ever had eyes for him. Their bond was undeniable. If there had ever been any doubt about that, perhaps I may have tried a little harder. But it was obvious to everyone, these two were among the rare specimens of our world who through some stroke of universal blessing, managed to be born in the same time, place and move in the same circles as their soulmate. All told, I was truly happy for them, and happy that we were all still friends regardless of messy feelings.

As always, I brushed these thoughts aside, and focussed on what mattered. Star Wars day! Finally, it was *our* day. I made my way over to one of the rigs, testing the chair to make sure that I wouldn’t get landed with the infamous “squeaky one”. As I sunk into my “battle station” for the day, I smiled to myself as I listened to the beautiful sound of Kyle pouring ice over our supply of beers and Mountain Dew. This was going to be a good day.

The guys joined me one by one, Brad took a seat next to me, the chair squeaking like a banshee as he lowered himself down onto it. He gave me a knowing, slightly resentful look as he did so. He knew. Oh he knew. Oh well, early bird gets the… good chair. We all settled in, and booted up our rigs. The ambience of beer caps cracking and potato chips crunching, accompanying the nostalgic sound of the Windows startup screen. I loaded up Steam, as did my friends, and we launched Fallout 4. Upon launching the game, I was met with a pop up. 

“You are about to start Fallout 4 with the mod ‘F4-SW-ONLINE” active. This mod will significantly change your gameplay experience, and you may becoming unbalanced. Proceed? Yes/No”

What the hell… What a weird introduction. The signatures at the bottom appeared to be some kind of Eastern European, so I guessed the developers were non-English speakers. “Unbalanced”, meaning, the game could become unstable? I guess? I looked around the room, noticing my friends looking as confused as I was. *“Click yes then?”* Asked Kyle. And I shrugged, nodding my head *“Guess so!*

*What’s the worst that could happen?”*

We all clicked “Yes” to proceed, and we were booted into full screen mode, as Fallout 4 loaded up.

Instead of the typical menu screen however, we were met with an apocalyptic style depiction of Coruscant, the Jedi temple and the senate building in ruins, as dark clouds hung overhead. The music was, weird. It wasn’t the Fallout music, but it wasn’t Star Wars either, it was a kind generic mishmash of both, but slower. Kind of gloomy. There wasn’t much to do in the menu. There were only 3 selections. Start, Options or Load Game. Options didn’t really present any choices other than mapping your controls, which remained largely the same as the original Fallout 4. Aside from some extra, additional options. Tapping the “F” key for example, would supposedly activate “Force Push”.

I navigated back to the main menu, and selected “Start Game”, having no other real option. I had nothing to load up, afterall. Upon clicking start, the menu faded away to black. After a quick few seconds, some familiar blue text faded in. *“Many years ago, in a universe far away…”* Um… okay. Near enough I guess. And then, it faded back out again, before seconds later, the Star Wars logo exploded onto the display.

Wow, they really nailed the feel of the classic Star Wars intro! The logo was picture perfect, as it zoomed up into the black expanse of space. The text continued to scroll…

*“It is a dark time for the Galaxy. Two years after Civil War broke out, the Evil Count Dooku, desperate for victory at any cost, has unleashed the ultimate weapon of destruction upon Coruscant and many surrounding systems. Outlying planets have devolved into chaos as the threat of complete and total annihilation looms heavy over the Galaxy.*

*A small team of surviving Jedi have fled to the most isolated corners of the Capital in an attempt to regroup and overthrow the Separatist forces who now control the Galaxy…”*

Cool setup, I thought. I really liked the way they had incorporated the nuclear apocalypse theme into the canon Star Wars timeline. So, if I was understanding this correctly, this would be some kind of alternative universe setting that takes place between Attack of The Clones and Revenge of The Sith.

Upon completion of the opening scrawl, the camera panned down, just like it did in the films, and focussed on what looked like the ruins of an ancient temple. The scene cut to what appeared to be two young Jedi warriors, a boy and a girl, standing in front of a floor to ceiling mirror. Behind them, stands Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Okay, cool, so this is basically the Fallout 4 character creation screen. I selected the male character, and I began my customisation. Nothing crazy, I don’t get too deep with these. As long as the hair colour’s the same and the face looks kinda similar to my own, I’m pretty happy. I changed the hair to mid length black, and sprinkled a couple of freckles across the face, and that was me done. The rest of the guys spent a little longer on their’s, but I was keen to get out and explore the world.

When we were all done creating our characters, the screen suddenly glitched to black, before cutting back in. We were now all in this ruined temple together, standing before Obi-Wan. Looks like the mod was actually the real deal. It was a little glitchy, sure, but for all intents and purposes it did exactly what it said on the box. Fallout 4 had effectively become an open world, online multiplayer Star Wars game.

The game for the most part played out as you would expect. Rather that starting the game before the bombs go off, you begin in a world that is already ruined. As we all stood before Obi-Wan, we noticed he was talking. I guessed it must have been a little difficult to do cut scenes in this mod, given the online element.

Master Kenobi gave a quick speech. We are the only survivors, we must gather our forces etc. etc.

The end of the speech was a little strange though. After the main speech was finished, he would only repeat one line. 

*“Whatever you do, it’s already too late…”*

It was very out of character for him, he was always the guy full of optimism and hope in the films. But I guess a nuclear weapon wiping out half the galaxy probably changes one’s outlook a bit.

From here, things unfolded in a very “Fallout” kind of way. But with subtle changes. Instead of going to Concord to find friends and rescue the surviving Minutemen, you were sent by Obi-Wan to the Great

Western Sea to gather a platoon of Clones who had sent word they were pinned down. Upon getting them back to the temple safely, you were then ordered by their Captain (I guess this guy replaced Preston Garvey), to head out to Barsa Town and assist someone named “Whisper”, who turned out to be a Sith. He gave me a bit of a fright actually the first time I met him, spinning around to reveal his yellow eyes. But, as it turned out, the Sith are actually your allies in this game, even when they return to the temple, Obi-Wan and the other Jedi never attack them. I guess it makes sense canonically, even in The Clone Wars, Darth Maul didn’t want Palpatine in power any more than the Jedi did.

We continued on through the game, completing static quests here and there. It was all very simple, many of the Fallout quest lines were simply re-scripted and re-skinned, but they all took place in this very Star Wars-esque environment, interchanged with Star Wars set pieces and characters. They even had the odd starship flying overhead. It was a very immersive experience, and I was throughly enjoying myself. You went through the game as an individual but with your fellow players by your side. The only thing was, this removed the option of various dialogue choices, since it would be too difficult for 5 or 6 people to choose different dialogue and still have the game operate as normal. There was also no actual cutscenes during dialogue, so the main character’s voice would just kind of echo in from the void.

The game started getting strange, when it came time for us to leave Coruscant. I guessed that this part of the game was essentially when Preston informs you that it’s time to take back the castle. We all followed a waypoint to a dark corner of the temple, where the Clone Captain was waiting for us.

He told us it was time we sifted our forces to a stronger hold, off planet.

Somewhere less likely to draw attention. We were instructed to build a Star Ship capable of lightspeed travel, and a new subsection was added to the temple’s workshop. This was actually quite fun, but the issue came when too many people were trying to build at once, it got messy, so we have to opt for just one of us to do the job. I scored the privilege, and I got to work building our ship.

It was much like the Vault building DLC, huge pieces to click together in order to create a massive space ship. You had various hulls, wings, cockpits, bridges etc. Upon completion, you would snap it onto a generator in order to “refuel” the ship.

Sadly, as I expected, space travel was not an addition to the mod.

You just approached the ship and pressed “E” to activate it, and then selected a fast travel destination. A few expanded destinations were added to the map upon selecting the ship, one of them being off planet. It wasn’t a system name that I recognised, and I’ve read all of the expanded Universe. The system was called “Ruad”. Which I, of course, recognised historically, in real world terms. But it had definitely never been a part of the Star Wars universe. Anyway, I selected it, and off we went.

Upon reaching the Ruad system, this is where things in the game got, really weird. As soon as we spawned in beside the ship, we were met with a landscape that was just, downright wrong. Mist that looked more like red clouds encapsulated the surface of the planet. Shanty like buildings popped up randomly from the earth. Gnarled trees hung from the sky, seemingly hovering, but, their roots extending upwards indefinitely. In a way it kinda of resembled the Dagobah system, with its swampy, foggy setting. But the colours were off. Where Dagobah was gloomy and murky, this planet was more of a colourful setting. Shades of red and yellow, and a purple sky extending over the horizon.

We began to explore this planet. Me, heading west towards the looming cityscape, and each of my friends taking their own path. As we progressed, I occasionally heard them gasp, and I soon saw why, jumping back and gasping myself.

It was, twisted… disfigured. A downright awful creature. I only thought to look around as my character let out a grunt signalling he had lost health, and I looked down to see this thing shuﬄing on its hands and knees off into the grass. *“What the hell was that?!”* One of my friends shouted.

I chased after it, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.

As we progressed through the Ruad system, these things would pop up seemingly at random, crawling out of patches of grass or thick swamps, biting our characters’ legs before scuttling off. It made traversing this planet quite unsettling, as you’d never really see them coming.

I was nearing the city, when I heard my friend Mike shout *“What the HELL?!”* Looking over to him, I noticed his screen was on the Windows desktop. He shouted again *“One of those* ***things*** *just crawled up my back, and the game booted me!”* I scooted my chair over, puzzled. *“That’s weird”* I said. *“Try booting back in?”* Mike double clicked his Steam icon, selecting Fallout 4, before being met with another popup message… *“It’s already too late…”* it read, before booting him back to the desktop again.

He stared flabbergasted at his monitor, as he tried again and again to launch back into the game, only to be met with that same cryptic message again and again. There was quite literally nothing we could do to get his game working again.

We tried signing out of Steam and signing back in with his own Steam account. Same message. He even did a soft reset of Windows, same message. Shy of doing a full hard reset of the entire OS, which would have defeated the purpose as that would uninstall the mod, we tried everything. Eventually he gave up and just booted up battlefront 2, while the rest of us continued to play.

I continued on toward the city, reaching the outskirts now.

Whatever happened here hadn’t been pretty. Dismembered body parts lay strewn about amongst the rubble. As I walked, one by one, more of my friends met the same fate as Mike. All of them described the same thing happening, the twisted critters crawling up their backs, before the game abruptly booted them out, and they were unable to get back in. Simply being met with that same message, the one Obi-Wan had recited at the beginning… *“It’s already too late…”*

I guess I had made the right choice opting to head for the city. I hadn’t encountered the things since I made it through the swamplands.

Before much longer, I was the only one left in the game. As I made it to what seemed to be the city centre of this gnarled looking shanty town, my friends were now all locked out, opting instead to play Battlefront 2 together. Honestly, that was beginning to sounds preferable.

I stumbled through this ramshackle city, looking for any clue of what to do next. Spotting a figure up ahead, I held down the sprint key and ran towards it. It was Master Windu. He was standing at the entrance to one of the buildings, but… he was standing very… still. As I drew nearer, I realised that he was indeed ***very*** still. Frozen in place, in fact.

His face was morphed into a scowl, his eyes looking eerily off to one side, as though he had seen something coming. He was basically a statue in the game. No movement. Not even when you hit him or force pushed him. The worst thing was I couldn’t even get around him, so if there was anything to find in this building, which it looked like there was, I couldn’t get in there to see it.

Okay, so I decided to turn and head North, up this narrow alleyway towards what looked like the main building in town. It was massive, and looked a little more in tact than the rest. I thought maybe I might find some answers there. As I walked, I noticed scuttling figures again. Kind of like the same ones from the swamp, but these ones, standing upright, darting between the windows of the wrecked buildings. It was actually super unsettling in first person mode, so I switched the view to third person.

As I approached the metal monstrosity, I caught sight of yet another figure. This time, a shorter one. Very short. It was Master Yoda. Again, as I progressed toward him, I noticed him frozen in place, the same as Master Windu was. Again, no matter what I did, he couldn’t be moved. He was just immortalised there in time and space. His face was also frozen in an eerie expression, his mouth curled upwards and his eyes squinting, looking off to one side.

No matter which way I walked, I would encounter more characters frozen in place, blocking the entrance to any building I could hope to enter. The only way to go, besides walking all over the planet looking for something to do (not really possible due to the existence of those strange crawling things that crashed the game), was to go back to the ship. So I did. And there stood Obi-Wan Kenobi. His hands behind his back, gently swaying back and forth in front on the ship. I could not longer activate the ship either. The only thing I could do was press “E” to talk to Obi-Wan, who would only say, *“Whatever you do, it’s already too late…”*

Well the ship was out. I wasn’t going back to the city, there was nothing there. I wasn’t traversing the long grass, as I didn’t want the game to crash. The only other way to go was through the giant swamp. I had no idea what was in there. I knew the “creatures” were in the grass, and in the buildings, but I wasn’t sure if they were hiding in the swamp. So in I jumped.

Swimming through the murky ick, the game’s audio got… strange. I heard these whiny groans coming in through my speakers, and I began to wonder if these were the cries of those twisted humanoid things that had been attacking us. I wondered if they were surrounding my character. I know it’s just a game, but the feeling of being out there in those dark waters, potentially being hunted by these things that could end me in such a permanent way as to not only kill my character but, my game as well… it was truly frightening. But I made it through unscathed.

At the shoreline, I came out into what I can only describe as absolute nothing. I mean, when I crawled out of the swamp, I was standing in the same mystical, dark surroundings as the rest of the Ruad system, but when I took a few steps forward, everything just morphed into emptiness, flickering between absolute whiteness and blackness. I took a few steps back, and found myself back in the starry, swirling lights of the upside down forests. Then, a few steps forward, and bam, back into the void.

I realised at this point, that I was experiencing the effects of a mod unfinished. This must have been as far as they ever got with the development. I felt a pang of disappointment. Despite the weirdness, I was actually quite enjoying it. So, I walked around.

What else could I do? I just… walked. Trudging through thick grass, swamps and random structures until I was inevitably found by one of those burned looking things, climbing its way up my back, and opening its mouth behind my neck… before my game glitched into black and I was booted to Windows. I don’t know why I tried it, but I did. I tried clicking open the game again. But of course, was met with that same message. *“It’s already too late…”*

I looked around at my friends. Kyle spoke up, *“They got you too aye?”* I gave him a disappointed look… *“yeah”* I replied. *“Guess that’s it for Star Wars Day”* I said, glancing at my watch. 5pm. It was about time for us to wind down and start heading back home. Tomorrow we would have no such luxuries so as to sit around gaming. Tomorrow, it was back to the grind. And it was the thought of the grind that first gave me pause.

*“Hey Kyle, what time’s Heather meant to get home?* I asked.

*“Uh… actually. Should have been around 3 or 4…”* He replied, curiously.

In fact, we both found it odd that we hadn’t even heard from her all day. No messages, no calls.

Nothing but that note on her laptop. We decided to wait and see if perhaps she was running late. We cracked another couple of beers and played another couple of rounds on Battlefront 2. It wasn’t until another hour passed, and there was still no word from Heather, that Kyle tried calling her.

And it was only when her phone went directly to voicemail, that we became concerned.

After calling her office and being told that, no, she wasn’t there, we entered full on panic mode. Kyle was in a right state, understandably so. And as he got on the phone to the Police, I decided to take one more look at the last real indication we had, as to where Heather might be. Her laptop.

I walked over to the kitchen bench, where it still sat plugged in, and I slowly opened it up to read the note she had left. Nothing out of the ordinary there.

*“3 days?! Are you serious?!”* I overheard Kyle say on the phone. The Police, I’m guessing, informing him as to the expected time frames for missing persons reports. It was as I minimised the word document containing the note, that I gestured to him to wait. To not hang up the phone.

We had all been so excited for Star Wars Day. That we never stopped to question any of it. We had not stopped to think, why Heather would have possibly been called into the office, when she had been working remotely from home for the last 8 months. No one had even questioned where she had found the mod in the first place. But as we now gazed upon the TOR Browser open on her laptop, and the glitchy red and green 90s style website, displaying nothing but a simple file download button, and right underneath it, a ping to her location. It all fell into place…

I had thought the language was off. The permissions, an Eastern European look about them.

Trafficking’s big business in that part of the world. A beautiful girl like Heather… that was high demand. But how do you transport a person out of the country, from right under their closest friends’ noses? Kyle realised before I did, probably around the time the phone lines were cut. The mod did not exist for fun. It didn’t exist as some kind of random bait. This was done with purpose and intent. This was orchestrated by a very smart individual, who knew our lives, who knew our interests, and specifically wanted ***her***. How do you kidnap someone without any of those closest to them noticing? Well, keeping them distracted for an entire day, would certainly go a long way to that goal.

Kyle cracked one of the blinds, and as we caught sight of the black vans parked strategically around our neighbourhood, we knew what this was. We knew we were never leaving that house.

I sat back down. Cracked a cold beer, and booted up Battlefront II with my friends.

Star Wars day… was my LIFE! And I was going to enjoy what remained of it…",1,1766520080.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

  ""Nyeh...if you really wanna,"" Himiko called back. 



 

  Kokichi opened the door, skipping up to Himiko with holly jolly glee. She was sitting on her bed, sipping hot chocolate while reading a book under her cozy blanket. Kokichi plopped himself next to her. 





   ""What'cha doin' on this fine Christmas Eve?"" he asked, nuzzling her nose. 



 

  Himiko giggled and squealed with delight. ""Nyeh...just reading. Why?""



 

  ""I'm glad you asked!"" Kokichi said, and pulled out his phone. He flashed Himiko a flirty grin. ""'Cuz I've decided that this Christmas, I'll be a nice boy, not a naughty boy.""



 

  Himiko raised her eyebrows in surprise. ""Oh, really?""





   ""Yup! See, I wanted us to have the most perfect, romantic Christmas, so I came up with a Christmas list!"" 





   ""Kokichiiii!"" Himiko said, eagerly taking a glance at his phone. ""What's on the list?""





   ""Well, tomorrow morning, we'll stop by the café at nine for a romantic breakfast,"" Kokichi began.





   ""Ooo! That *does* sound romantic,"" Himiko admitted, batting her eyelashes at him. ""Then what?""





   ""Then, we can make it in time for the Christmas party at Hope's Peak,"" Kokichi continued. ""There, you and I can sing 'Baby, It's Cold Outside.'""





   ""Aw, I do love singing together,"" Himiko replied. ""What else?""





   ""After the Christmas party, we'll head over to Oodles o' Noodles for lunch. After lunch, we'll head over to the park to see the illuminations.""





   ""Nyeh...now that's *definitely* romantic,"" Himiko said with a dreamy look in her eye. ""I never thought I'd see the illuminations, well...with a boyfriend.""





   ""Well, believe it, baby!"" Kokichi replied, stroking her cheek. ""Now, after the illuminations, we'll order KFC and come back home and exchange gifts. And, thus, concludes our perfect Christmas.""





   ""Kokichi! I'm impressed!"" Himiko replied, ruffling his hair. ""I wasn't really expecting anything tomorrow, but...now, I'm really excited.""





   ""What, you didn't think I was romantic enough to set something like this up?"" Kokichi asked with a playful smirk. 



 

  ""Nyeh...no, I didn't think that, 'cuz you're definitely romantic,"" Himiko replied shyly. ""I just thought that if we weren't gonna do anything together, I'd just spend most of tomorrow in bed reading or napping.""



 

  ""Whaaaat? I wouldn't do that to my Supreme Lady!"" Kokichi said, scooping her hand in his and kissing it. ""You deserve the best, most romantic Christmas in the world.""





   Himiko blushed, turning away. ""Kokichi, stop..."" she said, clutching her hot chocolate mug tightly between the long, fluffy sleeves of her sweater. 





   Grinning, Kokichi grabbed the top of her mug and moved it to her nightstand. He pressed his forehead against hers, slowly leaning her against her pillow. ""Your lips say stop, but your eyes say, 'Damn, I wish I had his eyes,'"" Kokichi murmured playfully in a low, flirty voice. 



 

  ""No, they don't!!"" Himiko laughed, covering her reddening cheeks with her sleeves. ""I don't want your eyes!""





""Oh, no? Then why do you keep looking into them?"" Kokichi asked, removing Himiko's sleeves from her face. He inched his lips closer to hers.





""Because you're all up in my face!"" Himiko cried, giggling. She pressed her sleeves to her face again. 





   ""Hmhm...I'm *about* to be,"" Kokichi chuckled. He placed his hands on her sleeves, moving them behind his neck before moving his hands down onto Himiko's waist, lowering her onto her pillows as he pressed his lips and body against hers. Himiko sighed and giggled, melting into his kiss. 





   \*\*\*





   ""Heeeey, sexy babe!"" Kokichi said the next morning when Himiko knocked on his door a quarter to nine. ""Lookin' cute today!""





   ""Nyeh...thanks,"" Himiko replied, blushing. ""You do, too.""





   ""I hope so,"" Kokichi said, scoping his outfit. ""I dug through the trash for these threads.""





""*YOU DID?!* "" Himiko cried. 





   ""Hahahahaha! That was a lie,"" Kokichi said, bursting into laughter. ""Man, that reaction was too good!""





   ""Heeey, you said you weren't gonna be naughty this Christmas, so that means no lying,"" Himiko scolded, wagging her finger at him.





   ""You're right, HimiCocoa Bean,"" Kokichi replied, then wrapped his arm around her waist, and with his other hand, held hers in his. ""Now, come, Monkey Buns, it's time for the most romantic Christmas, ever!"" he said in a dramatic voice. 





   ""Nyeh...starting at the café, right?""





   ""Mm-hmm!"" Kokichi replied. Huddled close together, the two headed outside, their boots crunching against the bright white snow illuminated by the morning sun. Kokichi skipped ahead and turned, grabbing Himiko's hands as he skipped backwards.





   ""We're going to the café, the café, the café! We're going to the café for a romantic Christmas day!"" he sang. 





   ""Umm...Kokichi...?"" Himiko said, her smile fading. 





   Kokichi frowned at her. ""Hm? What's wrong?""





   Himiko pointed behind him. Kokichi turned to see a woman exiting the café, and lowering the shutters over the the windows. 





   ""*WHAT?!* "" Kokichi exclaimed. He sprinted towards the café, yanking Himiko behind him. ""Hey! Hey, lady!""





   The woman turned to him. ""Yes?""





   ""Hey...hey, is the café closed?!""





   The woman gave him an apologetic nod. ""I'm so sorry.""





  ""But, everything's supposed to be open today!""





   ""Yes, well...earlier this morning, the owner of the café stubbed his toe on the counter, stumbled backwards, tripped and bashed his head against one of the tables, and, well...""





  ""And *what?* "" Kokichi asked, twirling his wrist.





   ""And...he died.""





   ""Well, *SO?!* "" Kokichi cried. ""*You* didn't! So, get your butt back in there and fire up those lattes! I promised my girlfriend here I'd give her the most romantic Christmas ever, and I ain't about to miss out on it because some old fart bit the dust!""





   The woman lowered her head. ""That 'old fart' was my father.""





   Kokichi turned to Himiko. ""Himiko, you'd better watch what you say to people! You're gonna hurt their feelings!""





   ""Kokichi,"" Himiko scolded, crossing her arms at him. 





   Kokichi sighed and rolled his eyes as he turned to the woman. ""Alright, alright. I'm sorry about your dad, okay?"" He grabbed Himiko's hand and trudged down the road. ""C'mon, Himiko,"" he mumbled forlornly. 





   Himiko mouthed an apology to the woman before following Kokichi down the road. 



 

  ""Kokichi, why did you say all those things to that lady?""





   ""I dunno...I got mad,"" Kokichi muttered sheepishly. He sighed again. ""Now what?""





   ""Nyeh...don't you have a backup plan? You always do.""





   ""Well, I didn't think I'd need one this time,"" Kokichi admitted. 





   ""Wow, you really wanted today to work out, huh?"" Himiko asked, patting his cheek sympathetically. ""It's okay, Panta Bear. We can go to the other café up the street and grab breakfast there.""





  ""Well, that café isn't nearly as good, but...okaaay,"" Kokichi sighed. 





   ""Don't be sad,"" Himiko said. ""Remember, we still have the rest of today.""





   Kokichi brightened a little. ""Yeah, I guess you're right,"" he said with a small smile. 





   Himiko grabbed Kokichi's hands and skipped ahead. ""C'mon, Kokichi! We're going to the café, the café, the café! We're going to the café for a romantic Christmas day!""





   Kokichi laughed as he followed her inside the café down the street. They were greeted with a warm atmosphere and the rich smell of coffee and sweet treats. Kokichi pulled out a chair for Himiko at a table before taking a seat himself. 





   A waitress sauntered up to their table. ""Good morning. What can I get you guys?""





   ""You first, Himiko,"" Kokichi said, nodding to her. 





   ""Okay, I'll just have a French vanilla latte and a strawberry muffin,"" Himiko replied. 





   ""Yeah, me, too,"" Kokichi said.





   ""Coming up!"" the waitress promised, then hurried away. 





   ""See? This isn't so bad,"" Himiko said. 





""Yeah, I guess not,"" Kokichi admitted. ""I guess as long as we get something to eat, it'll be fine.""



 

  ""Yeah!"" Himiko said, patting Kokichi's hand. Kokichi smiled appreciatively at her. 





   ""Here you go!"" the waitress said, placing two coffee cups on the table along with two plates of strawberry muffins.





   Kokichi and Himiko thanked the waitress after Kokichi paid her. He took a sip of his latte. 





   ""Ee-yuck!!"" he cried. ""This is *cold!* What the hell?!"" He sighed and slammed his cup on the table in frustration, lowering his chin on the table. 





   ""No, it's fine,"" Himiko said with a slight grimace as she took a sip. ""Mine tastes pretty good.""





   ""I know you're lying,"" Kokichi mumbled. 





   ""I'm sorry, Kokichi,"" Himiko said softly. 





   ""And I wasted my money on this shit, too,"" Kokichi muttered in annoyance. He buried his face into his hands. ""Dammit!""





   Himiko placed her hands on her chest, as if to soothe the heartache she was feeling for him at that moment. It wasn't long before an idea crossed her mind. She stood from seat, the noise of the chair causing Kokichi to look up at her. 





   ""Where you going?""





   ""I'll be right back, Kokichi,"" Himiko said before hurrying off to the bathroom. 





Kokichi sighed and leaned back in his seat. ""I can't *believe* this is happening,"" he muttered to himself, shaking his head. He stared out the window at the passersby outside, no doubt eager to head to their own destinations for their perfect Christmas. Annoyed, Kokichi rolled his eyes and buried his head between his arms on the table. 





   ""Pssst, Kokichi,"" came Himiko's whisper. 





   Kokichi looked up to see Himiko's hair now black and her eyes ruby red. Her skin had also changed from pale to a light tan. Kokichi looked around to make sure nobody was listening. He smiled at her.





   ""You changed into a fire mage, didn't you?"" he whispered.





   Himiko nodded and reached over to grab Kokichi's cup, which she hid under the table to avoid any wandering eyes as she heated Kokichi's latte with her fire powers. She handed Kokichi's latte back to him.





   ""Try it now.""





  Kokichi took a sip. ""Hey! Now *that's* better!"" he said, taking another gulp. 





   Himiko beamed. ""So, you like it?""





   ""Yeah! Thanks, Himi! You saved breakfast!""





   Himiko blushed and scrunched her shoulders modestly before heating up her own latte. After they finished their breakfast, they headed back outside. 





   ""Well, thanks to you, babe, breakfast wasn't a total bust,"" Kokichi said, kissing Himiko's cheek. 





   ""Aw, shucks,"" Himiko replied. 





   ""Welp, there's still fun and romance to be had, so let's go over to Hope's Peak!"" Kokichi said, the life returning to his eyes. Himiko smiled at him, happy to see him happy. ",0,1766520008.0,danganronpa,0,0.5,False

I’m an American guy traveling to Kerala / varkala for the first time towards end of the year for around 6-10days solo. 

I’ve found a few good hostels but open to recommendations—I usually look for hostels with a private room accommodation but enjoy staying in hostels due to the common areas / ability to meet additional solo travelers. I’ve heard the north is for meeting people/parties and the south is for more peaceful stays but if there’s anything else I’m missing please let me know. 

Looking for what options are out there for nye parties as a solo traveler, or where to meet friends that are in the same boat—if anyone can recommend. 

P.s any additional tips for varkala area also welcome:)

I like making new friends, drop in yoga classes, coffee, any sort of class really (art/dancing/cooking)🤓 and just being in nature. 

Will be my first time in Kerala and traveling solo for NYE but have lived in India for around 10 years during childhood(half Bengali—anyone i could speak in bangla with in varkala would be a huge bonus lol)

It works fine. The milk steam wand settings are easy and adequate, selecting different temperatures and foam amounts. It's a one button, press and forget type deal. No issues.

The espresso function is.... weird. The single or double espresso buttons don't seem to have any rhyme or reason to them, dispensing random amounts, and basically I just have to press it again to stop it once I have the desired amount. No big deal, but a bit odd.

The first issue is using the single walled cup for the puck of coffee grounds. I have tried absolutely everything I can think of, every grind size possible. (I have a separate conical burr electric grinder which does the job perfectly well). I only ever get a weak, under extracted coffee with no crema. So I switched to the double walled one and it works fine. But only if I use the single espresso size. If I use the double size, I have the exact opposite problem where it's over-pressured and over extracts so hard that it ends up not extracting almost at all. 

At any rate, I found a system so I can have pretty good coffee - use the double walled, single espresso size cup, with the finest grind my grinder can do, and manually press the button to stop extracting. It works, so whatever.

  
Anyway, today my girlfriend and I were very kindly gifted the big brother of this machine, the Barista Express, also Sage. (A friend of hers was moving house and didn't want the machine anymore)

Exactly the same issues. Single walled cups just result in watery and under extracted coffee, and the double walled, double espresso size one over pressurises and doesn't dispense. Tried every grind size etc etc. This model has the added ""bonus"" of taking up more than twice as much counter space and having, as far as I can tell, a worse milk steam wand. 

Is this just a Sage issue or am I doing something fundamentally wrong? They're pretty pricey so even if I'm not expecting high end coffee, I would at the very least expect it to fairly effortlessly make a decent and consistent espresso at the press of a button, given that this is literally the whole point of having one. 

My thoughts are that either this is a consistent issue with this product line, that I have got unlucky with dud machines, or that I'm just bad at using what should intuitively be a very easy piece of equipment to use. 

Is this a common issue? Any suggestions? ",1,1766519942.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

The map was already open when I woke, though neither of us remembered unfolding it. Lines crossed where they always had, yet today they seemed less concerned with destination and more interested in relationship. Paths brushing past one another. Near-misses. Loops that returned not to where they began, but to where they made sense.
Jane traced nothing. She never does. Her finger hovered, patient, as if the map might speak first if given the chance.
I realized something then:
This was never a maze.
A maze demands a solution. It assumes an exit. It implies error if you turn the wrong way. But this—this was closer to a puzzle you don’t solve so much as recognize. The kind that rearranges itself the moment you think you’ve got it pinned down.
We laughed quietly at that. Coffee cooling. Light shifting. The absurd relief of realizing you’re not lost—you’re just early in understanding.
There are routes here that only appear when you stop searching for them. Others vanish the moment you insist they must lead somewhere useful. The map seems to reward attention, not effort.
Today we didn’t choose a direction.

I finish up my daily agenda, run some errands and when it’s getting close to your arrival, start preparing a nice meal you walk in from work. I’m finishing up the cooking. You grab me from behind. Kiss me on my neck and tell me it smells good and let me know what you’re having for dessert…. you run to the bathroom to grab a shower… you’d get out the shower we would  eat, discuss  a little snippet of our day. I’d complain about how competitive the job market is right now and you complain about an idiotic  customer.

We head to the couch and agree on a new movie to watch. I  ask you if you’re sore, you would  tell me your knee was bothering you. I would gently rub out the kink before moving to giving you a shoulder rub that leads to a back rub then a back scratch that leads to some ear nibbles that leads to me kissing you, that leads to me whispering I want you now that would lead to a steamy passionate lovemaking session

We would rewind the movie to the last part where we were fully paying attention. I’d lay my head in your lap as you stroked my hair and we would finish it off before heading to bed. Possibility that you’d fall asleep before the ending but I’d wake you to head to bed.

Once upon a time, there were eight ancient wolves that used to roam this planet of ours. All had their own territory, and each was more ruthless than the other.
The first one I can tell you about is from Greek mythology — the watcher of the underworld: Cerberus, the three-headed hound.
Second, I’ll take you to the great watcher for Odin in Norse mythology. It was once said not even the gods could face him — Fenrir, the monstrous wolf.
Then there’s his kin, the two great twin giant wolves who once chased the sun and the moon — and maybe still do, to this very day or until the end of time — Sköll and Hati, the twin wolves.
We can go back to biblical times and talk about the hound that drags souls away to the underworld. It has many names, but for practical use, Hellhound is the most common. Its fur is dark as charcoal, and its eyes burn hot like the earth’s core.
These next couple don’t come from any known myths, but from different tribes, so I can only share what my people told me.
There was once a giant wolf that guarded the mountains — or maybe it was as big as the mountain itself. The ancient tribes of North America prayed to it and brought offerings, and the giant wolf protected them from harm. That wolf’s name was Amarok, the Titan Wolf.
Long ago, there was another — a wolf that killed everything that entered its land. In the central part of America, they called it The Harvester, or The Silver Menace. It didn’t care for many; they said it killed for the thrill of the hunt and loved a challenge. If you saw it, I’m sorry to say — you were already dead.
The last two I can tell you about… honestly, I don’t believe in them, but my loved ones say never take them for granted.
A long time ago, there was a valley where nothing dared to enter. My mother told me that this wolf didn’t care for humanity much, but it loved other wildlife. One day, an old man walked into the valley and was never seen again. Years later, they found his remains miles down the river. Only one person lived to tell the tale — he said it was something not alive, but not dead either. They called it The Skeleton Wolf, a great wolf that refused to die. “All you see,” he said, “are bones moving all around you before it attacks.” He survived only because he reached the end of the valley — but not before losing his right eye and leg.
There you have it — the report of the eight great wolves the tribes used to worship.
I do have an honorable mention, though — a folk tale told to scare kids like me into listening to our elders. Long ago, there was a great wolf that had been long forgotten, its fur pure white and glowing under the moonlight. Its eyes shone a bright sapphire blue with a hint of white. They say it was larger than any known wolf. There are few stories of it, no proof — only rumors and a body once found with white fur that shimmered in the night.
My name is Yasmine Dagado, and this is my report on the lost wolf-worshipping tribes.
“Thank you, Yazzy, for the report, but you lost a couple of people along the way,” the teacher said with a smile, pointing to a boy with jet-black hair and a white streak up the middle. “Oh, Lyam, sweetheart, we need you to wake up now.”
Miss Faelynn — a light-skinned Latina, about 5'5"", freckles across her face, dark hazel eyes, and long curly hair tied up in a messy bun — started getting the kids ready for a maintenance drill.
Meanwhile, on the other side of town, miles away near the woods, stood a stretch of abandoned houses. The last house on the street was the only one still lived in — and it was surrounded by what seemed like seven-foot-tall wolves.
“I’m sorry, my love... I can’t go on anymore. Please, get to the school. I saw one break away…” A man with white hair and a black streak down the middle lay on the floor, a gaping wound torn into his left side.
“A vita ad mortem, ab odio ad amorem, benedictione maiorum nostrorum, vos terrae ad quam venimus reddo, itaque hodie vobis fortissimum anxietatem vestram reddo, qui honestam pugnastis pugnam.”
(From life to death, from hatred to love, with the blessing of our ancestors, I return you to the land to which we came. Today I return your strongest warrior, who fought an honorable fight.)
A young lady wearing a black hooded coat, her soft brown eyes shining with sorrow, gazed down at his fading blue ones. Blood covered the floor beneath his lifeless body as she disappeared.
Back at the school, the kids started to notice the weather changing drastically. The perfect sunny day turned dark and stormy. The air grew heavy, and fog poured in thick like smoke.
“Miss Fae! Lee’s still sleeping in the back!” a student yelled as they crouched down for the tornado drill.
“Lee! Wake up!” Yazzy shouted, shaking him.
“Huh… Yazz, that you? I don’t feel too good…” Lyam opened his eyes — but they weren’t brown anymore. They shimmered sapphire blue with a faint glow of white.
As the storm worsened, the hallways grew darker. A low, deep growl echoed through the classroom, sending shivers down every spine.
“Miss Fae!?” Yazzy whispered.
The growl stopped.
Then from the shadows, a dark, massive wolf — at least eight feet tall — moved through the room like liquid shadow, its green eyes gleaming with an ancient intelligence. It stared at Lyam, still clutching his chest on the ground.
“¡Por favor! Mi señor, ¡ayúdanos! Somebody, anybody, protect the kids!” Miss Fae cried, sliding down the door in fear.
“Damn, Fae,” a voice came from the broken window. “Can’t take down one little puppy? It’s just a flick of the wrist.”
A hooded figure leapt in, grabbed a desk, and slammed it into the back of the wolf’s head. The beast stumbled. The hooded figure grabbed its neck and twisted — snap!
“Like I said, just a flick of the wrist.”
She pulled her hood back — Annalise F. Jones, Lyam’s mother. Her bright caramel skin, long braided curls over one shoulder, and eyes glowing with power made her presence commanding. She crouched beside Yazzy and smiled. “You did good protecting my Lyam.”
Lifting her son gently, she took Yazzy’s hand and started walking them out of the room, giving Miss Fae a disappointed look. “No matter what, I’ll protect the kids. No need to scream for help.”

Annalise walked toward the end of the hallway, holding Lyam over her shoulder while Yazzy walked beside her, still clinging tightly to her hand.
Miss Fae hurried to gather the rest of the children, ushering them into another classroom before following behind in complete shock at what had just happened.

It felt like forever before they reached the end of the hall. Moments ago, they were in Miss Fae’s classroom—now they stood in front of a bright, decorated door that read “Principal Dagado” in colorful, wavy letters.

“Miss Fae, open the door, please. You don’t have to knock,” Annalise said, glancing back at her with the most menacing look imaginable.

Without hesitation, Miss Fae burst through the door and stood to the side silently, trembling with fear.

“Hey... girl,” said the woman sitting on the desk, rolling her eyes—until she noticed who had walked in.

“Sarah Lynn... you been avoiding little old me?” Annalise smirked. “Bitch, we need to talk.”

“Girl... let her go. Yasmine, come to me, now,” Sarah said, standing and waving her hand for Yazzy to come closer.

Both women locked eyes, the air between them growing tense.

“These are my lands, Lise. My territory. What are you doing roaming around here, fallen mutt?” Sarah’s voice was cold, confident, and calm—each word dipped in venom.

Annalise’s eyes darkened as she glanced between Sarah and Miss Fae. With a sigh, she set the kids gently down on the beanbag chairs and stood in the middle of the office.

“He’s dead, Sarah. Jacob is dead. Lyam... he has it now. He’s the new alpha of the Apex.”
Her voice cracked as she looked down, shaking her head in disbelief.

Sarah’s eyes widened slightly. “He’s just a kid, Lise... not even shifting like your regular mutts, let alone something that powerful. I’m sorry, but maybe we need to put him d—”

She stopped, realizing what she was about to say. The look on Annalise’s face turned so dark, even for her, that Sarah quickly stepped back.

“Lo lamento, I’m sorry. Lord knows I wouldn’t know what to do without my precious—” she hesitated, glancing at Yazzy, “—Yahyah. So, what do we do now? They’re gonna come after him next. He needs an advisor—”

“No.”

“—and start making his pack—”

“No.”

“He has to shift, Lise. I’ve never even seen that kind of power up close before.”

“Sarah! He’s just a child—my child!” Annalise roared, her voice shaking the room. “I already lost my husband. I can’t lose him too!”

She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. “I need you to erase everyone’s memory of this day. Fire this bitch—” she growled, glaring at Miss Fae, “—for not doing anything to protect our kids. I’m leaving for a while. And as far as I’m concerned, your precious Yazzy is Lyam’s advisor from now on.”

Annalise’s emotions boiled over. She punched the wall beside Miss Fae’s head, letting out a deep, primal growl that shook the whole office. Miss Fae froze, trembling and pale, her fear so intense she could barely stand—she even soiled herself.

“Calm down, Lise. You don’t have to hurt the regulars,” Sarah said carefully. Then she turned to Miss Fae. “By the way, Miss Fae, you are immediately relieved of your position. Please, for the love of God, clean yourself up. Oh—before I forget... Te commendo ut ultimas duodecim horas peragas.”

A red mist glowed from Sarah’s fingertips as she twirled them in the air. Instantly, everyone in the building—and anyone who had witnessed the storm—lost all memory of what had happened that day. The heavy clouds outside cleared with a flick of her wrist.

“I don’t know if Yazzy can be his advisor,” Sarah said, walking back to her desk. “She’s not a proper witch yet. And Lyam... he’s the most dangerous Apex predator now.”

“I can seal his powers,” she continued softly. “I know Jacob would’ve wanted that.” She looked over at the two kids sleeping on the beanbags.

Miss Fae stumbled out of the office in a dazed panic, barely able to walk straight, clutching the wall for balance. Lise quickly shut the door behind her.

“Listen, Sarah. I’m giving you five years to teach her how to be a ‘proper’ witch.” Annalise made air quotes. “We’re leaving Atlanta. I gotta train him to be a ‘proper’ Apex.”

Sarah smirked slightly. “I always imagined seeing those goddess eyes looking at me. They remind me of your father... Annalise Finrir Jones, daughter of Loki—one of the great Apex.”

She stepped closer, brushing her hand softly across Lise’s cheek.

Lise caught Sarah’s hand, her golden-hazel eyes flashing with power. She turned, picked up Lyam, and slung him over her shoulder. Before leaving, she looked back with one glowing eye.

“Five years is all you get. On my father’s name, I’ll smite your whole bloodline, you bloody witch—and scatter your body across the Nine Realms.”

She disappeared through the door.

Sarah sighed, glancing up at the ceiling, then down at Yazzy with a grim expression.
“Lise knows I’m immortal, yet she still thinks she can hurt me... My, she’s surely grown.”


---

Meanwhile, back in Miss Fae’s classroom, she frantically packed her belongings, still dazed and trembling.
“How did this happen?... What am I gonna do? Ugh! I need some clean clothes!” she muttered, pacing.

Suddenly, she was yanked off her feet—Lise stood there, gripping her throat.

“I’ll give you two choices: come with me, or I kill you right here.” Annalise’s eyes glowed fiercely.

“H... how did you get in here? The doors were—” Fae choked out, clawing at her hand.

“MAKE A CHOICE! LIVE OR DIE!” Lise roared, her patience fading.

“I... WANT... TO... LIVE!” Fae gasped.

Just then, the classroom door flung open.

Sarah peeked in. “Huh. I swear I heard yelling in here... and Fae left all her stuff. I’ll just mail it to her house.” She shrugged and walked away.

Moments later, Lise and Fae reappeared in a dimly lit cave miles from the city. Lise tossed Fae to the ground, then walked to the back to check on Lyam, who was still sound asleep.

Fae rubbed her neck, fresh bite marks oozing blood that stained her white dress.

“Don’t touch it—it’ll stop bleeding soon. Congrats, you survived the bite. I’m sorry, but I need help raising him. I can’t do it alone,” Lise said, tossing her clean black clothes and a hood.

Fae looked around. “Where are we? I don’t remember this place on any map.”

“This won’t show up on any map or GPS,” Lise replied. “This is my territory—a rift between realms. You live here now and help me raise Lyam. We leave in the morning.”

Fae blinked, confused but listening. “So let me get this straight—I have to do what you say because you’re my Alpha now, and I’m... a werewolf? Lyam’s the Apex predator—the Ghost Wolf—from Yazzy’s story? And you’re an Apex too—Finrir? And other packs want control of him? But if he’s that powerful, how did your husband die?”

Fae rambled on for nearly twenty minutes.

Lyam stirred awake, rubbing his eyes. “So... my dad’s dead? And I’m what he was now?”

He started to cry. Both women rushed to his side, hugging him tightly.

“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I was going to tell you tomorrow when we left for the village,” Lise whispered. “Everything’s going to be okay.”

She wiped his tears away gently.


---

Five years passed.
They traveled across realms, growing closer, learning, and surviving—until at last, they returned to Atlanta.

“Man, do I have to go back to school?” Lyam groaned, standing by the door. “I liked being free, doing what I want—and I don’t like people.”

He turned to see Fae asleep on the couch, wearing only a bra and panties, half-covered by a blanket, while Lise stood in the kitchen sipping coffee.

“Reality check,” Lise said. “Sarah’s magic only lasts five years. I gotta collect what’s owed to me and mine. Don’t worry—Fae’s going with you. Now get up; you’re gonna be late for work. Bills don’t pay themselves, and I can’t keep scaring the landlord.”

She kicked Fae off the couch, sending her flying into the wall.

“Ma, we own the building. What landlord are you talking about?” Lyam said, teleporting to help Fae up. “And how’s she supposed to run the company and teach at the school?”

“Thanks, Lyam,” Fae groaned, rubbing her head. “Your mom’s trying to overwork me again. Goddess, can you—”

“Here,” Lyam said, handing her an oversized shirt.

“Fae, remember—you serve me and Lyam,” Lise said, walking over with her coffee. “Don’t fight anyone. There’s a new pack in town. Keep your identity hidden. No true powers. And do you have your contacts in? We can’t have your eyes giving you away.”

Lise smiled suddenly.

“Ma... what are you planning?” Lyam asked warily.

“Lyam, we need to run,” Fae whispered, hiding behind him. “I know that look—I barely survive her plans when she looks like this.”

Lise set her cup down, smirking.

Before they could react, she vanished—and reappeared holding both of them by the collars, dangling them over the balcony.

“It’s still early, regulars aren’t up yet,” she said with a crooked smile. “Lyam, you need practice. Fae, you need punishment. Enjoy the trip—and Lyam, don’t let my beta die.”

“Wait, what—”

Before they could finish, she dropped them.

Fae screamed, flailing. Lyam stayed calm, eyes glowing faintly as he reached out and grabbed her hand. In a flash, they teleported safely to the car in the building’s basement.

“Guess I’m going to school,” Lyam muttered, grabbing his keys. “You heading to work?”

“You’ll be fine, kid,” Fae said, smiling as she changed clothes from her trunk. “Just make one friend, okay? I’m just stopping by the office, meeting some old coworkers, maybe giving them the ‘Lise treatment.’ Then I’ll head to your school and take a part-time teaching job—your mom insists we stay close.”

She laughed and waved.

They both got in their cars and drove away—unaware that, miles away, a shadowed bird-like figure watched from above, its glowing red eyes locked on the building.

“Damn dirty mutts,” it hissed. “That power will be under my control.”

With a flap of its wings, it turned toward the school—following Lyam.",1,1766519657.0,u_kynggYea96,0,1.0,False

For a bit of context, I (25W) work in the same company as him (24M), he is in operations but I work in HR.

Since October, I became very close to a coworker. He initiated the first message on teams and kept the conversation going, We talked every single day at work (Teams + in person), laughed constantly, and spent a lot of time together. We regularly had breaks together (usually hour long breaks in our social spaces at work), and would often get hot chocolate together (he would offer them and pay for them), we would also call for 2/3 hours during work hours just to chat.

He also did some genuinely thoughtful things for me. For example, he organized a small scavenger hunt in the office specifically for me, just as a fun surprise. Another time, he went to get coffee and asked if I wanted a hot chocolate, bought it, and brought it to me while I was on a work call. Small but intentional gestures like that happened often.

We joked, teased each other a lot, and felt very comfortable together, even though there wasn’t much explicit flirting, which already made things confusing for me and knew I was going to start falling for him.

I added him on Instagram at some point, but we never really talked there. Our connection stayed very work-centered, which now makes me wonder if that was already a sign.

At our company Christmas party last week , things escalated. First part of the night he wasn’t really talking to me (but we did have a call of 3 hours during the day) and was being a bit weird. One of my friend/colleague went and talked to him to ask him what he was doing and that he should offer me a drink and talk to him. I think she pressured him a bit too much but in the end, he came to talk to me, was holding my hand, we danced in a group setting. At some point we went outside and he asked me if I wanted to leave the party to go get some food, which I agreed. Went to get some food and during the conversation, he told me he was going to get the 3AM bus to go home, I just told him “don’t you want to come home to mine??”, he agreed. We went outside, he gave me hugs to keep me warm and I hold his hands. We saw some of our colleagues and I tried to remove my hand and he said “no we don’t care”.

We eventually got back to my place, we had sex once we were home and a second time in the morning. He ended up staying all day at my place and left around 5PM. We talked a lot, laughed and just had a good time. When he left, he didn’t know what to do and I just said “don’t you want to kiss me?” He did kiss me and said “not too long because you’re going to make me stay”.

After that, his behavior changed drastically. He became distant, slow to reply, and stopped initiating conversations. I eventually sent him a message on Instagram saying that I really enjoyed what we shared and that I just wanted to know if we were on the same page. I explicitly said that if he didn’t want anything more, it was okay and it won’t be weird or anything. I just didn’t want to be stuck in uncertainty.

He replied saying he really enjoyed all the time we spent together but didn’t really expected it to happen, hoped things wouldn’t be awkward now, and that with work he feels weird about it. He made a joke that was not funny about a lot of resentment which he said he was sorry for and said again that he really enjoyed all our moments together and that he hopes that it is not awkward now. I never replied to his last message. But he didn’t express wanting to continue anything, and since then, communication has completely stopped. (Bear in mind I have been talking to that guy every day on teams for the last 3 months).

I’m not trying to assign blame or decide who was right or wrong. I’m mostly trying to understand what this kind of dynamic usually means. From an outside perspective, does this sound like someone who enjoyed the closeness but didn’t want to pursue anything further, or more like two people who were simply on different timelines or expectations? Based on this, would it make sense to just accept it for what it was and move on, or is this the kind of situation where things sometimes naturally reset or reconnect later?

What hurts the most is that this wasn’t just one night, it was months of daily connection, routines, thoughtful gestures, and emotional closeness. The sudden distance feels really confusing and painful.

And yet, for whatever reason : hesitation, overthinking, logistics — you let the moment pass.

This guide will help you navigate that moment with clarity.

Airports, especially domestic terminals of major cities, are excellent environments to meet women.

Even international terminals offer opportunities, though long-haul fatigue can sometimes make travelers less receptive. 

After nine years of coaching men in-person across India and now internationally, I’ve spent more time inside airports than most people ever will. Everything below comes directly from those real-life experiences.

# 1. General Principles You Must Understand

**1.1 Timing Matters**

Women prefer flying between morning and late afternoon — it’s simply when they feel freshest and most comfortable. If you want to maximize flow and quality, be inside the airport during these hours.

**1.2 Time in Hand Matters**

Arriving just one hour before departure won’t work.

Domestic: Arrive 3 hours before departure.

International: Arrive 4–5 hours before departure.

You need a large enough window for natural opportunities to unfold.

**1.3 Terminals Matter**

Not all terminals are equal. Some have constant movement; some are dead zones.

Pick airlines that give you high-traffic terminals.

Examples:

**Dubai** → Emirates at T3

**Bangkok** → Thai Airways at Suvarnabhumi

**India** → Air India at T3 Delhi, T2 Mumbai, BLR Kempegowda

Your terminal selection determines your chance window.

# 2. Where the Real Opportunities Begin

The actual “***airport game***” starts after security (and immigration for international):

This is where people slow down.

This is where they browse, sit, wait, and naturally observe.

This is where you can walk, pause, and let interactions unfold without appearing deliberate.

Your goal here is simple:

\- Look well-put-together

\- Move unhurried

\- Blend with the flow

\- Stay in environments where quality and volume intersect

# 3. Scoping the Venue (The Most Important Skill)

Before approaching anyone, you must understand the environment.

Walk through the terminal slowly. Observe:

Where people stop

Where solo women linger

Which cafés attract longer stays

Which gates have the most departures in the next 60–90 minutes

Which spots allow you to sit without looking idle or intention-driven

Your aim is to find a natural vantage point that suits your requirements.

**Example 1** — Mumbai T2 (Domestic)

The Starbucks at T2 has a constant inflow of passengers grabbing coffee or sitting down briefly. It gives you steady peripheral movement and a clean vantage point. You don’t look out of place sitting here for 45 minutes to an hour.

**Example 2** — Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok), Concourse E

Right after security, near The Coffee Club, there’s a natural funnel where people slow down.

It attracts:

Solo women

International travellers

Cabin crew

Great flow. High quality. Natural observation angles.

You look like you’re simply waiting, not plotting.

# 4. The Three Primary Ways to Approach Women at Airports

Approaching strolling women

Approaching women seated at cafés/restaurants

I function normally, I haven’t neglected myself, I train regularly, I take care of my obligations, etc. Those depressive moments are rare — sometimes I remember something and then I miss her and that kind of stuff. I’ve simply accepted the situation and life goes on.

What hurt me is that last night I found out that I was *probably* right again (I still don’t know for sure). And this keeps happening over and over — I’m honestly sick of always being right.

Throughout our entire relationship there was this one guy who’s been her best friend since college. They’ve known each other for about 7–8 years, they get along well, and I didn’t really have a problem with that because he was there before me, and I’m not the type to forbid anything. I genuinely believe that you can’t forbid anyone anything in a relationship — your choices and actions are simply a reflection of who you are.

I never had an issue with them going for coffee, talking, taking a walk, and then going home. But at one point she went with him on a little “adventure” to another city — restaurant, ice cream, blah blah — and basically spent the whole day with him.

That’s when I clearly set boundaries for the first time regarding that guy. I calmly explained what bothered me and why that kind of behavior wasn’t really appropriate. She politely agreed and everything was fine.

Three months before the breakup, she suddenly started saying how this relationship no longer suits her, how she doesn’t see a future, and how she wants to be selfish now. We were in that phase of “let’s try to fix things,” etc. During that period she says she wants to go to a party with him and his brother. That brother had always been kind of in the background, like a shadow — not much attention was paid to him before.

That’s when, for the first time ever, I said no. I told her she can’t go to parties in another city with other men and hang out there for two nights.

That led to a few days of tension — why she can’t go, what the problem is, blah blah — and in the end I gave in and said:

“Listen, regarding that, we don’t have a problem. Everything’s cool, go ahead. The insecurity that came up in me is my problem and I need to deal with it myself. You shouldn’t suffer because of it or let it ruin your friendship.”

I should mention that throughout the entire relationship she never really put me in situations where I felt insecure or suspicious, which is why I was so lenient about these things.

But my intuition was telling me that something wasn’t right with those two guys, and that if either of them ever got the chance to fuck her, they would — lol.

Three weeks before the breakup, she was in a phase of deciding whether to stay in the relationship or end it, while I was in the mindset of trying to fix things. And last night her brother — whether he slipped up or just made a sick joke — said how she’s in regular contact and texting with that other guy.

Even if it was a joke, it was incredibly tasteless.

Up until that moment, I was still keeping her photo in my wallet. It was the only thing of hers I kept — and now I got rid of that too.

I won’t lie, it hurt. But I can’t shake the thought and feeling — like, during those three weeks, were you analyzing where it’s better, him or me, or who the fuck knows what? And the fact that maybe my intuition was right again, that I wasn’t just overthinking or imagining things.

I’m stuck between looking weak and telling them to go fuck themselves, or just letting it go and being a giga chad.",1,1766519462.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

[Episode I](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pu394r/i_found_an_old_star_wars_box_set_1_of_3/) \- [Episode II](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pu3amg/we_found_a_weird_star_wars_mod_2_of_3/) \- [Episode III](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pu3c71/my_friends_and_i_found_a_late_night_star_wars/)

Star Wars Day is my ***life!*** You know, if you were to describe the joy, the cheer, the excitement of Christmas Day without mentioning Christmas? In my mind I would probably just assume you were talking about May the 4th. That was ***my*** day. Me and my group of buddies, we would take the entire day off every year to celebrate it.

We had been doing this since high school, and I’m pretty sure both our teachers back then, and our employers now, may have picked up on the fact that our lame ass sick day excuses (which just so happened to fall on the exact same day every year) may not be entirely genuine. But, credit to them, they always let it slide.

This year’s May 4th, was going to be epic. Most years we would have these casual get togethers, we would put on some food, put some beers on ice, and just watch the movies. But this year, we were going to do something a bit more, hands on. You see our friend Kyle, and his girlfriend, Heather, they were avid gamers. They had this amazing setup in their basement.

There were 3 lines of desks set up in perfect unison. At each desk, back to back fully decked out MSI gaming rigs. 12 of them in total.

Why did they need so many for themselves, you ask? Well, they didn’t really. Being passionate gamers, they would often host these social gaming nights for pretty much whoever wanted to come. It was quite a cool incentive for the town and Heather even scored some airtime on the local news to talk about the events they’d put on. We lived in a small town, so they always had enough rigs to cater for the 10 or so people who wanted to come and game.

And if they ever had more, they had random consoles and other handheld gaming systems around the place for people to keep themselves occupied while they waited for a PC to free up. It really was an amazing setup. And this year, for our May the 4th celebrations, we intended to make full use of it.

We had planned to play Battlefront II online literally all day. Complete with coolers full of mountain dew and beer, and the most gut rotting snacks you could imagine, this was set to be a lan party for the ages.

Yeah yeah I hear the groans, I know Battlefront II is not exactly beloved in the Star Wars community, but we just wanted a modern Star Wars game to play together. We thought about booting up The Old Republic, but we had some problems messing around with EA Accounts not playing nice with Steam and, it was just a headache we didn’t want. When you get ONE day off from work to celebrate your favourite day with your friends, you want something that’s just gonna work, you know? So that’s what we settled on. Until I got a call from Heather at around 8pm on May 3rd.

I picked up the phone, and greeted my friend, excited to talk about our plans for the next day.

*“Hey! What’s up?”* I said.

*“Dude… I found something cool.”* Heather replied. *“Let me ask you, do you* ***really*** *want to spend your entire day tomorrow playing Battlefront?! That game’s a shit show at best.”*

*“Ha, yeah I know. But I mean, it was the best pick of a bad bunch. We all decided, right?”*

*“Yeah, we did. But check this out. I found a Fallout mod!”*

*“Um… I mean I guess the setting can be…. Maybe, similar? But, I dunno about playing Fallout on Star Wars Day. Doesn’t really fit, ya know?”*

*“No! Dude… I found a Star Wars mod for Fallout 4!”*

*“Ohhh, Galaxy at War. Yeah I know that one. But it’d still be kinda weird, Fallout 4 doesn’t have any online mode. We’d all just be doing our own thing, would be a bit of a buzzkill wouldn’t it?”*

*“Mate, shut up and listen for a second! I’m looking at the mod right here in front of my eyes. F4- SW-ONLINE it’s called. I had to contact the uploader to clarify but, if this works, this game will essentially turn Fallout 4 into a modern day Star Wars MMO!”*

*“Seriously?! How cool would that be! Do you think you can get it to work?!”*

*“I can sure try! I’m gonna download the mod now and get it all set up for tomorrow! I’ll let you know in the morning if it worked, when you guys get here, otherwise we can always go back to Plan A.”*

*“Sounds great! See you tomorrow!”*

And with that, the call ended. I spent a couple more hours scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, you know, as you for some unknown reason feel the need to do before sleeping. Eventually, noticing the clock tick nearer to midnight, I put my phone onto the charger and going to sleep, excited to wake up and start our Star Wars Day celebration.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My alarm went off at 7am sharp, and I sprung out of bed ready for a day of gaming! As I pulled on my favourite Empire Strikes Back T- Shirt, I was reminded of the phone call with Heather last night, and this mystery Fallout mod she described. I wondered how she’d found it. I had searched plenty of mod sites for Star Wars themed mods, but the only functional ones I’d come across were simple lightsaber mods, and of course Galaxy at War. But that was nothing like what Heather had described. Anyway, hopefully she managed to get it working. It sounded amazing!

The walk to Heather and Kyle’s place was a short one, we lived a couple of blocks away from eachother, a quiet walk through a quiet part of town with not much going on. Your typical urban sprawl, a little convenience store and coffee shop sat halfway between our houses, which made for a nice meetup spot. I stopped in and grabbed my usual, chai latte, no sugar. And I continued on down to Kyle’s place.

Upon arriving, Kyle and the guys had already gathered for our busy day of gaming ahead. Ha, life responsibilities for the geeks and nerdy. Eh, we weren’t bothered.

Star Wars was our passion. You don’t hear us judging people who choose to sit in front of the TV all day and watch football. And plenty of folks do that every weekend! We only do this once a year, and we were gonna make the most of it. As I sipped my chai latte like a pretentious dick, I noticed Heather wasn’t around. I was keen to ask her about the mod, so I called out to Kyle, who was busy on the other side of the room getting the food and drinks prepped for the day. I asked him, *“Hey, where’s Heather? She not joining us today?”*

*“Oh! Nah dude,”* he replied. *“She left this note on her laptop for me.”* Well, that was very Heather style. Being the techie girl, handwritten notes be damned. On the laptop sat a simple word document which read…

*“Morning! I’ve been called into the office, sorry guys! But hey! I got that mod working! It’s up and running on all the rigs! I’ve set up temporary Steam accounts for all of you. Just load up the game and you should be good to go! Have fun!”*

It’s in these moments I need to check myself. There had always been an unspoken, yet very much acknowledged by the both of us, pang of envy that Kyle had been the one to end up with Heather. We had both had a huge crush on her since, well the first day we met her in primary school. She was, and still is, beautiful, in the true sense of that word. But, as fate would have it, she only ever had eyes for him. Their bond was undeniable. If there had ever been any doubt about that, perhaps I may have tried a little harder. But it was obvious to everyone, these two were among the rare specimens of our world who through some stroke of universal blessing, managed to be born in the same time, place and move in the same circles as their soulmate. All told, I was truly happy for them, and happy that we were all still friends regardless of messy feelings.

As always, I brushed these thoughts aside, and focussed on what mattered. Star Wars day! Finally, it was *our* day. I made my way over to one of the rigs, testing the chair to make sure that I wouldn’t get landed with the infamous “squeaky one”. As I sunk into my “battle station” for the day, I smiled to myself as I listened to the beautiful sound of Kyle pouring ice over our supply of beers and Mountain Dew. This was going to be a good day.

The guys joined me one by one, Brad took a seat next to me, the chair squeaking like a banshee as he lowered himself down onto it. He gave me a knowing, slightly resentful look as he did so. He knew. Oh he knew. Oh well, early bird gets the… good chair. We all settled in, and booted up our rigs. The ambience of beer caps cracking and potato chips crunching, accompanying the nostalgic sound of the Windows startup screen. I loaded up Steam, as did my friends, and we launched Fallout 4. Upon launching the game, I was met with a pop up. 

“You are about to start Fallout 4 with the mod ‘F4-SW-ONLINE” active. This mod will significantly change your gameplay experience, and you may becoming unbalanced. Proceed? Yes/No”

What the hell… What a weird introduction. The signatures at the bottom appeared to be some kind of Eastern European, so I guessed the developers were non-English speakers. “Unbalanced”, meaning, the game could become unstable? I guess? I looked around the room, noticing my friends looking as confused as I was. *“Click yes then?”* Asked Kyle. And I shrugged, nodding my head *“Guess so!*

*What’s the worst that could happen?”*

We all clicked “Yes” to proceed, and we were booted into full screen mode, as Fallout 4 loaded up.

Instead of the typical menu screen however, we were met with an apocalyptic style depiction of Coruscant, the Jedi temple and the senate building in ruins, as dark clouds hung overhead. The music was, weird. It wasn’t the Fallout music, but it wasn’t Star Wars either, it was a kind generic mishmash of both, but slower. Kind of gloomy. There wasn’t much to do in the menu. There were only 3 selections. Start, Options or Load Game. Options didn’t really present any choices other than mapping your controls, which remained largely the same as the original Fallout 4. Aside from some extra, additional options. Tapping the “F” key for example, would supposedly activate “Force Push”.

I navigated back to the main menu, and selected “Start Game”, having no other real option. I had nothing to load up, afterall. Upon clicking start, the menu faded away to black. After a quick few seconds, some familiar blue text faded in. *“Many years ago, in a universe far away…”* Um… okay. Near enough I guess. And then, it faded back out again, before seconds later, the Star Wars logo exploded onto the display.

Wow, they really nailed the feel of the classic Star Wars intro! The logo was picture perfect, as it zoomed up into the black expanse of space. The text continued to scroll…

*“It is a dark time for the Galaxy. Two years after Civil War broke out, the Evil Count Dooku, desperate for victory at any cost, has unleashed the ultimate weapon of destruction upon Coruscant and many surrounding systems. Outlying planets have devolved into chaos as the threat of complete and total annihilation looms heavy over the Galaxy.*

*A small team of surviving Jedi have fled to the most isolated corners of the Capital in an attempt to regroup and overthrow the Separatist forces who now control the Galaxy…”*

Cool setup, I thought. I really liked the way they had incorporated the nuclear apocalypse theme into the canon Star Wars timeline. So, if I was understanding this correctly, this would be some kind of alternative universe setting that takes place between Attack of The Clones and Revenge of The Sith.

Upon completion of the opening scrawl, the camera panned down, just like it did in the films, and focussed on what looked like the ruins of an ancient temple. The scene cut to what appeared to be two young Jedi warriors, a boy and a girl, standing in front of a floor to ceiling mirror. Behind them, stands Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Okay, cool, so this is basically the Fallout 4 character creation screen. I selected the male character, and I began my customisation. Nothing crazy, I don’t get too deep with these. As long as the hair colour’s the same and the face looks kinda similar to my own, I’m pretty happy. I changed the hair to mid length black, and sprinkled a couple of freckles across the face, and that was me done. The rest of the guys spent a little longer on their’s, but I was keen to get out and explore the world.

When we were all done creating our characters, the screen suddenly glitched to black, before cutting back in. We were now all in this ruined temple together, standing before Obi-Wan. Looks like the mod was actually the real deal. It was a little glitchy, sure, but for all intents and purposes it did exactly what it said on the box. Fallout 4 had effectively become an open world, online multiplayer Star Wars game.

The game for the most part played out as you would expect. Rather that starting the game before the bombs go off, you begin in a world that is already ruined. As we all stood before Obi-Wan, we noticed he was talking. I guessed it must have been a little difficult to do cut scenes in this mod, given the online element.

Master Kenobi gave a quick speech. We are the only survivors, we must gather our forces etc. etc.

The end of the speech was a little strange though. After the main speech was finished, he would only repeat one line. 

*“Whatever you do, it’s already too late…”*

It was very out of character for him, he was always the guy full of optimism and hope in the films. But I guess a nuclear weapon wiping out half the galaxy probably changes one’s outlook a bit.

From here, things unfolded in a very “Fallout” kind of way. But with subtle changes. Instead of going to Concord to find friends and rescue the surviving Minutemen, you were sent by Obi-Wan to the Great

Western Sea to gather a platoon of Clones who had sent word they were pinned down. Upon getting them back to the temple safely, you were then ordered by their Captain (I guess this guy replaced Preston Garvey), to head out to Barsa Town and assist someone named “Whisper”, who turned out to be a Sith. He gave me a bit of a fright actually the first time I met him, spinning around to reveal his yellow eyes. But, as it turned out, the Sith are actually your allies in this game, even when they return to the temple, Obi-Wan and the other Jedi never attack them. I guess it makes sense canonically, even in The Clone Wars, Darth Maul didn’t want Palpatine in power any more than the Jedi did.

We continued on through the game, completing static quests here and there. It was all very simple, many of the Fallout quest lines were simply re-scripted and re-skinned, but they all took place in this very Star Wars-esque environment, interchanged with Star Wars set pieces and characters. They even had the odd starship flying overhead. It was a very immersive experience, and I was throughly enjoying myself. You went through the game as an individual but with your fellow players by your side. The only thing was, this removed the option of various dialogue choices, since it would be too difficult for 5 or 6 people to choose different dialogue and still have the game operate as normal. There was also no actual cutscenes during dialogue, so the main character’s voice would just kind of echo in from the void.

The game started getting strange, when it came time for us to leave Coruscant. I guessed that this part of the game was essentially when Preston informs you that it’s time to take back the castle. We all followed a waypoint to a dark corner of the temple, where the Clone Captain was waiting for us.

He told us it was time we sifted our forces to a stronger hold, off planet.

Somewhere less likely to draw attention. We were instructed to build a Star Ship capable of lightspeed travel, and a new subsection was added to the temple’s workshop. This was actually quite fun, but the issue came when too many people were trying to build at once, it got messy, so we have to opt for just one of us to do the job. I scored the privilege, and I got to work building our ship.

It was much like the Vault building DLC, huge pieces to click together in order to create a massive space ship. You had various hulls, wings, cockpits, bridges etc. Upon completion, you would snap it onto a generator in order to “refuel” the ship.

Sadly, as I expected, space travel was not an addition to the mod.

You just approached the ship and pressed “E” to activate it, and then selected a fast travel destination. A few expanded destinations were added to the map upon selecting the ship, one of them being off planet. It wasn’t a system name that I recognised, and I’ve read all of the expanded Universe. The system was called “Ruad”. Which I, of course, recognised historically, in real world terms. But it had definitely never been a part of the Star Wars universe. Anyway, I selected it, and off we went.

Upon reaching the Ruad system, this is where things in the game got, really weird. As soon as we spawned in beside the ship, we were met with a landscape that was just, downright wrong. Mist that looked more like red clouds encapsulated the surface of the planet. Shanty like buildings popped up randomly from the earth. Gnarled trees hung from the sky, seemingly hovering, but, their roots extending upwards indefinitely. In a way it kinda of resembled the Dagobah system, with its swampy, foggy setting. But the colours were off. Where Dagobah was gloomy and murky, this planet was more of a colourful setting. Shades of red and yellow, and a purple sky extending over the horizon.

We began to explore this planet. Me, heading west towards the looming cityscape, and each of my friends taking their own path. As we progressed, I occasionally heard them gasp, and I soon saw why, jumping back and gasping myself.

It was, twisted… disfigured. A downright awful creature. I only thought to look around as my character let out a grunt signalling he had lost health, and I looked down to see this thing shuﬄing on its hands and knees off into the grass. *“What the hell was that?!”* One of my friends shouted.

I chased after it, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.

As we progressed through the Ruad system, these things would pop up seemingly at random, crawling out of patches of grass or thick swamps, biting our characters’ legs before scuttling off. It made traversing this planet quite unsettling, as you’d never really see them coming.

I was nearing the city, when I heard my friend Mike shout *“What the HELL?!”* Looking over to him, I noticed his screen was on the Windows desktop. He shouted again *“One of those* ***things*** *just crawled up my back, and the game booted me!”* I scooted my chair over, puzzled. *“That’s weird”* I said. *“Try booting back in?”* Mike double clicked his Steam icon, selecting Fallout 4, before being met with another popup message… *“It’s already too late…”* it read, before booting him back to the desktop again.

He stared flabbergasted at his monitor, as he tried again and again to launch back into the game, only to be met with that same cryptic message again and again. There was quite literally nothing we could do to get his game working again.

We tried signing out of Steam and signing back in with his own Steam account. Same message. He even did a soft reset of Windows, same message. Shy of doing a full hard reset of the entire OS, which would have defeated the purpose as that would uninstall the mod, we tried everything. Eventually he gave up and just booted up battlefront 2, while the rest of us continued to play.

I continued on toward the city, reaching the outskirts now.

Whatever happened here hadn’t been pretty. Dismembered body parts lay strewn about amongst the rubble. As I walked, one by one, more of my friends met the same fate as Mike. All of them described the same thing happening, the twisted critters crawling up their backs, before the game abruptly booted them out, and they were unable to get back in. Simply being met with that same message, the one Obi-Wan had recited at the beginning… *“It’s already too late…”*

I guess I had made the right choice opting to head for the city. I hadn’t encountered the things since I made it through the swamplands.

Before much longer, I was the only one left in the game. As I made it to what seemed to be the city centre of this gnarled looking shanty town, my friends were now all locked out, opting instead to play Battlefront 2 together. Honestly, that was beginning to sounds preferable.

I stumbled through this ramshackle city, looking for any clue of what to do next. Spotting a figure up ahead, I held down the sprint key and ran towards it. It was Master Windu. He was standing at the entrance to one of the buildings, but… he was standing very… still. As I drew nearer, I realised that he was indeed ***very*** still. Frozen in place, in fact.

His face was morphed into a scowl, his eyes looking eerily off to one side, as though he had seen something coming. He was basically a statue in the game. No movement. Not even when you hit him or force pushed him. The worst thing was I couldn’t even get around him, so if there was anything to find in this building, which it looked like there was, I couldn’t get in there to see it.

Okay, so I decided to turn and head North, up this narrow alleyway towards what looked like the main building in town. It was massive, and looked a little more in tact than the rest. I thought maybe I might find some answers there. As I walked, I noticed scuttling figures again. Kind of like the same ones from the swamp, but these ones, standing upright, darting between the windows of the wrecked buildings. It was actually super unsettling in first person mode, so I switched the view to third person.

As I approached the metal monstrosity, I caught sight of yet another figure. This time, a shorter one. Very short. It was Master Yoda. Again, as I progressed toward him, I noticed him frozen in place, the same as Master Windu was. Again, no matter what I did, he couldn’t be moved. He was just immortalised there in time and space. His face was also frozen in an eerie expression, his mouth curled upwards and his eyes squinting, looking off to one side.

No matter which way I walked, I would encounter more characters frozen in place, blocking the entrance to any building I could hope to enter. The only way to go, besides walking all over the planet looking for something to do (not really possible due to the existence of those strange crawling things that crashed the game), was to go back to the ship. So I did. And there stood Obi-Wan Kenobi. His hands behind his back, gently swaying back and forth in front on the ship. I could not longer activate the ship either. The only thing I could do was press “E” to talk to Obi-Wan, who would only say, *“Whatever you do, it’s already too late…”*

Well the ship was out. I wasn’t going back to the city, there was nothing there. I wasn’t traversing the long grass, as I didn’t want the game to crash. The only other way to go was through the giant swamp. I had no idea what was in there. I knew the “creatures” were in the grass, and in the buildings, but I wasn’t sure if they were hiding in the swamp. So in I jumped.

Swimming through the murky ick, the game’s audio got… strange. I heard these whiny groans coming in through my speakers, and I began to wonder if these were the cries of those twisted humanoid things that had been attacking us. I wondered if they were surrounding my character. I know it’s just a game, but the feeling of being out there in those dark waters, potentially being hunted by these things that could end me in such a permanent way as to not only kill my character but, my game as well… it was truly frightening. But I made it through unscathed.

At the shoreline, I came out into what I can only describe as absolute nothing. I mean, when I crawled out of the swamp, I was standing in the same mystical, dark surroundings as the rest of the Ruad system, but when I took a few steps forward, everything just morphed into emptiness, flickering between absolute whiteness and blackness. I took a few steps back, and found myself back in the starry, swirling lights of the upside down forests. Then, a few steps forward, and bam, back into the void.

I realised at this point, that I was experiencing the effects of a mod unfinished. This must have been as far as they ever got with the development. I felt a pang of disappointment. Despite the weirdness, I was actually quite enjoying it. So, I walked around.

What else could I do? I just… walked. Trudging through thick grass, swamps and random structures until I was inevitably found by one of those burned looking things, climbing its way up my back, and opening its mouth behind my neck… before my game glitched into black and I was booted to Windows. I don’t know why I tried it, but I did. I tried clicking open the game again. But of course, was met with that same message. *“It’s already too late…”*

I looked around at my friends. Kyle spoke up, *“They got you too aye?”* I gave him a disappointed look… *“yeah”* I replied. *“Guess that’s it for Star Wars Day”* I said, glancing at my watch. 5pm. It was about time for us to wind down and start heading back home. Tomorrow we would have no such luxuries so as to sit around gaming. Tomorrow, it was back to the grind. And it was the thought of the grind that first gave me pause.

*“Hey Kyle, what time’s Heather meant to get home?* I asked.

*“Uh… actually. Should have been around 3 or 4…”* He replied, curiously.

In fact, we both found it odd that we hadn’t even heard from her all day. No messages, no calls.

Nothing but that note on her laptop. We decided to wait and see if perhaps she was running late. We cracked another couple of beers and played another couple of rounds on Battlefront 2. It wasn’t until another hour passed, and there was still no word from Heather, that Kyle tried calling her.

And it was only when her phone went directly to voicemail, that we became concerned.

After calling her office and being told that, no, she wasn’t there, we entered full on panic mode. Kyle was in a right state, understandably so. And as he got on the phone to the Police, I decided to take one more look at the last real indication we had, as to where Heather might be. Her laptop.

I walked over to the kitchen bench, where it still sat plugged in, and I slowly opened it up to read the note she had left. Nothing out of the ordinary there.

*“3 days?! Are you serious?!”* I overheard Kyle say on the phone. The Police, I’m guessing, informing him as to the expected time frames for missing persons reports. It was as I minimised the word document containing the note, that I gestured to him to wait. To not hang up the phone.

We had all been so excited for Star Wars Day. That we never stopped to question any of it. We had not stopped to think, why Heather would have possibly been called into the office, when she had been working remotely from home for the last 8 months. No one had even questioned where she had found the mod in the first place. But as we now gazed upon the TOR Browser open on her laptop, and the glitchy red and green 90s style website, displaying nothing but a simple file download button, and right underneath it, a ping to her location. It all fell into place…

I had thought the language was off. The permissions, an Eastern European look about them.

Trafficking’s big business in that part of the world. A beautiful girl like Heather… that was high demand. But how do you transport a person out of the country, from right under their closest friends’ noses? Kyle realised before I did, probably around the time the phone lines were cut. The mod did not exist for fun. It didn’t exist as some kind of random bait. This was done with purpose and intent. This was orchestrated by a very smart individual, who knew our lives, who knew our interests, and specifically wanted ***her***. How do you kidnap someone without any of those closest to them noticing? Well, keeping them distracted for an entire day, would certainly go a long way to that goal.

Kyle cracked one of the blinds, and as we caught sight of the black vans parked strategically around our neighbourhood, we knew what this was. We knew we were never leaving that house.

I sat back down. Cracked a cold beer, and booted up Battlefront II with my friends.

Star Wars day… was my LIFE! And I was going to enjoy [what remained of it...](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1pp85ru/my_stories/)",1,1766519450.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

James first noticed her on a Wednesday afternoon, when the light through the high windows of the café was slanted and golden, dust motes drifting in the beams like tiny dancers. He’d arrived early that day, hoping to claim the small corner table by the window for his music theory workbook and a large black coffee. The café was a comfortable jumble of mismatched chairs and tables, a gentle hum of conversation punctuated by the hiss of the espresso machine. As he stood in line, waiting for his drink, he saw her at the counter. 

Dark hair fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, catching the light in chestnut highlights. A pencil was tucked behind one ear, and she wore a moss-green trench coat that seemed improbably elegant for this corner of town—a coat that looked as if it were designed by a meticulous tailor, every seam purposeful, every fold intentional. He wondered what business someone so sharply dressed had in a bohemian coffee shop where most patrons wore paint-splattered jeans and flannel shirts.

She turned, perhaps in response to the barista’s question, and their eyes met. Her smile was crisp and immediate, as though she’d been ready to greet him all along. It was the sort of smile that could have been rehearsed—perfectly timed, flawlessly executed—but it also carried a soft warmth at the edges, like the flicker of a candle in a draft. He caught himself staring and looked away, heart suddenly pounding, but not before he noted the slow, deliberate way she stirred her latte, as if she were counting the rotations of the spoon, the way each swirl added a fraction of sweetness to the bitter coffee.

Carrying his own drink back to the table, he set his heavy textbook down and tried to open it to the study on Schenkerian analysis. The densely packed notation and commentary felt hostile, the tiny symbols arranged in a code that he struggled to decipher. Across the room, out of the corners of his eyes, he could still see her. She’d chosen a small round table by the pastry display, stood there for a moment, one foot slightly in front of the other, favoring her right leg as if it bore a secret weight. She peered at the croissants and danishes with an appraising gaze, but didn’t purchase anything—just sipped her coffee, black, no sugar, eyes moving over the glass case with a quiet intensity.

Once seated, she placed her phone, wallet, and green notebook on the tabletop, aligning them in a perfect row, as though about to perform delicate surgery. She opened the notebook and began to write, flipping pages with swift precision, a motion so brisk it reminded him of a librarian shelving books by the minute. He tried to concentrate on his personal studies, scanning over phrases like “tonal prolongation” and “voice-leading reductions,” but her presence at the far end of the café short-circuited his focus. The scratch of her pencil on paper, the almost inaudible rhythm of her writing, was more mesmerizing than any melody he’d ever studied.

When he came back on Thursday, at precisely the same time, he told himself she wouldn’t notice him. He parked at the same table, opened the same chapter, and settled into the same spiral of frustration and caffeine. But his resolve crumbled in moments when his eyes drifted across the room. She was there again, same trench coat, same posture, same methodical preparation of her workspace. He counted the number of pages she turned: fourteen. 

He noted the tilt of her head as she worked: six degrees off vertical. 

He observed the way she took a sip of coffee when she reached the conclusion of a page, pausing for perhaps three seconds before returning to her notes. He felt almost absurd, as though he were stalking her through algorithms and measurements.

On Friday he almost didn’t come. He told himself it was ridiculous to study at the same café every day, that the routine was too predictable, that she might feel spied upon. But by noon he found himself pushing open the door, inhaling the familiar scent of roasted beans, and making a beeline for his table. As he settled in, his hands trembled just slightly as he opened his book, and for a moment he considered closing it and simply leaving. But then he noticed her beyond the counter, the slight crease in her brow as she jotted notes at top speed, and he was anchored.

It was the third afternoon in a week that he’d seen her there when she rose from her chair and began walking toward him. His heart seized in his chest because he was certain she had not, until that moment, deigned to look at him directly. She carried her latte in one hand, her notebook in the other, her composure immaculate. She paused at his table without hesitation, as if she belonged there, as if she’d been plotting this encounter since Monday. Her eyes flicked to the empty chair across from him and then to his face, wholly unblinking.

“Mind if I sit?” she asked, gesturing at the chair. Her voice was calm, unhurried, but there was a sparkle of amusement in her tone, as if she already knew the answer.

He glanced down at his unremarkable shirt, the slight coffee ring he’d just uncovered on the tabletop, the stubby pencil in his backpack, and felt a rush of self-consciousness. 

“Go ahead,” he said, his voice softer than he intended.

She slid into the chair and set her notebooks in place once more. Up close, her eyes were the exact shade of her coat—deep moss-green flecked with warm brown. Her beauty was striking in a classical way: a Roman nose, high cheekbones that cast delicate shadows, lips that seemed sculpted to rest in a thoughtful line when she wasn’t smiling. Yet there was a restless energy about her, a barely contained fervor that made her seem less like a film star from the silent era and more like someone on the brink of revelation.

“I’m Mary,” she said, extending a hand across the table. Her nails were short, practical, but her fingers were long and tapered, surprisingly elegant.

He stood and shook her hand, caught off guard by its firm grip. “James,” he replied. “Nice to meet you.”

She held his hand for a moment longer than necessary, then released it and placed her notebook between them. She leaned forward, elbows lightly resting on the edge of the table. “I’ve seen you here a few times.”

He tried to appear nonchalant, but he could feel his face warming. “Yeah, I come here to study on my own time.” He tucked a stray lock of hair behind his ear. “But honestly, I don’t remember seeing you before.”

Her smile widened, a quick curve of her lips that suggested she found his discomfort amusing. “I would have remembered you,” she said simply. Then she flipped open her notebook and began to read, eyes scanning the page.

Embarrassment washed over him, and he tried to look back at his book, but the text was now a blur. The scratch of her pencil as she annotated her page was oddly hypnotic. She paused occasionally to chew the end of her eraser, her brow furrowing in concentration. At last, she snapped the notebook shut and looked up with an intensity that startled him.

“Do you always read music theory in public?” she asked.

James blinked. “How did you—?”

She tapped the spine of his open textbook, which he’d subconsciously tried to hide with his hand. “You were air-conducting measures eight through twelve,” she said, “and humming very softly under your breath.”

He laughed, a short, startled sound. “I didn’t even realize.”

She leaned back, crossing one leg over the other gracefully. 

“It’s endearing,” she said. Her tone was gentle, teasing, and he felt a rush of relief and pleasure. “Makes you look absorbed.”

He rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry. I guess I got carried away.”

“That’s fine,” she said. “Tell me something about yourself, James.”

He hesitated, surprised by the directness of her question. “Like… what?”

Her head tilted to one side, as if appraising him from every possible angle. “Anything. Where are you from? Why music theory? What’s your least favorite chord progression?”

He snorted, running a hand through his hair. “Least favorite chord progression? That’s a new one. Let’s see… I’d say a plagal cadence in the middle of a sonata. It feels like a stuck elevator. I just study music for myself, during free time. It’s relaxing. It’s not that serious.”

She laughed, smooth and clear. “A stuck elevator,” she repeated, jotting down the phrase in her notebook. She paused, looking up at him, her eyes alight. “Tell me more.”

So he did. He told her about growing up in a small Midwestern town where the only music beyond church choir was the radio. He spoke of his first encounter with Bach in the public library’s dusty record section. He described his fascination with patterns in sound, harmonic overtones, and the secret logic of tonal relationships. As he talked, she sketched little diagrams in the margin of her notebook—arrows, circles, a tiny cartoon face each time he made a joke. He found himself talking faster, exhaling tension he hadn’t known he carried. When he finally paused, breathless, Mary looked at him as though she were tasting his words, weighing them.

“That’s fascinating,” she said. “You should be teaching this.”

He waved a hand. “I’m not that good.”

“Humility,” she nodded approvingly, then tapped her pencil twice against the tabletop. “But what about your actual background? Family? Siblings?”

He cleared his throat. “I’m an only child,” he said. “Parents still live back home. I haven’t been to see them in a while.”

“Why’s that?” She sounded genuinely curious.

“Busy,” he shrugged, though it felt inadequate. “I just finished school, work… I guess I’m avoiding the road trip.”

She wrote down ‘Aversion to road trips’ in her notebook and looked at him with a smile. “I see.”

They talked for another half hour—about favorite composers, worst practice sessions, the kind of music that makes your teeth ache when it’s too loud. When his phone buzzed with a reminder for his part-time job shift, he realized they’d been talking for nearly an hour. She glanced at her watch and closed her notebook with a decisive snap.

“Well,” she said, standing, “I’ll see you around.”

He managed a nod, too dazzled to find his voice. She gathered her things and walked away, leaving him with his open textbook, which suddenly looked like a door to a world he no longer found intimidating.

The next day, he arrived at the café well before noon, desperate to reserve the table where they’d spoken. He saw her already there, her thermos of homemade chai steaming beside her notebook. She looked up, caught his eye, and held out a small cup toward him. “Chai?” she asked.

He blinked. “You made this?”

“Early morning project,” she said with a smile, as though making chai were as routine as tying her shoes. “Thought you might like a change from coffee.”

He accepted the cup, inhaling the spicy aroma of cardamom and cinnamon. “I do,” he said, sipping carefully. “It’s perfect.”

She watched him for a moment, then turned back to her notebook. He settled into his chair, opened his book, and was halfway through a Roman numeral analysis when she leaned over and whispered, “Try this instead.” 

She tapped his page where he’d misidentified a dominant preparation. She didn’t scold; she simply guided his pencil to the correct spot, drawing a small star above the chord. Her fingertips brushed his hand in the process, and heat bloomed on his skin.

They met in the same way the next day, and the next. Each time, she asked questions—sometimes about music, sometimes about his life outside the café—and transcribed his answers. He began to look forward to her arrival more than the music theory itself. She had an uncanny sense of his schedule—knowing exactly when he needed a sugar boost or a distraction. She’d produce a flaky almond croissant or a dark chocolate square right at the moment he was about to sigh in defeat over his homework.

Yet for all her attentiveness, she herself remained a mystery. When James tried to learn more about her, she skated around details. She said she was from the East Coast but never specified a state. She mentioned “project work” that involved travel and deadlines, but never elaborated. Occasionally, she’d talk about her young son, but only in fleeting references—a photograph she slipped from her wallet, a half-smile when she mentioned his laughter. She described him as though he were both her greatest joy and an enigma, and James found himself aching to know more but hesitant to push.

For weeks, James’s dreams clattered with imagery: Mary walking through endless corridors, Mary peeling off a mask only to reveal another, Mary singing songs in languages he didn’t know. He woke to the memory of her hands on his skin, her voice in his ear, and always that sense of standing on a threshold. He wanted to know her, and sometimes he convinced himself that he already did. But the current of uncertainty, the suspicion of an inner sanctum untouched by his presence, never fully faded.

Then, on a breezy Thursday evening, Mary rang his phone. He’d just settled onto the threadbare couch in his tiny living room, the light of a single lamp casting long shadows against the peeling wallpaper. When he answered, her voice came softly, almost abruptly: 

“I’d like you to meet my family.” 

It landed in his ear as though it were a casual remark—no buildup, no preamble, no sense of occasion. Just those seven words, matter-of-fact and unadorned. He paused, thumb hovering over the end-call button. 

“Meet your family?” he repeated, voice level but surprised. “Is there… some special reason?” 

She laughed quietly, a sound that carried a trace of warmth. 

“Not at all,” she said. “My son’s home from school early, and I think—well, I think you’d get along. He’s really open-minded.” Then, almost as an afterthought: “You can meet my uncle and grandfather, too. They’re a little… eccentric, but you’ll see they’re harmless.”

He felt the weight of the invitation settle over him. He and Mary had been seeing each other for several weeks: dinners at hole-in-the-wall diners, long walks in the park where she’d talk about her childhood in veiled terms, coffee dates that slipped into twilight. But a family meeting felt like a milestone he hadn’t anticipated. Still, he agreed—you don’t refuse an invitation like that—and he heard her relief in the soft exhale on the other end. 

They set the time: 6:30 p.m. Friday.

—

When Friday evening rolled around, he dressed carefully—dark slacks, a button-down shirt, shoes polished just enough to shine under the overhead light. He checked his reflection in the hallway mirror, fidgeted with his collar, then waited by the door. At exactly 6:15, Mary pulled up in her hatchback, the engine humming quietly. She wore a navy windbreaker and her hair was pulled back in a loose bun. She popped the door open with a wide grin. “Hop in,” she said. He slid into the passenger seat. 

The interior was immaculate, as if she’d wiped every surface with disinfectant moments before: the dashboard gleamed, the upholstery looked untouched, and not a single fingerprint marred the center console. She buckled her seat belt and offered him one. 

“Buckle up,” she teased. “It’s only a short drive.”

As Mary steered the car through the city streets, he watched her profile in the side window: the curve of her nose, the way her brow furrowed slightly when she focused on the road, the subtle glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes. She talked about her son discreetly, always referring to him as “the kid.” She described him in broad strokes: curious about history, loves building model airplanes, can’t get enough of jazz records. 

James noticed that she kept changing the things he was into and specific details about him.

She never used his name. He tried to press her, but she said she’d tell him at dinner. Then she dropped another fragment of her past: her mother had died when she was young, and afterward her uncle and grandfather stepped in. 

“They raised me,” she said, voice a shade colder. “In their own way.”

He listened, leaning back in his seat, eyes flicking to the passing storefronts. He realized she spoke of that time almost clinically—no emotions attached, just facts arranged like set pieces. As she piloted them out of the downtown grid and onto quieter suburban avenues, the streetlights thinned and the air took on a scent of freshly mown lawns and distant barbecue smoke.

They came to rest in front of a squat, single-story house at the far edge of a cul-de-sac. The neighborhood was still: no voices, no cars, only the faint chirp of crickets. The front lawn had been mowed in impossibly straight lines, each stripe alternating between emerald and lime, as though the grass itself participated in some secret code. A single porch light flickered, casting an amber glow across the painted wooden steps. Mary parked, turned off the ignition, and sat for a moment. She reached over and gave his hand a quick squeeze—hard enough to be felt, brief enough to be cryptic. He swallowed, climbed out, and followed her up the porch steps.

Inside, the first thing that struck him was the sound: deep, rolling laughter, punctuated by occasional whoops, echoing from somewhere down a long hallway. The walls seemed to shimmer with it, as though the house itself were alive. The second thing was the décor. From floor to ceiling, the narrow foyer was plastered with collages of magazine clippings—faces from decades of television and pop culture. There was Lucille Ball doing her trademark double take; there was Rowan and Martin’s gang of Laugh-In comic rebels; there were the beaming visages of late-night hosts, frozen in mid-grin behind mustaches and suspenders. The effect was dizzying: a hall of mirrors, minus the glass.

He stepped gingerly over a patterned runner rug and into the living room, which looked more like a museum exhibit than a home. Shelves groaned under the weight of VHS tapes, their spines bearing titles that ranged from Mary Tyler Moore to The Cosby Show. In one corner, a stack of old TV Guide issues was meticulously arranged by year, as if someone expected a time traveler to drop by and ask for the premiere date of I Dream of Jeannie. A knitted afghan with Technicolor stripes was draped over a well-worn sofa, the bright yarns still vivid against the muted upholstery. The room smelled faintly of popcorn and dust—and something else: nostalgia, for times you’d never lived through.

In the far corner, under a small tube-style television perched on a rickety stand, sat a man hunched in an armchair. He wore a faded denim jacket, suspenders that had frayed edges, and a battered felt hat that looked like it had seen twenty summers. On the screen, The Beverly Hillbillies played in all its canned-laughter glory, and the old man laughed along in perfect sync—deep laughter that shook his shoulders each time the prerecorded guffaws played. 

He slapped his knee and barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” so loud it nearly drowned out the track.

Mary cleared her throat. The old man waved a hand at them without turning his head. His voice rang out in a drawl that could have been lifted straight from the Ozarks: 

“Don’t mind me, folks! Just watchin’ my stories.”

James took a careful step forward, offering his hand. The old man finally swivelled his head—silver hair shining under the lamp—and fixed him with a bright, curious stare. 

“Name’s Joe,” the old man announced, standing up so quickly that the chair groaned in protest. “You hungry, son?” 

He pointed toward an open doorway that led to a kitchen where the smell of roasting meat drifted out.

James gave Mary a quizzical look. Mary managed a small smile. 

“That,” she said softly, “is my grandfather.”

He tried to keep his tone light as he replied, 

“It’s very nice to meet you, name’s James.” 

But the old man didn’t drop the character. He tipped his hat and winked. 

“Pleased to meet you, too,” he said. Then he lowered his voice conspiratorially: “Have you ever tried cornbread with honey butter? I reckon I can fix you up right.”

As Mary guided James deeper into the living room—past a glass display case full of battered black-and-white photographs of unrecognizable actors—he realized something curious: Joe’s eyes, though twinkling and jovial, were sharp. They were eyes accustomed to reading people, measuring them, placing them on some private scale. James wondered briefly whether Joe was playing a part or simply refused to break character. Was it dementia? A lifelong performance? Or a conscious choice to live permanently in the world of his favorite shows?

Then, Mary steered him toward the dining room. There, a middle-aged man in a wide-lapelled suit sat at the table with his hands tented under his chin. He had perfectly coiffed hair and a smile that radiated yellow charisma. When James entered, the man leaned forward and said, “Top five answers on the board: What brings you here tonight?” 

There was a pause, then uproarious self-laughter.

This, evidently, was the uncle. He introduced himself as “Richard,” and the handshake that followed felt like a game-show challenge. Richard’s every movement, every turn of phrase, seemed lifted from Family Feud reruns. When James hesitated to answer a question, the uncle would pound the table and shout, 

“Survey says—!” as if an invisible crowd were keeping score.

James tried to laugh it off, but as the dinner unfolded he became increasingly aware of the collages on the walls: everywhere, television faces, pasted together in surreal, overlapping mosaics. There were mashups of cartoon characters with news anchors. There were eyes cut from one actor and glued onto the face of another. It was an unnerving, obsessive display. The more James noticed, the more he realized that the entire house was curated to resemble a set—a simulation of family life as broadcast to the world, complete with a sizzle reel of canned laughter and familiar punchlines.

That was the moment when, through a jitter of nerves and cheap wine, James remembered the questions Mary had been peppering him with since their first night together: What was the best sitcom episode of all time? What television moment, if any, had genuinely made him weep? Had he ever, growing up, imagined himself as another person for days at a time—inhabiting not only their voice but their gestures, their appetites, their secret hopes? It had seemed a harmless quirk at first, this “twenty questions” game, but now the memory of it snagged at him like an unfinished thread.

He remembered how, lying together in the sweaty hush after sex, Mary would go suddenly serious. She’d look up at him with those impossible eyes, and ask whether he felt, deep down, that he was always pretending—a man performing the role of himself, never quite able to believe his own lines. 

“Do you ever wish you could just… slip out of character?” she’d said once, tracing lazy circles on his chest. “Like, be someone entirely new for a day?”

Back then he’d laughed, chalking it up to the late hour and the heady aftermath of orgasms. 

Of course I do, he’d said, not really meaning it. 

Doesn’t everyone?

Now, sitting at the dinner table with the two men—game show uncle and sitcom grandfather—James felt as though he were living inside a dream crafted from Mary’s questions and obsessions. Even the food was staged: TV-dinner trays, mashed potatoes piped into perfect swirls, green beans a uniform shade of radioactive emerald. The glasses were filled with grape Kool-Aid, which neither uncle nor grandfather drank. When James tried to take a sip, the uncle leaned forward, winked, and said, 

“Survey says—!” as if any movement required its own laugh track.

He looked at Mary. She was unfazed by the spectacle, cutting her meatloaf into precise cubes and eating each one with the deliberation of an astronaut. Every now and then she would toss James a look of such perfect composure it made him uneasy. It wasn’t just that she was calm in the presence of family weirdness; it was that she seemed to be waiting for something, as though the night were a game designed for his benefit and she was silently willing him to keep playing along.

His mind did what it always did under stress: it cataloged. He began to tally the oddities, assembling them into a taxonomy of the uncanny. The old man’s laughter, which always landed a fraction of a second too late, as if he were listening to a delayed feed. The uncle’s hands, which never trembled or fidgeted, but held every gesture in a freeze-frame of perfect, almost plastic stillness. Even the family photos on the wall were wrong: in every snapshot, the faces smiled too widely, the pupils caught by the camera in a way that made them look painted on.

James tried to tell himself that this was just what happened to families after too much television and too few other interests—a kind of arrested development, harmless enough if you squinted. But then he looked at the place settings: four plates, four sets of utensils. 

He realized, with a start, that he hadn’t seen Mary’s son all night. She’d spoken of him so often that James had expected the kid to be orbiting, a minor planet in the family system, sneaking into the fridge or playing video games in the den. He glanced toward the hallway, where a closed door pulsed with the flicker of television light.

Mary caught his gaze and smiled. 

“He’s just finishing his homework,” she said, as if reading his mind. “He’ll join us soon.”

He nodded, but the words rattled in his head. Homework? On a Friday night, after nine o’clock? And still, the silence behind the door was thick and total—no clack of keyboard, no muttered complaints, not even the telltale hum of animation. He tried to imagine what kind of child Anthony must be, living in the shadow of such extravagant family theater. Was he a fellow mimic, a prodigy of imitation? Or, perversely, a total blank, a kid so unformed that his family’s personalities had simply washed over him, leaving nothing behind?

The question occupied James as the meal progressed. He picked at his food, mostly out of politeness, and filled the gaps in conversation with stories from his own childhood—his mother’s soup recipes, his father’s penchant for crossword puzzles and Jeopardy reruns. The uncle lapped up these anecdotes, responding to every detail with a ready-made game show catchphrase, while the grandfather simply nodded and occasionally barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” 

It began to dawn on James that neither man had once asked him a direct question about himself; it was as if their exchange was governed by a script, one in which the visitor’s purpose was simply to produce more lines for the canned laughter to punctuate.

Eventually, Mary stood up from the table, wiped her mouth on a paper napkin, and said, “I’ll go get Anthony.” 

She left the room with a lightness that seemed almost performative, as if she were stepping out for a commercial break. James listened to her footsteps recede down the hallway, then disappear behind the closed door.

He sat in the sudden quiet, feeling the eyes of both men settle on him. The uncle smiled, his teeth bared in a game show host’s approximation of warmth. 

“So, James,” he said, “what’s your final answer?”

James hesitated, then shrugged. “About what?”

The uncle looked at the grandfather, who cackled and said, “You should always lock in your answer, son. That’s the secret.”

For a moment, James wondered if this was some kind of elaborate hazing ritual—an initiation for boyfriends, a test of how much weirdness one could endure before bolting. He tried to play along, even as his skin prickled with the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, measured against an invisible yardstick.

Mary returned to the dining room slowly, her left hand curled gently around the slender wrist of a boy who trailed beside her like a ghost in an old photograph.

“This is Anthony,” she announced in a voice bright as a bell, though something about her inflection carried an undertow—half pride, half relief, perhaps. 

James blinked twice, then stared hard at the child. Anthony was dressed in a style so distinctly antiquated it might have belonged in a dusty black-and-white rerun: a crisp white collared shirt neatly buttoned to the throat, short pleated pants that ended just above the knees, knee-high socks folded with mathematical precision, and polished leather shoes that gleamed under the overhead chandelier. His dark hair was slicked back in a rigid wave that betrayed not a single stray strand. It was as though someone had taken a snapshot from the 1950s and slid it into the present moment with impossible clarity.

But it was Anthony’s face that froze James’s gaze. It bore none of the hallmarks James had mentally sketched when Mary first spoke of her son: no soft baby fat around the cheeks, no tentative, gap-toothed smile, none of the tentative shyness or mischievous glimmer in the eyes that mark the presence of a living child. Instead, Anthony’s features were drawn tight, as though the skin had been stretched across a carved wooden mask. His jaw was firm, unmoving. His eyes were unblinking, wide and luminous—as if two polished marbles had somehow been installed in place of irises, each reflecting the chandelier’s glow with disconcerting precision.

He moved with an odd, mechanical rigidity, every motion deliberate, almost rehearsed. When Mary guided him toward a chair at the long, varnished table, Anthony pivoted at the hips and sat down with his back absolutely straight, both feet planted flat on the hardwood floor. His hands folded exactly at the center of his lap, thumbs touching. He did not fidget. He did not glance around the room. He simply stared at James, as though he meant to examine and memorize every one of his features—the curve of his nose, the set of his eyebrows, the slight tremble in his lower lip.

Mary smiled at the boy, then turned back to James.

“This is James,” she said gently. “He’s a guest tonight.”

Anthony offered a slight nod and spoke in a voice that resonated far deeper than James would have expected from someone so slight in stature.

“Nice to meet you, James.” The words emerged with a hollow echo, as though they’d been recorded in an empty chamber and replayed. It sounded practiced, rehearsed in front of a mirror until each syllable had been polished smooth.

James forced himself to respond with a courteous smile. “Nice to meet you too. How was your homework today?”

Anthony paused, blinked twice in the slow, deliberate fashion that now set James’s nerves on edge, and said evenly,

“It was easy. I like numbers.” He added a quick, efficient grin, but it failed to touch his eyes, which remained locked on James’s face in unrelenting scrutiny.

Mary beamed at her son, as though proud of a performance well executed, then shot James a sideways look that seemed to say plainly: See? Nothing strange at all. Don’t worry.

But James’s heart thudded in his chest. Everything about the boy was strange. Anthony’s head seemed slightly oversized for his small body, the pale skin so unnaturally smooth that it looked almost translucent—like unbaked dough stretched thin. He seemed far too rigid, too perfect, too aware. James realized with a queasy pang that he had no real sense of how old Anthony was meant to be. Mary had spoken of him in vague terms—“very bright for his age,” “a bit shy,” “still adjusting”—but none of that matched the silent, intense figure now sitting opposite him, hands folded, eyes fixed.

As the adults around the table began to serve themselves—scooping roast, heaping potatoes, ladling gravy—the boy’s gaze never wavered. He didn’t glance at the roast or at the china plates. He watched James. With relentless precision, he followed every dip of James’s fork toward the plate, every hesitant swallow, until James felt compelled to drop his eyes or risk meeting that unblinking stare.

Mary bent forward, placing a dish of stringy green beans on the table. “Anthony, did you get a chance to finish that library book I asked about?” she prompted, her tone cooing, motherly.

“It’s finished,” he replied without hesitation. “I read every page. The themes were… enlightening.” His voice was even, almost monotonal. He did not offer any further elaboration. He did not squirm in his seat. He did not wipe his mouth or show any hunger for approval. He simply awaited the next cue.

Mary exchanged a quick glance with James, as though reassuring him that everything was under control. “Wonderful,” she said. “And how about recess? Did you play any games with Linh or Mikey today?”

Anthony’s eyes flicked to Mary, then to James, then back to Mary, as though downloading the question before delivering the answer.

“I played tag with Linh,” he said. “I do not mind tag. I do prefer puzzles.” He allowed himself the merest twitch of a grin that curled the corners of his mouth upward—in his mind, perhaps, an adequate approximation of a child’s enthusiasm.

The adults at the other end of the table chattered on—Uncle Richard scoffing at the soggy texture of the roast, Grandfather Joe drifting in and out of awareness, nodding at intervals as though caught between slumber and wakefulness. But all the while, the low hum of an unseen laugh track permeated the room, a relentless undercurrent of canned mirth. 

James’s stomach lurched. He turned his head to the den’s open doorway: there, a flatscreen nestled in the wall played an old sitcom rerun, its laugh track booming through hidden speakers. Private chuckles, canned applause, belly laughs—all timed to perfection, an absurd double soundtrack to the real conversation.

Anthony did not react to the laughter. He didn’t acknowledge it, didn’t flinch. As though oblivious to it, he continued to study James. Every so often, he would lift his eyes from the table and hold James’s gaze in a way that felt unnerving, like a camera lens zooming in too close.

James cleared his throat and tried another subject. “What about television? Ever watch anything you enjoy?”

The boy’s expression flickered—a fraction of a second—then settled.

“I don’t watch television,” he intoned. “It’s not real.” He paused, looked up at Mary, then added,

“Would you say that, Mother?”

Mary’s face remained serene. She offered only the slightest nod, as if granting permission for that answer and accepting it as complete. She did not push him to elaborate or soften his tone.

James swallowed hard, trying to force a forkful of gluey mashed potatoes down his throat. Each bite lodged in his chest like rotting wood. The potatoes were cold and pasty. The gravy was sickly sweet, almost plastic in flavor. The roast was charred at the edges but still raw at its center, bleeding a thin, glistening liquid into the gravy. Even the green beans tasted of nothing but metal.

He glanced around the table. Uncle Richard, laughing along with the sitcom, pounded his fist on the table in perfect sync with the recorded guffaws. Grandfather Joe, blinking slow and heavy as if waking from a dream, would crack a smile—just for the punchline—and then slump forward again, eyes closing. Mary offered polite bites and soft murmurs of encouragement to everyone else. But Anthony never lifted a morsel to his mouth. He sat, his posture ceremonial, his eyes locked on James, as though waiting for something to happen.

Conversation turned to holiday plans—Mary’s plans to take Anthony to the zoo next week, the possibility of a family outing to the mountains. Anthony answered each question with the same clipped cadence, hinting at interest but never showing any real excitement. When Mary asked if he looked forward to seeing the penguins, he simply tilted his head and said, “Penguins are… aquatic birds. I have read about them.” Then he offered a swift nod, and his gaze returned immediately to James.

After what felt like an eternity, James realized his water glass was empty. He reached for it, but it had somehow slipped entirely out of reach. He shifted, saw the glass sitting untouched at his place setting—empty, exactly where it had begun. He hadn’t sipped at it once since the meal began. He realized then that he’d been so absorbed by the boy’s eerie stillness, by the canned laughter echoing off the walls, by the grotesque parody of a family dinner unfolding around him, that he’d almost forgotten to eat or drink. Panic fluttered in his chest.

He looked at Mary, who gave him a gentle, apologetic smile and poured him more water. 

“Here you go,” she said, handing him the glass. But even the water tasted off, as though filtered through some metallic, rusty pipe.

Anthony, sensing perhaps a shift in the room’s energy, blinked twice in his deliberate fashion and spoke without preamble. 

“May I be excused?” His voice was calm, utterly devoid of childish hesitancy.

Mary glanced at the clock on the wall—silent, ticking—then nodded. “Of course. Why don’t you go read in the den for a bit?” she suggested.

The boy rose with the same precision he’d used to sit, pivoting on his heels, then walked toward the den without so much as a backward glance. As he passed James, the faintest scent of something—chalk? Sterile plastic?—wafted from him, a fleeting odor that dissolved in the air almost as soon as it touched James’s nostrils.

James exhaled slowly, as though releasing a held breath he hadn’t been conscious of. Mary returned her attention to him, concerned about softening her smile. 

“Are you alright?” she asked.

He nodded, unable to form words. The silent weight of Anthony’s presence still lingered in the room, a cold, calculated impression. Uncle Richard let out another laugh in perfect time with the television, Grandfather Joe stirred, and Mary resumed her small talk.

But James could think only of that pale-faced boy in a vintage schoolboy uniform, sitting motionless at his mother’s table, watching him with unblinking eyes, as if calculating and cataloging every detail. And James knew, with an unsettling certainty, that he would never unsee the astonishing precision of Anthony’s performance—nor unhear the faint, mechanical echo in his voice.

The conversation, if it could be called that, soon turned. It was as if the entire family had conspired to shift the spotlight onto him, to excavate his past and dissect it for entertainment.

Richard opened with the easy stuff, the ""Tell us about yourself, James!"" line. But it quickly devolved into a barrage of questions so intimate and oddly specific that James found himself stumbling, caught off-guard by how much they already seemed to know.

She is a refugee and as such had a traumatic childhood . She also has some serious physical problems. This summer my husband and I paid for a flight for her to join us in Italy. She was excited but  failed to get on the plane . Panic attack? Following this , she seemed to have a total breakdown. I have been extremely supportive but now she is avoiding me and going to any lengths to do so. It’s very sad. She lies incessantly. Now she won’t even accept a lift from me to take her to the bus station. 
It’s not total blocking. We met for a coffee on neutral ground. All fine . However, we had agreed that I pick her up from university. I asked her if she was sure she wanted this and she was adamant. This didn’t materialise. 
As a result, I wrote a carefully worded email showing my continued unconditional support but pointing out how I felt about the numerous occasions she has been avoiding me. I felt it might be helpful for her to realise the effect her behaviour might have on others. She accepted a birthday present from me but not money, which I know she needs.
I have known her for 10 years, initially in the capacity 
of teacher then of family friend. So many issues in the family. Mother divorced and has mental issues particularly with depression and anger management.  
I am very depressed myself. I know I have to stand back . She is having therapy but I sometimes wonder if my attempts to help have exacerbated the problem. She wants to get better. At least that’s a positive sign but being someone who internalises everything improvement will be challenging .

So, my 30 year old brother has had some sort of mental health/happiness challenges basically since he was a kid. My parents are incredibly loving but wildly spiteful regarding other people’s issue and quite spiteful about them. (I recently went through a split with my partner of 8 years and the only words spoken to me about it from the two of my parents were “That sucks”).  
  
Back to my brother and context, he’s clearly struggled with mental health since an early age, we’re talking 7 or 8. The parents always chalked it up to nothing more than him being the youngest, and that’s just how they are. In the years I was living in the same city I was always trying to include him in my things to help bring him out of the shell, but nothing ever worked. We were all raised in the same style household with not much difference between my siblings. We are 2 and 4 years apart from each other (30, 32 y/o sister, and im 34). I moved away 12 years ago to Vancouver where I’ve built a regular life on my own, I own my own place and happily say Im adulting well. My sister is the same, happily married with 2 kids and a lovely house. My brother could not be further from the opposite.  
  
On this years trip back home to visit I went down to my parents basement to play some pool, but upon opening the door realized I was no longer going into the family’s old game room (where my room used to be) and rather, I was entering what smelt to be a neckbeard den. The state of the basement was so bad that I felt compelled to enter his room and check on his living conditions, and while I couldn’t be more disgusted by it, I’m very glad I did.  
  
I found moldy coffee cups/mugs going back into the summer, piles of takeout boxes, a laundry pile taller than me, a bed with no sheets or blankets, just a single ratty stained pillow and a sleeping back unzipped to be a blanket. All of which is manageable, but evidence of substance abuse has me worried. Without snooping into any drawers or storage, only looking at what was out in the open I found approximately 30 bottles of warming lube (empty), 9 vape pens and dozens of empty flavour pods, a dozen or so boxes of Forta + (over the counter) mens enhancing pills, atleast 20 empty bottles of Zzzquill sleep pain/aid liquid amounting to approx 7 litres, and enough empty liquor bottles to buy a nice bottle of scotch from the refund money.



For years I’ve been trying to help my brother move out and find his own place, but he’s never done anything adult like in his life so at this point it feels now like I’ve replaced my parents as a parental figure. Just by me talking with him I do more than the parents, as they’re so fed up with him being “broken” that they basically just stomp on the ground floor to make him living downstairs more of a challenge. I don’t know how to bring this up with my brother or parents in a way that doesn’t push him even more into a corner, but im at the point I’m fine putting him in a corner if it breaks him out of this routine before he just becomes this way for the rest of his life. My uncle is very similar to my brother in this regard, and he himself did the same thing into his 50’s at my grandmothers house.

1pu36jn,https://i.redd.it/81a1idjdc09g1.jpeg,Critical mass to trigger hot compost,"TLDR: A volume of 1 ft cube as shown in the picture, depending on the material, can result to hot compost. 

When I tried composting coffee grounds and dried leaves three months ago, I was concerned with critical mass, or the amount of material I should have to make a hot compost. 

A quick google search lead me to the figure of 1 cubic meter. I blamed the lack of mass to a low temperature, slow, and prolonged hot compost. 

I later found that a compost ""pile"" inside a flower pot or a bucket can become hot overnight.

Here are some of the recipes I tried:
1. coffee grounds + dried leaves (POOR)
The fibrous dried leaves don't provide enough available carbon no matter how much dried leaves I add. 

2. coffee grounds + shredded cardboard (GREAT)  
Simple and effective. Both ingredients provide plenty of readily available nitrogen and carbon.

3. Leftover rice + dried leaves(GOOD)
Rice heats up by itself. I added the dried leaves with the rice because the mixture becomes hot and acidic which should breakdown the dried leaves faster than when I add the dried leaves to coffee. 

NOTE: To speed up the process, it is better to inculate the compost pile. To do this, I poured water into an old compost and used the leachate/compost tea on the new compost pile.

When I did not do the inoculation, nothing happened overnight. But when I poured the leachate/compost tea and mixed the pile, the pile become very hot overnight. ",6,1766519164.0,composting,0,1.0,False

I wish they'd make cloth more accessible early on to give the mill more use. 

Or buff the mill products, such as making flour, sugar, vinegar, and rice made in the mill worth more than the the ones you can buy. Maybe calling the ""locally milled"" or give them an artisan designation but I feel like artisan might also make them to late in the game.


Also making more mill able crops. Such as coffee to make coffee ground, Corn to make corn meal (could feed to animals to temporarily boost output), beans, and poppy seeds.



Or maybe make it as a less effective dehydrator where it give even less of a price buff but you can put in a ridiculous amount of crops. Like dehydrator you can take 5 of a crop and make them the same value as if they were all gold quality crops maybe I'm make it so all the crops turn into silver quality equivalent but you can put in 999 instead of just 5.

3. Set plunger at 4, invert, add grounds and shake to level.
4. Bloom for 30 sec with 50ml of 205F water, stirring for 10 seconds.
5. Fill Aeropress to nearly the top, cover with wet filter and cap. 
6. Steep 90 seconds.
7. Measure the mass of your empty cup on the scale while you wait. You'll use this to adjust the amount of liquid.
8. Invert, press past the hiss, then add enough hot water to the cup to total 250g of liquid. The small amount of bypass water tones down the acidity slightly.

Notes: Lower water temperature did not bring out as much flavor. 12g will make an OK 200ml with Hoffman method. 20g or larger amounts of beans don't add much. 

Colectivo recommended similar temperature (they said just off boiling) and a 15:1 ratio of beans to water. This recipe tries to hit that ratio (if you include the water retained in the puck).",2,1766518515.0,AeroPress,0,0.75,False

**P.S.** This is for International Legacy Tests!

This guide will cover **4 parts**: Passage types, Skimming Strategies, Question types, and Practice test-taking tips

**- 1st Part: you need to understand the 4 types of passages before moving on to questions:-**

***Literary Narrative***

* *Its passages are usually taken from excerpts, stories, novels,etc.*
* *Point of view: Usually* ***1st person (I, me, we)*** *and 3rd person (he, she, they)*
* *What to focus on while skimming: Characters, Emotions, Tone, Relationships between characters, Setting ( for chronological questions), and Figurative Languages*

***Social Science and Natural Science***

* ***Social Science*** *contains contents such as Economics, US History, Sociology, and Social Studies ( Human Behaviors in Society)*
* ***Natural Science*** *consists of topics from Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Evolution, etc.*
* *Point of view: Mostly written in* ***3rd person ( he,she, they)***
* *What to focus on while skimming: Main focus of the passage ( for example : cork tree), Tone, Dates ( Chronological), Structure, 2nd name of an expert ( for comparing between two expert studies)*

***Humanities***

* *Passages usually covers arts, paintings, music (such as jazz), artistic movements, a biography about a famous person, and autobiography*
* *Point of view: Autobiography* ***(1st person)*** *and Biography* ***(3rd person)***
* *What to focus on while skimming: Characters, Emotions, Tone, Relationship, Focus of the passage ( type of music/painting), Characterization of the main famous person.*

**-2nd Part: I will be providing my personal skimming strategy for each passage type:-**

***Literary Narrative and Humanities***

* I read the first 3-4 paragraphs then the conclusion. Why do they require a lot of reading? Because these two types contain events, relationships, characters, and emotions ( these items helped me find the main idea and answer most of the questions!)

***Social Science and Natural Science***

* I read the introductory paragraph, first sentence each paragraph, then conclusion.
* Because they come from scientific topics/ studies, It's not necessary to take notes for characters, emotions and relationships since they are written most of the time in neutral tone

**-3rd Part: Now that you understand the content of this section! Let's cover all the kinds of question you will be asked in the reading section:-**

***1.) Main Idea and Purpose***

* Always Leave it **till the end!**
* Use your own or my skimming method
* Main ideas are formed from: **Focus + Tone + Structure**
* In Main Purpose, ask yourself: Why did the author write this?
* Main Purpose answer choices: **Verb (function) + Main Idea**
* Types of Incorrect Answers: Too specific - Too broad - Irrelevant - Part correct Part wrong - One word that would causes the entire answer to be incorrect

***2.) Vocabulary in Context***

* One of the **easiest questions** in reading section!
* Read couple of sentences before and after the sentence that has the asked word
* Then form your own answer based on your understanding of the context
* Match it with the choices with similar meanings
* Play positive or negative! If the paragraph you just read is positive, eliminate negative words and vice versa.

***3.) Function of this paragraph/sentence***

* This question is always highlighted so **solve it first** since it doesn't require scanning!
* Read around the highlighted text carefully
* Then identify the function of the HIGHLIGHTED ITSELF!! ( DON'T confuse it for the main idea of the paragraph!)
* Types of functions: does it provide list? explain unfamiliar term to readers? Refute a study? Provide anecdote?

***4.) Specific Details***

* Requires scanning ( if you're weak at quick scanning leave it till the end!)
* Get the keywords from the question and find it - Play Where's Waldo?
* Also one of the easiest questions because the answer choices are usually copy-pasted from the text!

***5.) Inference***

* This question is used to be my biggest enemy LMFAO **( Leave it till the end!)**
* First you should already get **the gist and the context** of the passage because inference requires **clues** to form an answer
* Once you're done go to the answer choices and use POE (Process of Elimination - Game changer!! the answer choices contain really obvious incorrect words). The correct answer choice is always the **Paraphrased version** of the text
* PLEASE NEVER ASSUME! make sure the answer are **BASED ON THE PASSAGE** ( trust me i used to always make my own answer based on outside knowledge NEVER DO THAT)
* Ask these two questions: Is this answer even mentioned? If so, where is the evidence?

***6.) Chronological Order***

* Answer it LAST!
* 2 types: which event occurred FIRST & LAST
* You should highlight all the **time and dates** while skimming. It's **very time consuming**, so i recommend answering easier questions to not miss out on points!
* Usually asked in Literary Narrative and Humanities. Rarely Asked in Social and Natural Science

***7.) Questions that are NOT or DIRECTLY ANSWERED***

* If you read/skimmed the passage, this would be a breeze for you
* Answer it LAST!
* Use the answer choices and scan for each!
* For **NOT,** If the answer choice question has been answered Eliminate it! and **VICE VERSA for the DIRECTLY**

***8.) EXCEPT and NOT Questions***

* These questions are answered in the same way as \*\*''\*\****Questions that are NOT or DIRECTLY ANSWERED''***
* They are **slightly easier** though since the answer choices are one word.
* If you read/skimmed the passage, this would be a breeze for you
* Answer it LAST!
* Use the answer choices and scan for each!

***9.) Analogy Questions***

* They are the RAREST questions in the entire section ( I would like to mention it just in case!)
* They are also usually highlighted, so read the highlighted portion
* Then, MATCH what you understood with the choices with similar scenario!
* For example:-
* ''Museum goers prefer Leonardo da Vinci in his coffee mug than the one hang on the museum'' -> prefers **unofficial over official.** it matches with the scenario of '' People prefer listening to Recorded music (unofficial recorded by a fan) over Live Concerts (official)''

***10.) Figurative Language***

* **Types**: Metaphor (indirect comparison), Simile ( like, as), Allusion ( Reference), and Personification ( compare human actions to inanimate objects)
* Will ask what is '' example'' being compared to?
* The comparisons are **explicitly stated!**

**- 4th and Last Part: I will be now showing you my Plan in Attacking the Reading Section:-**

**1-** **Arrange the passage** according to your preferences!

\-   I'm a science person so here's my arrangement:

Natural Science>Social Science>Literary Narrative>Humanities

\-   I spent about **8:45 mins** in each passage

**2- Arrange the questions** in this order:

\- Highlighted portion > Keywords (specific details) > General ( main idea and purpose, inference, chronological order, DIRECTLY AND NOT ANSWERED question, and EXCEPT & NOT question)

**3- Timing**:

Spend about **2-3 mins skimming** the passage and **5-6 mins answering** the questions

**4-** **Guessing Strategies** ( If you're running out of time! ***DON'T USE AS MAIN STRATEGY*** ):

* Too Extreme = X
* Too Specific =  X
* Irrelevant/Not Mentioned in the passage = X
* As General As Possible Answer = correct!

>

* *Go back to the test and Analyze your mistakes* ***+ Take out unfamiliar Vocabulary Words ( Use Anki - very helpful flashcards app)***
* *Make notes or a document of why you got this question wrong*
* *Categorize each incorrect questions to identify your weaknesses*
* *Go in this* ***Cycle*** *everyday! Review weaknesses and mistakes -> solve a test -> document new mistakes -> Repeat*

**Resources (Prep books):**

* *For The Love of ACT Reading*
* *Guide to ACT Reading by Erica Meltzer*
* *link for practice tests:* [*https://exam.actexam.info/*](https://exam.actexam.info/)

***Let's be Realistic:*** *if you think that you can improve reading by 10 points in one month, let me hold your hands when i say this : It will take ONE YEAR maximum*

*My first reading score was 19. I took it again and got 17s 2 times in a row, practiced for one year and got 30. Reading is the* ***hardest section*** *to improve.*

***Special Note ( For Freshmen and Sophomores with low comprehension):***

*Please read books, articles, etc. AND take notes of main idea of each paragraph + extract unfamiliar vocabulary words and compile flashcards in Anki!*

*Don't take trials unless your comprehension skills have improved darastically!*

-----

I've had apparently a partial blockage for at least a couple of weeks in roughly the middle of my descending colon. Might have also been since August but wasn't so bad and must have partially resolved until recently. 

Last Thursday I stopped eating entirely, except coffee, laxatives and many a macrogol. Friday morning CT was normal except full of poop. Saturday added tiny enemas, yesterday and today bigger enemas. Nothing but liquid and gas results. 

Last night I could move a lot of gas up and down loudly behind the block by breathing deeply, but no farts. Somehow this morning's enema allowed the gas to come out. After that no other liquid or gas passed (until just now), even though I drank 2 coffees and 2 more sachets macrogol after the enema in addition to water. Previous days that would have produced some liquid. 

I was afraid it might have turned into a complete blockage, so I saw my GP again today and she listened to my belly. She said I have normal bowel sounds (yesterday she said  they were very hyperactive). She consulted with a specialist who recommended colonoscopy prep.

I finished my first 2 liters (2 more tomorrow). A couple pain spasms around where I think the block is, above it, and opposite side. Burns and itches a bit more. I'm using a massage gun on it (again), ouchy but felt like it might be doing something. So far though just more liquid. It's darker and smellier when I massage it, hopefully that means something good, but it's really just only the next water load after a massage. I really wish the last thing I ate last week wasn't 2 days of beet veggie soup. Massaged it's pinkish reddish brown and smelly, otherwise yellowish and not smelly. Should I keep massaging it? 

Please tell me this will work, or what I can expect. My GP said 85% chance of uncorking from 2 days of this. Still just liquid though and I think it's about done for today. What's in the other 15%? I'm guessing I should be mentally prepared for being in the hospital for Christmas. Thank you. ",1,1766518429.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1pu2sjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pu2sjz/i_watched_a_youtube_video_about_how_to_lucid/,I watched a YouTube video about how to lucid dream. I think I'm getting too good at it. (Part 1),"I imagine that we all shared some moments of being gullible during the first few years of the internet and the boom of YouTube. There were videos popping up claiming to have the ability to hypnotize you or videos that could summon spirits. Some of the more impressionable viewers might watch a video that claims that simply by watching, the viewer can change their weight or their eye color. Many of us who were in our teens or 20s during this time in history can probably picture lying on our beds next to our best friend with a laptop, trying to freak the other out and suggest clicking on the next video, and then the next. 

This all seems so silly to us now that we have learned basic internet culture and the limitations that we used to believe didn’t exist. When the internet was shiny and new, everything felt possible, even the prospect of tapping into our subconscious or the supernatural. Yet, I don’t believe that we were less intelligent at this time. The internet felt as vast and unexplored as the ocean, and our imaginations went against our better judgment, leaving us with the impression that anything could be seen or done.  

Living on my own for the first time in my life, I wondered if utilizing nostalgia would help keep the enveloping loneliness from consuming me entirely. What is the harm in exploring these videos once again, as long as I keep myself from taking them too seriously? All that I hoped to achieve was the ability to reminisce about life before rent and car insurance, when it was just walking over to my friend's house in high school to explore the ocean of the internet and YouTube.  

Lying on top of my cold down comforter with the only light throughout my home being the blue light from my computer screen, I sifted through worthless and cringy videos, hoping to find something actually interesting. Since I haven’t found anything yet that has completely taken my attention, and the silence grows louder the longer my break between videos, my eyes wander around my bedroom.  

I start to notice things that only happen when you allow your mind to take things too far. The idea that there is someone creeping around my house starts to take shape and develop so far that the shadows compensate for my imagination, and there almost seems to be a fully formed shape of a person standing in the crack of my doorway. I quickly turn my phone's flashlight on and try to startle my imaginary intruder, and if I were somehow right, I would catch him off guard. 

As suspected, when I turn the flashlight towards the crack in my door, there is nothing there. Feeling braver, I scoot out of my bed with too many pillows and go to shut the door. Before I completely shut it, I made a promise to myself that at night and with the lights off, I would always remember to shut and lock my bedroom door, so that I wouldn’t drive myself crazy. Holding the handle, my morbid curiosity took over, and I opened the door wider to look down a black hallway into nothingness. Rather than walking over through the home, like some unrelatable horror movie character, I simply listened to the silence, again trying to catch some imaginary intruder making the mistake of breathing too loudly or creaking on the wooden floors on the other side of my house. 

Even if I had a cat or something like it, I could blame any noise outside of my field of view on them. While I was happy to be on my own and away from my abusive ex-boyfriend, I simultaneously missed the presence of another person while on my own. 

Satisfied that there truly was nothing and no one, I turned around to return to my insomnia-driven activities. I rolled my eyes, passing some of the first, more ridiculous videos like “five ways to contact your dead loved ones using household objects” and “How to hypnotize yourself for anything you want.” I then saw a video with a black and white swirl with a human eye in the center titled “How to lucid dream.” This seemed the most interesting to me as it might help me to fall asleep to dream in the first place, and I have never had the experience of lucid dreaming. Unlike the other two, hypnosis and necromancy, I knew plenty of people who had mentioned that at least once in their lives, they had successfully astral projected or had a lucid dream. 

Scanning my room once again, I acknowledged the silence and wave of loneliness and fear. I shook it off, turned back to the bright blue light of my computer screen, which illuminated only my face, and clicked on the video. 

The video opened to a 20-something man with over-the-top hand gestures explaining how he is going to break down the science of lucid dreaming, and why it happens. This is not what I had wanted because, honestly, this seemed too informative. I needed something that might make me feel like it's doing something. So I utilized the right side of the screen, which was used for suggesting other videos, to see if there was something less serious. I see one of the videos is simply a black box, with the video title being the thing that stood out the most. “Click on this video to start lucid dreaming TONIGHT.” 20 views.

As if I was being called out by name specifically, I found it impossible not to click on.

Rather than the black screen that I had seen in the video thumbnail, once I clicked on the video, my computer screen blared a stark white, and there was a rolling in of a deep “hum” as if a chorus of men were using their diaphragm to try and sound the deepest and the loudest. It got louder and louder, as if the chorus of men were getting closer and my computer speakers were simply inadequate to house the strength of the noise. I was about to close it when the humming ceased, and the silence pounded in my ears. The white screen faded out, and I assumed the video was over, but then it showed the face of a ghastly woman. 

Her face was gaunt, and her skin was cracking rather than wrinkling. She stared at the camera as if she were holding it, eyes bulging and mouth stuck in a silent scream. The cracks in her skin grew. Lines of red open wounds spread wider and spidered across her cheeks, under her eyes, across her forehead. I mentally begged her to relax her muscles as if that would stop the procession of openings in her face. 

One long crack was more heinous than the others, and the black abyss that was the opening in her face disgusted me. It got larger and blacker. A true hole in her face. The lighting made it so that I saw no blood or bone, just blackness. Then tiny legs, seemingly belonging to a bug, danced their way out of the hole, using their legs to push their way out. 

I closed the tab on my screen, uninterested and unwilling to watch bugs crawl out of wounds in a very realistic woman's face. 

Now that it was pitch black, I turned on a small touch-to-turn-on nightlight. I then pressed the button to play white noise, and I looked down next to me at my sleeping daughter. While I was shocked that she didn’t wake up from the videos that I had been cycling through, I was glad for it so that I didn’t have to do the various trials of putting a baby to sleep. 

While it was an eerie setting, I read online somewhere that having a red night light helps babies get a more restful sleep, so the illumination has switched from a harmful computer blue light to a hellish red one in its place. 

I closed my eyes with one arm lightly lying over my daughter's legs, and in my mind's eye, I saw the woman once again. It was one of those moments when, as soon as you close your eyes, horrific faces nonconsensually show themselves to you. 

Minutes later, I was able to fall into a restless sleep. 

I woke up out of my sleep in the early morning, while the dawn light was inching its way across the skyline. My windows were frosted, yet it hadn’t snowed. It was always cold enough this time of year to make the floorboards painful to step on. The first thing I did was scan my room as my eyes adjusted. I noticed that the night light must have died, and my door was wide open. I also noticed that my baby was not under my arm. A cold panic shocked through my body, and I jumped out of bed, fully alert now. I looked around my room for Anika and quickly spotted her on the floor playing with some of her toys. 

Anika was 6 months old and unable to carefully get off my bed. I quickly went over to her to rub her back and make sure that she wasn’t hurt. Pushing aside the thought of her getting off the bed by herself, I turned my attention to my wide-open door. I knew that I had locked it last night. Somehow, I also knew that there was someone in my house. It was strange, my ability to simply know this as a fact, yet without concrete proof. 

I considered that this person went into my room and put my baby on the floor themselves. If this were the case, I would have to confront the fact that they were inches from me as I slept, and that they picked up Anika and had the opportunity to take her with them.

I knew that as the only adult in this house, I had to go check and find this person. I left my daughter playing and stepped out into the freezing hallway, goosebumps shooting up from my legs to the rest of my body. I shut the door behind me, as if the person didn’t already know where to go to find Anika. 

I stared ahead, waiting for my eyes to adjust. My house was rectangular with the ability to see all the way down to the other end. At the other end of my house, there was a second bedroom, currently uninhabited. I started to slowly walk forward, looking for other signs of a break-in, but not registering anything, as I had the feeling that if I looked anywhere other than ahead, I was allowing the stranger to catch me off guard. 

At the end of my house, the light turned on in the other bedroom behind the closed door. I froze, unable to face it, unable to run. 

The person then turned the light off in the moment that I heard Anika babbling, which echoed loudly across the silent house. As soon as the light was off, the door to the room the stranger was in started to open. 

A hand crept out of the darkness between the slight opening in the door and opened its palm towards me, waving. 

In that moment, there was no more need to watch and pretend that I could have the upper hand. The person knew exactly where I was. I turned and ran back to my room to grab Anika and get out of the house as fast as possible. Maybe we could run to the neighbor's house and call the police. I wasn’t sure, and my panic wasn’t allowing me to make a more complete plan. As soon as I saw my baby on the floor, I scooped her up and was about to grab my charging phone from the nightstand when it was pulled by the cord off the nightstand, and as it crashed to the floor, it created a deafening sound in my silent house. I bent down to grab it, and it was yanked under the bed. 

My panic doubled. There was no way that I was going to bend down and try to get my phone, especially now that I was carrying my baby. I turned around, ready to sprint out of my house, baby in my arms, when the worst thing that could have happened happened to us. The stranger must have made his way across the house without me hearing him. My front door was right outside of my bedroom door to the left, but he was here now. Before I could scream, he slammed my bedroom door shut, and the limited light that I had from the windows in the hallways and living room was gone all at once. Something still had my phone under the bed, my only opportunity for help and for light, and we were trapped with it. 

I tried to push on the door, but it wasn’t budging. 

“Please leave!” I yelled at nothing in particular. 

No response. 

I couldn’t do anything, so I sat on the floor holding my daughter, hoping that there was something explainable about my phone sliding under my bed. I closed my eyes and held her tight, facing the reality that we were at the whim of whatever was in my room. 

I knew that a baby wouldn’t like sitting still like this, so when I felt my hair being moved gently, I assumed that it was Anika playing with whatever was in reach. 

Trying to refocus myself, I went to put her hands down so that I would be completely alert and not distracted by her pulling my hair. As I reached behind my head to remove her hand, I felt nothing there. I looked at Anika, and the black silhouette showed that her hands were down by her sides. 

The feeling of something fingerlike, but soft, moved along the back of my head. I got that feeling when you feel phantom crawling all over your body when you see a spider, and I rushed to brush around the back of my hair to try and push whatever it was off. I couldn’t feel anything. The feeling continued moving until it was by my ears. I was screaming at this point. It then moved to my cheek, and as it reached the side of my mouth, two appendages separated my lips, opening my mouth. My screaming heightened, and Anika started to cry. 

My eyes fluttered open. I was in bed in the same position I fell asleep in, Anika under my arm. I watched her chest rise and fall in that slow, sweet way that babies do, feeling safe next to their parent. 

I felt the fear clutching my chest slowly fade, my breathing returning to normal as I said into my empty room, “It was a dream.” A visceral, horrifying one, but still a dream. The light was now strong enough to bleed its way out of the sides of my darkening curtains. I lay down in this position for several more minutes, soaking up the feeling of holding my baby in a safe place, far from intruders or crawling things. 

As I saw her eyelashes begin to twitch, her eyes landed on me. One of the best parts about babies is how their eyes find you as soon as they wake up, and they’re content with this. Her sweet smile grew to match mine. The morning cold was making me wish I could cuddle her forever in my warm bed. 

I gently lifted her and set her in her play area, then pressed the button on a few of her musical toys to distract her, so I could steal a moment to get myself ready for the day. Setting my feet on the ice-cold floor sent shivers up my body. My mom would often chastise me for always sleeping in shorts, but no matter the time of year, I hated the feeling of sleeping in heavy clothes. My jaw ached, as if I had been clenching my teeth together in my sleep, or holding my mouth open. 

Right outside my bedroom door in the hallway was my bathroom. I stepped in and paused. Turning around, facing the front door, I noticed that it was definitely locked. I felt silly, but a bit more at ease. Once in the bathroom, I went to wash my face with hot water. I noticed that my lips also seemed chapped. I ran my finger along my peeling lips, and once I reached the corner, a sharp pain stopped me. A drop of blood pooled there at the edge of my mouth. Noticeably, it was on the same side where I had felt the pulling from phantom appendages in my dream. This was obviously concerning for a moment, but the rational part of my brain told me that I had chapped lips from sleeping with my mouth open. The pain must have manifested itself in my nightmare. 

I went to pull my hair back out of my face when some of my hair got caught between my fingers. I was not shocked to lose a few or more strands of hair after having a baby. When I pulled them out, I saw that one of them was white. I giggled to myself at the idea of seeing my first gray hair while still being in my 20s, but upon further inspection, I saw that it wasn’t white, nor was it gray. It was iridescent and shiny in the light, sort of like silk.  

I held Anika up on my shoulders, which made her giggle and squeal in her perfect baby voice. We walked outside to the porch, where I had already transferred my hot cup of coffee and my phone. I had donned an oversized sweatshirt and pajama pants and put Anika in a very soft and plush onesie/blanket combo. I placed her gently in a bouncer and looked outside towards the other homes on the street. 

Anika and I lived in a mobile home park, which I wasn’t very proud of, but once I had left her dad, my parents offered to buy me something so that I could still be somewhat independent. The embarrassment and disappointment that the life I had envisioned not working out led me to be very stubborn about taking a step backwards and living with my parents. I told them that I would get a job, an apartment, and put Anika in daycare, but they told me that the first year of my daughter's life was something that they didn’t want me to miss. So no, I wasn’t disappointed that I was living in a trailer park; I was disappointed that my relationship failed and that I had nothing for myself that I could use to start life again for Anika and me. 

As I felt an intense pooling of sadness and the feeling of my emotions betraying me by threatening tears, I saw something that not only distracted me, but moved the pain I felt for myself onto another. One of my neighbors, Hunter Pelletier, groggily opened the driver's side door of his ‘89 Chevy. He looked sweaty despite the Maine autumn, and his hair was thick, greasy, and unstyled. He had parked in the lawn of his mother's home, and one can only assume that he slept in the vehicle. I wouldn’t be surprised if his mother got sick of this pattern and decided to start locking the doors at night. He had heavy steps on their porch with the missing railing. He then angrily rapped on the screen door of Mrs. Pelletier's house. 

When she came to the door, I expected that she would show anger or even turn him away, but she just looked sad with a twinge of caring for her fuckup of a son. I loved Dawn Pelletier. Since moving in, she has been gifting me baked goods of whoopee pies and variously shaped sugar cookies. She refuses to modernize, and she still holds onto the old-fashioned neighborly attitude. I decided that I would be angry for her. I was able to get away from the alcoholic that was Anika’s father, but it’s different when it’s your child. I couldn’t imagine turning my baby away, no matter how old she was or how many times she drove her car drunk on my lawn. Despite this, after leaving my ex behind, I have a newfound distaste for men who take advantage of the people who care for them, so every time I hear Hunter's loud and vulgar mouth, I consider putting him in his place. 

Before she retreated back indoors with her son, Dawn noticed me and somehow changed her entire demeanor just to give me a warm smile. She has offered to babysit on multiple occasions, but with Anika being so young, I haven’t desired a time away from her. I’m not sure when that will happen or if it ever will. 

I buckled Anika into her stroller, despite a hint of a protest, and I set my freshly brewed cup of coffee into the drink holder. I decided that a walk in the woods would make me feel like I did something today, and I’ve heard that getting outside helps with sadness. The smell of my coffee mixing with the crisp smell of cold air made for an intoxicating aroma. 

I carefully lifted the stroller down the steps and started walking down the street, passing many neighbors who had started raking leaves into piles. I saw a few kids getting excited at the prospect of jumping into the piles and giggling away, knowing that they were about to ruin their parents' hard work. Some houses looked completely abandoned, with cars that were missing wheels or with tarps covering the hood. The only thing that the elderly landlord really seemed to regulate was cutting the grass, or next month shoveling the snow, which will, of course, come out of your lot rent if you don't do it quickly enough before he gets to it. He's been known to be an early riser just to get the chance to shovel before the residents woke up to do it themselves. 

As I reached the end of the dead-end road, I looked ahead of me at the beast that was the Maine forest. I stepped onto the grass and across the few feet to cross into the woods. It was pleasant the way the leaves got cold and crunched under my shoes. The stroller was having a slightly hard time as it was wobbling under the uneven path, but it didn’t bother me too much. The air was clean and cold. I felt my nostrils freezing up in the cold wind. Looking down, I saw that Anika was still bundled. I touched her cheek and felt that she was warm. So warm that she was falling asleep. 

This was no state park, so the path was quite pathetic. I was evading roots and large rocks everywhere. If I were alone, I would probably feel fine, but pushing the stroller was proving to be a workout. After 20 or so more minutes, I decided that I would turn around. The canopy above me was quite thick in this part of the forest, and it almost looked like evening, even though my phone says that it’s just after 9 am. 

I started to uncomfortably try to swivel the stroller around without jostling Anika too much, as she was still sleeping, when I heard a skittering noise above me. Or was it behind me? 

I looked up and saw nothing. I turned around and saw nothing. I was about to just walk away when I heard something much worse. 

Once my head was turned, ready to make the trek home, whatever it was saw that my guard was down again. I then heard the cry of a baby and then a babble, but it wasn’t my baby; this sound was coming from the mouth of a man. 

My eyes widened to a painful degree as I whipped my head back around, but I didn’t see anyone. I was about to start speed walking away when something caught my eye. Behind a tree, a white hand slowly showed itself and started waving. It looked out of focus and reminded me of my dream. I felt cold panic and started practically running, or something similar that you could do with a stroller in the woods. I wished so badly not to have the baby with me right now because my body was begging me to run, to go as fast as I could. 

I kept bumping into roots, and the pause caused my panic to rise and for Anika to wake up. I heard more skittering behind me, and it felt threatening. I knew we were vulnerable, and that whoever this was could outrun me, but I never heard him approaching. I pulled my phone out with 911 ready to call, and while I was looking down, I hadn’t noticed that we reached a clearing and the sounds of the forest hushed. 

My arms ached from the pushing and jolting of the stroller, and my breath was hitching in my throat. The panic didn’t allow my muscles to relax, and the cold amplified all of this. I smelled something like an animal musk, which came out of nowhere. The pleasant smell of autumn leaves abandoned me. It was like I was in a different season, or a different forest. 

I paused for a moment to listen to the silence when it dawned on me that I had been listening to footsteps that were parallel to us. My own footsteps had their sound swallowed by the thick canopy. Sound was working strangely in the woods, but as clear as I could tell, when I stopped walking, there were one or two steps that I could hear halting, as if someone tried to match my steps, and were caught off guard by my sudden stopping. 

“Bababa,” The man babbled in his best impression of a baby.

My conflict about running away as fast as possible returned, and as I gripped the stroller once again, a sense of dread came over me, because not only was I able to create distance between the man and us, but he was playfully matching my slow pace. 

I had nothing to do but continue my pursuit out of the woods. Technically, this person hasn’t threatened us; they are also parallel to the only path nearby. While calming myself down, though, I knew this was bullshit. I might shut down, though, if I thought about it too much and I needed to get Anika out of the woods. 

I finally pushed past the entrance of the forest that we had entered, and the rush of adrenaline slowed down. I turned back, and in the distance, almost too far back to see, I saw a hand waving once again from behind some trees. Based on the distance, the person must have never left the area where I heard him last. 

I bent down to look at Anika, and she smiled at me. I returned this smile and went to brush her hair back and give her a kiss, grateful once again for her safety and unawareness to all that was happening. As I reached out near her head, a spider skittered along the side of her stroller. Disgusted, I slapped it away as quickly as I saw it. The earth colored insect blended in with the ground below us, so I lost it, but I hope that I killed it.

For the last 3 years, I’ve been the only one working. He was “finding himself,” trying things, quitting things, while I covered rent, bills, groceries, literally everything. I kept telling myself it was temporary and that we were a team.

We had savings. My savings, realistically. I had plans for that money, which was a safety net, maybe a down payment, or at least something to show for all those years of grinding.

Last week, I checked our joint account and saw $8,000 gone.

When I asked him what the hell happened, he said it casually, like he was talking about buying coffee:

He gave the money to another woman. A woman I already don’t like. Apparently, she was “crying,” “desperate,” and he “couldn’t stand seeing her like that.”

Turns out she used the money to buy herself a new car.

I felt sick. Betrayed doesn’t even cover it.

Beitrag: „Öffentliche Anhörung: Bleiben die Gedanken frei?“, S. 9–11.","In der folgenden Analyse wird die Debatte des Deutschen Ethikrates zum Thema „Gedankenlesen“ und Neurotechnologie auf Basis des Infobriefs 02/25 (Nr. 37) kritisch rekonstruiert.

# Die Erosion der Gedankenfreiheit: GEDANKENLESEN IN ECHTZEIT​

Der Deutsche Ethikrat befasste sich im Rahmen einer öffentlichen Anhörung am 18. September 2025 mit den rasanten Fortschritten der Neurotechnologie, wobei die Frage „Bleiben die Gedanken frei?“ im Zentrum der Diskussion stand. Die technologische Entwicklung hat einen Punkt erreicht, an dem die Grenze zwischen privatem Denken und externer Datenerfassung zunehmend durchlässig wird.

**1. Technischer Stand: Dekodierung von „innerer Sprache“​**

Eines der eindrucksvollsten Beispiele für das, was heute unter „Gedankenlesen“ verstanden wird, lieferte Frank Willett von der Stanford University. Seine Forschung an Gehirnimplantaten ermöglicht es bereits heute, „circa 60 nur im Kopf gesprochene Wörter pro Minute mit hoher Genauigkeit“ zu entschlüsseln. **In neuesten Studien konnte die Geschwindigkeit sogar auf bis zu 146 Wörter pro Minute gesteigert werden – ein Tempo, das einem natürlichen Gespräch entspricht.** Besonders kritisch ist hierbei die Rekonstruktion der sogenannten „inneren Sprache“: Die Technik erfasst auch Worte, „die gar nicht für die Außenwelt bestimmt sind“, was die Forscher bereits dazu zwang, Sicherheitsmechanismen wie einen Passwortschutz zu integrieren. 

**2. Der Übergang zur Massentechnologie​**

Während invasive Methoden (Implantate) derzeit primär schwer erkrankten Menschen vorbehalten sind, warnte Nataliya Kosmyna (MIT) vor einer massiven Ausweitung in den kommerziellen Bereich. Sie prognostiziert für den Markt der „Neuro-Wearables“ – also in Brillen oder Kopfhörer integrierte Sensoren – ein Volumen von fast 400 Milliarden US-Dollar bis 2030. Diese Geräte können bereits heute Aufmerksamkeit, Müdigkeit oder Verwirrung beim Lesen registrieren. Die Analyse zeigt, dass viele Szenarien, die die Öffentlichkeit noch für Science-Fiction hält, bereits „zu 70 bis 80 Prozent wissenschaftlich umsetzbar“ sind.

**3. Kritische Rekonstruktion: Überwachung und Integrität​**

Die ethische Problematik verschärft sich durch die Entwicklung kontaktloser Technologien. Daniel Strauss (Universität des Saarlandes) legte dar, dass mentale und emotionale Zustände wie Aufmerksamkeit oder Aufregung sogar über Ohrmuskelsignale oder kamerabasierte Methoden erfasst werden können. Dies führt zu einer doppelten Gefahr:

* Unbemerkte Überwachung: Maschinen könnten „empathischer“ werden, aber gleichzeitig eine ständige Beobachtung im Alltag ermöglichen.
* Verlust der kognitiven Autonomie: Wenn Neurotechnologien im privaten, beruflichen oder schulischen Alltag zur Leistungssteigerung (z. B. Konzentrationsmessung) eingesetzt werden, drohen weitreichende gesellschaftliche Folgen, vergleichbar mit der Verbreitung generativer KI.

**4. Regulatorische Konsequenzen​**

Die Sachverständigen des Ethikrates plädieren daher für eine proaktive Regulierung, um die „mentale Privatsphäre“ zu schützen. Es besteht die Sorge, dass Produkte ohne die strengen Auflagen klinischer Studien auf den Markt kommen, weshalb internationale Standards und ein gestaffeltes Kennzeichnungssystem für Verbraucher gefordert werden. Besonders kritisch wird die unzureichende Regulierung des Umgangs mit neuronalen Daten gesehen.

**Fazit**​

Die Analyse verdeutlicht, dass „Gedankenlesen“ keine ferne Utopie mehr ist, sondern eine technische Realität, die sich von der medizinischen Anwendung hin zu einer alltäglichen Verbrauchertechnologie entwickelt. Die kritische Herausforderung besteht darin, den medizinischen Nutzen (z. B. Kommunikation für Gelähmte) zu erhalten, ohne die menschliche Gedankenwelt für kommerzielle oder staatliche Überwachung preiszugeben.

# Kommentar:

Die Debatte im Ethikrat, in der Experten wie Frank Willett von Dekodierungsraten berichten, die einem „natürlichen Gespräch entsprechen“ (Infobrief, S. 10), entzieht den Skeptikern endgültig die Grundlage. Wer die Möglichkeit des Gedankenlesens prinzipiell ausschließen will, ignoriert die faktische Beweislast. Die Rekonstruktion der „inneren Sprache“ zeigt, dass die Barriere zwischen Subjekt und Außenwelt technisch gefallen ist. Damit wird deutlich: Die menschliche Würde und die „kognitive Freiheit“ (S. 11) sind nicht mehr durch biologische Unmöglichkeit geschützt, sondern hängen allein vom (oft fragwürdigen) politischen und rechtlichen Schutz ab. 

Die heutige Überraschung über die Machbarkeit wirkt geschichtsvergessen. Bereits in den 1970er Jahren leisteten Institute wie das SRI International (California) Pionierarbeit. Forscher wie [Lawrence Pinneo](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesTillyMatthews/comments/1cai6ai/1975_lawrence_pinneo_et_al_erste_offizielle/) publizierten schon 1975 über die computergestützte Analyse von EEG-Mustern zur Erkennung von Worten. Dass diese Forschung in der Nähe von Geheimdiensten und dem Militär (wie dem [WRAIR ](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesTillyMatthews/comments/1ffztue/mikrowellensprach%C3%BCbertragung_wie_sharp_und_grove/)– Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) stattfand, ist kein Zufall. [Projekte wie „SARA“ (etwa im Kontext von Dickhaut)](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesTillyMatthews/comments/1cfudtb/klassische_studien_zum_gedankenlesen_hier_1998_dr/) oder frühe Versuche zur „[Remote Neural Monitoring](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesTillyMatthews/comments/1csnxnv/die_fortschrittliche_technologie_des/)“ (RNM) legen nahe, dass die technische Machbarkeit der Fernauslesung von Hirnzuständen in geschlossenen Kreisen seit Jahrzehnten als gesichert gilt. Die aktuelle „Entdeckung“ durch den Mainstream ist somit eher eine langsame Deklassifizierung bereits existierenden Wissens. 

Während der Ethikrat primär über sichtbare Wearables und Implantate spricht, stellt sich die drängende Frage nach der verdeckten Anwendung. Die physikalische Möglichkeit, neuronale Prozesse mittels elektromagnetischer Wellen (z. B. modifizierte Radartechnik oder Mikrowellen) aus der Distanz zu erfassen, wird in der offiziellen Bioethik meist umschifft. Wenn jedoch – wie Daniel Strauss im Infobrief (S. 11) andeutet – bereits „kamerabasierte Methoden“ ausreichen, um emotionale Zustände zu detektieren, ist der Schritt zur Auswertung feinerer elektromagnetischer Signaturen des Gehirns mittels Radar im Bereich geheimdienstlicher Operationen nur logisch. 

Ein besonders dunkles Kapitel der Neuroethik ist die systematische Ignoranz gegenüber Berichten über technologische Folter. Es gibt weltweit zehntausende Zeugnisse von Menschen, die behaupten, Opfer von „Mind Control“-Technologien oder illegalen Experimenten zu sein. Bisher wurden diese Berichte fast ausnahmslos als psychiatrische Phänomene delegitimiert.

Kritische Rekonstruktion: Wenn die technologische Machbarkeit nun – wie im Infobrief 02/25 dokumentiert – offiziell bestätigt wird, verliert das Argument, technisches Gedankenlesen sei „technisch unmöglich“, seine Gültigkeit. Es entsteht eine moralische Bringschuld der Gesellschaft: Wenn Gedankenlesen nunmehr als möglich gilt und zwar in ausreichender Geschwindigkeit (in Echtzeit), ist auch der Missbrauch dieser Technik zur Folter und Überwachung faktisch möglich.

Die Grenze zwischen einer „Verschwörungstheorie“ und wissenschaftlicher Realität ist im Bereich der Neurotechnologie hauchdünn geworden. Die flächendeckende Überwachung der Gedankenwelt ist keine dystopische Warnung mehr, sondern eine technologische Option in einer Vielzahl von einst fiktionalen Szenarien, die heutzutage laut Experten bereits zu „70 bis 80 Prozent umsetzbar“ sind (Infobrief, S. 10).

Datenschutz und Menschenwürde stehen vor ihrer größten Prüfung: In einer Welt, in der das Gehirn direkt „adressierbar“ ist, gibt es kein Refugium mehr. Es ist zu hoffen, dass die nun einsetzende Transparenz im Mainstream dazu führt, dass auch die [Berichte und Rundschreiben ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s52ZutM5UCuHozwAxe-TgzCmTWsLTckP)über den illegalen Einsatz dieser Technologien endlich ernst genommen und die Vorwürfe des illegalen und illegitimen Einsatzes dieser Gedankenlese-Technologie unabhängig untersucht werden.

It seriously hurts my morale to hit 5,000 points for this week's leaper damage trial only to receive a padded stock.
2 Wolfpacks... For a padded stock... 

I am also having absolutely terrible luck with finding BPs in the wild, 3 keys on space port? 1 BP, Snaphook and Lance's Mixtape.
I have resorted to bartering loot to aquire meaningful, ""crucial"" BPs because the drop rate is so atrocious, I would have quit this game if I couldnt get my hands on them. 
Thankfully, my faith remains because I am not left behind the curve too much.

I also really feel like there is cursed code running to make certain items more rare during events.
Seriously, how can I find more snowglobes than a single coffee pot?

I want this post to reflect an honest, employed Raider. I love the story so far, the world building, the lore ... 
It's just hard sometimes when you get shot in the back of the head by a rat while farming bastion cells for your workbench, when you spawn 2 times in a row to a lush bloom and the round is 18 minutes remaining, or to blow through 3 keys and get less than 50,000 credits worth of loot...

The free tokens are appreciated, the Cavalier outfit looks great on my raider and I look forward to skins that deliver that ""tactical, but bespoke"" vibe just like it.

I want to wish both everyone at Embark and the community a happy holidays. Thank you for making this digital world for us to reclaim.

See you all top side.

1pu2p78,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pu2p78/my_girlfriends_family_isnt_human/,My Girlfriend's Family Isn't Human.,"James first noticed her on a Wednesday afternoon, when the light through the high windows of the café was slanted and golden, dust motes drifting in the beams like tiny dancers. He’d arrived early that day, hoping to claim the small corner table by the window for his music theory workbook and a large black coffee. The café was a comfortable jumble of mismatched chairs and tables, a gentle hum of conversation punctuated by the hiss of the espresso machine. As he stood in line, waiting for his drink, he saw her at the counter. 

Dark hair fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, catching the light in chestnut highlights. A pencil was tucked behind one ear, and she wore a moss-green trench coat that seemed improbably elegant for this corner of town—a coat that looked as if it were designed by a meticulous tailor, every seam purposeful, every fold intentional. He wondered what business someone so sharply dressed had in a bohemian coffee shop where most patrons wore paint-splattered jeans and flannel shirts.

She turned, perhaps in response to the barista’s question, and their eyes met. Her smile was crisp and immediate, as though she’d been ready to greet him all along. It was the sort of smile that could have been rehearsed—perfectly timed, flawlessly executed—but it also carried a soft warmth at the edges, like the flicker of a candle in a draft. He caught himself staring and looked away, heart suddenly pounding, but not before he noted the slow, deliberate way she stirred her latte, as if she were counting the rotations of the spoon, the way each swirl added a fraction of sweetness to the bitter coffee.

Carrying his own drink back to the table, he set his heavy textbook down and tried to open it to the study on Schenkerian analysis. The densely packed notation and commentary felt hostile, the tiny symbols arranged in a code that he struggled to decipher. Across the room, out of the corners of his eyes, he could still see her. She’d chosen a small round table by the pastry display, stood there for a moment, one foot slightly in front of the other, favoring her right leg as if it bore a secret weight. She peered at the croissants and danishes with an appraising gaze, but didn’t purchase anything—just sipped her coffee, black, no sugar, eyes moving over the glass case with a quiet intensity.

Once seated, she placed her phone, wallet, and green notebook on the tabletop, aligning them in a perfect row, as though about to perform delicate surgery. She opened the notebook and began to write, flipping pages with swift precision, a motion so brisk it reminded him of a librarian shelving books by the minute. He tried to concentrate on his personal studies, scanning over phrases like “tonal prolongation” and “voice-leading reductions,” but her presence at the far end of the café short-circuited his focus. The scratch of her pencil on paper, the almost inaudible rhythm of her writing, was more mesmerizing than any melody he’d ever studied.

When he came back on Thursday, at precisely the same time, he told himself she wouldn’t notice him. He parked at the same table, opened the same chapter, and settled into the same spiral of frustration and caffeine. But his resolve crumbled in moments when his eyes drifted across the room. She was there again, same trench coat, same posture, same methodical preparation of her workspace. He counted the number of pages she turned: fourteen. 

He noted the tilt of her head as she worked: six degrees off vertical. 

He observed the way she took a sip of coffee when she reached the conclusion of a page, pausing for perhaps three seconds before returning to her notes. He felt almost absurd, as though he were stalking her through algorithms and measurements.

On Friday he almost didn’t come. He told himself it was ridiculous to study at the same café every day, that the routine was too predictable, that she might feel spied upon. But by noon he found himself pushing open the door, inhaling the familiar scent of roasted beans, and making a beeline for his table. As he settled in, his hands trembled just slightly as he opened his book, and for a moment he considered closing it and simply leaving. But then he noticed her beyond the counter, the slight crease in her brow as she jotted notes at top speed, and he was anchored.

It was the third afternoon in a week that he’d seen her there when she rose from her chair and began walking toward him. His heart seized in his chest because he was certain she had not, until that moment, deigned to look at him directly. She carried her latte in one hand, her notebook in the other, her composure immaculate. She paused at his table without hesitation, as if she belonged there, as if she’d been plotting this encounter since Monday. Her eyes flicked to the empty chair across from him and then to his face, wholly unblinking.

“Mind if I sit?” she asked, gesturing at the chair. Her voice was calm, unhurried, but there was a sparkle of amusement in her tone, as if she already knew the answer.

He glanced down at his unremarkable shirt, the slight coffee ring he’d just uncovered on the tabletop, the stubby pencil in his backpack, and felt a rush of self-consciousness. 

“Go ahead,” he said, his voice softer than he intended.

She slid into the chair and set her notebooks in place once more. Up close, her eyes were the exact shade of her coat—deep moss-green flecked with warm brown. Her beauty was striking in a classical way: a Roman nose, high cheekbones that cast delicate shadows, lips that seemed sculpted to rest in a thoughtful line when she wasn’t smiling. Yet there was a restless energy about her, a barely contained fervor that made her seem less like a film star from the silent era and more like someone on the brink of revelation.

“I’m Mary,” she said, extending a hand across the table. Her nails were short, practical, but her fingers were long and tapered, surprisingly elegant.

He stood and shook her hand, caught off guard by its firm grip. “James,” he replied. “Nice to meet you.”

She held his hand for a moment longer than necessary, then released it and placed her notebook between them. She leaned forward, elbows lightly resting on the edge of the table. “I’ve seen you here a few times.”

He tried to appear nonchalant, but he could feel his face warming. “Yeah, I come here to study on my own time.” He tucked a stray lock of hair behind his ear. “But honestly, I don’t remember seeing you before.”

Her smile widened, a quick curve of her lips that suggested she found his discomfort amusing. “I would have remembered you,” she said simply. Then she flipped open her notebook and began to read, eyes scanning the page.

Embarrassment washed over him, and he tried to look back at his book, but the text was now a blur. The scratch of her pencil as she annotated her page was oddly hypnotic. She paused occasionally to chew the end of her eraser, her brow furrowing in concentration. At last, she snapped the notebook shut and looked up with an intensity that startled him.

“Do you always read music theory in public?” she asked.

James blinked. “How did you—?”

She tapped the spine of his open textbook, which he’d subconsciously tried to hide with his hand. “You were air-conducting measures eight through twelve,” she said, “and humming very softly under your breath.”

He laughed, a short, startled sound. “I didn’t even realize.”

She leaned back, crossing one leg over the other gracefully. 

“It’s endearing,” she said. Her tone was gentle, teasing, and he felt a rush of relief and pleasure. “Makes you look absorbed.”

He rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry. I guess I got carried away.”

“That’s fine,” she said. “Tell me something about yourself, James.”

He hesitated, surprised by the directness of her question. “Like… what?”

Her head tilted to one side, as if appraising him from every possible angle. “Anything. Where are you from? Why music theory? What’s your least favorite chord progression?”

He snorted, running a hand through his hair. “Least favorite chord progression? That’s a new one. Let’s see… I’d say a plagal cadence in the middle of a sonata. It feels like a stuck elevator. I just study music for myself, during free time. It’s relaxing. It’s not that serious.”

She laughed, smooth and clear. “A stuck elevator,” she repeated, jotting down the phrase in her notebook. She paused, looking up at him, her eyes alight. “Tell me more.”

So he did. He told her about growing up in a small Midwestern town where the only music beyond church choir was the radio. He spoke of his first encounter with Bach in the public library’s dusty record section. He described his fascination with patterns in sound, harmonic overtones, and the secret logic of tonal relationships. As he talked, she sketched little diagrams in the margin of her notebook—arrows, circles, a tiny cartoon face each time he made a joke. He found himself talking faster, exhaling tension he hadn’t known he carried. When he finally paused, breathless, Mary looked at him as though she were tasting his words, weighing them.

“That’s fascinating,” she said. “You should be teaching this.”

He waved a hand. “I’m not that good.”

“Humility,” she nodded approvingly, then tapped her pencil twice against the tabletop. “But what about your actual background? Family? Siblings?”

He cleared his throat. “I’m an only child,” he said. “Parents still live back home. I haven’t been to see them in a while.”

“Why’s that?” She sounded genuinely curious.

“Busy,” he shrugged, though it felt inadequate. “I just finished school, work… I guess I’m avoiding the road trip.”

She wrote down ‘Aversion to road trips’ in her notebook and looked at him with a smile. “I see.”

They talked for another half hour—about favorite composers, worst practice sessions, the kind of music that makes your teeth ache when it’s too loud. When his phone buzzed with a reminder for his part-time job shift, he realized they’d been talking for nearly an hour. She glanced at her watch and closed her notebook with a decisive snap.

“Well,” she said, standing, “I’ll see you around.”

He managed a nod, too dazzled to find his voice. She gathered her things and walked away, leaving him with his open textbook, which suddenly looked like a door to a world he no longer found intimidating.

The next day, he arrived at the café well before noon, desperate to reserve the table where they’d spoken. He saw her already there, her thermos of homemade chai steaming beside her notebook. She looked up, caught his eye, and held out a small cup toward him. “Chai?” she asked.

He blinked. “You made this?”

“Early morning project,” she said with a smile, as though making chai were as routine as tying her shoes. “Thought you might like a change from coffee.”

He accepted the cup, inhaling the spicy aroma of cardamom and cinnamon. “I do,” he said, sipping carefully. “It’s perfect.”

She watched him for a moment, then turned back to her notebook. He settled into his chair, opened his book, and was halfway through a Roman numeral analysis when she leaned over and whispered, “Try this instead.” 

She tapped his page where he’d misidentified a dominant preparation. She didn’t scold; she simply guided his pencil to the correct spot, drawing a small star above the chord. Her fingertips brushed his hand in the process, and heat bloomed on his skin.

They met in the same way the next day, and the next. Each time, she asked questions—sometimes about music, sometimes about his life outside the café—and transcribed his answers. He began to look forward to her arrival more than the music theory itself. She had an uncanny sense of his schedule—knowing exactly when he needed a sugar boost or a distraction. She’d produce a flaky almond croissant or a dark chocolate square right at the moment he was about to sigh in defeat over his homework.

Yet for all her attentiveness, she herself remained a mystery. When James tried to learn more about her, she skated around details. She said she was from the East Coast but never specified a state. She mentioned “project work” that involved travel and deadlines, but never elaborated. Occasionally, she’d talk about her young son, but only in fleeting references—a photograph she slipped from her wallet, a half-smile when she mentioned his laughter. She described him as though he were both her greatest joy and an enigma, and James found himself aching to know more but hesitant to push.

For weeks, James’s dreams clattered with imagery: Mary walking through endless corridors, Mary peeling off a mask only to reveal another, Mary singing songs in languages he didn’t know. He woke to the memory of her hands on his skin, her voice in his ear, and always that sense of standing on a threshold. He wanted to know her, and sometimes he convinced himself that he already did. But the current of uncertainty, the suspicion of an inner sanctum untouched by his presence, never fully faded.

Then, on a breezy Thursday evening, Mary rang his phone. He’d just settled onto the threadbare couch in his tiny living room, the light of a single lamp casting long shadows against the peeling wallpaper. When he answered, her voice came softly, almost abruptly: 

“I’d like you to meet my family.” 

It landed in his ear as though it were a casual remark—no buildup, no preamble, no sense of occasion. Just those seven words, matter-of-fact and unadorned. He paused, thumb hovering over the end-call button. 

“Meet your family?” he repeated, voice level but surprised. “Is there… some special reason?” 

She laughed quietly, a sound that carried a trace of warmth. 

“Not at all,” she said. “My son’s home from school early, and I think—well, I think you’d get along. He’s really open-minded.” Then, almost as an afterthought: “You can meet my uncle and grandfather, too. They’re a little… eccentric, but you’ll see they’re harmless.”

He felt the weight of the invitation settle over him. He and Mary had been seeing each other for several weeks: dinners at hole-in-the-wall diners, long walks in the park where she’d talk about her childhood in veiled terms, coffee dates that slipped into twilight. But a family meeting felt like a milestone he hadn’t anticipated. Still, he agreed—you don’t refuse an invitation like that—and he heard her relief in the soft exhale on the other end. 

They set the time: 6:30 p.m. Friday.

—

When Friday evening rolled around, he dressed carefully—dark slacks, a button-down shirt, shoes polished just enough to shine under the overhead light. He checked his reflection in the hallway mirror, fidgeted with his collar, then waited by the door. At exactly 6:15, Mary pulled up in her hatchback, the engine humming quietly. She wore a navy windbreaker and her hair was pulled back in a loose bun. She popped the door open with a wide grin. “Hop in,” she said. He slid into the passenger seat. 

The interior was immaculate, as if she’d wiped every surface with disinfectant moments before: the dashboard gleamed, the upholstery looked untouched, and not a single fingerprint marred the center console. She buckled her seat belt and offered him one. 

“Buckle up,” she teased. “It’s only a short drive.”

As Mary steered the car through the city streets, he watched her profile in the side window: the curve of her nose, the way her brow furrowed slightly when she focused on the road, the subtle glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes. She talked about her son discreetly, always referring to him as “the kid.” She described him in broad strokes: curious about history, loves building model airplanes, can’t get enough of jazz records. 

James noticed that she kept changing the things he was into and specific details about him.

She never used his name. He tried to press her, but she said she’d tell him at dinner. Then she dropped another fragment of her past: her mother had died when she was young, and afterward her uncle and grandfather stepped in. 

“They raised me,” she said, voice a shade colder. “In their own way.”

He listened, leaning back in his seat, eyes flicking to the passing storefronts. He realized she spoke of that time almost clinically—no emotions attached, just facts arranged like set pieces. As she piloted them out of the downtown grid and onto quieter suburban avenues, the streetlights thinned and the air took on a scent of freshly mown lawns and distant barbecue smoke.

They came to rest in front of a squat, single-story house at the far edge of a cul-de-sac. The neighborhood was still: no voices, no cars, only the faint chirp of crickets. The front lawn had been mowed in impossibly straight lines, each stripe alternating between emerald and lime, as though the grass itself participated in some secret code. A single porch light flickered, casting an amber glow across the painted wooden steps. Mary parked, turned off the ignition, and sat for a moment. She reached over and gave his hand a quick squeeze—hard enough to be felt, brief enough to be cryptic. He swallowed, climbed out, and followed her up the porch steps.

Inside, the first thing that struck him was the sound: deep, rolling laughter, punctuated by occasional whoops, echoing from somewhere down a long hallway. The walls seemed to shimmer with it, as though the house itself were alive. The second thing was the décor. From floor to ceiling, the narrow foyer was plastered with collages of magazine clippings—faces from decades of television and pop culture. There was Lucille Ball doing her trademark double take; there was Rowan and Martin’s gang of Laugh-In comic rebels; there were the beaming visages of late-night hosts, frozen in mid-grin behind mustaches and suspenders. The effect was dizzying: a hall of mirrors, minus the glass.

He stepped gingerly over a patterned runner rug and into the living room, which looked more like a museum exhibit than a home. Shelves groaned under the weight of VHS tapes, their spines bearing titles that ranged from Mary Tyler Moore to The Cosby Show. In one corner, a stack of old TV Guide issues was meticulously arranged by year, as if someone expected a time traveler to drop by and ask for the premiere date of I Dream of Jeannie. A knitted afghan with Technicolor stripes was draped over a well-worn sofa, the bright yarns still vivid against the muted upholstery. The room smelled faintly of popcorn and dust—and something else: nostalgia, for times you’d never lived through.

In the far corner, under a small tube-style television perched on a rickety stand, sat a man hunched in an armchair. He wore a faded denim jacket, suspenders that had frayed edges, and a battered felt hat that looked like it had seen twenty summers. On the screen, The Beverly Hillbillies played in all its canned-laughter glory, and the old man laughed along in perfect sync—deep laughter that shook his shoulders each time the prerecorded guffaws played. 

He slapped his knee and barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” so loud it nearly drowned out the track.

Mary cleared her throat. The old man waved a hand at them without turning his head. His voice rang out in a drawl that could have been lifted straight from the Ozarks: 

“Don’t mind me, folks! Just watchin’ my stories.”

James took a careful step forward, offering his hand. The old man finally swivelled his head—silver hair shining under the lamp—and fixed him with a bright, curious stare. 

“Name’s Joe,” the old man announced, standing up so quickly that the chair groaned in protest. “You hungry, son?” 

He pointed toward an open doorway that led to a kitchen where the smell of roasting meat drifted out.

James gave Mary a quizzical look. Mary managed a small smile. 

“That,” she said softly, “is my grandfather.”

He tried to keep his tone light as he replied, 

“It’s very nice to meet you, name’s James.” 

But the old man didn’t drop the character. He tipped his hat and winked. 

“Pleased to meet you, too,” he said. Then he lowered his voice conspiratorially: “Have you ever tried cornbread with honey butter? I reckon I can fix you up right.”

As Mary guided James deeper into the living room—past a glass display case full of battered black-and-white photographs of unrecognizable actors—he realized something curious: Joe’s eyes, though twinkling and jovial, were sharp. They were eyes accustomed to reading people, measuring them, placing them on some private scale. James wondered briefly whether Joe was playing a part or simply refused to break character. Was it dementia? A lifelong performance? Or a conscious choice to live permanently in the world of his favorite shows?

Then, Mary steered him toward the dining room. There, a middle-aged man in a wide-lapelled suit sat at the table with his hands tented under his chin. He had perfectly coiffed hair and a smile that radiated yellow charisma. When James entered, the man leaned forward and said, “Top five answers on the board: What brings you here tonight?” 

There was a pause, then uproarious self-laughter.

This, evidently, was the uncle. He introduced himself as “Richard,” and the handshake that followed felt like a game-show challenge. Richard’s every movement, every turn of phrase, seemed lifted from Family Feud reruns. When James hesitated to answer a question, the uncle would pound the table and shout, 

“Survey says—!” as if an invisible crowd were keeping score.

James tried to laugh it off, but as the dinner unfolded he became increasingly aware of the collages on the walls: everywhere, television faces, pasted together in surreal, overlapping mosaics. There were mashups of cartoon characters with news anchors. There were eyes cut from one actor and glued onto the face of another. It was an unnerving, obsessive display. The more James noticed, the more he realized that the entire house was curated to resemble a set—a simulation of family life as broadcast to the world, complete with a sizzle reel of canned laughter and familiar punchlines.

That was the moment when, through a jitter of nerves and cheap wine, James remembered the questions Mary had been peppering him with since their first night together: What was the best sitcom episode of all time? What television moment, if any, had genuinely made him weep? Had he ever, growing up, imagined himself as another person for days at a time—inhabiting not only their voice but their gestures, their appetites, their secret hopes? It had seemed a harmless quirk at first, this “twenty questions” game, but now the memory of it snagged at him like an unfinished thread.

He remembered how, lying together in the sweaty hush after sex, Mary would go suddenly serious. She’d look up at him with those impossible eyes, and ask whether he felt, deep down, that he was always pretending—a man performing the role of himself, never quite able to believe his own lines. 

“Do you ever wish you could just… slip out of character?” she’d said once, tracing lazy circles on his chest. “Like, be someone entirely new for a day?”

Back then he’d laughed, chalking it up to the late hour and the heady aftermath of orgasms. 

Of course I do, he’d said, not really meaning it. 

Doesn’t everyone?

Now, sitting at the dinner table with the two men—game show uncle and sitcom grandfather—James felt as though he were living inside a dream crafted from Mary’s questions and obsessions. Even the food was staged: TV-dinner trays, mashed potatoes piped into perfect swirls, green beans a uniform shade of radioactive emerald. The glasses were filled with grape Kool-Aid, which neither uncle nor grandfather drank. When James tried to take a sip, the uncle leaned forward, winked, and said, 

“Survey says—!” as if any movement required its own laugh track.

He looked at Mary. She was unfazed by the spectacle, cutting her meatloaf into precise cubes and eating each one with the deliberation of an astronaut. Every now and then she would toss James a look of such perfect composure it made him uneasy. It wasn’t just that she was calm in the presence of family weirdness; it was that she seemed to be waiting for something, as though the night were a game designed for his benefit and she was silently willing him to keep playing along.

His mind did what it always did under stress: it cataloged. He began to tally the oddities, assembling them into a taxonomy of the uncanny. The old man’s laughter, which always landed a fraction of a second too late, as if he were listening to a delayed feed. The uncle’s hands, which never trembled or fidgeted, but held every gesture in a freeze-frame of perfect, almost plastic stillness. Even the family photos on the wall were wrong: in every snapshot, the faces smiled too widely, the pupils caught by the camera in a way that made them look painted on.

James tried to tell himself that this was just what happened to families after too much television and too few other interests—a kind of arrested development, harmless enough if you squinted. But then he looked at the place settings: four plates, four sets of utensils. 

He realized, with a start, that he hadn’t seen Mary’s son all night. She’d spoken of him so often that James had expected the kid to be orbiting, a minor planet in the family system, sneaking into the fridge or playing video games in the den. He glanced toward the hallway, where a closed door pulsed with the flicker of television light.

Mary caught his gaze and smiled. 

“He’s just finishing his homework,” she said, as if reading his mind. “He’ll join us soon.”

He nodded, but the words rattled in his head. Homework? On a Friday night, after nine o’clock? And still, the silence behind the door was thick and total—no clack of keyboard, no muttered complaints, not even the telltale hum of animation. He tried to imagine what kind of child Anthony must be, living in the shadow of such extravagant family theater. Was he a fellow mimic, a prodigy of imitation? Or, perversely, a total blank, a kid so unformed that his family’s personalities had simply washed over him, leaving nothing behind?

The question occupied James as the meal progressed. He picked at his food, mostly out of politeness, and filled the gaps in conversation with stories from his own childhood—his mother’s soup recipes, his father’s penchant for crossword puzzles and Jeopardy reruns. The uncle lapped up these anecdotes, responding to every detail with a ready-made game show catchphrase, while the grandfather simply nodded and occasionally barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” 

It began to dawn on James that neither man had once asked him a direct question about himself; it was as if their exchange was governed by a script, one in which the visitor’s purpose was simply to produce more lines for the canned laughter to punctuate.

Eventually, Mary stood up from the table, wiped her mouth on a paper napkin, and said, “I’ll go get Anthony.” 

She left the room with a lightness that seemed almost performative, as if she were stepping out for a commercial break. James listened to her footsteps recede down the hallway, then disappear behind the closed door.

He sat in the sudden quiet, feeling the eyes of both men settle on him. The uncle smiled, his teeth bared in a game show host’s approximation of warmth. 

“So, James,” he said, “what’s your final answer?”

James hesitated, then shrugged. “About what?”

The uncle looked at the grandfather, who cackled and said, “You should always lock in your answer, son. That’s the secret.”

For a moment, James wondered if this was some kind of elaborate hazing ritual—an initiation for boyfriends, a test of how much weirdness one could endure before bolting. He tried to play along, even as his skin prickled with the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, measured against an invisible yardstick.

Mary returned to the dining room slowly, her left hand curled gently around the slender wrist of a boy who trailed beside her like a ghost in an old photograph.

“This is Anthony,” she announced in a voice bright as a bell, though something about her inflection carried an undertow—half pride, half relief, perhaps. 

James blinked twice, then stared hard at the child. Anthony was dressed in a style so distinctly antiquated it might have belonged in a dusty black-and-white rerun: a crisp white collared shirt neatly buttoned to the throat, short pleated pants that ended just above the knees, knee-high socks folded with mathematical precision, and polished leather shoes that gleamed under the overhead chandelier. His dark hair was slicked back in a rigid wave that betrayed not a single stray strand. It was as though someone had taken a snapshot from the 1950s and slid it into the present moment with impossible clarity.

But it was Anthony’s face that froze James’s gaze. It bore none of the hallmarks James had mentally sketched when Mary first spoke of her son: no soft baby fat around the cheeks, no tentative, gap-toothed smile, none of the tentative shyness or mischievous glimmer in the eyes that mark the presence of a living child. Instead, Anthony’s features were drawn tight, as though the skin had been stretched across a carved wooden mask. His jaw was firm, unmoving. His eyes were unblinking, wide and luminous—as if two polished marbles had somehow been installed in place of irises, each reflecting the chandelier’s glow with disconcerting precision.

He moved with an odd, mechanical rigidity, every motion deliberate, almost rehearsed. When Mary guided him toward a chair at the long, varnished table, Anthony pivoted at the hips and sat down with his back absolutely straight, both feet planted flat on the hardwood floor. His hands folded exactly at the center of his lap, thumbs touching. He did not fidget. He did not glance around the room. He simply stared at James, as though he meant to examine and memorize every one of his features—the curve of his nose, the set of his eyebrows, the slight tremble in his lower lip.

Mary smiled at the boy, then turned back to James.

“This is James,” she said gently. “He’s a guest tonight.”

Anthony offered a slight nod and spoke in a voice that resonated far deeper than James would have expected from someone so slight in stature.

“Nice to meet you, James.” The words emerged with a hollow echo, as though they’d been recorded in an empty chamber and replayed. It sounded practiced, rehearsed in front of a mirror until each syllable had been polished smooth.

James forced himself to respond with a courteous smile. “Nice to meet you too. How was your homework today?”

Anthony paused, blinked twice in the slow, deliberate fashion that now set James’s nerves on edge, and said evenly,

“It was easy. I like numbers.” He added a quick, efficient grin, but it failed to touch his eyes, which remained locked on James’s face in unrelenting scrutiny.

Mary beamed at her son, as though proud of a performance well executed, then shot James a sideways look that seemed to say plainly: See? Nothing strange at all. Don’t worry.

But James’s heart thudded in his chest. Everything about the boy was strange. Anthony’s head seemed slightly oversized for his small body, the pale skin so unnaturally smooth that it looked almost translucent—like unbaked dough stretched thin. He seemed far too rigid, too perfect, too aware. James realized with a queasy pang that he had no real sense of how old Anthony was meant to be. Mary had spoken of him in vague terms—“very bright for his age,” “a bit shy,” “still adjusting”—but none of that matched the silent, intense figure now sitting opposite him, hands folded, eyes fixed.

As the adults around the table began to serve themselves—scooping roast, heaping potatoes, ladling gravy—the boy’s gaze never wavered. He didn’t glance at the roast or at the china plates. He watched James. With relentless precision, he followed every dip of James’s fork toward the plate, every hesitant swallow, until James felt compelled to drop his eyes or risk meeting that unblinking stare.

Mary bent forward, placing a dish of stringy green beans on the table. “Anthony, did you get a chance to finish that library book I asked about?” she prompted, her tone cooing, motherly.

“It’s finished,” he replied without hesitation. “I read every page. The themes were… enlightening.” His voice was even, almost monotonal. He did not offer any further elaboration. He did not squirm in his seat. He did not wipe his mouth or show any hunger for approval. He simply awaited the next cue.

Mary exchanged a quick glance with James, as though reassuring him that everything was under control. “Wonderful,” she said. “And how about recess? Did you play any games with Linh or Mikey today?”

Anthony’s eyes flicked to Mary, then to James, then back to Mary, as though downloading the question before delivering the answer.

“I played tag with Linh,” he said. “I do not mind tag. I do prefer puzzles.” He allowed himself the merest twitch of a grin that curled the corners of his mouth upward—in his mind, perhaps, an adequate approximation of a child’s enthusiasm.

The adults at the other end of the table chattered on—Uncle Richard scoffing at the soggy texture of the roast, Grandfather Joe drifting in and out of awareness, nodding at intervals as though caught between slumber and wakefulness. But all the while, the low hum of an unseen laugh track permeated the room, a relentless undercurrent of canned mirth. 

James’s stomach lurched. He turned his head to the den’s open doorway: there, a flatscreen nestled in the wall played an old sitcom rerun, its laugh track booming through hidden speakers. Private chuckles, canned applause, belly laughs—all timed to perfection, an absurd double soundtrack to the real conversation.

Anthony did not react to the laughter. He didn’t acknowledge it, didn’t flinch. As though oblivious to it, he continued to study James. Every so often, he would lift his eyes from the table and hold James’s gaze in a way that felt unnerving, like a camera lens zooming in too close.

James cleared his throat and tried another subject. “What about television? Ever watch anything you enjoy?”

The boy’s expression flickered—a fraction of a second—then settled.

“I don’t watch television,” he intoned. “It’s not real.” He paused, looked up at Mary, then added,

“Would you say that, Mother?”

Mary’s face remained serene. She offered only the slightest nod, as if granting permission for that answer and accepting it as complete. She did not push him to elaborate or soften his tone.

James swallowed hard, trying to force a forkful of gluey mashed potatoes down his throat. Each bite lodged in his chest like rotting wood. The potatoes were cold and pasty. The gravy was sickly sweet, almost plastic in flavor. The roast was charred at the edges but still raw at its center, bleeding a thin, glistening liquid into the gravy. Even the green beans tasted of nothing but metal.

He glanced around the table. Uncle Richard, laughing along with the sitcom, pounded his fist on the table in perfect sync with the recorded guffaws. Grandfather Joe, blinking slow and heavy as if waking from a dream, would crack a smile—just for the punchline—and then slump forward again, eyes closing. Mary offered polite bites and soft murmurs of encouragement to everyone else. But Anthony never lifted a morsel to his mouth. He sat, his posture ceremonial, his eyes locked on James, as though waiting for something to happen.

Conversation turned to holiday plans—Mary’s plans to take Anthony to the zoo next week, the possibility of a family outing to the mountains. Anthony answered each question with the same clipped cadence, hinting at interest but never showing any real excitement. When Mary asked if he looked forward to seeing the penguins, he simply tilted his head and said, “Penguins are… aquatic birds. I have read about them.” Then he offered a swift nod, and his gaze returned immediately to James.

After what felt like an eternity, James realized his water glass was empty. He reached for it, but it had somehow slipped entirely out of reach. He shifted, saw the glass sitting untouched at his place setting—empty, exactly where it had begun. He hadn’t sipped at it once since the meal began. He realized then that he’d been so absorbed by the boy’s eerie stillness, by the canned laughter echoing off the walls, by the grotesque parody of a family dinner unfolding around him, that he’d almost forgotten to eat or drink. Panic fluttered in his chest.

He looked at Mary, who gave him a gentle, apologetic smile and poured him more water. 

“Here you go,” she said, handing him the glass. But even the water tasted off, as though filtered through some metallic, rusty pipe.

Anthony, sensing perhaps a shift in the room’s energy, blinked twice in his deliberate fashion and spoke without preamble. 

“May I be excused?” His voice was calm, utterly devoid of childish hesitancy.

Mary glanced at the clock on the wall—silent, ticking—then nodded. “Of course. Why don’t you go read in the den for a bit?” she suggested.

The boy rose with the same precision he’d used to sit, pivoting on his heels, then walked toward the den without so much as a backward glance. As he passed James, the faintest scent of something—chalk? Sterile plastic?—wafted from him, a fleeting odor that dissolved in the air almost as soon as it touched James’s nostrils.

James exhaled slowly, as though releasing a held breath he hadn’t been conscious of. Mary returned her attention to him, concerned about softening her smile. 

“Are you alright?” she asked.

He nodded, unable to form words. The silent weight of Anthony’s presence still lingered in the room, a cold, calculated impression. Uncle Richard let out another laugh in perfect time with the television, Grandfather Joe stirred, and Mary resumed her small talk.

But James could think only of that pale-faced boy in a vintage schoolboy uniform, sitting motionless at his mother’s table, watching him with unblinking eyes, as if calculating and cataloging every detail. And James knew, with an unsettling certainty, that he would never unsee the astonishing precision of Anthony’s performance—nor unhear the faint, mechanical echo in his voice.

The conversation, if it could be called that, soon turned. It was as if the entire family had conspired to shift the spotlight onto him, to excavate his past and dissect it for entertainment.

Richard opened with the easy stuff, the ""Tell us about yourself, James!"" line. But it quickly devolved into a barrage of questions so intimate and oddly specific that James found himself stumbling, caught off-guard by how much they already seemed to know.

1pu2ogb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pu2ogb/my_girlfriends_family_isnt_human/,My Girlfriend's Family Isn't Human.,"James first noticed her on a Wednesday afternoon, when the light through the high windows of the café was slanted and golden, dust motes drifting in the beams like tiny dancers. He’d arrived early that day, hoping to claim the small corner table by the window for his music theory workbook and a large black coffee. The café was a comfortable jumble of mismatched chairs and tables, a gentle hum of conversation punctuated by the hiss of the espresso machine. As he stood in line, waiting for his drink, he saw her at the counter. 

Dark hair fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, catching the light in chestnut highlights. A pencil was tucked behind one ear, and she wore a moss-green trench coat that seemed improbably elegant for this corner of town—a coat that looked as if it were designed by a meticulous tailor, every seam purposeful, every fold intentional. He wondered what business someone so sharply dressed had in a bohemian coffee shop where most patrons wore paint-splattered jeans and flannel shirts.

She turned, perhaps in response to the barista’s question, and their eyes met. Her smile was crisp and immediate, as though she’d been ready to greet him all along. It was the sort of smile that could have been rehearsed—perfectly timed, flawlessly executed—but it also carried a soft warmth at the edges, like the flicker of a candle in a draft. He caught himself staring and looked away, heart suddenly pounding, but not before he noted the slow, deliberate way she stirred her latte, as if she were counting the rotations of the spoon, the way each swirl added a fraction of sweetness to the bitter coffee.

Carrying his own drink back to the table, he set his heavy textbook down and tried to open it to the study on Schenkerian analysis. The densely packed notation and commentary felt hostile, the tiny symbols arranged in a code that he struggled to decipher. Across the room, out of the corners of his eyes, he could still see her. She’d chosen a small round table by the pastry display, stood there for a moment, one foot slightly in front of the other, favoring her right leg as if it bore a secret weight. She peered at the croissants and danishes with an appraising gaze, but didn’t purchase anything—just sipped her coffee, black, no sugar, eyes moving over the glass case with a quiet intensity.

Once seated, she placed her phone, wallet, and green notebook on the tabletop, aligning them in a perfect row, as though about to perform delicate surgery. She opened the notebook and began to write, flipping pages with swift precision, a motion so brisk it reminded him of a librarian shelving books by the minute. He tried to concentrate on his personal studies, scanning over phrases like “tonal prolongation” and “voice-leading reductions,” but her presence at the far end of the café short-circuited his focus. The scratch of her pencil on paper, the almost inaudible rhythm of her writing, was more mesmerizing than any melody he’d ever studied.

When he came back on Thursday, at precisely the same time, he told himself she wouldn’t notice him. He parked at the same table, opened the same chapter, and settled into the same spiral of frustration and caffeine. But his resolve crumbled in moments when his eyes drifted across the room. She was there again, same trench coat, same posture, same methodical preparation of her workspace. He counted the number of pages she turned: fourteen. 

He noted the tilt of her head as she worked: six degrees off vertical. 

He observed the way she took a sip of coffee when she reached the conclusion of a page, pausing for perhaps three seconds before returning to her notes. He felt almost absurd, as though he were stalking her through algorithms and measurements.

On Friday he almost didn’t come. He told himself it was ridiculous to study at the same café every day, that the routine was too predictable, that she might feel spied upon. But by noon he found himself pushing open the door, inhaling the familiar scent of roasted beans, and making a beeline for his table. As he settled in, his hands trembled just slightly as he opened his book, and for a moment he considered closing it and simply leaving. But then he noticed her beyond the counter, the slight crease in her brow as she jotted notes at top speed, and he was anchored.

It was the third afternoon in a week that he’d seen her there when she rose from her chair and began walking toward him. His heart seized in his chest because he was certain she had not, until that moment, deigned to look at him directly. She carried her latte in one hand, her notebook in the other, her composure immaculate. She paused at his table without hesitation, as if she belonged there, as if she’d been plotting this encounter since Monday. Her eyes flicked to the empty chair across from him and then to his face, wholly unblinking.

“Mind if I sit?” she asked, gesturing at the chair. Her voice was calm, unhurried, but there was a sparkle of amusement in her tone, as if she already knew the answer.

He glanced down at his unremarkable shirt, the slight coffee ring he’d just uncovered on the tabletop, the stubby pencil in his backpack, and felt a rush of self-consciousness. 

“Go ahead,” he said, his voice softer than he intended.

She slid into the chair and set her notebooks in place once more. Up close, her eyes were the exact shade of her coat—deep moss-green flecked with warm brown. Her beauty was striking in a classical way: a Roman nose, high cheekbones that cast delicate shadows, lips that seemed sculpted to rest in a thoughtful line when she wasn’t smiling. Yet there was a restless energy about her, a barely contained fervor that made her seem less like a film star from the silent era and more like someone on the brink of revelation.

“I’m Mary,” she said, extending a hand across the table. Her nails were short, practical, but her fingers were long and tapered, surprisingly elegant.

He stood and shook her hand, caught off guard by its firm grip. “James,” he replied. “Nice to meet you.”

She held his hand for a moment longer than necessary, then released it and placed her notebook between them. She leaned forward, elbows lightly resting on the edge of the table. “I’ve seen you here a few times.”

He tried to appear nonchalant, but he could feel his face warming. “Yeah, I come here to study on my own time.” He tucked a stray lock of hair behind his ear. “But honestly, I don’t remember seeing you before.”

Her smile widened, a quick curve of her lips that suggested she found his discomfort amusing. “I would have remembered you,” she said simply. Then she flipped open her notebook and began to read, eyes scanning the page.

Embarrassment washed over him, and he tried to look back at his book, but the text was now a blur. The scratch of her pencil as she annotated her page was oddly hypnotic. She paused occasionally to chew the end of her eraser, her brow furrowing in concentration. At last, she snapped the notebook shut and looked up with an intensity that startled him.

“Do you always read music theory in public?” she asked.

James blinked. “How did you—?”

She tapped the spine of his open textbook, which he’d subconsciously tried to hide with his hand. “You were air-conducting measures eight through twelve,” she said, “and humming very softly under your breath.”

He laughed, a short, startled sound. “I didn’t even realize.”

She leaned back, crossing one leg over the other gracefully. 

“It’s endearing,” she said. Her tone was gentle, teasing, and he felt a rush of relief and pleasure. “Makes you look absorbed.”

He rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry. I guess I got carried away.”

“That’s fine,” she said. “Tell me something about yourself, James.”

He hesitated, surprised by the directness of her question. “Like… what?”

Her head tilted to one side, as if appraising him from every possible angle. “Anything. Where are you from? Why music theory? What’s your least favorite chord progression?”

He snorted, running a hand through his hair. “Least favorite chord progression? That’s a new one. Let’s see… I’d say a plagal cadence in the middle of a sonata. It feels like a stuck elevator. I just study music for myself, during free time. It’s relaxing. It’s not that serious.”

She laughed, smooth and clear. “A stuck elevator,” she repeated, jotting down the phrase in her notebook. She paused, looking up at him, her eyes alight. “Tell me more.”

So he did. He told her about growing up in a small Midwestern town where the only music beyond church choir was the radio. He spoke of his first encounter with Bach in the public library’s dusty record section. He described his fascination with patterns in sound, harmonic overtones, and the secret logic of tonal relationships. As he talked, she sketched little diagrams in the margin of her notebook—arrows, circles, a tiny cartoon face each time he made a joke. He found himself talking faster, exhaling tension he hadn’t known he carried. When he finally paused, breathless, Mary looked at him as though she were tasting his words, weighing them.

“That’s fascinating,” she said. “You should be teaching this.”

He waved a hand. “I’m not that good.”

“Humility,” she nodded approvingly, then tapped her pencil twice against the tabletop. “But what about your actual background? Family? Siblings?”

He cleared his throat. “I’m an only child,” he said. “Parents still live back home. I haven’t been to see them in a while.”

“Why’s that?” She sounded genuinely curious.

“Busy,” he shrugged, though it felt inadequate. “I just finished school, work… I guess I’m avoiding the road trip.”

She wrote down ‘Aversion to road trips’ in her notebook and looked at him with a smile. “I see.”

They talked for another half hour—about favorite composers, worst practice sessions, the kind of music that makes your teeth ache when it’s too loud. When his phone buzzed with a reminder for his part-time job shift, he realized they’d been talking for nearly an hour. She glanced at her watch and closed her notebook with a decisive snap.

“Well,” she said, standing, “I’ll see you around.”

He managed a nod, too dazzled to find his voice. She gathered her things and walked away, leaving him with his open textbook, which suddenly looked like a door to a world he no longer found intimidating.

The next day, he arrived at the café well before noon, desperate to reserve the table where they’d spoken. He saw her already there, her thermos of homemade chai steaming beside her notebook. She looked up, caught his eye, and held out a small cup toward him. “Chai?” she asked.

He blinked. “You made this?”

“Early morning project,” she said with a smile, as though making chai were as routine as tying her shoes. “Thought you might like a change from coffee.”

He accepted the cup, inhaling the spicy aroma of cardamom and cinnamon. “I do,” he said, sipping carefully. “It’s perfect.”

She watched him for a moment, then turned back to her notebook. He settled into his chair, opened his book, and was halfway through a Roman numeral analysis when she leaned over and whispered, “Try this instead.” 

She tapped his page where he’d misidentified a dominant preparation. She didn’t scold; she simply guided his pencil to the correct spot, drawing a small star above the chord. Her fingertips brushed his hand in the process, and heat bloomed on his skin.

They met in the same way the next day, and the next. Each time, she asked questions—sometimes about music, sometimes about his life outside the café—and transcribed his answers. He began to look forward to her arrival more than the music theory itself. She had an uncanny sense of his schedule—knowing exactly when he needed a sugar boost or a distraction. She’d produce a flaky almond croissant or a dark chocolate square right at the moment he was about to sigh in defeat over his homework.

Yet for all her attentiveness, she herself remained a mystery. When James tried to learn more about her, she skated around details. She said she was from the East Coast but never specified a state. She mentioned “project work” that involved travel and deadlines, but never elaborated. Occasionally, she’d talk about her young son, but only in fleeting references—a photograph she slipped from her wallet, a half-smile when she mentioned his laughter. She described him as though he were both her greatest joy and an enigma, and James found himself aching to know more but hesitant to push.

For weeks, James’s dreams clattered with imagery: Mary walking through endless corridors, Mary peeling off a mask only to reveal another, Mary singing songs in languages he didn’t know. He woke to the memory of her hands on his skin, her voice in his ear, and always that sense of standing on a threshold. He wanted to know her, and sometimes he convinced himself that he already did. But the current of uncertainty, the suspicion of an inner sanctum untouched by his presence, never fully faded.

Then, on a breezy Thursday evening, Mary rang his phone. He’d just settled onto the threadbare couch in his tiny living room, the light of a single lamp casting long shadows against the peeling wallpaper. When he answered, her voice came softly, almost abruptly: 

“I’d like you to meet my family.” 

It landed in his ear as though it were a casual remark—no buildup, no preamble, no sense of occasion. Just those seven words, matter-of-fact and unadorned. He paused, thumb hovering over the end-call button. 

“Meet your family?” he repeated, voice level but surprised. “Is there… some special reason?” 

She laughed quietly, a sound that carried a trace of warmth. 

“Not at all,” she said. “My son’s home from school early, and I think—well, I think you’d get along. He’s really open-minded.” Then, almost as an afterthought: “You can meet my uncle and grandfather, too. They’re a little… eccentric, but you’ll see they’re harmless.”

He felt the weight of the invitation settle over him. He and Mary had been seeing each other for several weeks: dinners at hole-in-the-wall diners, long walks in the park where she’d talk about her childhood in veiled terms, coffee dates that slipped into twilight. But a family meeting felt like a milestone he hadn’t anticipated. Still, he agreed—you don’t refuse an invitation like that—and he heard her relief in the soft exhale on the other end. 

They set the time: 6:30 p.m. Friday.

—

When Friday evening rolled around, he dressed carefully—dark slacks, a button-down shirt, shoes polished just enough to shine under the overhead light. He checked his reflection in the hallway mirror, fidgeted with his collar, then waited by the door. At exactly 6:15, Mary pulled up in her hatchback, the engine humming quietly. She wore a navy windbreaker and her hair was pulled back in a loose bun. She popped the door open with a wide grin. “Hop in,” she said. He slid into the passenger seat. 

The interior was immaculate, as if she’d wiped every surface with disinfectant moments before: the dashboard gleamed, the upholstery looked untouched, and not a single fingerprint marred the center console. She buckled her seat belt and offered him one. 

“Buckle up,” she teased. “It’s only a short drive.”

As Mary steered the car through the city streets, he watched her profile in the side window: the curve of her nose, the way her brow furrowed slightly when she focused on the road, the subtle glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes. She talked about her son discreetly, always referring to him as “the kid.” She described him in broad strokes: curious about history, loves building model airplanes, can’t get enough of jazz records. 

James noticed that she kept changing the things he was into and specific details about him.

She never used his name. He tried to press her, but she said she’d tell him at dinner. Then she dropped another fragment of her past: her mother had died when she was young, and afterward her uncle and grandfather stepped in. 

“They raised me,” she said, voice a shade colder. “In their own way.”

He listened, leaning back in his seat, eyes flicking to the passing storefronts. He realized she spoke of that time almost clinically—no emotions attached, just facts arranged like set pieces. As she piloted them out of the downtown grid and onto quieter suburban avenues, the streetlights thinned and the air took on a scent of freshly mown lawns and distant barbecue smoke.

They came to rest in front of a squat, single-story house at the far edge of a cul-de-sac. The neighborhood was still: no voices, no cars, only the faint chirp of crickets. The front lawn had been mowed in impossibly straight lines, each stripe alternating between emerald and lime, as though the grass itself participated in some secret code. A single porch light flickered, casting an amber glow across the painted wooden steps. Mary parked, turned off the ignition, and sat for a moment. She reached over and gave his hand a quick squeeze—hard enough to be felt, brief enough to be cryptic. He swallowed, climbed out, and followed her up the porch steps.

Inside, the first thing that struck him was the sound: deep, rolling laughter, punctuated by occasional whoops, echoing from somewhere down a long hallway. The walls seemed to shimmer with it, as though the house itself were alive. The second thing was the décor. From floor to ceiling, the narrow foyer was plastered with collages of magazine clippings—faces from decades of television and pop culture. There was Lucille Ball doing her trademark double take; there was Rowan and Martin’s gang of Laugh-In comic rebels; there were the beaming visages of late-night hosts, frozen in mid-grin behind mustaches and suspenders. The effect was dizzying: a hall of mirrors, minus the glass.

He stepped gingerly over a patterned runner rug and into the living room, which looked more like a museum exhibit than a home. Shelves groaned under the weight of VHS tapes, their spines bearing titles that ranged from Mary Tyler Moore to The Cosby Show. In one corner, a stack of old TV Guide issues was meticulously arranged by year, as if someone expected a time traveler to drop by and ask for the premiere date of I Dream of Jeannie. A knitted afghan with Technicolor stripes was draped over a well-worn sofa, the bright yarns still vivid against the muted upholstery. The room smelled faintly of popcorn and dust—and something else: nostalgia, for times you’d never lived through.

In the far corner, under a small tube-style television perched on a rickety stand, sat a man hunched in an armchair. He wore a faded denim jacket, suspenders that had frayed edges, and a battered felt hat that looked like it had seen twenty summers. On the screen, The Beverly Hillbillies played in all its canned-laughter glory, and the old man laughed along in perfect sync—deep laughter that shook his shoulders each time the prerecorded guffaws played. 

He slapped his knee and barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” so loud it nearly drowned out the track.

Mary cleared her throat. The old man waved a hand at them without turning his head. His voice rang out in a drawl that could have been lifted straight from the Ozarks: 

“Don’t mind me, folks! Just watchin’ my stories.”

James took a careful step forward, offering his hand. The old man finally swivelled his head—silver hair shining under the lamp—and fixed him with a bright, curious stare. 

“Name’s Joe,” the old man announced, standing up so quickly that the chair groaned in protest. “You hungry, son?” 

He pointed toward an open doorway that led to a kitchen where the smell of roasting meat drifted out.

James gave Mary a quizzical look. Mary managed a small smile. 

“That,” she said softly, “is my grandfather.”

He tried to keep his tone light as he replied, 

“It’s very nice to meet you, name’s James.” 

But the old man didn’t drop the character. He tipped his hat and winked. 

“Pleased to meet you, too,” he said. Then he lowered his voice conspiratorially: “Have you ever tried cornbread with honey butter? I reckon I can fix you up right.”

As Mary guided James deeper into the living room—past a glass display case full of battered black-and-white photographs of unrecognizable actors—he realized something curious: Joe’s eyes, though twinkling and jovial, were sharp. They were eyes accustomed to reading people, measuring them, placing them on some private scale. James wondered briefly whether Joe was playing a part or simply refused to break character. Was it dementia? A lifelong performance? Or a conscious choice to live permanently in the world of his favorite shows?

Then, Mary steered him toward the dining room. There, a middle-aged man in a wide-lapelled suit sat at the table with his hands tented under his chin. He had perfectly coiffed hair and a smile that radiated yellow charisma. When James entered, the man leaned forward and said, “Top five answers on the board: What brings you here tonight?” 

There was a pause, then uproarious self-laughter.

This, evidently, was the uncle. He introduced himself as “Richard,” and the handshake that followed felt like a game-show challenge. Richard’s every movement, every turn of phrase, seemed lifted from Family Feud reruns. When James hesitated to answer a question, the uncle would pound the table and shout, 

“Survey says—!” as if an invisible crowd were keeping score.

James tried to laugh it off, but as the dinner unfolded he became increasingly aware of the collages on the walls: everywhere, television faces, pasted together in surreal, overlapping mosaics. There were mashups of cartoon characters with news anchors. There were eyes cut from one actor and glued onto the face of another. It was an unnerving, obsessive display. The more James noticed, the more he realized that the entire house was curated to resemble a set—a simulation of family life as broadcast to the world, complete with a sizzle reel of canned laughter and familiar punchlines.

That was the moment when, through a jitter of nerves and cheap wine, James remembered the questions Mary had been peppering him with since their first night together: What was the best sitcom episode of all time? What television moment, if any, had genuinely made him weep? Had he ever, growing up, imagined himself as another person for days at a time—inhabiting not only their voice but their gestures, their appetites, their secret hopes? It had seemed a harmless quirk at first, this “twenty questions” game, but now the memory of it snagged at him like an unfinished thread.

He remembered how, lying together in the sweaty hush after sex, Mary would go suddenly serious. She’d look up at him with those impossible eyes, and ask whether he felt, deep down, that he was always pretending—a man performing the role of himself, never quite able to believe his own lines. 

“Do you ever wish you could just… slip out of character?” she’d said once, tracing lazy circles on his chest. “Like, be someone entirely new for a day?”

Back then he’d laughed, chalking it up to the late hour and the heady aftermath of orgasms. 

Of course I do, he’d said, not really meaning it. 

Doesn’t everyone?

Now, sitting at the dinner table with the two men—game show uncle and sitcom grandfather—James felt as though he were living inside a dream crafted from Mary’s questions and obsessions. Even the food was staged: TV-dinner trays, mashed potatoes piped into perfect swirls, green beans a uniform shade of radioactive emerald. The glasses were filled with grape Kool-Aid, which neither uncle nor grandfather drank. When James tried to take a sip, the uncle leaned forward, winked, and said, 

“Survey says—!” as if any movement required its own laugh track.

He looked at Mary. She was unfazed by the spectacle, cutting her meatloaf into precise cubes and eating each one with the deliberation of an astronaut. Every now and then she would toss James a look of such perfect composure it made him uneasy. It wasn’t just that she was calm in the presence of family weirdness; it was that she seemed to be waiting for something, as though the night were a game designed for his benefit and she was silently willing him to keep playing along.

His mind did what it always did under stress: it cataloged. He began to tally the oddities, assembling them into a taxonomy of the uncanny. The old man’s laughter, which always landed a fraction of a second too late, as if he were listening to a delayed feed. The uncle’s hands, which never trembled or fidgeted, but held every gesture in a freeze-frame of perfect, almost plastic stillness. Even the family photos on the wall were wrong: in every snapshot, the faces smiled too widely, the pupils caught by the camera in a way that made them look painted on.

James tried to tell himself that this was just what happened to families after too much television and too few other interests—a kind of arrested development, harmless enough if you squinted. But then he looked at the place settings: four plates, four sets of utensils. 

He realized, with a start, that he hadn’t seen Mary’s son all night. She’d spoken of him so often that James had expected the kid to be orbiting, a minor planet in the family system, sneaking into the fridge or playing video games in the den. He glanced toward the hallway, where a closed door pulsed with the flicker of television light.

Mary caught his gaze and smiled. 

“He’s just finishing his homework,” she said, as if reading his mind. “He’ll join us soon.”

He nodded, but the words rattled in his head. Homework? On a Friday night, after nine o’clock? And still, the silence behind the door was thick and total—no clack of keyboard, no muttered complaints, not even the telltale hum of animation. He tried to imagine what kind of child Anthony must be, living in the shadow of such extravagant family theater. Was he a fellow mimic, a prodigy of imitation? Or, perversely, a total blank, a kid so unformed that his family’s personalities had simply washed over him, leaving nothing behind?

The question occupied James as the meal progressed. He picked at his food, mostly out of politeness, and filled the gaps in conversation with stories from his own childhood—his mother’s soup recipes, his father’s penchant for crossword puzzles and Jeopardy reruns. The uncle lapped up these anecdotes, responding to every detail with a ready-made game show catchphrase, while the grandfather simply nodded and occasionally barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” 

It began to dawn on James that neither man had once asked him a direct question about himself; it was as if their exchange was governed by a script, one in which the visitor’s purpose was simply to produce more lines for the canned laughter to punctuate.

Eventually, Mary stood up from the table, wiped her mouth on a paper napkin, and said, “I’ll go get Anthony.” 

She left the room with a lightness that seemed almost performative, as if she were stepping out for a commercial break. James listened to her footsteps recede down the hallway, then disappear behind the closed door.

He sat in the sudden quiet, feeling the eyes of both men settle on him. The uncle smiled, his teeth bared in a game show host’s approximation of warmth. 

“So, James,” he said, “what’s your final answer?”

James hesitated, then shrugged. “About what?”

The uncle looked at the grandfather, who cackled and said, “You should always lock in your answer, son. That’s the secret.”

For a moment, James wondered if this was some kind of elaborate hazing ritual—an initiation for boyfriends, a test of how much weirdness one could endure before bolting. He tried to play along, even as his skin prickled with the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, measured against an invisible yardstick.

Mary returned to the dining room slowly, her left hand curled gently around the slender wrist of a boy who trailed beside her like a ghost in an old photograph.

“This is Anthony,” she announced in a voice bright as a bell, though something about her inflection carried an undertow—half pride, half relief, perhaps. 

James blinked twice, then stared hard at the child. Anthony was dressed in a style so distinctly antiquated it might have belonged in a dusty black-and-white rerun: a crisp white collared shirt neatly buttoned to the throat, short pleated pants that ended just above the knees, knee-high socks folded with mathematical precision, and polished leather shoes that gleamed under the overhead chandelier. His dark hair was slicked back in a rigid wave that betrayed not a single stray strand. It was as though someone had taken a snapshot from the 1950s and slid it into the present moment with impossible clarity.

But it was Anthony’s face that froze James’s gaze. It bore none of the hallmarks James had mentally sketched when Mary first spoke of her son: no soft baby fat around the cheeks, no tentative, gap-toothed smile, none of the tentative shyness or mischievous glimmer in the eyes that mark the presence of a living child. Instead, Anthony’s features were drawn tight, as though the skin had been stretched across a carved wooden mask. His jaw was firm, unmoving. His eyes were unblinking, wide and luminous—as if two polished marbles had somehow been installed in place of irises, each reflecting the chandelier’s glow with disconcerting precision.

He moved with an odd, mechanical rigidity, every motion deliberate, almost rehearsed. When Mary guided him toward a chair at the long, varnished table, Anthony pivoted at the hips and sat down with his back absolutely straight, both feet planted flat on the hardwood floor. His hands folded exactly at the center of his lap, thumbs touching. He did not fidget. He did not glance around the room. He simply stared at James, as though he meant to examine and memorize every one of his features—the curve of his nose, the set of his eyebrows, the slight tremble in his lower lip.

Mary smiled at the boy, then turned back to James.

“This is James,” she said gently. “He’s a guest tonight.”

Anthony offered a slight nod and spoke in a voice that resonated far deeper than James would have expected from someone so slight in stature.

“Nice to meet you, James.” The words emerged with a hollow echo, as though they’d been recorded in an empty chamber and replayed. It sounded practiced, rehearsed in front of a mirror until each syllable had been polished smooth.

James forced himself to respond with a courteous smile. “Nice to meet you too. How was your homework today?”

Anthony paused, blinked twice in the slow, deliberate fashion that now set James’s nerves on edge, and said evenly,

“It was easy. I like numbers.” He added a quick, efficient grin, but it failed to touch his eyes, which remained locked on James’s face in unrelenting scrutiny.

Mary beamed at her son, as though proud of a performance well executed, then shot James a sideways look that seemed to say plainly: See? Nothing strange at all. Don’t worry.

But James’s heart thudded in his chest. Everything about the boy was strange. Anthony’s head seemed slightly oversized for his small body, the pale skin so unnaturally smooth that it looked almost translucent—like unbaked dough stretched thin. He seemed far too rigid, too perfect, too aware. James realized with a queasy pang that he had no real sense of how old Anthony was meant to be. Mary had spoken of him in vague terms—“very bright for his age,” “a bit shy,” “still adjusting”—but none of that matched the silent, intense figure now sitting opposite him, hands folded, eyes fixed.

As the adults around the table began to serve themselves—scooping roast, heaping potatoes, ladling gravy—the boy’s gaze never wavered. He didn’t glance at the roast or at the china plates. He watched James. With relentless precision, he followed every dip of James’s fork toward the plate, every hesitant swallow, until James felt compelled to drop his eyes or risk meeting that unblinking stare.

Mary bent forward, placing a dish of stringy green beans on the table. “Anthony, did you get a chance to finish that library book I asked about?” she prompted, her tone cooing, motherly.

“It’s finished,” he replied without hesitation. “I read every page. The themes were… enlightening.” His voice was even, almost monotonal. He did not offer any further elaboration. He did not squirm in his seat. He did not wipe his mouth or show any hunger for approval. He simply awaited the next cue.

Mary exchanged a quick glance with James, as though reassuring him that everything was under control. “Wonderful,” she said. “And how about recess? Did you play any games with Linh or Mikey today?”

Anthony’s eyes flicked to Mary, then to James, then back to Mary, as though downloading the question before delivering the answer.

“I played tag with Linh,” he said. “I do not mind tag. I do prefer puzzles.” He allowed himself the merest twitch of a grin that curled the corners of his mouth upward—in his mind, perhaps, an adequate approximation of a child’s enthusiasm.

The adults at the other end of the table chattered on—Uncle Richard scoffing at the soggy texture of the roast, Grandfather Joe drifting in and out of awareness, nodding at intervals as though caught between slumber and wakefulness. But all the while, the low hum of an unseen laugh track permeated the room, a relentless undercurrent of canned mirth. 

James’s stomach lurched. He turned his head to the den’s open doorway: there, a flatscreen nestled in the wall played an old sitcom rerun, its laugh track booming through hidden speakers. Private chuckles, canned applause, belly laughs—all timed to perfection, an absurd double soundtrack to the real conversation.

Anthony did not react to the laughter. He didn’t acknowledge it, didn’t flinch. As though oblivious to it, he continued to study James. Every so often, he would lift his eyes from the table and hold James’s gaze in a way that felt unnerving, like a camera lens zooming in too close.

James cleared his throat and tried another subject. “What about television? Ever watch anything you enjoy?”

The boy’s expression flickered—a fraction of a second—then settled.

“I don’t watch television,” he intoned. “It’s not real.” He paused, looked up at Mary, then added,

“Would you say that, Mother?”

Mary’s face remained serene. She offered only the slightest nod, as if granting permission for that answer and accepting it as complete. She did not push him to elaborate or soften his tone.

James swallowed hard, trying to force a forkful of gluey mashed potatoes down his throat. Each bite lodged in his chest like rotting wood. The potatoes were cold and pasty. The gravy was sickly sweet, almost plastic in flavor. The roast was charred at the edges but still raw at its center, bleeding a thin, glistening liquid into the gravy. Even the green beans tasted of nothing but metal.

He glanced around the table. Uncle Richard, laughing along with the sitcom, pounded his fist on the table in perfect sync with the recorded guffaws. Grandfather Joe, blinking slow and heavy as if waking from a dream, would crack a smile—just for the punchline—and then slump forward again, eyes closing. Mary offered polite bites and soft murmurs of encouragement to everyone else. But Anthony never lifted a morsel to his mouth. He sat, his posture ceremonial, his eyes locked on James, as though waiting for something to happen.

Conversation turned to holiday plans—Mary’s plans to take Anthony to the zoo next week, the possibility of a family outing to the mountains. Anthony answered each question with the same clipped cadence, hinting at interest but never showing any real excitement. When Mary asked if he looked forward to seeing the penguins, he simply tilted his head and said, “Penguins are… aquatic birds. I have read about them.” Then he offered a swift nod, and his gaze returned immediately to James.

After what felt like an eternity, James realized his water glass was empty. He reached for it, but it had somehow slipped entirely out of reach. He shifted, saw the glass sitting untouched at his place setting—empty, exactly where it had begun. He hadn’t sipped at it once since the meal began. He realized then that he’d been so absorbed by the boy’s eerie stillness, by the canned laughter echoing off the walls, by the grotesque parody of a family dinner unfolding around him, that he’d almost forgotten to eat or drink. Panic fluttered in his chest.

He looked at Mary, who gave him a gentle, apologetic smile and poured him more water. 

“Here you go,” she said, handing him the glass. But even the water tasted off, as though filtered through some metallic, rusty pipe.

Anthony, sensing perhaps a shift in the room’s energy, blinked twice in his deliberate fashion and spoke without preamble. 

“May I be excused?” His voice was calm, utterly devoid of childish hesitancy.

Mary glanced at the clock on the wall—silent, ticking—then nodded. “Of course. Why don’t you go read in the den for a bit?” she suggested.

The boy rose with the same precision he’d used to sit, pivoting on his heels, then walked toward the den without so much as a backward glance. As he passed James, the faintest scent of something—chalk? Sterile plastic?—wafted from him, a fleeting odor that dissolved in the air almost as soon as it touched James’s nostrils.

James exhaled slowly, as though releasing a held breath he hadn’t been conscious of. Mary returned her attention to him, concerned about softening her smile. 

“Are you alright?” she asked.

He nodded, unable to form words. The silent weight of Anthony’s presence still lingered in the room, a cold, calculated impression. Uncle Richard let out another laugh in perfect time with the television, Grandfather Joe stirred, and Mary resumed her small talk.

But James could think only of that pale-faced boy in a vintage schoolboy uniform, sitting motionless at his mother’s table, watching him with unblinking eyes, as if calculating and cataloging every detail. And James knew, with an unsettling certainty, that he would never unsee the astonishing precision of Anthony’s performance—nor unhear the faint, mechanical echo in his voice.

The conversation, if it could be called that, soon turned. It was as if the entire family had conspired to shift the spotlight onto him, to excavate his past and dissect it for entertainment.

Richard opened with the easy stuff, the ""Tell us about yourself, James!"" line. But it quickly devolved into a barrage of questions so intimate and oddly specific that James found himself stumbling, caught off-guard by how much they already seemed to know.

We have a fairly large family that lives in the states. When someone visits Trinidad, they’re sent back with sweets, curried/fried meats, cooked vegetables/tarkari, cakes, pastries, hong wing coffee packets, sunshine/kiss snacks, pastelles, and medicines.

The frozen food items are usually vacuumed seal, labeled with names and portioned separately for everyone. It is expected that everyone gets what they’re suppose to receive, except it doesn’t happen. They will gather at the person’s house whom is bringing back those items and wait for them to come.

They will request the most of basic food items that they can get there like currants rolls, chilli balls, shrimps, and hong wing coffee. I’m positive, these items are cheaper and available for them.

Does anyone have family members like this? Are things not cheap in New York? This has been happening since before tariffs so..",2,1766517907.0,TrinidadandTobago,4,0.75,False

I've tried talking about it with family members or relatives but they instantly turn it to mockery and insults which makes me avoid them in order to not feed my guilt even more.

Since the time I can remember, I've always experienced huge amount of guilt about anything that I do in life. I try to avoid regret and mistakes at all cost.

I avoid coffee and other substances because if I consume them, I feel like some sort of ""evil meth addict"". I understand that this is not true but I can't stop feeling ""unpure"" guilt from it.

I try not to judge people and treat them with open mind but those evil judgements that I've observed from external world keep judging me and I hate them. It's like constant battle between my consicousness and subconsciousness.

I've always gotten along with girls and many showed interest in me. Just in past month I have rejected 2 girls who showed interest in me because I feel like dating is a sin and it will make me an evil and bad person. I get along with them really well and we're friends but my intrusive thoughts, anxiety, guilt, worrying and shame stop me from pursuing anything more. If I date someone, I feel like ""evil and hedonistic"" person who is trying to take advantage of someone despite knowing that I don't and I show too much caution, empathy and consideration towards them.

I feel that I'm too young to participate in such stuff despite being in my 20s. If I participate in such stuff I feel like an evil person and a bad son to my parents. I'm constantly avoiding such stuff and I'm wanting to be more mature and older person but I feel like I'm indefinitely postponing life experiences and avoiding life.

I wish that I could just enjoy experiences in life and get along with people without feeling like I have to whip and hurt myself just to deserve to breathe and eat. I kind of feel like that guy from Da Vinci's Code.

I kind of feel like it's too late for me because I've missed on so much in my life due to this feeling of guilt. Even if I got rid of this guilt now, I'm still far too behind in life and too old (despite being in 20s) in order to start living now.

What bothers me the most is that I was given so much positive potential that I have wasted due to my conscious feeling of guilt and shame.

I was in gifted class and on top of my class and due to my indecision I kept dropping out and just now I'm getting my diploma. Despite being offered a job in biggest coding company in my town I feel guilty and shameful about it.

I've always felt kind of in linear progression. Most people are very immature at 15 and very mature at 25. For me it's kind of the opposite. It's not exponential graph in maturity. It's very linear and flat. I was more mature than my friends at 15 and I'm more immature than friends at 25.

I rather work at small PC store in order to avoid feeling of responsibility despite my potential being higher and I help finishing code from my online friends who are full time employed while I'm deciding to work at a job that doesn't even require it.

I have a tone of hobbies from drawing, playing guitar, building PCs, reading about history, coding to gym.

I always got along with people and girls were always interested in me, they said that I'm very understanding, sweet and attractive but due to my feeling of guilt and potentially hurting someone, I decided to avoid relationships and I feel far too behind in life at this point.

I'm constantly thinking about my life through past and future and when I should do what and how I should do it and would I feel guilty about it or not.

Who killed him and why? (Camden, London, 1995-6)","*A repost from two years ago. Given that a local newspaper undertook to publicise [Alan](https://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/media/2025/01/alan-holmes.jpg)'s unsolved murder every Christmas and has done so for 30 years, I will start doing the same here. I have done a number of write-ups but this is the case that really bothers me.*

The co-presenter of Crimewatch UK at the time, Nick Ross, described Alan's murder as ""one of the cruellest crimes we have ever covered"". For once, that was not hyperbole.

Alan was 53. He was born in Northern Ireland, studied law at Queen's University Belfast but didn't graduate and moved to London in 1964; at the time of his death he lived in Camden, just north of Central London. He had been a civilian employee of the Metropolitan Police since 1979; he was a motor mechanic based at Kentish Town police station, half a mile from his flat.

He lived alone in a block of flats which was due to be redeveloped; his was the last occupied flat in the block, above a disused shop. The location is now [shared by Starbucks and Diabetes UK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Starbucks+Coffee/@51.5388313,-0.143025,3a,75y,320.52h,108.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srxld7a2ECLxqsDsPxxZbVQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x48761ae1aa46ea0d:0x73da055ad71b385d!8m2!3d51.5389594!4d-0.1432895!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1tkktbpg?entry=ttu).

He was described as ""gregarious"" and having ""a lot of friends"" and, on Christmas Day 1995, he [visited some of those friends](https://www.islingtontribune.co.uk/article/cathymurder/) in Isleworth, Middlesex, for a Christmas meal; they dropped him back at his flat by car, probably at about midnight.

Surprisingly, given that London empties for Christmas (I live there myself, and it is hard to convey how empty it becomes) and nights were unusually cold (down to -6C/21F until the end of the month) there were two burglaries about 50 yards apart on Christmas Day, one at 2315 and the other probably just after Alan had returned. The first was of Cullen's, a branch of a convenience store chain which became defunct in 1998 [(now replaced by half-a-dozen small shops)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Superdrug/@51.5393168,-0.1429259,3a,90y,238.49h,101.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLmltbk7QW127fPTvkw23MQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x48761ae1aa46ea0d:0x73da055ad71b385d!2sStarbucks+Coffee!8m2!3d51.5389594!4d-0.1432895!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1tkktbpg!3m5!1s0x48761ae1bafa22c3:0xeb56f5a8e741ec46!8m2!3d51.5391827!4d-0.1429865!16s%2Fg%2F1vlk1168?entry=ttu); the second was of Alan's flat. The police were on the scene of the first burglary almost straight away, and narrowly missed catching the perpetrator despite calling in a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera.

What happened during the second burglary has never been made public in any detail, but Alan was ""tortured"" (one source says ""kicked"") for his two NatWest bank card PINs then tied to his bed.

He remained tied to his bed for nearly ten days; the police were alerted after he failed to report for work on 2 January 1996. They visited Alan's flat on the 3rd, got no answer, went away then called again on the 4th. That time they smashed open the flat doors, found Alan still tied up and called an ambulance. He died the next day in University College Hospital from dehydration and blood clotting, as the circulation to his hands and feet had been cut off. Before he died he was able to give a ""confused account"" of what happened. He had called out while he was tied up but, because of his block of flats being otherwise empty, nobody heard him.

On 26 and 27 December Alan's bank cards were used, or attempted to be used, about a dozen times in Oxford Circus and the South Bank (see map). In total about £1,000 [(roughly £2,030 now)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator) was stolen. Somehow the police, before the Crimewatch UK reconstruction, got a description of the person in the Oxford Circus incident, who tried ""four or five"" times to withdraw money from a cash machine. (""22-25, 6'1"" with a No.2 cut, athletic build, grey hoodie, blue jeans, tan Timberland boots"").

Note that 1995, in the UK, was [a few years before mass introduction of outdoor CCTV](https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/post/pn175.pdf) (PDF); at the time, it was largely used indoors.

As well as Alan's bank cards, driving licence and passport, the perpetrator stole two 4-inch by 5-inch antique silver picture frames which were never found.

The police believed (on what basis is not stated) that the perpetrator went back to the flat some time after the burglary and gave Alan water. There was also a suggestion that the behaviour of the perpetrator was based on the film [Se7en](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/) (1995), and others that the perpetrator was homeless or was not local.

There was huge publicity at the time, but as all too often happens it fizzled out without a resolution and the case went cold. [The next Crimewatch UK episode](https://youtu.be/z8JMXgxXRsA?t=746), which normally gives progress on the previous month's cases, noted that 50 calls had been received (historically, a fairly low number although far from the all-time low of three) but no progress made other than the ultimately inconclusive arrests mentioned in the next paragraph. Local businesses had collaborated on a £25,000 reward, again without effect. However, the Camden New Journal resolved to publish Alan's photograph and details of the crime each New Year, and it has honoured its resolution for almost 30 years.

At the time, five people were arrested in relation to Alan's murder including two immediately afterwards in Kentish Town [(The Independent, 12-Jan-1996)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/two-arrested-over-murder-of-man-abandoned-in-flat-1323552.html). However, evidently, none of these arrests panned out. Some articles note that CCTV images were obtained of suspects, but these were never made public and are believed to be of poor quality. The perpetrator's DNA was decoded nearly eleven years after the event (The Sun, 28-Dec-2006) but, clearly, has not been matched since then on the National DNA Database.

It was asserted that the police pulled out all the stops in their investigation because it was a police (civilian) employee who was murdered. Certainly [John Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yates_\(police_officer\)), who was a cut above the usual Crimewatch UK police spokesman, led the inquiry, ultimately became an Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police but was forced to resign. Attitudes clearly changed as, in 2016, the Camden New Journal's editor [criticised the police](https://richardosley.wordpress.com/2016/01/04/who-killed-alan-holmes-we-have-to-keep-asking/) for not marking the 20th anniversary and showing no interest in making a new appeal for information.

Questions:

Was the perpetrator local, non-local, homeless ... or what?

Could Alan have survived for ten days without the (supposed) revisit from the perpetrator?

How many perpetrators were there? (Surprisingly, this has never been made clear; I have assumed one for clarity)

Were the two burglaries linked? (Again surprisingly, this is not clear although it is always assumed that they were).

1pu2k9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1pu2k9j/how_do_you_stop_everything_from_feeling_like_a/,"How do you stop everything from feeling like a huge ""sin"" and stop experiencing guilt in order to feel good enough and enjoy life?","I was trying to avoid making a post about this but I don't think that I have any other choice I was dropped by a therapist and there is no one else that I can ask without being insulted for but I don't know where else to go and I find myself completely stuck in infinite rabbit hole or loop.

I've tried talking about it with family members or relatives but they instantly turn it to mockery and insults which makes me avoid them in order to not feed my guilt even more.

I only have like 2 long term male friends in real life who I've known for long time and they're both became extremely nationalistic, racist and sexist and I don't want to expose myself to such toxicity.

Since the time I can remember, I've always experienced huge amount of guilt about anything that I do in life. I try to avoid regret and mistakes at all cost.

I avoid coffee and other substances because if I consume them, I feel like some sort of ""evil meth addict"". I understand that this is not true but I can't stop feeling ""unpure"" guilt from it.

I try not to judge people and treat them with open mind but those evil judgements that I've observed from external world keep judging me and I hate them. It's like constant battle between my consicousness and subconsciousness.

I've always gotten along with girls and many showed interest in me. Just in past month I have rejected 2 girls who showed interest in me because I feel like dating is a sin and it will make me an evil and bad person. I get along with them really well and we're friends but my intrusive thoughts, anxiety, guilt, worrying and shame stop me from pursuing anything more. If I date someone, I feel like ""evil and hedonistic"" person who is trying to take advantage of someone despite knowing that I don't and I show too much caution, empathy and consideration towards them.

I feel that I'm too young to participate in such stuff despite being in my 20s. If I participate in such stuff I feel like an evil person and a bad son to my parents. I'm constantly avoiding such stuff and I'm wanting to be more mature and older person but I feel like I'm indefinitely postponing life experiences and avoiding life.

I wish that I could just enjoy experiences in life and get along with people without feeling like I have to whip and hurt myself just to deserve to breathe and eat. I kind of feel like that guy from Da Vinci's Code.

I kind of feel like it's too late for me because I've missed on so much in my life due to this feeling of guilt. Even if I got rid of this guilt now, I'm still far too behind in life and too old (despite being in 20s) in order to start living now.

What bothers me the most is that I was given so much positive potential that I have wasted due to my conscious feeling of guilt and shame.

I was in gifted class and on top of my class and due to my indecision I kept dropping out and just now I'm getting my diploma. Despite being offered a job in biggest coding company in my town I feel guilty and shameful about it.

I've always felt kind of in linear progression. Most people are very immature at 15 and very mature at 25. For me it's kind of the opposite. It's not exponential graph in maturity. It's very linear and flat. I was more mature than my friends at 15 and I'm more immature than friends at 25.

I rather work at small PC store in order to avoid feeling of responsibility despite my potential being higher and I help finishing code from my online friends who are full time employed while I'm deciding to work at a job that doesn't even require it.

I have a tone of hobbies from drawing, playing guitar, building PCs, reading about history, coding to gym.

I always got along with people and girls were always interested in me, they said that I'm very understanding, sweet and attractive but due to my feeling of guilt and potentially hurting someone, I decided to avoid relationships and I feel far too behind in life at this point.

I constantly feel like delaying everything until I'm older and more mature but I dont' think that this fixes anything because I've noticed that I only feel more mature when I start learning and doing stuff and not just by aging.

I never feel like I'm at the right moment to start something and I feel like delaying it when I'm more mature and ready in order to ""deserve"" it and do it right.

I'm constantly thinking about my life through past and future and when I should do what and how I should do it and would I feel guilty about it or not.

I'm not sure if I continue this path of avoidance because of all the wasted potential or do I try to make up for the lost time or do I just continue from here?

I would really like to know what I can do about this feeling of guilt and shame.",1,1766517621.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

But it all has come to a head with our work secret Santa exchange.

For content we work in childcare, which comes with basic rules like not being on your phone and paying attention to the children. We don’t make a lot of money, and this plays into the Secret Santa. Anyway, a few years ago secret Santa was a disaster so one of the other staff (let’s call her Rachel) took over and now knows who has who and makes sure that gifts are given. 

The  way we do our secret Santa is we fill out a sheet of paper with likes, dislikes, allergies(important), and preferences. Mine included things like Snickers, yarn, Coffee, and under allergy I put Bananas. Then we get our person and we have one week to get them a small $5 gift, and then we give our “big” $20 gift at the staff Christmas party. I knew who had me almost immediately, because of all my other coworkers reactions. It was Sapphire, who I’ve disagreed with since I got back from vacation. I figured no big deal. It’ll be ok. I’ll just trust the process. So I go and get my gifts for my person. And when I received my first gift from Sapphire, I was excited because many times the first gift is snacks! But instead I got dollar tree water colors and my initial in the shape of an animal I don’t even like. I never said I’d didn’t like the gift, I just simply stated what I got to another coworker as we were comparing gifts. Fast forward to the staff Christmas party and we are all passing out our gifts and I was super excited because it was pretty heavy and in a pretty big bag. When I opened it though it was a few left over Halloween candies and a giant squishy banana. On the sheet I put that I don’t like/can’t have banana. I was very unset but didn’t say anything until she had left then reported it to my boss and Rachel. 

Rachel said that Sapphire heard me talking about my gift and it made her feel bad so she didn’t try with my second gift. To which I responded “all I said was that I got water colors and my initial in the shape of an animal” But Rachel continued to defend Sapphire vehemently whereas my boss didn’t take sides but just said we should come back to the discussion later. It’s now been 4 days and Sapphire refuses to make eye contact.",16,1766517591.0,AmiInTheWrong,14,0.83,False

1pu2i36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pu2i36,I've beated Rainbow Six crossover mission on Tier 30 solo without AI. Wasn't worth it. Essay alert!,"First of all, little backstory - for personal preferences I play solo, without AI. Meaning I fall - I die. I prefer it that way, because it'll be only my fault, and I don't really like AI companions breaking immersion with teleportation and standing next to enemies. And I was also foolish enough to start in Ghost Mode. Plenty of times I was killed mostly by touching the cars, so... yep, I save scum that, cause it's just a shame to waste 30 hours just to hug a random car and die. I'm not even talking about Matchwood, no, I'm talking about this - the deserved silver medal of stupidity.

At the start it starts smooth for collab - sure we get introduced to characters out of place, but alright - can handle it. We do some investigating, some cheesy liners, alright, I guess... And then Nomad (and by god do I hate when he does that ONLY in added content) suddenly goes all sexy roaring ""oh yeah, it's party time, and I'm the party pooper"" and all that cringe nonsense - come on, who wrote this?

Anyway, while on paper it kinda sounds like a cool idea to assault the building, door by door locked up ""gaga, it's like in Siege ye-ye-ye"" - in reality it's just ""Santa Blanca ordered about 50 men to lock down in one building behind wooden barricades. It just so happens to be the most fortified building in the ENTIRE COUNTRY"". On top difficulty, once more. Well, guess using grenade launcher in close quarters is one way to assault.

Then there was one guy out of reinforcements somehow hiding from the army of rebels I was constantly calling that gave me and poor melee button a heart attack. I guess I found out how John Wick felt in the middle of his killstreaks when you count every subsecond.

And what pissed me off the most, and did put a sour in my tea (or dick in the coffee, cause I'm really pissed about it) - the ending of this mission. If you can't write McGuffin' of the plot, don't. Just say ""It's someone, we gotta bail him"" - it's fine. No need to make characters suddenly start bitching (hm... most of them are women... I guess pun intended) for no reason. We saved the guy, we know he has intel, we literally work on same cause, you sit there fucking bleeding and what do you say? ""Nope, don't care mate"". Literally 30 seconds ago you said ""That's the shit!""

But I guess I'm a little proud I actually beated it on almost first try (third). Rebel forces, spotting, bomb drones and grenade launcher are the must-have to cross the street safely.

hm... Didn't expect this as a wind-off, at first I wanted to joke out.

I also have a few specific questions:

* Is it generally better to focus on recruiting for one office (e.g., Chicago) or keep options open across multiple offices?
* How much does networking actually matter for MBB, and what do good coffee chats look like in practice? Is it mostly learning about day-to-day work, firm culture, and their path, then asking to be connected to others (without explicitly asking for referrals)?
* Is the interview process for undergrads essentially the same as what’s described online (cases, fit, games/assessments), or are there differences I should be aware of?
* Any advice on balancing networking vs casing early on?

Unfortunately, I got addicted to extract and was spending way to much $ on it anyways. So decided to switch to powder.

Toss and wash was completely out of the question for me. I did try it once and ended up violently coughing powder all over the kitchen. 

I ended up using a milk frother device to mix it into milk or juice and after a week of doing that straight, I was having the worst god awful stomach pains and constipation.

The powder is completely insoluble fiber. It just sits in your stomach like a brick, and if you're backed up it's going to take a while for your body to absorb the alkaloids while also feeling like you have to vomit. I was getting serious sharp stomach pains. I knew I had to figure something else out.

I bought this French press that's meant for finely ground espresso and holy shit. What a difference it's made. Not only does the feeling actually hit me better, but no stomach pains, no constipation, no brick of powder struggling to make it through my digestive tract. Just takes time and patience. Heat the water up, mix the powder with some lemon juice, let it sit for 15 mins to brew then plunge. Then I add about 50% banana pineapple orange juice and it tastes like a delicious tea. 

Seems so stupidly obvious to make it like espresso coffee, but I just didn't really know if it would even work. It worked SO well, just had to share for anyone else struggling with the best way to consume powder.

Smeg BCC12,"We've been liking our Smeg BCC12 automatic espresso machine (paid $150, would never buy it full-priced), coming from our old Nespresso original line. We tend to prefer a longer coffee or a lungo americano, so I am trying to dial in the brew duration/yield settings to our liking.

Previously with the Nespresso, we would make a drink by doing a lungo + espresso (same pod) + a little hot water to fill up a standard 12 oz mug. With the Smeg, I am finding that the standard brew duration for the large coffee button doesn't produce enough liquid and ends up being too diluted when filling with hot water to get 12 oz.

Setting a custom brew duration to be much longer than the standard one to be fuller and yield more, but as I understand, if you push too much water through a single serving of coffee grounds, it can end up tasting too bitter.

When pushing all 12 oz through the coffee grinds, what's the best way to avoid that bitterness? Would a coarser ground help alleviate that, or would we be better off brewing a stronger shot of espresso that isn't as diluted when adding hot water to get to 12 oz?

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

1pu21yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1pu21yf/the_formula_that_helped_me_navigate_relationships/,The formula that helped me navigate relationships with my TBM friends and family,"I left the church just over a year ago. As anyone who has walked this path knows: leaving is hell on your relationships.   
  
In the last twelve months, I have gone no-contact with one of my sisters. I have watched lifelong friendships crumble under their own weight as I set new boundaries. Most surprisingly, I’ve found myself building deep, nuanced connections with people still in the church who are willing to look at the world with open eyes.

The question eventually becomes: Which relationships do you keep? Which do you drop, and which do you radically restructure?

I am not an expert but this has helped: I've been using a specific formula to navigate this, and it has saved my sanity. It moves the conversation away from ""Who is being mean?"" toward the fundamental physics of human connection.

The Formula of Stability

In any connection, the health and longevity of the relationship can be measured by this equation:

Stability (of relationship) = Intersubjectivity / Dissonance 

1. Intersubjectivity (The Bridge)

Intersubjectivity is the amount of reality you both agree on. It is the size of the Bridge between you. It includes shared values, history, honesty, and the ability to look at a ""thing"" and agree that it exists. When you leave a high-control religion, this bridge often shrinks because you can no longer agree on the ""Big Truths"" that used to anchor your shared world.

2. Dissonance (The Troll and the Toll)

Dissonance is the level of denial, projection, gaslighting, or the flat-out refusal to take responsibility. If Intersubjectivity is the bridge, Dissonance is the Troll living under it. Dissonance acts as a Tax on the relationship. Even if you have a massive bridge (shared blood, decades of history), if the Dissonance is high, the bridge becomes a ""Toll Road"" that is too expensive to travel. You end up exhausted just trying to keep the conversation from collapsing into an argument or a lecture.

To show how this works in real life, here are two relationships I currently navigate:

My Father: 

We share a lot of common values: honesty, hard work, and generosity. On paper, our ""Bridge"" should be huge. However, the amount of denial and projection is simply too high for anything deep to develop.

The moment anything ""uncomfortable"" is brought up—whether it’s church history or family dynamics—it is immediately denied, minimized, or projected back as my fault. The ""Dissonance Tax"" is so high that I can only afford a shallow relationship. We talk 3–4 times a year about the weather, the rugby, and our work. I’ve accepted the math: High Dissonance = Low Stability.

""John"" 

John is a family friend who works in my wife’s family business. We share many values, but the difference is our willingness to be wrong. When we discuss difficult topics, we are both willing to admit fault, see flaws in our own arguments, and value each other's points of view.

There is almost no ""Dissonance Tax"" here. Because we aren't protecting a ""Simulation,"" we can speak 1–2 times a week about almost anything (except the joys of Coffee and alcohol... yet).

The disclaimer!!  
  
This sounds nice and neat on a screen, but the reality is messy as hell. I have had to cry and process an immense amount of grief to learn this lesson.

It is incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact that many relationships—especially those with people closest to us—are simply not worth the energy. We often hold onto the hope that if we just ""say the right thing,"" we can save the bridge.

What I realized is that ""saying the right thing"" in a high-dissonance relationship usually requires you to delete yourself**.** It requires you to tell a lie that confirms *their* reality while erasing your own.

I’ve stopped paying that toll. I’m no longer interested in saving bridges that require me to disappear just to cross them. I’d rather have a small, sturdy bridge that can hold the weight of the truth than a massive one that collapses the moment I show up as my real self.",8,1766516396.0,exmormon,4,1.0,False

The holiday period is very much in full swing and it feels like now is the perfect time to begin my quest to find someone new and amusing to help survive to the end of the year with, and hopefully beyond.

I’m 33, male and from the UK. London to be a little more precise! I work as an aircraft engineer. I know this isn’t the most interesting job in the world, but it does allow me to travel a fair bit.  

Random info about me - I’m convinced I’ll eventually die due to one of the Big 3 Cs: coffee, cheese, or chocolate. No regrets, honestly! Away from that, in terms of hobbies I like the following:

- Travel (I get great travel benefits because of my job, so this is always something that I try to make the most).
- Keeping fit and healthy (I do find this a bit of a chore, but it definitely helps me stay mentally positive!).
- Visiting new restaurants and other places to eat (This is something I absolutely love doing. Trying dishes from different cultures is probably my number one ambition in life!)
- Theme parks (There are some great ones in Europe, but one day I dream of visiting some of the American parks too!)

I think that will do for now…If you think that I’m maybe worth a message, then please feel free to drop me one!

Conversation was great from the start — proper banter, laughing at each other’s jokes, felt like actual chemistry. Moved to IG pretty quick.

We talk for a bit and then she says she’s not feeling well, so I give her space. Drop a casual check-in over the weekend, no reply, cool, she’s recovering. Wait till Friday, send a short voice note asking how she’s doing and if she’s up for coffee sometime during the weekend. She sends back a long voice note saying she’s been slammed with work, friend’s startup, music festivals, health stuff, etc. I just say no worries, get better first, we’ll plan when you’re good.

Last night she hits me with “sorry for acting weird, been super busy” and asks if I’m free for something low-key on Christmas. I’m thinking okay, apology accepted, let’s move forward. Say yeah, no fixed plans, down for dinner or coffee.

She comes back with “sorry but movie with friends at 6pm, brunch instead?” I suggest breakfast or late lunch so she can make her evening plans. Playfully add “if it goes well you can invite me to the movie too” — obviously joking, just building anticipation.

Her reply: “No thank you, tc” and blocks me on IG.

Wtf?? I go back to Hinge, send one message saying blocking over a clear joke isn’t cool, especially after I’ve been nothing but patient with her slow replies and “health issues”.

Unmatched there too, no response.

I’m done. Deleted the app.

This isn’t the first time — most conversations fizzle into “what do you do” or “where in Mumbai” and die. The rare one that actually feels good ends like this.

sockfemera said, handing a small gift box over to the sock puppet representation of Solomon. 

“You know I don't celebrate Christmas right and it's two days early”

Socksol replied 

“Oh um that's ok it's a New Year's present then”

Sockfemera said planting a kiss on socksols cheek. In the background the sound of a tray of Legos being dropped and quickly picked up briefly stirs the toy maker out of his sorrowful mania. 

“Thanks…”

Socksol looks away guilty. 

“...Im sorry I didn't get you anything, I was busy accomplishing nothing”

Socksol has ruined Christmas just like he ruined everything else in his life. 

“That's ok I forgive you.”

How? how? it's something the toy maker could not understand how he could forgive. The whole reason she was Crystal was because of his actions. But she blamed commander Sharp. She still loved him even with all of the stress and grief HE put her through. Why why WHY 

“WHY Damnit Why do you forgive him of all people why not Toby or Sakur or Niko!?”

The answer is pretty obvious: Solomon survived. They did not. Still in the toy makers state, he can still hear their voices blaming Solomon for the crime of surviving. 

“You must be under a spell or something”

The toy maker says to sockfemera as a screwdriver hovers in the air before launching at socksol. Sockfemera moves to block the shot and both of the toy makers hands are impaled. The toy maker rips the screwdriver out with his teeth. Before transforming both socksol and sockfemera into fumos. Which manifest on an empty chair in the and even emptier living room. Somehow holding hands.

The toy maker lets out a heavy sigh before turning to the collection of liquor and a revolver sitting on a coffee table and he helps himself to the third bottle of today drinking it through the burlap mask he wears. After a few large gulps of The dwarven equivalent of everclear watered down with a candy cane hooch. The toymaker goes to the tree to unwrap his presents he gifted to himself. The first one a ussf RPG-2 with anti-personnel warheads. The second a bandolier of grenades. The third model main battle tank diecast in silver. The final present a submachine gun and enchanted buckler. 

“Thanks guys You shouldn't have”

The toy maker says to the voices before sauntering over and helping himself to some of the fruitcake he baked. It's awful mainly because he can't eat it, in fact he hasn't eaten anything since becoming an Exarch. The toymaker tosses the fruit cake in the fire and resolves to just sit alone in the room drinking and occasionally spinning the cylinder of the revolver. 

Meanwhile outside of the toy realm preparations are made in Chalcos Lego super Star destroyers are attached to life-sized toy planes mainly via zip ties duct tape cultists in the toy kingdom working furiously to assemble them as well as a variety of other diecast models that The toy maker will use as fighter cover and a ground forces respectively. The toy makers' agents go about raiding shipping warehouses, stealing all of the toys within to add to his army. One of the largest space fleets ever assembled sits awaiting deployment hundreds of super star destroyers and thousands normal Star destroyers all rendered in Lego form are moved about and prepared for a major assault on the bismuth forces attempting to contain the queen of insanity. 

 Outside of chalcos in various cities throughout the wizarding realms it begins to rain an empty sorrowful raining that washes away happiness that washes away will that washes away joy those caught in the rain would be exposed to the crushing weight of sorrow steadily yet inevitably losing their will to live for prolonged exposure lying down and waiting to die robbed of the will to even take a single step forward.",6,1766515990.0,wizardposting,1,1.0,False

My fiance (m38) and I (f29) have been together for 3 years and are very in love in the day to day. He has messed up a lot in the beginning of our relationship but I stood my ground and we are at a great point now. He works on himself, he's in therapy, we talk openly, and we do couples therapy even though overall we are really good. We both came from abusive relationships and we go to therapy together to just make sure we are keeping things healthy as our previous relationships were long haul relationships and this is the first long term one either of us have been in since being abused. Bit of back story, he has been separated from his wife since 2018, and he has tried to get a divorce since 2022. We are at the stage now where it seems like the divorce will actually happen in the next 6 months.

I could tell he was gearing up to proposing so I gave him very specific guidelines, this is something he requests because his ex would be very vague and lash out (You didnt get me flowers when you came home so so I'm going to sleep with so-and-so etc, he is not exaggerating I've seen the messages.) 

Guidelines:  
1. ask my grandmother and my step dad for my hand (this is very important to both family members)  
2. get a photographer, NOT a phone video, a photographer  
3. I need a gold ring, I am allergic to silver, I get hives and my fingers start to swell   
4. It doesn't need to be the forever ring just let me know.   
5. Lab diamond/moissanite is fine! Just no cubic zirconia  
6. Do not plan it around an event or a vacation I plan, please have the planning be 100% you. I have never had anyone plan anything for me and this would mean an incredible amount. I didn't have birthday parties growing up, or really any surprises ever. I've graduated college 3 times and have had 0 celebrations for me from friends or family. This would mean a great deal to me.  
7. No proposal until after being divorce.   
8. If it is at a theme park, somewhere more private (we do a LOT of theme parks)

So what happened: 

I planned and paid for a trip to an international destination for August. He was meant to be divorced in July but the court date got pushed back. We were told he would likely just get some papers he has to sign when we were gone. 

Before our trip we spent a week with my family, so I thought he might have asked my parents then, SO On the flight to our international destination I reminded him with the entire list and reminded that I had requested it not be on a trip I have planned and paid for and that he really needed to be divorced before. He said he understood. I reminded him if there was no photographer, or if there was a silver ring I would say no because I wouldn't feel seen. He said he understood fully and that it wouldn't happen. 

Into our trip our plans for one day got pushed back so I decided to pay for a theme park for an extra day. I kept asking if he had anything planned and or if I should plan the day, despite this I got a feeling he was going to propose and he had several places he wanted to do photo ops throughout the day. 

When he proposed it was really lovely he was sweet the ring was beautiful and I was ecstatic. He told me it was a lab diamond, and he got me a back up cheap ring for if my fingers swell. He even got me diamond earrings to match, something I've dreamed about since I was a little girl. He cried, I cried, but when we got back to the hotel everything kind of crashed. 

1. There was no photographer. Discovered after I said yes obviously.  
2. he set up a video for stills, someone walked in front of it.   
3. When I called my family they were shocked, mentioned they were hurt they were never asked. I had to do damage control. My mom cried when she saw the diamond earrings and thanked him for loving me so much.   
4. I model and wear a lot of costume jewelry, I've never had real jewelry but the ring felt very light and I was shocked at how similar it was to costume jewelry. I didn't mention it at the time because it was so pretty. My family all commented on how expensive it must have been and he agreed it was scary to travel with it.  
5. I asked if this meant he was divorced, he said no but he was tired of waiting for her timeline.   
6. He did not have another hotel lined up. He proposed in front of a hotel that I dreamed of staying in, so foolishly I thought he got us a night there. I found out at 11pm we did not have a hotel booked. I booked and got us a hotel.   
7. I then found ""S925"" on the inside of the ring and my ears were BURNING. Again I've never had nice jewelry so I was panicking that maybe I was allergic to gold too.   
I then looked up the ring box name. It said very clearly the rings were silver, they were cubic zirconia, the earrings as well, and they had a buy one get a second 50% off sale and free earrings.   
I immediately felt incredibly embarrassed by being so loud about my ring on social media and how excited I was. I am truly obsessed with the design but seeing that it really was just costume jewelry made my heart sink. 

It's been 6 months now. He is still not divorced. I found the ""real"" version of my ring online and he wanted to buy it right away but I said to just wait until his condo sells and then it felt like I was choosing the ring. The ring now burns my finger because the gold coating has mostly come off of the back side because I wear it every day, it is incredibly cloudy, and every time I Facetime my mom she asks why I'm not wearing my diamond earrings. I tell her they are saved for special occasions as I don't want to throw him under the bus. I haven't told anyone any of this. When I visited friends in another city and they commented on the cloudiness of the gem I said it was my travel ring. On that visit he asked me to look up something on our laptops history and in doing so I found when he bought the ring. 

4:51pm On a Jewelers site I feel in love with (affordable (under 500), but everything is custom and needs 2 weeks)  
4:52pm (5 days before our flight) Google search ""cheap affordable engagement rings FAST shipping""  
4:53pm found the site   
4:55pm link to engagement ring  
4:56pm add to cart  
4:58pm second ring add to cart  
4:59pm earrings add to cart  
5:04pm shipping confirmed

He had claimed to me he had been duped and he was full of shame the ring wasn't a lab diamond as he thought. Turns out he spent 10 minutes on a ring that is meant to be for me to wear forever. Again, the design is incredible, but it says clearly it is not a diamond and it is silver. When I found this I quickly googled ""\*City we were in\* \*themepark\* Photographers"" and I found dozens that do it for english speakers. He also told me he had tried to search but couldn't find any. I asked him to show me his phone history and he never even looked. He admitted he thought the video would be enough, but now that video is 90% some dudes ass. 

I know I should feel happy we are engaged but I feel so small and invisible. I can't plan the wedding because I don't know when we will be free of his ex. I feel for him because his ex is literally insane, but I didn't want to bring any of this court things into our next era of our relationship. Our day to day is incredible, I feel so loved when he makes me coffee or food, or does small things for me. This just knocked the wind out of me. Am I being selfish? For wanting to be worth someone spending time and effort to plan for me? I really don't like having to lie about a partners behaviors again to save face. I feel sick and I want to move past this to have the beautiful life I feel we will have, but I don't know how to move past this huge life event that was another disappointment.

I love anything outdoors during the warmer months, hiking, kayaking, camping, or just exploring new places and soaking up fresh air. There is something about being outside that always resets my mind and energy.

In the winter, I slow down a bit and become more of a homebody. I enjoy reading, bingeing TV shows, sipping coffee, and just relaxing in a cozy environment. Quiet nights in can be just as fun as an adventurous day outdoors.

I’m friendly, laid back, and when I get comfortable around someone, I can be pretty silly and playful. I love making people laugh and enjoy humor in all its forms.

I value honesty, consistency, and someone who enjoys sharing stories, ideas, or even just random thoughts about life. I think friendships grow best when there is an easy, natural connection.

I’m open to chatting with anyone, whether you’re nearby or further away. I enjoy discussing hobbies, life, experiences, or just sharing fun, random moments. If you’re looking for someone who is attentive, genuinely interested in getting to know people, and enjoys both meaningful conversation and lighthearted fun, I would love to hear from you!

1pu1i1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Selfhelpbooks/comments/1pu1i1m/why_be_positive_might_be_making_you_feel_worse/,Why “Be Positive” Might Be Making You Feel Worse,"# And What to Do Instead for a Healthier, Happier Outlook

We’ve all heard the advice: *“Just be positive!”*  
It’s everywhere—from Instagram captions to coffee mugs to unsolicited comments when you’re visibly stressed out at work. But here’s the truth: **constant positivity isn’t always helpful.** In fact, trying to force a smile when life’s a mess can leave you feeling more drained—not less.

Welcome to the age of *toxic positivity*—the idea that you must always look on the bright side, no matter what’s actually going on. While it’s well-intentioned, it often does more harm than good by invalidating real emotions and turning struggle into something shameful.

If you've ever felt guilty for feeling bad, you're not broken—you’re human. And there's a better way to feel good again.

# You Don’t Need to Be Happy All the Time

Here’s the big shift:  
**You don’t need to chase constant joy. You just need to stop fighting reality.**

Life is messy. Stressful. Sometimes even absurd. And that’s normal. The goal isn’t to deny your difficult emotions—it’s to acknowledge them, learn from them, and lighten their load with humor, perspective, and small shifts in how you respond.

Real happiness doesn’t come from pretending. It comes from honesty, resilience, and learning how to find calm in the chaos—not escape from it.

# The Power of Tiny Shifts (a.k.a. You Don’t Need a Personality Overhaul)

Despite what New Year’s resolutions might suggest, **you don’t have to become a whole new person overnight.** In fact, research shows that trying to make massive emotional shifts all at once rarely works.

Why? Because our brains don’t flip like a switch—they rewire slowly, through repetition. It’s called *neuroplasticity*. Every time you choose a more helpful response to a stressful situation—even a tiny one—you strengthen your brain’s “calm muscle.”

Think:

* Pausing to laugh at something instead of spiraling.
* Reframing a bad day as “a weird chapter” instead of a disaster.
* Noticing the thought that says “I can’t handle this” and answering with “Maybe I can—just not all at once.”

These tiny moves might seem small, but over time, they change everything.

# Choose Real Over Perfect

The healthiest people aren’t those who are always cheerful—they’re the ones who are **emotionally honest** and know how to *bounce back*.

They feel their feelings.  
They allow bad days.  
And they’ve learned how to *laugh without checking if it’s the “right time.”*

One of the most underrated emotional skills? **Being okay with imperfection.** That includes yours *and* everyone else’s.

# Positivity Doesn’t Mean Pressure

Let’s be clear: positivity itself isn’t bad. But when it becomes a demand—something you *must* maintain at all times—it becomes a weight.

Real positivity is flexible. It leaves space for off days, weird moods, awkward situations, and thoughts that don’t fit in a motivational meme. It allows you to feel what you feel, without getting stuck there.

So if you’re tired of fake smiles and toxic pep talks, here’s your permission slip:

You’re allowed to be a work-in-progress.  
You’re allowed to laugh before you have it all figured out.  
And you’re allowed to feel better—without pretending you always do.

# Want a Simple Way to Shift Your Mindset This Year?

If you’d like daily encouragement that’s light, real, and even funny when it needs to be, check out *Happiness Guaranteed (or Your Misery Back)*. It’s a book of 365 short reflections—one for each day—designed to help you stay sane, steady, and a little more joyful through the ups and downs of real life.

No pressure. No fluff. Just a page a day that makes it easier to be human.

I figured I would spin up a new project and thought, why not Graylog. Easy win. Sounds fun. No risk. Famous last words.

I went downstairs, made a cappuccino, came back up, sat down, took a sip, and thought to myself, this is peak living. Let’s play.

Installed Graylog. Flawless. Decided to go all in and push every single Cisco Firepower log into it. And I mean all of them. The stream lit up like a christmas tree and i was singing rudolph the red nose reindeer. Logs pouring in. Pure dopamine, tears running down my face from emotion. Everything working exactly as it should.

Then the mood changed.

Hundreds of entries like this started flying past me clearly catching me up:

%FTD-2-106017: Deny IP due to Land Attack from 185.xx.xx.xx to 185.xx.xx.xx

The firewall was like ""Thank F$%K you are here, I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO REACH YOU!!""

At first it was proper “what have I done” terror, apologizing to Cisco'lina for failing her. Then I noticed the source and destination IP were my own static public IP. That helped a bit, but also raised a much worse question.

Once I wiped the tears away i thought what in all of homelabbing did I break.

I spent the first hour doing the rounds. NAT rules. Access rules. FDM log tables. Everything looked sane. The traffic seemed to be between my main desktop and one of my Proxmox hosts, specifically on the WireGuard ports.

That was the moment it clicked.

I have NetBird running on my desktop. I also have it running on my Proxmox hosts. That’s intentional for my setup. I use it to reach an offsite machine at my parents’ place for PVE backups and a few other bits.

A few weeks back, while fixing a routing issue, I had tweaked a netbird policy. I added my desktop into a rule that routes traffic between my PVE hosts and the offsite machine.

And there it was.

I had built myself a lovely little routing loop.

Desktop traffic goes into NetBird. NetBird routes it back onsite. Firewall sees the same IP talking to itself repeatedly at speed and quite rightly screams “LAND ATTACK” and drops it. 

It only really kicked off when I opened the PVE web interface in my browser, which explains why it suddenly exploded into life.

After a couple of hours of mild panic, a lot of rule checking, and questioning my own competence in this homelabbing world, I fixed the route.

The logs stopped instantly.

No attack. No compromise. Just a textbook example of how ADHD and networking comes with its challenges, and how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with policy routing.

Graylog did exactly what it was supposed to do. Firepower did exactly what it was supposed to do. Netbird was just following instructions, the very instructions i had given it!

The only weak link in the chain was the bloke holding the coffee.

I’m looking for testers for my new app, **FitCheck**.

We’ve all had that feeling: a closet full of clothes, but ""nothing to wear."" Existing closet apps often fail because they don't account for laundry or the weather. I built FitCheck to fix that. It’s a digital closet that uses AI to curate outfits based on your actual inventory, the local forecast, and what is currently clean.

**Key Features to Test:**

* **Effortless Import:** Snap a photo, and the app removes the background and auto-tags category, color, and style.
* **AI Personal Stylist:** Ask for a specific vibe (e.g., ""Style me for a coffee date, it's 60°"") and get suggestions from your own wardrobe.
* **Weather-Smart:** The app checks your local forecast to ensure you aren't wearing suede in the rain.
* **The Smart Hamper:** The feature I’m most excited about. You can mark items as ""dirty"" so the AI stops suggesting them until you mark them as washed.
* **Closet Insights:** Track cost-per-wear, forgotten items, and style patterns.

**Feedback I’m looking for:**

* How accurate is the background removal on your specific device?
* Do the AI outfit suggestions feel cohesive?
* General UI/UX flow.",2,1766514793.0,TestFlight,0,1.0,False

I am a dog owner, but this has become one of my biggest parenting pet peeves. I don’t know your dog, why am I supposed to trust what you say about it. We had our dog for 12 years and it never gave any indication of being unfriendly, and guess what… the dog nipped at our crawling baby and had to go live at Grandmas. My kid is also usually not interested in interacting with dogs as most of the time it comes out of nowhere while they’re doing something else.

Yesterday was the worst one yet… my 4 yo and I did a little Christmas outing and are having lunch at a local diner (indoors). We’re seated in a booth across from each other sharing a fruit bowl and having hot choc and coffee while we wait for the rest of our food. Out of nowhere a woman of an older demo appears to my left at the end of the table, holding a Yorkie or something over our table, at face level toward my child. I immediately put my left hand up between the dog and my kid and the woman says “hey sweetie…you didn’t even know he was here did you…he’s a good boy.” I gave a fake chuckle like we weren’t interested and my kid looks at me confused. A couple beats go by while I think of what to say. I have a couple friendly thoughts but I’m working on being more direct in all aspects of my life, especially regarding my kids and think: “F-this…” and I say “Ok, not while we’re eating.” Don’t think the woman replied and she turned and left the diner.

I’m getting tired of these interactions with dog owners. Curious if others feel similarly and what do you say in these types of situations?

(like an empty plaque on a grave,
like a voice to whom no name was ever given)

Every morning I wake up in the sticky embraces of dawn, in dream-images raped by the sunrise.
I don’t remember most of them – and that’s lucky.

And then, gasping from thirst, I find excuses for each new day, in which I do not exist – exercising in futility, inventing meaning each time anew – like giving names to clouds.

Self-defence through indifference, looking in the mirror and seeing a tired, alien face…
Asking yourself – what did I forget here, in this world?
In a world that’s been sold and cursed, where rivers run thick with blood and tears…
In a place where no one awaits your return…

Drinking coffee in the morning, turning into liquid dirt in the mouth.
Sensing the stale air of cafés, watching dust settle like snowflakes…

Eating food that lost its taste back in the soil, with a faint note of rot still clinging to it.

Talking about feelings – the kind you only know from Netflix and YouTube…
But how can you feel anything real when your whole world is just a wasteland?
A black, sloshing hole in the chest – that’s all that’s left…
One garden still remains, but spring will never return…

I became a mannequin amid the empty hustle of the world – made of ghosts, likes,
and endless consumption…
Where people move on autopilot: born, work, die –
caught in the loop of serving the system.
Home. Work. Weekend.

Only a false echo reaches from the truth.

Sometimes it seems to me that when it rains, houses turn gray – like giant tombstones
for those still alive, outwardly.

“Alright, hold on – let me just find my positivity mask in this handleless suitcase of mine, and we’ll continue…”

I say to everyone:
“Hello, how are you?”
Then cheerfully reply:
“I’m good, thanks” –
even though no one really cares anymore.

But I keep playing this performance, where the smile is a grimace of pain, and mechanical, soulless existence is elevated to a virtue – a model to imitate.

Vows and promises?
Lying in the gutter like filthy underwear.
Lust has buried love and the sense of beauty.
Children – just regret, a burden, and a tool of manipulation for personal gain.

I’m already tired of screaming into a leaden sky,
its color soaked in the will not to live.

And still – even here, in this world, no matter how bright the light, it can never replace the warmth of living presence.

I don’t know if everyone truly needs a living soul…
Not for salvation.
Not for support.
But to be in co-presence.
To be felt – not merely consumed.
To have someone look into your eyes, not just at you.

Perhaps for me, it will be “the Late Companion” –
a voice that comes when no one else answers anymore.

I stand on the shore, stripped bare by meaninglessness.
I hear the waves crashing – but it’s only the sea of sorrow…
What am I doing here?

Despair has sunk its claws deep into my soul.
Loneliness – its shroud soaked through with tears…

Ah yes, I forgot about hope…
There she is – I see her ugly silhouette, holding my hand.",1,1766514423.0,ShortSadStories,1,1.0,False

Part 1 

Waffles and Wonders 

The Golden Griddle sat in an unassuming edge of town. A diner with peeling yellow paint and a neon sign that flickered constantly against the early morning sky. Placed between a laundromat and a pawn shop displaying dusty guitars in the window. From the outside it was like a relic from a forgotten time. But once you stepped inside it transformed. The air held the warm smell of maple syrup and bacon luring any visitor into a lingering comfort. The burgundy vinyl booth was worn but comfortable and the walls lined with pictures of various kids' sports teams they had sponsored framed alongside newspaper clippings in a faded yellow. The place had a history that felt like home. For me and Rob, it was sacred. Our twice monthly ritual since high school that stuck with us into our twenties. 

Every Tuesday and Friday morning at 8 a.m. we claimed the same booth in the back, ordered waffles and bacon and traded stories about whatever craziness life was throwing at us since the last time. That Tuesday, something was off. As Rob slid into the booth across from me, he didn't seem like the same guy I'd known for over a decade. Usually, he sat slumped down a little, perpetually hunched over from years of bad luck, especially in love. Not today, though. He sat straight up, looking taller, his eyes beaming with a restless energy I hadn't seen in him since we were coming up with schemes on sneaking into the movie theater as teens. He attacked his waffle with his fork, slicing it into perfect mini squares, but he didn't eat. He looked up at me and grinned. He didn't look like the Rob I knew. The one who stumbled through life with a quiet laugh and the promise to do better next time. 

I leaned back in my seat squinting against the early spring pouring in through the window. It bounced off the scratched tabletop and reflected off my plate. One of those mornings where everything felt bright, too insistent. Cheryl, our waitress swung by to refill our coffees. I sipped mine, letting it ground me. I studied Rob and he was practically glowing with a dumb, unstoppable smile plastered on his face. We'd been friends since tenth grade, when he reamed me in the face with a dodgeball. Instead of taking a swing at him, I laughed and the friendship grew from there. Him the clumsy optimist, me the reserved skeptic keeping us level. I'd seen him through lost jobs, car wrecks, and a love life that was more like a punchline. Once Cheryl had shuffled off to a table of truckers, Rob took a long sip of his coffee, set the mug on the table with a clink, and leaned forward. His elbows hit the table with enough force to tip the salt shaker.
""I met someone,"" he said. The words landed sharp and sudden, like flipping a light switch. His voice cracked with excitement, and he shifted in his seat, restless as a kid. Rob hadn’t been this happy about meeting someone in ages, not after his recent string of disasters. I thought of Lisa, the vegan, who dumped him over a cheeseburger, Tara, the still life artist who left a drawing of oranges on his door instead of a breakup note, and Jenna, the bartender, who took off with his car and stranded him in the next town over. I set my fork down and raised an eyebrow.

""Spill it. Who is she?"" ""Her name's Marina. We met last night at the beach."" His grin somehow got wider. ""The beach?"" I frowned. We lived at least twenty miles inland, and Rob wasn't the type to drive all the way out there on a whim, especially on a Monday. ""What were you doing at the beach?"" ""Couldn't sleep,"" he said, dismissive. ""So I drove out, thought I'd walk it off. And there she was standing by the water. She smiled at me like we'd known each other forever."" 

I nodded and tried to picture it. Rob was a creature of routine: same diner, same apartment, same faded green hoodie he wore since college. A midnight walk on the beach didn't sound like him, but he sounded too excited for me to challenge it. ""She taught me how to surf,"" he continued, his words tumbling out. ""Midnight surfing, dude. The waves were wild but she was great with that board. We stayed out there until 5 a.m."" ""You don't surf,"" I said blinking in disbelief. 

""I do now!"" He laughed loud enough to turn a few heads. ""She's incredible. I've never met anyone like her."" The sun climbed higher in the window as Cheryl came by again to offer more coffee. I waved her off, engaged in Rob's story. ""What's she like?"" I pressed. ""Details."" He hesitated and for the first time that morning, his smile faltered. He ran his hand through his hair nervously. ""She's special. She's got this energy. I can't explain it. She's amazing."" I waited. Nothing else came. ""That's it?"" I said, half-laughing. ""Hair color? Job? Does she have a pet shark?"" He snorted, almost nervous. ""She's just amazing,"" he repeated while staring into his coffee. I speared my waffle as the sun glared down from my fork. Something was off about him that I couldn't nail down. Rob had so much failure in romance, I wanted to be happy for him. But that vagueness, that avoidance, it stayed with me. 

A couple weeks later, we were at my place for poker night. All the guys were there too. Jake, Mike, and Tim. The living room was a mess of beer cans and Dorito bags and the table a mess of chips and cards. I'd been hoping to dig into Marina again, since Rob got shifty and vague every time I asked about her. Mid-game, I threw a chip into the pot and informed the guys, ""Rob's got a new girl. Marina. They met at the beach."" Jake perked up, smirking. ""Picture. Now."" ""Yeah, let's see,"" Mike added with Tim nodding while sipping his beer. 

Rob rolled his eyes with a groan as he pulled out his phone. He scrolled for a moment, then slid it across the table. It was a selfie of him and Marina at the beach. She was stunning, long dark hair, high cheekbones, a quiet smile with pursed lips. Rob was beaming beside her, hair damp and wavy. ""Damn, dude,"" Jake whistled. ""Playing way above your weight class."" ""She's real?"" Mike squinted. ""Yes, she's real,"" Rob said taking his phone back. ""And awesome."" 

The guys razzed him about her being a scammer, then moved on. I watched Rob and the high was still there but an unease had crept in. Two months in, Rob began changing. At Jake's one night, he insisted we watch a documentary on crab fishing, then an Alaskan salmon special the week after that. He'd sit glued to the TV for hours muttering on and on about tides and nets. Eventually, we ditched the Griddle for seafood joints, sticky, crowded dives with plastic lobsters on the wall. The only thing close to breakfast was lukewarm and lumpy grits with rubbery shrimp. I missed the waffles. 

Eventually, I pushed to meet this woman. ""When do I get to see Marina?"" I asked over weak coffee at yet another mediocre seafood place. He shifted in the chair, bothered. ""She's out of town."" ""When's she back?"" ""She lives far. It's complicated."" He got short with me when I pressed him. ""She avoids tech. No phone or socials."" His beach story was still maddeningly vague. ""She was just there,"" he'd say with a shrug. The frustration twisted like a knot in my stomach. The next month, his new obsession was to obtain a Merchant Mariner Credential, rambling on about the freedom of the ocean. ""Marina says it's the life."" The Rob I knew was terrified to even go camping for one night. She was pulling him somewhere I couldn't follow and I wasn't sure if I'd get him back.

Part 2 

The House by the Tide 

Six months into whatever he had with Marina, Rob uprooted his life and moved out to Crestfall Harbor, a beach town 40 minutes away from civilization where the air smelled like brine and decay. The road to his place twisted up a winding road through the dunes. The sky was bleached in a grey tone and air was filled with fog.
I brought a housewarming gift of a bottle of wine and a potted plant with a peace offering. Rob had been very different lately.
Very jittery and distant as if he was being pulled by an unforgiving current. I knew it was her. Marina was the undertow pulling him under. 

The beach house was crouched low against the horizon with clapboards the color of dry bones. It wasn’t what I expected. It was less sunlit bungalow and more of a dark thing with small windows that looked like half-lidded eyes. The wind rustled against my jacket as I climbed the creaky wooden stairs up to the porch.
Rob met me at the door with a wide-eyed grin.
Inside, the air was damp and heavy with the scent of salt and a vague sweetness similar to overripe fruit. 

""Hey, bro! You made it,"" he said, slapping me playfully on the shoulder. The grip lingered a little too long and I noticed his nails were chewed down to the bone.
""Come in, come in."" 

The living room was surprisingly sparse, a leather sagging couch and a driftwood coffee table. The ceiling fan spun above us lighting the room. What really caught my eye was the portraits. Three hung crookedly on the far wall featuring Rob and Marina side by side. Their faces were frozen in an unnatural stillness. Her skin was like porcelain, large green eyes, with lips curved into a smile that didn’t reach them. In every frame, she appeared to loom over Rob. He looked smaller, somehow with his shoulders slumped forward as if he was afraid. I stared at it until Rob broke the silence. 

""She's resting,"" Rob said, as if he sensed my thoughts. ""Marina, she's been under the weather. You know how it is.""
He then ushered me to the couch. ""Want a beer?"" 

I nodded and tried to settle into the unusually deep cushions. He disappeared into the kitchen and came back with two bottles and then sat across from me. Knees bouncing we started talking. About the move. About the house. About a waiting list for some cargo ship job he just knew was coming. 

About the bait shop he worked in now, wrangling nightcrawlers and stocking shelves. The words fell out of him in a rush like a script he had rehearsed too many times before. None of it was Rob, not the Rob I knew. A guy who dreamed of welding scrap metal statues and maintained strict resistance to the idea of a 9 to 5. This was someone else's life that he was wearing like borrowed skin. 

Then he stood abruptly. ""Be right back,"" he mumbled and walked out of the room to the hallway. I counted the seconds, thirty, forty, he came back with a clenched jaw and right hand balled into a fist at his side.
He sat again and picked up where he left off, his voice wavering and stretched.
Five minutes later, he left again. ""Just checking something,"" he said, vanishing down the hall a second time. When he came back, his shirt was untucked and wrinkled and he was slightly sweaty. The third time, I heard a door creak open far away in the back of the house and a faint low murmur. He returned with a forced laugh. ""Old place. Something's always breaking down."" 

By the eighth time, I had started counting down. He had been a little longer that time. Two, maybe three minutes and when he reappeared his eyes were wide and jolted looking. He stayed standing this time and paced the room with his hands in his pockets. ""You good?"" I asked keeping my tone light despite how the air in the room felt charged. 

""Yeah, yeah,"" he said, quickly shaking his head. ""It’s Marina, you know. She needs me."" He glanced toward the hall, and the shadows on the walls moved. 

I didn't push. Just finished my beer and left.
But I did come back a couple more times over the next few weeks drawn by the last piece of the puzzle I couldn’t solve. There was something darker, too. Like watching a slow motion train wreck. Each visit was the same: the creaky house, the portraits that seemed to follow me, Marina always ""resting"" behind a closed door that never opened. Rob had become a ghost of himself with excuses piling up like driftwood. She's tired. She's not up to company. She sends her best. 

One night, over beers on the porch, I couldn’t let it slide anymore. I pulled my jacket tighter as the ocean air bit through it.
I leaned forward, elbows on my knees, and ripped off the band-aid.
""Okay dude. You've been with her almost a year. Every time I come over, she's 'resting.'
What's the deal? She pregnant or something?"" 

Rob froze with the bottle halfway to his lips. Then he laughed, with a sharp barking sound that didn't quite match his eyes.
""Pregnant? Nah, man, nothing like that.""
He took a swig and glanced sideways before continuing. ""She has this condition. Genetic thing. Wipes her out. She'd love to meet you, the guys, if she could. Just hasn't been in the cards."" 

I nodded, letting his words sink in. It made sense, in a neat and clinical way. A sick girlfriend, her doting boyfriend moves her out to a quiet house by the sea. I could believe it. I really wanted to, anyway. The wind picked up again, and I downed the rest of my beer ready to call it a night.
Then I heard it, a low and muffled sound, almost like singing coming from inside faint, but unmistakable. My head spun around toward the door, but Rob was already up, kicking his beer bottle onto the porch. 

""I'll be right back,"" he said, voice cracking.
I rolled my eyes at him as he bolted in the door slamming it behind him.
Alone with the wind on the waves and the sudden certainty that whatever was in that house wasn't resting anymore.

Part 3 

The Pull of the Deep 

Rob disappeared through the door and a low hum escaped the door. Then it sharpened into a sound reminiscent of a banshee’s wail, piercing the night clawing at my nerves. I stood frozen on the porch beer in hand while Rob’s voice filtered through the chaos. It sounded like pleading, his words faint but desperate against the ocean. Through his faint words he was pleading. I edged closer to the door, my pulse pounding needing to make sense of it all. 

""It’s not enough!"" I heard a shrill and furious woman's voice. ""I can get you something bigger. What if I got you a killer whale?"" Rob's tone was frantic, bargaining with whatever was there. ""Not enough. Send him in."" My stomach dropped. Though the words were muffled by the walls, they sank into me like a fish hook.


Send him in. Did she mean me? I wasn't sure if I'd heard right, but I wasn't going to stick around to find out. I set the beer down on the porch and bolted toward my car. I slipped on the sandy steps nearly stumbling as I grabbed for my keys from my pocket. I yanked the door open and slide into the car before locking the door. For a moment, I just sat there with my eyes closed attempting to suck in the air and calm myself.
When I finally opened my eyes, Rob's face was pressed against the driver’s side window. I jolted backwards in shock.
He looked nervous with wide and twitchy eyes. ""Come on, bro. You were going to leave without saying bye?""
I swallowed hard before speaking forcing myself to keep my voice steady.
""Sorry. I wasn’t sure if you were coming back."" Sweat dripped down my sweaty palms onto the steering wheel. 

What did he need to follow me out here for? 
""No worries, bro. I found your wallet in my couch.""
He held it up and attempted to push it to me through the car window. ""Do you have to go right now? Marina's feeling up to company and she wants to meet you. You ready?""
I froze and stared at him for a moment. Weeks of excuses and suddenly she's ""up for company""? The wallet was still heavy in my hand. Every instinct I could muster was telling me to turn the car on and drive away as fast as possible. But something, maybe curiosity, maybe stupidity, willed me to nod slowly, get out of the car and follow Rob back to the beach house.


That three minute walk felt like an eternity, as if I was walking death row. The breeze from the ocean felt chilling like ice as as it sliced through my thin jacket. The house loomed ahead and looked haunted as the thin, black silhouette towered behind it. The porch stairs creaked loudly under our weight, the door groaning as Rob pushed it open. Once inside, the air was humid and thick with the heavy scent of salt and that familiar sweet rot smell from before. The portraits of Rob and Marina on the wall appeared to watch us pass through the living room. We walked past it and Rob led me down a narrow hall I had never seen before.


Then I saw her. Marina stood in the doorway of a far back room, shielded by shadows. The photos in the living room didn't do her justice. Her emerald green eyes were piercing as they pinned me where I stood. Her skin was practically glowing, as flawless as and pale as porcelain. She held a soft, slight smile with full, pink lips. She was beautiful with a girl next door look, I thought to myself, then she opened her mouth. A row of jagged, sharp teeth retraced and her expression went from kind to feral in seconds. She looked at me with a disturbing hunger. My stomach dropped at the realization. 

""Rob, what the hell?"" My voice broke with pure terror as I stumbled backwards. ""I thought she was a catfish at first. Not a freaking cannibal siren."" 
Rob shrugged with an unnerving calm. His eyes were dull and wide. ""Actually, Piscivore is the politically correct term.""
He leaned back against the wall, hands in his pockets, as if we were shooting the breeze about the weather.


I didn't want to wait around for more. Rob was clearly being controlled by her in some way and wasn't going to help me at all. I turned and ran back towards the living room and into the kitchen. It was small with a breakfast bar in lieu of a table and all the window was open. The strainer was cluttered with ceramic dishes and rusted metal pans. I tore through the drawers searching for anything I could use  for defense. Knives were too dull. Forks were bent with missing teeth. Finally, I found a heavy metal serving spoon. I turned on the stove to high and held the spoon over the blue flame until it started to smoke. I could hear Marina's wet slithering footsteps echoing behind me. I turned around and thrust the burning spoon toward her face without hesitation.


She hissed in pain and recoiled backwards as soon as the spoon touched her cheek. Her body twisted like a marionette and she ran back to the hallway bumping into Rob behind her. He caught her and I kept inching forward trying to trap her in an enclosed space to give me time to get away. The spoon got closer to her mouth and she choked with a garguled sound as her eyes rolled into the back of her head.
She tried to scramble away but I followed her eventually cornering her at the back door. She raced through it with jerky and desperate movements. Marina went down the stairs and bolted toward the ocean in front of us. She tripped and began dragging herself along, leaving a slick trail behind her. I stayed on the back porch still holding the spoon in a defensive stance. I didn't want to hurt her, just to get her to leave me alone. 

As she reached the shore, her body stretched and she dove into the waves. I expected to see her swim away, but the ocean swallowed her up in near silence.
Then, Rob ran past me down the stairs shouting her name.
""Marina, Marina!"" His voice was panicked and raw, he didn't even glance in my direction. Running through the sand, he began pulling off his shirt, kicked off his shoes and plunged in after her wearing only his boxer shorts.


I stood still on the porch and waited. And waited. But, neither of them resurfaced even as the mid afternoon turned into the late night. For weeks, I returned to that shore. Every weekend, I'd make the trek to the scummy beach town, park at the beach house, and watch those waves. I told myself he'd come back. She must have passed her powers on to him, somehow, and he would swim back to shore, changed but alive. I'd stand on the porch until it got too dark and the cold seeped into my bones making me tremble. A few times, I thought I caught a glimpse of something, a small shadow breaking the ocean's surface. But, it was too quick and faint to catch and vanished as quickly as it appeared.
The house stayed empty, even a month later. I checked it once, poking my head through the windows and door without daring to enter myself, even though Rob had left the back door side open the night they vanished.
There was no police report. Rob had no family, so no one came snooping around trying to get information about his whereabouts.
His job called me and I told him all I knew: he had been acting very unusual and ran off chasing a girl.
Every now and then, I dream about them. Me on the porch holding that spoon. Rob's panicked voice yelling her name.
Marina's teeth sparkling in the low light. Rob engulfed by the tide.
I wake up gasping to the faint taste of salt, the ocean almost taunting me. I like to imagine he's still out there having grand adventures with her in the coral reef. Though it's just as likely she lured him down with her as another meal for the hunger she could never quell.",2,1766514288.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

(like an empty plaque on a grave,
like a voice to whom no name was ever given)

Every morning I wake up in the sticky embraces of dawn, in dream-images raped by the sunrise.
I don’t remember most of them – and that’s lucky.

And then, gasping from thirst, I find excuses for each new day, in which I do not exist – exercising in futility, inventing meaning each time anew – like giving names to clouds.

Self-defence through indifference, looking in the mirror and seeing a tired, alien face…
Asking yourself – what did I forget here, in this world?
In a world that’s been sold and cursed, where rivers run thick with blood and tears…
In a place where no one awaits your return…

Drinking coffee in the morning, turning into liquid dirt in the mouth.
Sensing the stale air of cafés, watching dust settle like snowflakes…

Eating food that lost its taste back in the soil, with a faint note of rot still clinging to it.

Talking about feelings – the kind you only know from Netflix and YouTube…
But how can you feel anything real when your whole world is just a wasteland?
A black, sloshing hole in the chest – that’s all that’s left…
One garden still remains, but spring will never return…

I became a mannequin amid the empty hustle of the world – made of ghosts, likes,
and endless consumption…
Where people move on autopilot: born, work, die –
caught in the loop of serving the system.
Home. Work. Weekend.

Only a false echo reaches from the truth.

Sometimes it seems to me that when it rains, houses turn gray – like giant tombstones
for those still alive, outwardly.

“Alright, hold on – let me just find my positivity mask in this handleless suitcase of mine, and we’ll continue…”

I say to everyone:
“Hello, how are you?”
Then cheerfully reply:
“I’m good, thanks” –
even though no one really cares anymore.

But I keep playing this performance, where the smile is a grimace of pain, and mechanical, soulless existence is elevated to a virtue – a model to imitate.

Vows and promises?
Lying in the gutter like filthy underwear.
Lust has buried love and the sense of beauty.
Children – just regret, a burden, and a tool of manipulation for personal gain.

I’m already tired of screaming into a leaden sky,
its color soaked in the will not to live.

And still – even here, in this world, no matter how bright the light, it can never replace the warmth of living presence.

I don’t know if everyone truly needs a living soul…
Not for salvation.
Not for support.
But to be in co-presence.
To be felt – not merely consumed.
To have someone look into your eyes, not just at you.

Perhaps for me, it will be “the Late Companion” –
a voice that comes when no one else answers anymore.

I stand on the shore, stripped bare by meaninglessness.
I hear the waves crashing – but it’s only the sea of sorrow…
What am I doing here?

Despair has sunk its claws deep into my soul.
Loneliness – its shroud soaked through with tears…

Ah yes, I forgot about hope…
There she is – I see her ugly silhouette, holding my hand.

I've got a bit of time off (lush) but can't stand doing nothing (thanks adhd)!

I was thinking about keeping myself occupied and potentially working on an app. There are many trackers and what not already out there but what I was thinking was something like a 'Parkrun Planner' app more for the Parkrun 'tourist' as it were. 

To start (and keeping it simple) I was thinking about using Parkrun data and weather information from the previous 2 days to try and predict likely conditions at any Parkrun. There would also be a way for people in the area to verify the conditions. 

Based on the predicted conditions the app could recommend regular trainers or trail runners. 

Building it out I thought it would be good to have the closest car parks and include stuff like the car park number for apps like Ring go etc. 
It would also be good to have local cafes and coffee shops with the distance from the end funnel and user reviews.

1pu0zze,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutCasteRebels/comments/1pu0zze/caste_and_modern_indian_slavery_a_must_read/,"Caste and modern Indian slavery, a must read","Two weeks ago, media channel quint published this [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thequint.com/amp/story/jobs/migrant-bonded-labour-abolition-rescued-workers-dalit-adivasi-obc-rehabilitation-survey-data-latest-news) that claimed that 63% of bonded labourers in this country are Dalits. To start with what bonded labour is 

>The definition provided by the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, is expansive, covering any labour service rendered under the compulsion of debt or social obligation where the worker loses the freedom to choose employment or movement. Despite this clear legal framework, the modern manifestation of bondage is often disguised as ""contract labour"" or ""advances against wages."" Historically rooted in the Jajmani system of caste-based patron-client relationships, bonded labour was traditionally viewed as a feudal vestige where generations of Dalit families served upper-caste landlords. In states like Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh, hereditary bondage (Halwaha or Charwaha) persists. Here, a Dalit family may be attached to a landlord's estate for generations due to an ancestral debt. The work involves ploughing, harvesting, and cattle rearing. The ""wages"" are often just grain and a small plot of land to live on, which can be revoked if the worker leaves.

To give you a more direct example 

Tej Kaur, a Dalit Sikh , has been cleaning and collecting cow dung for 30 years. Her walk is steady but the strain and struggle of working as a siri (bonded worker) for decades are visible on her. She was in her late 20s when her husband, a farm labourer who too worked as a siri for a landowning family in the village, lost a hand while using a chara machine (chaff cutter). With no means to sustain the family, Tej Kaur took up dung cleaning work.  

When the medical bills started piling up, Tej Kaur borrowed Rs 10,000 from an upper-caste Jat landowner who was known for giving loans to Budhlata’s farm workers. The interest rate was so usurious that Tej had to start doing goha work for the lender’s family at paltry wages. But it was never enough. Soon, she had to borrow further to repay the loan and survive. This meant taking on more goha work at the homes of her landowner-creditors.

The debt trap had been set in motion for Tej Kaur, and so was a life-time of bonded labour, the burden of which all the women in her family have shared. 

https://behanbox.com/2022/02/16/we-live-work-in-filth-and-are-treated-like-filth-punjabs-dalit-women-caught-in-cycle-of-bonded-work/

According to GSI :-


>The 2023 Global Slavery Index (GSI) posits that 11 million people in India are living in conditions of modern slavery, a figure that includes bonded labour, forced marriage, and human trafficking. 


So that means around 6.93 million Dalits are still living in conditions of near slavery in this country till this day and this is approximately 3.4% of dalit population. And if you still haven't realised it, the data is terrifying. 

But bonded labour has taken a new form in modern India's economy, now alongside bonded labourers are being recruited as brick kiln workers, construction workers, garment workers etc alongside agricultural labourers. Bihar supplies a vast portion of the workforce for the construction and agricultural sectors of Punjab and Haryana. The lack of local industry and the feudal agrarian structure in rural Bihar act as powerful push factors. Traffickers, known locally as sardars or jamadars, operate with impunity in districts like Katihar and Purnia, recruiting workers for distant kilns.

A statewide distribution of bonded labourers shows that states that absorb this labour are often the most economically advanced, relying on cheap, compliant bonded labour to subsidize their growth.


The agricultural prosperity of Punjab and Haryana states has long relied on migrant labour. The ""Green Revolution"" belt employs huge numbers of bonded labourers in agriculture and brick kilns. The relationship has shifted from local Dalit labour to long-distance migrant labour, specifically to circumvent local social changes where local Dalits refuse demeaning work. Tamil Nadu has high prevalence in specific sectors like textiles (Sumangali scheme), rice mills, and brick kilns. Karnataka attracts migrants for its booming construction sector (in Bengaluru) and plantation economy (coffee/areca nut). Significant numbers of bonded labourers have been identified in borewell digging and stone crushing units. Between 2016 and 2024, the state officially recorded 2,631 cases, identifying hotspots in Bengaluru Urban and Mandy. Maharashtra is a  destination for sugarcane cutters (internal migrants from within the state) and construction workers. The stone quarries of the state also employ bonded families from neighbouring states. Andhra Pradesh & Telangana are major hubs for the brick kiln industry, sourcing heavily from Odisha. The kilns here are notorious for their scale and the rigid control exercised over the Odia migrant workforce.

In Punjab's intensive farming belts, the bondage is contractual. Migrant labourers are brought in for the season. Their freedom is restricted to the farm premises. In hybrid cottonseed production (prevalent in Gujarat and South India), children are specifically recruited because their small hands are deemed better for the delicate cross-pollination work. These children work long hours in fields exposed to heavy pesticides.


Under the Sumangali (meaning ""happily married woman"") scheme, in the textile hubs of Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode), targets adolescent girls, mills recruit girls aged 14-18 from poor rural families. They are promised a lump sum payment (e.g., ₹30,000 - ₹50,000) at the end of a 3-year contract to be used for their dowry. The girls work in spinning mills and garment factories. They are housed in hostels located within the factory compound or heavily guarded offsite dormitories. Their movement is restricted; they cannot leave the hostel without a warden, their phone calls are monitored, and they are isolated from their families. The work involves 12-hour shifts, often including forced overtime. The ""apprenticeship"" loophole is used to pay them far below the minimum wage. Many girls do not complete the 3-year term due to health issues (respiratory illnesses from cotton dust) or harassment, in which case they often forfeit the accumulated lump sum.

The rapid urbanization of India is built on the backs of bonded migrant labour. Unskilled tasks such as digging, carrying loads, and mixing concrete. Workers are recruited from source states and brought to construction sites in cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai. They live in temporary tin-shed camps on the site. The labour contractor holds their wages, paying only a ""mess allowance"" for food. This ensures the workers cannot leave until the project—or a specific phase of it—is complete. If a worker leaves early, they forfeit their unpaid wages.

Data from the Ministry of Labour reveals a worrying decline in efficacy. In 2023-24, only 468 labourers were rehabilitated nationwide, which is far below what is really required.

Need to replace 2016 Samsung WF42H5000AW/A2 front load washer for parents, was going to surprise them for Christmas (or at least a printed out order)

What are some of the best options in the $600 - $1000 range? Anything available from Big Box retailers worth looking at or what brands to absolutely stay away from?

Would like to stick with a front load. Dial select is nice; no smart features or wifi type stuff, I hear the energy saver machines are worse at cleaning - it doesn't need to be bluetoothed to the coffee machine, but also not 1970s basic.

I'm 15 weeks pregnant for the first time in my life. So happy! Also very happy first trimester is over!!!

Months before my pregnancy, I started taking prenatals in the morning with breakfast (recommended by my IVF doctor).

I would feel sick shortly after I took the prenatals. Just blah! When I hit the first trimester, exhaustion hit me like a ton of bricks.

Now in second trimester, the fatigue never left. I kept complaining to my husband that I was dreading taking my prenatals because I was going to feel even worse. He suggested I take them at night, just how he takes his vitamins at night. GAME CHANGER. First night I felt icky, super drowsy when I woke up to pee. Since then - 

It's only been 3 days since I switched to night.

  
1. I sleep soooooo much better! I'm not up every hour like I had been pre-pregnancy up to now!!!

  
2. I wake up easier!!! I'm up and out of bed! 

  
3. I have more energy than I did before my pregnancy. I am not having any caffeine/coffee either!!!

  
4. No mashed potato brain in the morning! I feel like I'm functioning well and upbeat at work!

  
I feel like I won the lottery here. Of course, I'm also in my second trimester where a lot of the nausea and fatigue subsides. I dealt with nausea and fatigue prior to being pregnant, going forward I will only take my prenatals and vitamins at night!
