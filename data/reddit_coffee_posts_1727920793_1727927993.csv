1fuz71g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1fuz71g/changing_symptoms/,Changing symptoms,"Hey gang, in July I (30 M) was diagnosed chronic, moderate gastritis, no H. Pylori. Cause almost definitely due to drinking habits. I quit booze, coffee, acidic foods, everything I’ve read on here. I was prescribed 40 mg Nexium extended release.

My symptoms have changed in the last 2 months since all these habit + medication differences.

Rather than the sharp stomach pains, and acute gastritis attacks that would leave me bedridden for 36 hours, I instead feel nausea and trapped gas. I eat high fiber foods to combat this which works-ish. Flare ups aren’t as bad. I’m not yet enjoying life in the same way, as I once had, but things are manageable.

My question is are these changes in symptoms normal? Is it a step of healing? Or, are these different symptoms due to the Nexium I’ve been taking? The timeline does add up.",1,1727927903.0,Gastritis,1,0.99,False

I started because I work out 6 days a week and my weight hasn’t budged at all. I have been really nervous about keto flu because I have a physically demanding job and I don’t want to be miserable during the day so I haven’t done any cardio, only lifting since I started (I get cardio at work too tbh). I have had weight gain issues in the past. 

A normal day of eating so far is 3 eggs in butter with uncured sugar free bacon for breakfast, some steak and either shrimp or salmon for one meal, black coffee before work and I’m usually pretty hungry during/after work so another meal would be ground beef and or the steak/seafood. If I need something in between boiled eggs and if I’m feeling snacky pork rinds. 

I haven’t had any symptoms at all other than being thirsty and peeing a ton. My gut is regular, I’m not crazy hungry, my head doesn’t hurt I feel fine. And I stepped on the scale today and have gained 1.7 lbs. I’m trying not to be discouraged! Any fixes I can add to this to get that weight loss going? 

Edit to add I’m taking electrolytes,  fiber gummies (no sugar or carbs in those) and I’m still taking my greens powder because like I said in the beginning, my job can be really active and I’m afraid of being too sick. ",1,1727927587.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

1fuyzkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1fuyzkp/im_so_conflicted/,I'm so conflicted,"There's a long story that I can share if people want but I'll just give the quick version.

I ended up typing far more than expected as usual. If you want to read it all, that's great. I honestly don't care. Here's the short of it: I like a girl but I can't decide if she likes me or not. We've kinda been on two dates but they were never clarified as such. I asked her to a picnic and a movie but she seemed like she really was interested, but busy this weekend. I got a rain check. Now I really want to confess but I can't find a good time or place. Texting would definitely be easier, but she isn't a fan of texting. So now I don't know what to do. 

I have a crush on a girl and ask her to coffee. She accepts then asks if I want to go grocery shopping with her after we were done. I was confused but also kinda excited cause I thought it could mean she liked me. 

Later I text her and she ends up saying we should cook or bake together next time. This also excited me. So we baked cookies and banana bread together.

Over time she's made multiple comments that make me think she likes me and multiple that make me think otherwise. 

A lot of people I know are telling me almost certainly that she likes me by what I told them. So after too many people trying to convince me, I'm finally starting to think she likes me.

Its just weird. She doesn't really behave how I would expect if she liked me. I was standing with her and a mutual friend earlier and she seemed just completely disinterested in me. She still laughed at jokes and continued conversations like just normal people. Which I thought was odd since the couple times it was just the two of us (also outside of school) she was much different. Very energetic, almost a constant smile, and we could keep talking for hours. So I don't get why when we aren't hanging out, she seems to treat me like kind of a friend. Someone you talk to but don't really care if they're there or not.

Anyway, so I texted her earlier asking if she wanted to go on a picnic and watch a movie. I thought this would be something that was just outright seen as a date. Coffee and baking could be friends, sure. But combine those then with a picnic and a movie, I figure it's obvious.

Anyway, I planned to confess during the picnic. Or at least try to. After I asked, she said ""that honestly sounds like so much fun but I'm completely booked this weekend"" I replied ""okay, that's fine! Rain check?"" her again ""rain check"". 

So I mean I guess that went well? I'm just disappointed now cause I was really counting on telling her at the picnic. The soonest we could do it would be next weekend, but I don't even know if she'll be free. 

I want to confess sooner than later because it's taking a serious strain on me mentally cause I have horrible anxiety and this just keeps making my brain go between her liking me and not, constantly. 

I would like to confess in private, or at least something more private than school near friends. Just cause it's something personal. But the only time that would be, is at the picnic (or any other kind of date). 

I could text her, but that feels kinda wrong. She doesn't like texting all too much as is. It would surely be a lot easier for me then. And she could have time to process if she needs. I'm just not sure it's the best idea. 

So that's what I need help with. When and how do I confess? ",1,1727927155.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I am NOT:
A “lifestyle coach”
A “manosphere influencer”
An expert on this topic

But I AM:
Providing my perspective based off of my life experiences in hopes of helping men of my generation.

This post comes as a response to the hundreds of posts on this subreddit (many from incels as trying to radicalize us) bringing up the “male loneliness crisis” and how too many young men seem to live solitary lives.
And it is true that men are feeling higher rates of loneliness than say 10 or 20 years ago. But what I do not agree with is who and what we are blaming for it. I will list some proposed causes of this crisis from this subreddit and say my thoughts about them.

The “third space” and their disappearance:
This one interests me because I’m fascinated with urban planning and how cities are designed and used. Basically a third space is any place aside from work or home (the first and second spaces) that can be used to hang out and socialize. Think of parks, coffee shops, city plazas and similar types of areas. While I do believe that the decrease of these spaces is a factor in the decrease of socialization I do also have a counter example from personal experience. I live on a college campus with all of these things within walking distance. They are accessible by public transport and all that. But I still hear stories of roommates that never leave their rooms or talk to anybody, so that means that cannot be the only factor.

Online dating and how women’s standards are “too high”:
I think that men these days put too much effort towards getting into a romantic/sexual relationship. They believe that their self worth is determined by their relationship status and feel awful about themselves when they’re not in one. Why do you think that men outnumber women on dating apps? It’s because women have realized that they don’t have to be in a relationship, they can find self worth in other things. Also, women tend to be pickier on dating apps because they have more to choose from.

Finally, what I do believe is responsible for the high rates of loneliness in men is well… men. Too many men would rather play video games late into the night than leave their room and meet people in real life. Too many men would rather watch porn than find a partner that loves them. And it’s because of fear. And the cause of that fear is uncertainty. And men feel this uncertainty because they lack the support groups (friends, trusted peers) that tell them that their feelings are okay. And why do you think that men don’t have these support groups? Because they would rather stay inside all day and do the things previously stated. Resulting in a positive feedback loop of misery.

So, in order to break this cycle, we must first take accountability for the situation we put ourselves through. Then we find our own support groups. I’m not certain if what I propose would work, but I do believe that it is a step in the right direction.",1,1727927037.0,GenZ,1,0.67,False

1fuyx4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingconfessions/comments/1fuyx4f/unspoken_desires_part_1/,Unspoken Desires - Part 1,"It all started in March 2018. I was 26 at the time, living in Noida, and used to come home from work everyday around 6:30 PM.

Ananya, my neighbor, was a 31-year-old woman, beautiful but with loneliness in her eyes. Every evening, she would walk around the park with her young son, Samarth. Her husband worked abroad. She seemed alone, burdened by the responsibilities of raising a child and managing the household all on her own.

One day, while playing with Samarth at the park, I struck up a conversation with her. At first, it was casual talk about the weather, work, and the struggles of raising a toddler. But soon enough, I found excuses to linger longer. I’d brush against her hand while handing her Samarth’s toys, and each time, I felt a spark I couldn’t ignore.

Our friendship grew naturally from there. After a few days of chatting at the park, we exchanged numbers, and that opened up a new world of communication between us. At first, it was just forwarded WhatsApp jokes & memes. But as days turned into weeks, our conversations deepened. We started chatting late at night, sharing stories about our lives. Slowly, Ananya began to open up to me, revealing the loneliness she felt in her husband’s absence. The time zone difference made it hard for them to talk regularly, and she admitted that sometimes it felt like she was raising Samarth all alone.

She confessed one night. “I don’t have anyone to talk to. Everyone assumes I’m okay just because I keep myself busy, but sometimes I just want someone to ask how I’m really doing.”

I made sure to be there for her, offering her emotional support, always responding quickly to her messages, offering a sympathetic ear when she needed to vent. I liked making her smile, knowing that I was one of the few people who could make her forget her struggles.

But beneath the surface of this growing friendship, there was an undeniable tension. With every late-night chat, that tension grew.

One night, Ananya asked me.

“Rohan, why are you always online so late? Don’t you have a girlfriend or something?”

Her question surprised me. “No,” I replied, “Just friends. And honestly, I haven’t found anyone as mature and cute as you.”

There was a brief silence before she replied.

“Really?” she asked, a hint of surprise in her voice.

“Yeah,” I continued, “You’re someone who understands. I haven’t met anyone who makes me feel the way you do. It’s not just about the late-night chats; it’s about how you make me feel like I’m a part of your life.”

Ananya didn’t reply immediately. I could almost sense her processing my words, the silence between us filled with unspoken emotions. When she finally responded, her message was softer.

“I didn’t realize you felt that way. I guess we’ve become quite good friends”

“We have,” I answered. “And it’s more than I expected. I care about you, Ananya.”

There was a pause again, and then she sent a message that was both reassuring and revealing.

“I care about you too, Rohan. It’s nice to have someone who listens and understands. But things are complicated for me right now.”

I knew she was referring to her situation with her husband and the challenges she faced. I wanted to offer support without pushing her boundaries.

“I understand,” I said. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

Ananya seemed to appreciate my response. We continued chatting late into the night and it had become a cherished part of our routine.

One day, Ananya asked me for help. “Rohan,” she said, “Samarth's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to buy his birthday dress. Would you be able to drive us to the mall and help us out?”

I was thrilled at the chance to spend some more time with her and gladly agreed. We decided on a weekend for the outing. On the chosen day, I picked up Ananya and Samarth from their place, and we headed to the mall.

We spent the afternoon browsing through various stores, chatting and laughing as we searched for the perfect birthday dress for Samarth. Ananya’s eyes lit up with excitement as she found a cute outfit that she knew Samarth would love. It was heartwarming to see her so happy and engaged, and I enjoyed every moment of our time together.

As we continued to explore the mall, I noticed Ananya glancing at the clothing sections with a hint of hesitation. I saw an opportunity to have a little fun and suggested, “Why don’t you try on some clothes for yourself too? ”

Ananya looked at me, slightly taken aback. “I’ve been so focused on Samarth’s needs. I haven’t really thought about shopping for myself.”

I insisted, “Come on, it’ll be fun. You deserve it.”

We made our way to the women’s clothing section. As Ananya began browsing through tops and T-shirts. I decided to intervene and gently steered her towards the saree section.

“Hey, Ananya, why don’t you try on one of these sarees?” I suggested with a grin.

She stopped and looked at me in surprise. “A saree? When did you see me in a saree? ”

I couldn’t resist a playful response. “Let’s just say I’m a good stalker of social media profiles,” I said with a wink and a mischievous smile.

Ananya’s eyes widened in disbelief, but she couldn’t help but laugh. “so someone is closing looking at my old pics? ;)”

I shrugged with a chuckle. “Just paying attention. Plus, I think you’d look amazing in a saree.”

She considered my suggestion for a moment and then decided to give it a try. I waited outside the fitting room, eagerly anticipating the reveal. When she stepped out, wearing a beautiful black saree that accentuated her grace, elegance, and curves, my heart skipped a beat.

“You look stunning,” I said sincerely.

Ananya looked at herself in the mirror and smiled, though she seemed to hesitate. “It does look lovely, but I think I’ll buy it some other time.”

I understood her reluctance and didn’t press further. “Alright, but keep it in mind for the future. It suits you perfectly.”

We finished up our shopping and headed back home.

As the day of Samarth's birthday approached, Ananya was busy in preparations. I rang the doorbell of her house, and she answered with a look of surprise.

“Rohan? What are you doing here at this hour?” she asked surprisingly.

I gave her a warm smile and said, “I took the day off from work to help you out with the birthday party preparations. I thought it would be nice to assist you and make sure everything goes smoothly.”

Her eyes widened with appreciation, and I saw a hint of tears in them. “You really didn’t have to do that,” she said, her voice a mix of gratitude and emotion.

We both felt a deeper connection as we began to work together.  I suggested, “How about you handle the food preparations, and I’ll take care of decorating the room? That way, we can divide the tasks and get everything ready more efficiently.”

Ananya nodded in agreement, her smile widening. “Good idea, Rohan. I really appreciate your help.”

As she worked in the kitchen, preparing delicious treats for the party, she occasionally came out to check on the decorations. With a warm smile, she would offer me a taste of her dishes. “Here, try this,” she said, handing me a small sample. “Tell me what you think.”

I savored the flavors, nodding in approval. “This is too tasty, Ananya.”

Throughout the preparations, I kept asking her for suggestions on the decoration, making sure that our conversations went deeper and more meaningful.  It felt as though we were sharing pieces of ourselves, building a connection that went beyond mere friendship.

Once I had finished with the decorations, I headed home to get ready for the party. After a quick change, I returned to Ananya’s place, feeling a mix of excitement and anticipation.

When I arrived, the house was bustling with energy, and the party was in full swing. Samarth’s laughter filled the air, and the atmosphere was vibrant with joy and celebration. I was greeted by Ananya’s grateful smile as she saw me walk in.

“Thanks for coming back,” she said, her eyes reflecting the happiness of the day. “Everything looks fantastic.”

I smiled back, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. “I’m glad I could help. It’s been a great day, and seeing Samarth so happy makes it all worthwhile.”

As the party came to end and guests started to leave. I turned to Ananya with a determined look. “Why don’t I stay a bit longer and help you clean up?” I offered.

Ananya looked at me with a touch of concern. “Oh, Rohan, you’ve already done so much today. You don’t have to stay.”

I shook my head with a reassuring smile. “It’s no trouble at all. Tomorrow is Saturday, and I don’t have to go to the office. I can stick around and help you finish up.”

Her expression softened, and she seemed relieved. “Well, if you insist,” she said with a grateful smile. “I’ll put Samarth to sleep quickly, and then I’ll join you.”

She headed towards Samarth’s room, and I set to work. I moved around the house, collecting garbage, putting used utensils into the sink, and storing leftover food in the refrigerator. I moved efficiently, making sure everything was tidied up and in order.

When Ananya returned after almost 45 minutes, she was taken aback by how much I had managed to accomplish. The hall was nearly spotless, and the kitchen was well on its way to being cleaned.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with astonishment.

I shrugged with a grin. “Just wanted to make sure you didn’t have to do all the work yourself. ”

Her eyes welled up with tears as she looked around at the clean space. “Kaise mujhe tum mil gaye,” she said, her voice breaking slightly, referring to Ghajini movie song.

""Kismat pe aaye na yakeen"", I replied with a smile.

Without thinking, she pulled me into a hug. It was a casual, grateful and thanking embrace

“Thank you so much, Rohan,” she whispered. “I don’t think I would have managed without your help.”

I returned her hug, feeling a strong sense of fulfillment. “You don’t have to thank me. Friendship mai no thanks & sorry.”

As she pulled away, the tears in her eyes were mingled with a smile. The bond between us had grown even stronger through the day’s events, and as we finished the remaining tasks together. The moments of support had cemented our relationship in a way that went beyond friendship.

After we finished tidying up, I turned to Ananya with a playful smile. “You know, since I’ve done all this work, I think I deserve a return gift,” I said, half-jokingly.

Ananya looked at me with a raised eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Oh really? Tell me, what you want ?”

I shrugged, trying to look as serious as I could. “Well, I was thinking if you could treat me with some more sandwiches. They tasted amazing. Also, I am thinking if you could pair them with a nice cold coffee”

Ananya chuckled, a warm and genuine laugh. “You really know how to make an evening special. I’d be happy to make us some sandwiches & cold coffee.”

“Great,” I said. “I’ll set up the table, and you can handle the kitchen.”

As Ananya went to prepare for us, I set up a small table in the dining area. I made sure the atmosphere was cozy, with a couple of candles flickering softly. The aroma of the freshly baked sandwiches filled the room, adding to the homely feel.

When Ananya returned with the food, we sat down together, and I could see the gratitude and affection in her eyes. The conversation flowed easily as we enjoyed the sandwiches and coffee, sharing stories and laughter.

“This is perfect,” Ananya said, taking a sip of her cold coffee. “Thank you for making this evening so special.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I replied. 

As we finished our late-night snack and our conversation turned to more personal topics, I decided it was time for one final surprise. I reached into my bag and pulled out a neatly wrapped gift.

Ananya looked at it with curiosity. “What’s this?” she asked, her eyes reflecting a mix of surprise and confusion.

“Just a little something,” I said with a smile. “I wanted to give you a gift to show how much I appreciate everything.”

I handed her the package, and she unwrapped it carefully. Her eyes widened as she revealed the black saree that she had tried on at the mall.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with disbelief. “This is the saree I tried on the other day. I didn’t expect this.”

I nodded, feeling a sense of warmth at her reaction. “I remember how much you liked it, and I thought it would be a lovely way to show my appreciation for everything you’ve done and for the connection we share. You deserve it.”

Ananya looked at the saree, her eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t accept this. It’s too much.”

I reached out and gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “You’re my good friend, Ananya. It’s not too much. You’ve been there for me, and I wanted to do something special for you. Please accept it.”

She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. “Thank you, Rohan. This means a lot to me. I really didn’t expect anything like this.”
As we sat together, enjoying the evening, I couldn’t resist one last playful suggestion. “You know,” I said with a mischievous grin, “I think you should try on the saree now. It would be amazing to see how it looks on you.”

Ananya’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Alright, I’ll give it a go,” she said, heading towards the bedroom to change.

When she emerged, my breath caught in my throat. The saree draped around her gracefully, accentuating her elegance and beauty. My eyes widened, and I couldn’t help but let out a soft whistle of admiration.

“You look absolutely breathtaking,” I said, my voice filled with genuine awe.

Ananya smiled, a touch of shyness in her demeanor. “Is there anything missing?” she asked, twirling slightly to show off the saree.

I took a deep breath, mustering all my courage. “Actually, yes,” I replied, stepping closer to her. With a gentle touch, I reached up and loosened the bun that held her hair in place, letting it cascade down her back.

“There,” I said softly, “you look even more beautiful with your hair open.”

The moment felt charged. We both sensed that this was a pivotal moment, a point where the boundary between friendship and something more was about to be crossed. The attraction that had been building between us was undeniable, and as we gazed into each other’s eyes, it was clear that we both wanted this.

Our faces drew closer, and without a word, our lips met in a tender, romantic kiss. It was a kiss filled with longing and passion, a culmination of the emotions that had been simmering between us. My hands moved to her back, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric, while her fingers wove through my hair.

The kiss deepened, and we lost ourselves in the moment, knowing full well that this was crossing a line. But the emotions we had been holding back could no longer be contained. We wanted this, and the intensity of our feelings was too strong to ignore.

As we finally pulled away, our breaths mingling, I knew that this moment had changed everything. It was a turning point.

After that first kiss, Ananya and I kissed again, this time with even more passion. Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me closer. My hands roamed over her back and waist, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric of her saree.

Ananya shivered as my hands traced her body, my touch both gentle and firm. She held onto me, fingers weaving through my hair, savoring the way I held her. Our kisses were deep and urgent, making everything else fade into the background.

My hands traveled slowly, savoring the curve of her hips and the softness of her skin. Her breathing grew shallow and quick, pressing herself into me, feeling the intensity of our bond. The soft rustle of her saree against my fingers heightened the intimacy, every touch sending shivers through her body.

Then, I gently pushed Ananya against the wall. The cool surface made her shiver, and she quickly wrapped her arms around me, pulling me closer. Her heart raced, the contrast between the cold wall behind her and the heat of our body overwhelming her senses.

Every touch sent chills down her spine, making her breath quicken. She closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of my lips against her cool skin. My soft breathing near her ear, combined with the light pressure of my lips, made her lose herself in the moment.

""You look so sexy Ananya !!"", I said.

"" Then show me how much you want me, Rohan !!"" She replied with a naughtiness in her eyes.

Ananya felt cherished and desired in every possible way. She couldn’t remember the last time she had felt like this—so completely wanted and treasured.

Unable to handle the overwhelming pleasure, tenderness, and emotions coursing through her, Ananya turned around, her soft moans escaping as she whispered my name. Her back now faced me, and the anticipation in the air grew thicker.

Gently, I placed my lips against the curve of her neck, feeling the warmth of her skin under my touch. I kissed her slowly, savoring every inch of her as I trailed my lips down to her shoulder.


""Aaaaaahhhhhh Rohaannn.... Ohhhhh Fuckkkkk !!"" She moaned.

My hands moved from her shoulders, gliding down the length of her body until they found her waist. The delicate fabric of her saree barely shielded the soft curve of her skin beneath. 



Slowly, I slid my fingers across her stomach, feeling the warmth of her skin as I traced the outline of her waist. My hand lingered at her navel, teasing the sensitive skin there with gentle, circular motions.



She shivered at my touch, her body pressing back against mine as I rubbed my fingers gently around her bellybutton.



My lips continued their slow journey down the curve of Ananya’s back, tasting the warmth of her skin with every kiss. Her breathing grew unsteady, her body trembling slightly under my touch. I kissed the soft line of her spine, trailing my lips lower with each delicate movement.




Unable to bear the overwhelming pleasure any longer, Ananya turned to face me, her eyes clouded with desire. Without a moment’s hesitation, I gently moved the edge of her saree aside, revealing the smooth skin of her stomach. 



The sight of her navel, so perfectly inviting, drew me in. I leaned down, pressing a tender kiss just above it, feeling her shiver at my touch.



She moaned my name, ""Ohhhh Shhhitttt...Rohan...""




I lingered there, savoring the moment. My lips caressed her waist, kissing the soft skin around her belly. With slow, deliberate movements, I let my tongue gently trace the edge of her bellybutton, feeling her body quiver under my attention.

I licked the sensitive area, teasing her, as she gasped in response, her hands gripping my hair tighter.

Her soft moans filled the air, every sound an expression of the pleasure she was feeling. I kissed her again and again, making her feel cherished, adored. The taste of her skin, the heat of the moment—it was intoxicating. I wanted to show her, with every touch, how deeply she was loved, how much I desired her.

Each kiss, each soft lick against her bellybutton made her body respond in ways that words could never capture. Ananya’s moans grew more urgent, her fingers tugging gently at my hair, pulling me closer, as if she couldn’t get enough of the intensity between us.

long story short is anyone on this med that is having success? or any recommendations? still struggling and just trying to finish college :( my dr is far away and tired of hearing they don’t know why i’m still so tired and in pain. i know stress can really affect chrons but kind of inevitable being in my senior year and just trying to push thru. looking for any suggestions or words or advice !!!

1fuysf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingconfessions/comments/1fuysf6/unspoken_desires/,Unspoken Desires ,"It all started in March 2018. I was 26 at the time, living in Noida, and used to come home from work everyday around 6:30 PM.

Ananya, my neighbor, was a 31-year-old woman, beautiful but with loneliness in her eyes. Every evening, she would walk around the park with her young son, Samarth. Her husband worked abroad. She seemed alone, burdened by the responsibilities of raising a child and managing the household all on her own.

One day, while playing with Samarth at the park, I struck up a conversation with her. At first, it was casual talk about the weather, work, and the struggles of raising a toddler. But soon enough, I found excuses to linger longer. I’d brush against her hand while handing her Samarth’s toys, and each time, I felt a spark I couldn’t ignore.

Our friendship grew naturally from there. After a few days of chatting at the park, we exchanged numbers, and that opened up a new world of communication between us. At first, it was just forwarded WhatsApp jokes & memes. But as days turned into weeks, our conversations deepened. We started chatting late at night, sharing stories about our lives. Slowly, Ananya began to open up to me, revealing the loneliness she felt in her husband’s absence. The time zone difference made it hard for them to talk regularly, and she admitted that sometimes it felt like she was raising Samarth all alone.

She confessed one night. “I don’t have anyone to talk to. Everyone assumes I’m okay just because I keep myself busy, but sometimes I just want someone to ask how I’m really doing.”

I made sure to be there for her, offering her emotional support, always responding quickly to her messages, offering a sympathetic ear when she needed to vent. I liked making her smile, knowing that I was one of the few people who could make her forget her struggles.

But beneath the surface of this growing friendship, there was an undeniable tension. With every late-night chat, that tension grew.

One night, Ananya asked me.

“Rohan, why are you always online so late? Don’t you have a girlfriend or something?”

Her question surprised me. “No,” I replied, “Just friends. And honestly, I haven’t found anyone as mature and cute as you.”

There was a brief silence before she replied.

“Really?” she asked, a hint of surprise in her voice.

“Yeah,” I continued, “You’re someone who understands. I haven’t met anyone who makes me feel the way you do. It’s not just about the late-night chats; it’s about how you make me feel like I’m a part of your life.”

Ananya didn’t reply immediately. I could almost sense her processing my words, the silence between us filled with unspoken emotions. When she finally responded, her message was softer.

“I didn’t realize you felt that way. I guess we’ve become quite good friends”

“We have,” I answered. “And it’s more than I expected. I care about you, Ananya.”

There was a pause again, and then she sent a message that was both reassuring and revealing.

“I care about you too, Rohan. It’s nice to have someone who listens and understands. But things are complicated for me right now.”

I knew she was referring to her situation with her husband and the challenges she faced. I wanted to offer support without pushing her boundaries.

“I understand,” I said. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

Ananya seemed to appreciate my response. We continued chatting late into the night and it had become a cherished part of our routine.

One day, Ananya asked me for help. “Rohan,” she said, “Samarth's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to buy his birthday dress. Would you be able to drive us to the mall and help us out?”

I was thrilled at the chance to spend some more time with her and gladly agreed. We decided on a weekend for the outing. On the chosen day, I picked up Ananya and Samarth from their place, and we headed to the mall.

We spent the afternoon browsing through various stores, chatting and laughing as we searched for the perfect birthday dress for Samarth. Ananya’s eyes lit up with excitement as she found a cute outfit that she knew Samarth would love. It was heartwarming to see her so happy and engaged, and I enjoyed every moment of our time together.

As we continued to explore the mall, I noticed Ananya glancing at the clothing sections with a hint of hesitation. I saw an opportunity to have a little fun and suggested, “Why don’t you try on some clothes for yourself too? ”

Ananya looked at me, slightly taken aback. “I’ve been so focused on Samarth’s needs. I haven’t really thought about shopping for myself.”

I insisted, “Come on, it’ll be fun. You deserve it.”

We made our way to the women’s clothing section. As Ananya began browsing through tops and T-shirts. I decided to intervene and gently steered her towards the saree section.

“Hey, Ananya, why don’t you try on one of these sarees?” I suggested with a grin.

She stopped and looked at me in surprise. “A saree? When did you see me in a saree? ”

I couldn’t resist a playful response. “Let’s just say I’m a good stalker of social media profiles,” I said with a wink and a mischievous smile.

Ananya’s eyes widened in disbelief, but she couldn’t help but laugh. “so someone is closing looking at my old pics? ;)”

I shrugged with a chuckle. “Just paying attention. Plus, I think you’d look amazing in a saree.”

She considered my suggestion for a moment and then decided to give it a try. I waited outside the fitting room, eagerly anticipating the reveal. When she stepped out, wearing a beautiful black saree that accentuated her grace, elegance, and curves, my heart skipped a beat.

“You look stunning,” I said sincerely.

Ananya looked at herself in the mirror and smiled, though she seemed to hesitate. “It does look lovely, but I think I’ll buy it some other time.”

I understood her reluctance and didn’t press further. “Alright, but keep it in mind for the future. It suits you perfectly.”

We finished up our shopping and headed back home.

As the day of Samarth's birthday approached, Ananya was busy in preparations. I rang the doorbell of her house, and she answered with a look of surprise.

“Rohan? What are you doing here at this hour?” she asked surprisingly.

I gave her a warm smile and said, “I took the day off from work to help you out with the birthday party preparations. I thought it would be nice to assist you and make sure everything goes smoothly.”

Her eyes widened with appreciation, and I saw a hint of tears in them. “You really didn’t have to do that,” she said, her voice a mix of gratitude and emotion.

We both felt a deeper connection as we began to work together.  I suggested, “How about you handle the food preparations, and I’ll take care of decorating the room? That way, we can divide the tasks and get everything ready more efficiently.”

Ananya nodded in agreement, her smile widening. “Good idea, Rohan. I really appreciate your help.”

As she worked in the kitchen, preparing delicious treats for the party, she occasionally came out to check on the decorations. With a warm smile, she would offer me a taste of her dishes. “Here, try this,” she said, handing me a small sample. “Tell me what you think.”

I savored the flavors, nodding in approval. “This is too tasty, Ananya.”

Throughout the preparations, I kept asking her for suggestions on the decoration, making sure that our conversations went deeper and more meaningful.  It felt as though we were sharing pieces of ourselves, building a connection that went beyond mere friendship.

Once I had finished with the decorations, I headed home to get ready for the party. After a quick change, I returned to Ananya’s place, feeling a mix of excitement and anticipation.

When I arrived, the house was bustling with energy, and the party was in full swing. Samarth’s laughter filled the air, and the atmosphere was vibrant with joy and celebration. I was greeted by Ananya’s grateful smile as she saw me walk in.

“Thanks for coming back,” she said, her eyes reflecting the happiness of the day. “Everything looks fantastic.”

I smiled back, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. “I’m glad I could help. It’s been a great day, and seeing Samarth so happy makes it all worthwhile.”

As the party came to end and guests started to leave. I turned to Ananya with a determined look. “Why don’t I stay a bit longer and help you clean up?” I offered.

Ananya looked at me with a touch of concern. “Oh, Rohan, you’ve already done so much today. You don’t have to stay.”

I shook my head with a reassuring smile. “It’s no trouble at all. Tomorrow is Saturday, and I don’t have to go to the office. I can stick around and help you finish up.”

Her expression softened, and she seemed relieved. “Well, if you insist,” she said with a grateful smile. “I’ll put Samarth to sleep quickly, and then I’ll join you.”

She headed towards Samarth’s room, and I set to work. I moved around the house, collecting garbage, putting used utensils into the sink, and storing leftover food in the refrigerator. I moved efficiently, making sure everything was tidied up and in order.

When Ananya returned after almost 45 minutes, she was taken aback by how much I had managed to accomplish. The hall was nearly spotless, and the kitchen was well on its way to being cleaned.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with astonishment.

I shrugged with a grin. “Just wanted to make sure you didn’t have to do all the work yourself. ”

Her eyes welled up with tears as she looked around at the clean space. “Kaise mujhe tum mil gaye,” she said, her voice breaking slightly, referring to Ghajini movie song.

""Kismat pe aaye na yakeen"", I replied with a smile.

Without thinking, she pulled me into a hug. It was a casual, grateful and thanking embrace

“Thank you so much, Rohan,” she whispered. “I don’t think I would have managed without your help.”

I returned her hug, feeling a strong sense of fulfillment. “You don’t have to thank me. Friendship mai no thanks & sorry.”

As she pulled away, the tears in her eyes were mingled with a smile. The bond between us had grown even stronger through the day’s events, and as we finished the remaining tasks together. The moments of support had cemented our relationship in a way that went beyond friendship.

After we finished tidying up, I turned to Ananya with a playful smile. “You know, since I’ve done all this work, I think I deserve a return gift,” I said, half-jokingly.

Ananya looked at me with a raised eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Oh really? Tell me, what you want ?”

I shrugged, trying to look as serious as I could. “Well, I was thinking if you could treat me with some more sandwiches. They tasted amazing. Also, I am thinking if you could pair them with a nice cold coffee”

Ananya chuckled, a warm and genuine laugh. “You really know how to make an evening special. I’d be happy to make us some sandwiches & cold coffee.”

“Great,” I said. “I’ll set up the table, and you can handle the kitchen.”

As Ananya went to prepare for us, I set up a small table in the dining area. I made sure the atmosphere was cozy, with a couple of candles flickering softly. The aroma of the freshly baked sandwiches filled the room, adding to the homely feel.

When Ananya returned with the food, we sat down together, and I could see the gratitude and affection in her eyes. The conversation flowed easily as we enjoyed the sandwiches and coffee, sharing stories and laughter.

“This is perfect,” Ananya said, taking a sip of her cold coffee. “Thank you for making this evening so special.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I replied. 

As we finished our late-night snack and our conversation turned to more personal topics, I decided it was time for one final surprise. I reached into my bag and pulled out a neatly wrapped gift.

Ananya looked at it with curiosity. “What’s this?” she asked, her eyes reflecting a mix of surprise and confusion.

“Just a little something,” I said with a smile. “I wanted to give you a gift to show how much I appreciate everything.”

I handed her the package, and she unwrapped it carefully. Her eyes widened as she revealed the black saree that she had tried on at the mall.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with disbelief. “This is the saree I tried on the other day. I didn’t expect this.”

I nodded, feeling a sense of warmth at her reaction. “I remember how much you liked it, and I thought it would be a lovely way to show my appreciation for everything you’ve done and for the connection we share. You deserve it.”

Ananya looked at the saree, her eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t accept this. It’s too much.”

I reached out and gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “You’re my good friend, Ananya. It’s not too much. You’ve been there for me, and I wanted to do something special for you. Please accept it.”

She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. “Thank you, Rohan. This means a lot to me. I really didn’t expect anything like this.”
As we sat together, enjoying the evening, I couldn’t resist one last playful suggestion. “You know,” I said with a mischievous grin, “I think you should try on the saree now. It would be amazing to see how it looks on you.”

Ananya’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Alright, I’ll give it a go,” she said, heading towards the bedroom to change.

When she emerged, my breath caught in my throat. The saree draped around her gracefully, accentuating her elegance and beauty. My eyes widened, and I couldn’t help but let out a soft whistle of admiration.

“You look absolutely breathtaking,” I said, my voice filled with genuine awe.

Ananya smiled, a touch of shyness in her demeanor. “Is there anything missing?” she asked, twirling slightly to show off the saree.

I took a deep breath, mustering all my courage. “Actually, yes,” I replied, stepping closer to her. With a gentle touch, I reached up and loosened the bun that held her hair in place, letting it cascade down her back.

“There,” I said softly, “you look even more beautiful with your hair open.”

The moment felt charged. We both sensed that this was a pivotal moment, a point where the boundary between friendship and something more was about to be crossed. The attraction that had been building between us was undeniable, and as we gazed into each other’s eyes, it was clear that we both wanted this.

Our faces drew closer, and without a word, our lips met in a tender, romantic kiss. It was a kiss filled with longing and passion, a culmination of the emotions that had been simmering between us. My hands moved to her back, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric, while her fingers wove through my hair.

The kiss deepened, and we lost ourselves in the moment, knowing full well that this was crossing a line. But the emotions we had been holding back could no longer be contained. We wanted this, and the intensity of our feelings was too strong to ignore.

As we finally pulled away, our breaths mingling, I knew that this moment had changed everything. It was a turning point.

After that first kiss, Ananya and I kissed again, this time with even more passion. Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me closer. My hands roamed over her back and waist, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric of her saree.

Ananya shivered as my hands traced her body, my touch both gentle and firm. She held onto me, fingers weaving through my hair, savoring the way I held her. Our kisses were deep and urgent, making everything else fade into the background.

My hands traveled slowly, savoring the curve of her hips and the softness of her skin. Her breathing grew shallow and quick, pressing herself into me, feeling the intensity of our bond. The soft rustle of her saree against my fingers heightened the intimacy, every touch sending shivers through her body.

Then, I gently pushed Ananya against the wall. The cool surface made her shiver, and she quickly wrapped her arms around me, pulling me closer. Her heart raced, the contrast between the cold wall behind her and the heat of our body overwhelming her senses.

Every touch sent chills down her spine, making her breath quicken. She closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of my lips against her cool skin. My soft breathing near her ear, combined with the light pressure of my lips, made her lose herself in the moment.

""You look so sexy Ananya !!"", I said.

"" Then show me how much you want me, Rohan !!"" She replied with a naughtiness in her eyes.

Ananya felt cherished and desired in every possible way. She couldn’t remember the last time she had felt like this—so completely wanted and treasured.

Unable to handle the overwhelming pleasure, tenderness, and emotions coursing through her, Ananya turned around, her soft moans escaping as she whispered my name. Her back now faced me, and the anticipation in the air grew thicker.

Gently, I placed my lips against the curve of her neck, feeling the warmth of her skin under my touch. I kissed her slowly, savoring every inch of her as I trailed my lips down to her shoulder.


""Aaaaaahhhhhh Rohaannn.... Ohhhhh Fuckkkkk !!"" She moaned.

My hands moved from her shoulders, gliding down the length of her body until they found her waist. The delicate fabric of her saree barely shielded the soft curve of her skin beneath. 



Slowly, I slid my fingers across her stomach, feeling the warmth of her skin as I traced the outline of her waist. My hand lingered at her navel, teasing the sensitive skin there with gentle, circular motions.



She shivered at my touch, her body pressing back against mine as I rubbed my fingers gently around her bellybutton.



My lips continued their slow journey down the curve of Ananya’s back, tasting the warmth of her skin with every kiss. Her breathing grew unsteady, her body trembling slightly under my touch. I kissed the soft line of her spine, trailing my lips lower with each delicate movement.




Unable to bear the overwhelming pleasure any longer, Ananya turned to face me, her eyes clouded with desire. Without a moment’s hesitation, I gently moved the edge of her saree aside, revealing the smooth skin of her stomach. 



The sight of her navel, so perfectly inviting, drew me in. I leaned down, pressing a tender kiss just above it, feeling her shiver at my touch.



She moaned my name, ""Ohhhh Shhhitttt...Rohan...""




I lingered there, savoring the moment. My lips caressed her waist, kissing the soft skin around her belly. With slow, deliberate movements, I let my tongue gently trace the edge of her bellybutton, feeling her body quiver under my attention.

I licked the sensitive area, teasing her, as she gasped in response, her hands gripping my hair tighter.

Her soft moans filled the air, every sound an expression of the pleasure she was feeling. I kissed her again and again, making her feel cherished, adored. The taste of her skin, the heat of the moment—it was intoxicating. I wanted to show her, with every touch, how deeply she was loved, how much I desired her.

Each kiss, each soft lick against her bellybutton made her body respond in ways that words could never capture. Ananya’s moans grew more urgent, her fingers tugging gently at my hair, pulling me closer, as if she couldn’t get enough of the intensity between us.

My mother has worked so hard her entire life. She was raised in the projects by a single mom of three who didn't speak English and brought herself up by her d*mn self. I'm in a financial situation now where I can spoil her rotten, and I would really like to! 

This is her third visit since I've lived here for a while, and I've taken her to all the main ""touristy"" spots like the Empire State Building or the Met. 

She likes broadway so I'm taking her to Wicked. She likes horror films, cooking, excercising, cocktails, coffee, facials, and shopping on a budget. Like she will devour a TJ Maxx but will refuse to set foot in a Tiffany's. 

She dislikes massages, full-on spa days, museums, wine bars, and dives. 

She adores a mom and pop establishment, but I don't know any good ones in Manhattan, and she's only in for three days so I don't want to spend an hour going into queens. Her favorites are Indian and Thai.

1fuyqhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1fuyqhx/i_had_a_really_odd_experience_a_few_weeks_back/,I had a really odd experience a few weeks back with a delivery and I didn’t really process it all until now. ,"So a few weeks ago I was at my work office, I was having a bad morning, so I ordered coffee and a breakfast sandwich from my favorite local coffee place for delivery. I usually avoid doing this as much as possible because I work in one of those corporate america maze areas where it’s just office building after office building and it all looks the same. Deliveries always have a hard time getting there. 

Anyway, my food got picked up pretty quickly, so I was pleasantly surprised. I usually head down downstairs and stand outside when they’re about 2 minutes out just in case they can’t find the building. I put in the instructions to let me know when they’re close. 

So my dasher texts me about 2 minutes out saying  they’re almost here so I head downstairs and wait outside. I don’t see anyone coming. To paint a picture, my office building is basically in the back of this huge parking lot that holds like 5-6 other office buildings. I check my app and I see that my dasher is stopped in the right parking lot, but is like 2 buildings away, which is a very honest mistake. I call them, and they… decline my call? I keep calling them and then she answers and sounds very on edge and upset, saying she’s sorry but her phone isn’t working and she can’t find me. I was like, “what?? just drive back a little more, you’re almost here” and then she hung up on me!!! I’m trying to keep an eye out for her car which was a white SUV but I didn’t see one. The next few minutes was spent with me blowing up her phone, blowing up door dash support who of course won’t help me, until finally she answers. At this point I’ve been standing down there for 15 minutes. 

She starts apologizing profusely and said that her phone was glitching out because she spilled water on it the night before , I was like it’s whatever, can you just come drop it off please? She says yes yes of course. 

Then I look up and I notice a beat up , run down old Chevy sedan coming towards me. It’s clearly my door dasher , not in the car they said they were in, and the driver was a MAN. No this was not just a man with a womanly voice. When he spoke, he said “I’m sorry about that maam” and it was a deep male voice. Like imagine hearing Megan the Stallion talking, followed by Morgan Freeman talking. VERY distinct and unmistakable voice. 

So who the fuck was I talking to on the phone?? And whose fucking car was that and who WAS that and why were they off the grid and stopped at the wrong building for 15 minutes???? There were other people standing out front , just other office workers on a smoke break or phone call,
or just going in and out, so I was never alone out there. I just can’t help but wonder if that was someone with bad intentions who was maybe spying on me from a different car and was waiting until I was alone, then just gave up because I never really was. 

I should’ve reported it now that I think about it but I was having a record busy day at work and I had already wasted 20 min of my day so I had to get back upstairs and it slipped my mind. 

TLDR; A dasher was exhibiting odd behavior and wouldn’t drop off my food or answer my calls despite being a few buildings away. When I spoke to her on the phone, she was clearly a female, but the person who ended up delivering my food was a male in a completely different car than the one listed. I can’t help but wonder if they had bad intentions. I did not report it because I was at work and very busy. I should have. ",0,1727926282.0,doordash,2,0.5,False

Regardless of your stance on the occult, in my opinion the occultModTeam's response was uncalled for.  Like seriously, their response has nil to do with the post. They are answering a question that was never asked and making a faulty assumption as to the reasons why. As to why they removed my post I have my suspicions ranging from misaligned comprehension at best and the mods being malignantly obtuse with a possibility of coordination at the worst.

I could literally see in his eyes that he didn’t belong there and it struck a nerve. This image has been replaying in my mind and i never understood why until just today i learned something new: 

most of starbucks baked goods contain palm oil, which is a cheap filler used to mimic cocoa butter. forests in indonesia and malasia have been converted to palm oil estates, harming the habitat of tens of thousands of orangutans to the brink of extinction. there is roughly only about 50-65,000 left in the wild, at this rate they’ll likely be gone in the next 50 years. 

I know i can’t make anyone give up something but if it isn’t for them do it for the children ( and adults ) working in horrible conditions while being underpaid on starbucks coffee farms or the sick cows starbucks sources their milk from … or maybe because rainforests supply us with something we kinda need to survive! just to name a few. 


unfortunately i’ve worked for starbucks and like everything else in life, all they care about is money!!!!!!!

I dated a guy for about six weeks a few months ago, and we hit it off instantly on the first date - both agreed that we didn't want it to end. We had an 11/12 hour second date, and things moved pretty quickly. On the third date, he said that he was 8 months off of a serious relationship but open to a relationship if the connection/chemistry was there and then said he liked me a lot. He said that towards the end of the relationship, things had broken down to a point where he was pretty much over it pretty quickly. We had actually planned to go to NYC together for a joint birthday celebration (a train ride away) which would've been our sixth date, but his texting suddenly dropped off for a few days before the trip. I finally reached out saying I wasn't sure what was going on with the sudden lack of communication but that it seemed like he was losing interest. 

Later that day, he sent a long text back apologizing, saying that he really liked me a lot, that I was someone who he could fall for very easily, but that he was beginning to realize that we were moving too quickly and was hesitant to enter a relationship. He also said he'd never moved so quickly before. We ended up meeting in person to talk more about it, and he revealed that he had been in a six year relationship where he had been engaged for a couple of months. He was pretty open that his ex occasionally reaches out and he meets with her for coffee to discuss why things ended and said that the previous week, she had reached out again saying that she was more in love with him than ever and wanted another chance. He told her it was over, which took a pretty big emotional toll on him. Putting two and two together, it seems that maybe his ex reaching out made him realize he wasn't as over the relationship as he thought, and when I directly asked him if he wished he could work things out with her, he said ""No, but I'm still dealing with resentment and a lot of those other big emotions."" At the end of the convo, he told me that he personally made himself exclusive with me because it ""felt right"" but said he understood if I wanted to end things. I decided to continue, because it seemed he was genuinely interested in me since he had brought up exclusivity and I was in no rush to be in a relationship, even if I would've gladly agreed to be in one if he asked me. 

Two dates after that discussion, a friend actually found him on Hinge (but we matched on Bumble), and I confronted him about it and said he was what I was looking for and if he couldn't be exclusive, it would be better to end things. He said he had basically been swiping out of boredom, didn't converse with anyone on the apps and didn't want to meet with anyone new. Said he assumed as long as our apps were active, there was some degree of activity and that even though he didn't think it got better than me, he was beginning to realize that he was not in the right headspace to be dating, needed to take a long break, and agreed to end it. We had mutually agreed on an earlier date that the mutual attraction was too strong for us to be friends without it being really painful, so I think it was understood that we wouldn't try keeping in touch after that.

About 2.5 months after we stopped seeing/talking to each other, I actually ran into him, and he apologized again for how things ended, saying that it had nothing to do with me but that ""it was just too much."" I told him I understood but wished that he'd just ask me out again. He said ""I'll let you know,"" which brings me to my question -- do people actually mean it when they say these things? I honestly haven't met someone I clicked with so well and felt so comfortable with and feel like he'd be worth the wait, but after seeing how some of his other actions didn't align with his words while we were dating, I feel like he could also just be saying some bs. On the other hand, from our convos he knew me well enough to know that it's extremely important to me for people to mean what they say, and it would've been just as easy for him to say he'd rather not make any promises since there were pretty much no stakes in that convo (after all, we had already ended things, and this was just some chance meeting). Can anyone else comment on their experiences with this? Do people who say things like this actually try and come back eventually?",2,1727925160.0,dating,6,1.0,False

The city of Glass was not a kind place. Built at the end of the Resource Wars by a consortium of megacorporations, it was a shining testament to the power of Capitalism, and Free Commerce. From outside, the glass facade of the towers glittered in the light, seeming like a place of freedom and hope. And it was, really.

If you happened to be one of the wealthy and elite that lived on the upper levels.

The upper levels were called, by the locals, Topworld. The air was kept clean by discreet atmospheric scrubbers, the sun shone freely, and it was a truly spectacular sight. 

For those in the lower levels, called Undercity by most, it was a world of darkness. A land of rust, grime, and filthy air,  it was far from the clean air and sunshine of the Topworld. Their options were slim to none. Either join the corporate machine, and become an easily replaceable cog or join a gang and become embroiled in an endless struggle for territory and survival. 

For some, there was a third path. A dangerous one that often didn't end well for anyone involved. 

Rebellion.

No matter how pretty you dress up the cage, or how much you beat the occupants down, Humans always recognize the cage. Humans always want to escape.

For those that sensed the bars of debt and struggle that surrounded them, a voice whispered. 

Join us.

Whatever names they had previously were systematically eradicated, digital traces removed, and they became something else, something dangerous to the ivory tower elite that ruled those beneath them.

Deviants. Seditionists. Criminals. Terrorists. 

Rebels.

Many organized themselves into cells, waging silent and mostly ineffective war on the megacorps.

A.O. Corp, which controlled the weapons and police. The Janus Group, which dealt with the banking and finance industries. AllComm, the corporate media titan. They, among others, held the city in a credit covered fist. 

Rumors in the undercity spread without corporate oversight, word of mouth spreading the Whispers almost as fast as AllComm's propaganda machine. 

People who gave everything up to become ideas. Heroes and monsters both, to the working class. They hijacked shipments of medicines, depriving the Prometheus Labs hospitals. They stole weapons from A.O armories. They hacked AllComm broadcasts and streamed their own. 

The corporations came together and conducted a purge, killing or capturing thousands of people they claimed were insurgents. Most were never seen again. Those that were, were loyal workers, their previous allegiances seemingly erased.

This is the story of some of those people.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Upbeat music blared from the vidscreen playing in the background of Dominic Sutherland's small, fifty square foot apartment. Everything was multipurpose, and not a single thing inside it was new. 

The lyrics were incomprehensible, sung in a foreign language, but something about them brought a smile to Dom's face. Maybe it was the animated characters flashing across the screen joyously.

Dom stretched, joints popping on his large, muscled frame, and settled back on the overstuffed, worn couch. 

A disgraced veteran of A.O.’s military force, Dom had been kicked out due to excessive use of force, and other equally terrible crimes.  

It was all lies, of course. Dom had actually intervened and prevented the killing of innocent families by rogue elements within the police. They'd received intel pointing to a rebel base in one of the abandoned buildings in the industrial sector, and had immediately moved in. The idea was to capture them, get them to talk. Find out enough to go after the one who was really running things. The Firefighter.

It turned out that the rebel base was a small community of homeless people, scraping by on whatever junk they could repurpose. 

People just trying to get by outside of a system that had failed them. 

Standing orders were to apprehend them and take them to be processed at one of the many A.O. prison camps. It got them off the streets and kept the great machine of industry humming.

Something, though, maybe the look of hopeless defeat on their faces, maybe the fear in their eyes, changed things for Dom. He had stepped in front of the line of guns, using his own body to block the angles of fire, ordering the soldiers to stand down.

It had worked, briefly. There had been a lot of shouting, a lot of threats, and Dom heard the crack of a discharging capacitor. Lightning had coursed through his veins, and he had blacked out. When he came to, he had been strapped to a medical bed, and informed that he had gone on a rampage, unfortunately, and the civilians were dead, unfortunately, and he was being let go, unfortunately. No charges would be pressed, unfortunately, but he would be placed under close surveillance, to make sure he didn’t do anything like that again. 

When he asked to see the evidence, he was informed that the helmet camera footage had been damage, unfortunately, and that they had witness statements and the footage from the other soldiers. He had asked to see the footage and wouldn’t you know it. That footage was damaged as well, unfortunately.

The message was clear.

Get out. We don’t want you here. 

*Protect and Serve, my ass.*

That had been two years ago, and Dom was still salty about it. He had been raised to protect those around him, which caused his current employer no small amount of headaches.

Dom worked for a small-time mob boss, one Jake Harkness, who styled himself as something of a freedom fighter. Dom didn't really care. The money was good, and Jake was generally alright to be around. 

Unless he was toting that oversized flamethrower he got somewhere. Then things got complicated. 

Still, Dom's job wasn't bad. His role in the organization was simple. Protect Jake. Bounce the heads of anyone within it that tried to pull a fast one. Don't die.

He took the remote for the vidscreen and changed the channel. The AllComm logo appeared, playing the oh-so-serious jingle associated with their news as it always did when the channel was selected, and the news anchor appeared.

*“...and that, folks, is why you never mix cybernetics with piñatas.* 

*In other news, the terrorist organization Black Lotus has claimed responsibility for the explosion at Miller Barracks, one of the Allan-Otashi Corporation’s military training facilities, resulting in the death of over a dozen of our hard working heroes in uniform.* 

The image cut to a view of a burning building, emergency services fighting to put out the flames that engulfed it. It could have been anywhere.

*A.O. has vowed to crack down on the terrorists, and has declared heightened security at all A.O. facilities.*

Dom’s comm buzzed quietly, and he glanced at the screen. It was Jake. A button on the remote muted the vid, and he answered with a grunt.

*“Dom. Dom, thank the Gods you answered. Dom, I fucked up. I really fucked up. They got me on camera, Dom. I’ve got Sec goons closing in on me right now. I need you.”* a voice said, clearly panicked.

Dominic closed his eyes for a moment, cursing quietly and reached under the coffee table to pull out his oversized pistol. He checked the chamber, ensuring it was loaded, and put it on safe. 

“Where?”

Jake rattled off an address, and Dom grabbed his jacket. The gun went into a shoulder holster and he covered it with the jacket as he stepped out the door.

“Jake, talk to me. What am I getting into? How many? Which unit? How secure are you?” he asked, locking the door.

*“Uh.. I make six. I’m secure for the moment. Lead them away from the kids, you know? Don’t want them mixed up in this life,”* Jake babbled, a tinge of hysteria in his words. *“Ah, the unit… patch looks like.. A rope? Maybe? It’s a squiggly line in a circle.”*

*Damnit. Taskmasters.* 

They were a high threat response team, sent when the target had to be taken alive, but was also strong enough– either via drugs, cybernetic enhancements, or something else– to be able to argue about it. They weren’t a particularly nice unit.

He hurried down to the elevator, hitting the button to take him to the garage. After about a minute of descent, the only sounds being the humming of electric motors, the doors gave a happy little \*ding\* and opened. Dom moved to the  parking space he shared with six other tenants, currently showing an electric car. A keypad on the side received a few button presses, and the space the car was in retracted, taking the car with it. There was a few moments of humming and the sounds of machinery, and his vehicle slid out of the wall. 

He threw a leg over his heavy motorcycle and hit the ignition, putting his full helmet on his head. Popping the clutch and shifting into gear, he roared out of the garage and into the busy Glass traffic.

He wove through traffic, a symphony of horns and shouting left in his wake. 

He drove recklessly, cutting vehicles off, blowing through red lights, even mounting the curb once or twice. Anything to get more shave time.

About a quarter mile from the location, a small office building, Dom began seeing signs of Corporate Security. Drones in the air, cruisers hovering menacingly over intersections, checkpoints being erected. He cursed, slowing down, and pulled over.

He called Jake. 

“Boss. Extraction is going to be tough. Pigs already have the whole block closed, and the net is growing as I watch. I’m…” Dom took a deep breath. “I’m going to have to do something stupid.”

*“Are you saying you can’t get me?”* came the frantic reply.

“No, I’m coming. Sit tight.”

This part of the city was riddled with tunnels. Sewers, service and maintenance tunnels, even military tunnels that allowed units to appear almost anywhere. Dom accelerated back onto the street and turned down an alley after a few minutes, coming to a stop in front of a large, overflowing dumpster. He stepped into the dumpster and through it, disrupting the holographic camouflage for a moment that covered a manhole. Taking hold of a handle welded to the top, Dom muscled it off and set it aside. He took a moment to prepare himself, and dropped in. 

He descended only about 6 feet before he landed on the floor of a tunnel lit with flickering light from old bulbs inset into the wall at head level. The tunnel extended in two directions, left and right, their ends vanishing into the gloom. Turning to the left, he started hurrying.

A city as old as Glass had many places that were abandoned or little used, and this tunnel happened to be one of those. Exploration during a misspent youth had let him discover it, and he had realized over time that it made for a great, private highway. He unfolded a much creased paper, a crude map scrawled on it, and continued moving as he plotted his route.

A few minutes, and several turns later, and Dom was at a boarded up door. He could hear voices on the other side, heavily distorted by helmet speakers, and cursed quietly. Peeking through a small hole deliberately placed in the door, he spied two soldiers, chatting in boredom as they guarded an apparently empty section of tunnel. 

Dom drew his pistol and checked it, ensuring it was still loaded, and quietly slipped it off safe. With a breath to psych himself up, he kicked the door. The wooden boards, cleverly designed to look like they were solid, shattered along carefully concealed faults and flew into the tunnel in a clatter of debris.

The soldiers jerked, their amicable conversation rudely disrupted by the emergence of a large figure from what had seemed a previously solid section of wall. Before they could comm for help, Dom raised his pistol and fired twice, one round for each. Visors shattered, and heads snapped back, and both soldiers spun to the ground, dead.

Briefly feeling remorse, Dom steeled himself and hurried past, quickly moving down the tunnel as he counted ladders to himself. Each one lead to a building up above, and after five hundred feet, he stopped in front of one.

He quickly climbed up, reaching the trapdoor that separated the buildings above from the service tunnels below. He knocked on the door twice, waited a moment, then knocked three times. There was a few seconds of silence, then the answering two-three knock came, and the door was pulled open.

Peering down on Dom was Jake’s pale, anxious face, long red beard covering half of it, the tip of his flamethrower pointed into the hole. Upon seeing Dom, Jake’s expression changed to one of relief, and he pulled away to let Dom up.

Dom finished his climb and slipped through the trap door, into a dusty kitchen, debris scattered all over the floor.

“Jake, let’s go. Into the tunnels, I have an exit for us.”

Jake looked pained as he looked at Dom.

And neither am I. 

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. “Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. “I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. ""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. ""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. “But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. “Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark.",1,1727925129.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

In June 2024 I noticed I felt a bit dizzy. It progressively got worse and I went to the ER where they diagnosed me with BPPV. During this whole month I felt absolutely horrible. Like I thought I was dying. All I could do was sleep the dizziness away which made me weak. I even used a walking cane while walking around the house because I was so dizzy. I attempted to go to Walgreens and the floor felt like it was moving like I was on a boat. There were plenty more symptoms that went along with all this. Especially anxiety. I haven’t been alone inside a store since Walgreens because it was such a scary experience. But I noticed as time has went by my dizziness isn’t as bad. Since June I have been to an ENT who said I actually have Vestibular Vertigo. I went to physical therapy where they thought it was coming from poor posture (my neck). We did some exercises which actually seemed to help. I’ve also been taking my iron pills and magnesium every day. I have also just decided I was just going to get up and do things I used to do and suffer through it. Fast forward to today, I’m still dizzy here and there and occasionally get migraines. But i’ve noticed my symptoms aren’t as bad. Oh I also quit coffee. Just decaf now. Is this something that eventually gets better? Could I possibly cure myself somehow? 🤷🏻‍♀️ I still have an MRI scheduled so I’ll have more answers soon I guess. ",2,1727924963.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

We bought a 2/2 SFH several years ago and are looking to expand our house. It’s not the perfect neighborhood or school district but it’s a great proximity for commute, restaurants, coffee shops, nature and pretty much everything else we like. Assume we’d stay in the house another 5-7 years. 

The conventional knowledge here has always been it’s cheaper to sell and buy the house you want but candidly buying a 3/2 in our area would double our mortgage generally with interest rates now vs when we bought. 

So our options are 

- do nothing and save
- add on <200 sq ft, finance minimal, lose a little backyard and gain an extra bedroom 
- sell the house and double our mortgage 

The last option doesn’t really make sense. We can’t afford to increase our mortgage that much. 

Curious what Bay Area real estate people think of this … and what questions you’d ask yourself before doing this.

I had been eating really unhealthy and at poor times (graveyard shifts) and probably in a way damaged my stomach. Around 2 months ago, started having horrible reflux, stomach/rib pains, etc. I could barely eat anything besides white bread and rice for the better part of 2 weeks. My PCP originally thought it was gastritis and seemed to not make much of a deal about it, but being a little health paranoid I got some labs done (blood work, chest/abdominal xray) and everything was normal. I got on 20mg Prilosec daily after a week of not feeling better on Pepcid. Thankfully the prilosec seemingly made my stomach much better. I stopped taking the Prilosec about 2 weeks ago (6 week trial) and with watching my diet, I'm like 99.999% back to ""normal"". My last residual symptoms are just burping after eating, having some minor stomach aches, and very occasionally a little relfux if I eat the wrong thing. I'm slowly introducing new things (in moderation) back into my diet, but have been still eating mostly right (im trying to work out/be healthier so i should anyway).  I can eat pretty much whatever I want with a little tums/pepto bismol but still have a few weird symptoms (globus, rib cage pain with no burning just a dull ache). Is this normal/long term for you guys too? Also it seems like this came on out of nowhere, ive gotten acid reflux before but it was never to this degree and im hopeful the fact ive improved significantly and seem to be doing okay now without the PPIs. 

Its also funny that some things cause it that I wouldn't expect to and other usualy triggers are fine. Coffee? Fine on my stomach. I had a little bit of frozen tyson rotisserie chicken? Horrible heartburn for a whole night. I also have seasonal late summer/fall allergies and sometimes the symptoms overlap with gerd.

1fuy5b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fuy5b7/finally_met_one_my_own_age/,"finally met one, my own age!","So I’m 25F, I knew I wanted to be CF since I was 14. I never liked kids, I have a lot of older siblings some of them in their 30s with multiple children of their own, interacting with my nieces and nephews spark nothing in me. I never thought babies were adorable, never had a blimp of a baby fever. Among my peers, if I ever declare my desire to be CF most people are pretty accepting of it. It’s usually a “as you should” or a little “pop off queen” or even a “in this economy? Understandable” and the conversation is over. BUT! I finally met a girl at work! My own age, at 25, who just could not accept that I plan to remain CF!! I usually don’t bring this conversation up voluntarily but it was 3 of us women working and talking about BC naturally led to my thoughts on a CF life. I explained that I just never had the desire and I am very uncomfortable around children. I also shared that I think a lot of young adults think of family and fulfillment interchangeably. When adults settle into their life financially and in their career they seek fulfillment elsewhere and instead of looking into themselves, they think bringing a new life into the world will bring them fulfillment and purpose, which I don’t agree with and i think is selfish. My coworker was having none of it. I concluded with my final thought that, life will always be full of regrets and I would much rather regret not having kids than regret having kids. She would just NOT let it go! Her ONLY arguments against me were “but you’re so young you never know!” And “you might change your mind soon” or even a “you just need to meet the right partner” (after I’ve mentioned I’m perfectly happy and healthy in a committed relationship with a partner who is also in on being CF). She had NOTHING to argue against my points. And the onnnnly way she dropped the conversation was after I mentioned that being foster parents for older kids might be something I want to look into in the far future once I’m financially stable. 

Just for additional background, we work together in a kitchen for a coffee shop in a very rich neighborhood, where a lot of our clientele during the weekdays are stay-at-home moms. Mothers like to sit at our cafe with their kids and their other mom friends to have a coffee and a snack during the day and relax….except…. They are never relaxed. They are exhausted, they are spending most of their day wrangling their 4 toddlers they birthed back to back,  they are busy yelling at their kids, and busy yelling at their idiotic husbands who have no clue how to interact with or control their own children. We as workers often have to clean up messy tables, sticky windows, knocked over plants, and messed up menu boards after the toddlers storm around in the cafe and the moms apologetically retreat from the store. Our kitchen is downstairs with thin ceilings so our workday is often interrupted by the sounds of children running around, screaming, crying and stomping all over the floors and we can hear their mothers chasing after them. I just found it baffling that my coworker who is the same age as me, coming from a similar financial situation as me, working the same job as me witnessing the same messy lives of mothers, just could not let go of the fact that I decided to be CF.",5,1727924293.0,childfree,1,1.0,False

My family is in Idaho, and I have a few long distance friends, but with this divorce obviously comes the challenge of losing friends.

I also love hiking, outdoorsy adventures, trails/walks, camping, fishing, paddle boarding, swimming, skiing, traveling/road tripping. I’m into gaming (console & PC), edm festivals and shows, rock concerts (warped tour 2025 anyone???), the gym, art. I am very passionate about art and would like to find art communities (paint nights, drawing get togethers, pottery, photography, etc).

I don't remember but some week on Friday night I texted her that my junior needed some work who has been struggling to find work for 6 months so she can give some pointers in starting freelancing (she's been doing it for the past 4 years ig). I specifically mentioned that if she's unable to call then even a voicenote would work. She told me it's difficult as she's busy and will call after Tuesday and I was like okay, fine. Sat, sun, mon, Tue passed. I got a text that she's unable to call me, on Wednesday midnight. I was annoyed bt still I replied ""no problem"" and waited for 2 more days, got nothing from her.

Meanwhile I have been seeing her Instagram stories about the books she's been reading with a coffee mug and then next day posted another insta story where she's telling everyone about something like she wants to read every book in the world (mindless blabber). This is where I lost my mind and the rest is history. Even when confronted, the utter disrespect and ""akad"" was the breaking point. My GF was also shocked to know about this.

I am an understanding person bt if you cannot spare 10 minutes in 1 week for someone then being understanding and being a ""chutiya"" has no difference. I did help her at the times in need where she needed some money so that she doesn't get into trouble, or the time where I booked movie tickets from her while I too was busy with something, selecting a tws earphones as she's not a techie etc etc. Now I feel like a total fool for prioritising her.

After blocking, she texted me on Instagram confirming that if I blocked her on Whatsapp to which I did not respond. Mind you, still not a single call from her since 10 days of this shit. Fast forward to now, she has unfollowed me from everywhere and deleted few texts from the chats. 

People actually do not care. All they're trying to do is to not get into trouble. That's what the fuck is wrong. I am not even sure if I'll be trusting/caring for someone else to that extent. Maybe just reciprocation is the answer.",7,1727924109.0,indiasocial,20,0.77,False

1fuxyr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1fuxyr9/33_days_on_carnivore/,33 days on carnivore,"
33 days on carnivore so here is a report on what has happened. First I would like to talk about what issues I was dealing with as my was the driving factor in my decision to drive in. Please keep in my I’m a 26 year old male who has never been out of shape. I’ve been in the gym since I was 12 and always tried to stay active.

The first major thing I was dealing with was IBS and it was so bad that when I was eating all the food I was even meat use to set off symptoms. I honestly was hopeless as I’m a stubborn man and will not go to the hospital for almost anything. 

The next worse thing was my hormones. When I got my blood tested in 2016, 2019, and 2021 came back with extremely low testosterone (best score being 406 and worst being 223), low free testosterone, and more estrogen than a teenage female (it was somewhere in the mid 20’s like 25-26). 

I had terrible insomnia I really hated sleeping so from the time I went through puberty when I was about 14 to now (I’m 26) I would stay up every night until at least midnight but a lot of the times 2-3am as well as all nighters in the mix. This was not a “sometimes I would do it” situation. For 12 straight years I dreaded falling asleep. The 2 biggest reasons I think my insomnia was so bad was because I had a sugar and caffeine addiction as well as having the worst fatigue or grogginess when trying to wake up the next day. This specifically has caused so much stress in my life because I would sleep through alarms missing work and my days off were spent sleeping in until noon if not later. I tried everything to get my sleep in order but I could never fix it. 

I noticed around the time that I turned 25 that my heart felt like it wasn’t working correctly. It felt stiffer if that makes sense. I always wear an Apple Watch and I found that my resting heart rate was slowly climbing from a 45bpm when I was a teen to a 68bpm low recently after I turned 26. This was gradual but I knew that it was not a good sign. I noticed my heart rate would be a lot higher with moderate movement and I also had high blood pressure regularly. 

My ankles in the last 2 years started to become inflamed everyday and would hurt so bad that I stopped running weekly. 

On top of everything else I was experiencing the worst brain fog, and depression, in my life. It felt like I was in the passenger seat of my own body and never got better. I wanted the pain, stress, and suffering to end but I have 2 kids so suicide was never an option even though it was a thought. Some of these health issues were things I’ve been dealing with for a long time but other issues like the heart rate and brain fog started out minimal, almost unnoticeable, and got a lot worse through the course of many years. 

I have done three different 10 day water fast as well as 2 different 15 day water fast and obviously countless 3+ day water fast. I thought this would help but every time I returned to eating the sugar and caffeine addiction came back and I never felt like my body truly healed. I think this was because I would only return to eating what I thought was healthy for a day or two (obviously started out with bone broths and liquids) then fall right back down into the standard American diet. 

My first two weeks on carnivore were especially hard as I was experiencing keto flu like no other. I had constipation and diarrhea with in those first two weeks but I stuck to it very strictly. After two weeks I started feeling amazing, the depression especially was gone, and it was immediate like day 15 immediate. I felt so good that I told my fiancé if this is what I could be feeling like daily that I will never return to how I was eating before. 

33 days in my insomnia is none existent, I wake up when my first alarm goes off and I’m up getting ready with no fatigue or grogginess, my resting heart rate has dropped to a new low of 43bpm, I haven’t had any IBS symptoms since the 5th day on carnivore, I don’t know what my hormone levels look like as I didn’t get those checked in my employee health screening for my work insurance however I scored almost perfect in all of the markers they do check, my ankles have not shown signs of inflammation since the 2 week mark and the do not hurt anymore, and I have been mentally sharp since the 5th day, my brain fog improved everyday since that 5th day and I feel like it’s the best it has ever been in my life!

My diet is red meat, salt, water, and every 4th day if I have not gone number 2 then I drink a cup of coffee which does the trick normally. Please let me know if there is something I can do different to be more regular in the bathroom because this is the only downside It seems with my diet specifically. I suspect that I am not eating enough fat maybe?

Feel free to ask my anything I am an open book when it comes to this as it has really changed my life in such a positive way that for the first time ever I feel like I’m in control. I’ve never been so happy, so productive, so ambitions, disciplined, thoughtful in my relationship, I have never been so free.",4,1727923678.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False
1fuxyla,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1fuxyla/social_engineering_degree/,Social engineering degree?,"I'm confused about the unspoken rules I'm supposed to follow when in my program as a person with a learning disability. I'm having fun thus far, thankfully, as my roommate has ADHD and I have a few MBA friends with either learning disabilities, autism, or other types of neurodiversity (T10 really was committed to the neurodiversity part of diversity!)

However, I feel like I'm falling behind in class not because I don't study but because the curves are being moved up due to rampant cheating. I get using genAI to help study but to get all the answers for homework, take-home assignments, and sometimes even some of the final in-person exams makes me feel like I'm missing out on being competitive by not cheating.

In addition, coffee chats don't make sense to me. Career services say it's supposed to make you likable to the firm, but on what metric? I'm trying figure out what's in my and my interviewer's best interests during these chats. Am I asking questions that he/she's heard thousands of times? Do they pretend to care about my generic resume? How do coffee chats further my career if it's not clearly showing my skills? Also, how have people learned everyone's names and positions for recruiters so quickly? 

And don't get me started on the ""drama"" between classmates for what I think are harmless differences - people are still on about how loud one candidate sneezed TWO WEEKS after they sneezed and then excused themself so they could sneeze in the hallway. Beyond their loud sneezing, they seem like a nice person.

I've always been aware that communicating with neurotypical people is different than with neurodiverse people, but it's felt different at the MBA level. I feel as though I'm being socially engineered to think in new ways that are more selfish than I learned working in tech startups and academia ... which is to be expected but still very jarring.

1fuxuvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1fuxuvi/many_conflicting_thoughts/,Many conflicting thoughts,"Hi! I'm technically not a member yet, my inability to stick to a routine means I have YET to enjoy the mental benefits of the practice, which I'm sure are a genuine chemical reaction of the brain to regular meditation. As a result I have not accomplished much with this practice, when it comes to fixing my life up. Or redirecting it where I want it to go. But I'm a peculiar case.


My thing is, I'd love to fully commit to this. To the practice and the community practices, at least. Many of the complains that are raised here are not something I'm able to relate to. That might be because I'm still ""one the margins"" of SGI society, but nobody in my community has ever pressured me in a way that has turned me off. I've been going to meetings for close to 6 years now, still no gohonzon or membership. 


Now, it would be a lie to say I don't feel like I'm being less of a Buddhist by still not having taken the gohonzon. But that is NOT because people have made me feel that way: I know I've not been consistent with my practice and I would've been inconsistent with any practice, regardless of the structure sorrounding it. I have an addiction that makes it difficult to face reality, and meditation helps me tremendously, but I have little determination to help myself when I'm alone, my brain gets swallowed by cravings. The community helps tremendously and so do the teachings.


To help myself through writing this, I've decided to use a post by @tosticated written 7 months ago. I hope it's OK, I've asked and was answered that ""everything is free and can be used"". I just need to answer to some points with my perspective because I relate to some but not others.


My thoughts will be in [ x ]  parentheses and I will elaborate further afterwards. 


Tosticated: ""As a former member, this is my take on why SGI is cult.


- The way chanting works on a physiological (hormones) and psychological (state of mind) level is that it makes your brain release hormones making you feel great, loved and loving, and, at the same time, you’re putting yourself in a slightly self-hypnotic state.  &#10;


   [Makes perfect sense to me. I'm also interested in other meditation practices for this very reason. I really do think meditation allievates anxiety and therefore allows you make better, more considerate choices. This is where the assertation that the practice makes you ""wise"" comes from, I think.] &#10;



- This happens regardless of the context and content of the chanting (you can chant to your hot cup of coffee and repetitively say anything you like, and the same thing will happen).   &#10;


   [Also something that makes sense. Also one of the reasons that makes me wary of SGI. One part of me wonders, Why can't I make my own gohonzon? In my own language? I understand the meaning and the useful ""summary"" of nichiren buddhism's phisolosphy in the words nam yo ho renge kyo, each and every part of the phrase symbolizing a particular intention. I guess my problem is the rigidity of the practice, the way that any self-made gohonzon is frowned upon, the way in which this practice that supposedly holds the truth of the universe CAN ONLY be properly accessed through this one's ancient dude's scribbles. Not to dismiss Nichiren. I know he reads these.] &#10;



- Being in a self-hypnotic state (even a slight one) makes you suggestible to anything anyone tells you or you experience. 
&#10;


  [Very possible. The issue is I like the way I feel in meetings, it really seems to bolster my focus and my hopes for the future. I really do see them as a support group of sorts, and it feels good to talk about being imperfect in front of people who also fight to better their own life and those of the people around them every week. I like the people in my meetings.] &#10;


- SGI's claims about why and how chanting works has absolutely zero merit and starting a meeting with Gongyo (including chanting) is nothing more than a well-understood method used deliberately to prime you for brainwashing. &#10;


  [Fair enough criticism, also something I've wondered. ] &#10; 



Here are a few examples of what you will learn as a member of SGI: &#10;


* When anything good happens in your life, it's only because you're a member. If you stop being a member, not only will good things stop happening, but really bad things will also start happening. You will suffer severely and eventually come crawling back, begging for forgiveness (according to Ikeda). You will learn to live in fear of even thinking about leaving. &#10;


  [This, I've heard. Not in explicit and direct terms, but it is definitely something that some of the most longtime believers think CAN happen. At the same time, I know that they would not pressure people to come back into the practice too aggressively, I know because I've swayed in and out of meetings and it's not like people have come knocking at my house. I also hear of actual members not practicing anymore or practicing on their own but not coming to meetings, and they are left on their own, their wishes are respected. Do I believe in this? One some levels, for sure, because it does ring true for me. I'm a weak person who needs positive reinforcement to give a fuck about themselves, I might be primed for cults 😅] &#10;


* When anything bad happens in your life, it's all your fault. It's because you're not chanting enough or doing enough activities for SGI. However, bad things happen in life no matter what you do. Following SGI’s teachings will teach you to live in fear of not chanting, always make you feel like something is wrong with you, and that you're not good enough. &#10;


   [The issue here for me is not being dependent on chanting, or ANY FORM OF MEDITATION (so yeah, not necessarily nmhrk) but that you live in fear of going on the ""wrong path"". It is said that this is the only path to happiness. I guess the former point was accurate. This is how people develop the belief that by quitting the practice they are doomed to fuck their lives up. It is the only one and true way, but hey you can stop! Anytime, because this is a proof-based faith. So if you fail, it's on you, and if you win, it's thanks to the practice. Mhm.] &#10;


* You will find it both normal and desirable to do SGI activities 3-6 times weekly, thereby completely isolating yourself socially from non-members, including friends and family. &#10;


   [That is wild and completely opposite to what I'm taught and the way the people in my community practice. The point of the practice is to better navigate the world and your own relationships, your own life. To actually center yourself and do things with better intention, and to feel seren in both good times and bad times. You need other people to do that. You need to be in the world!] &#10;


* People who are not members are deluded and must be converted. All non-members, including friends and family, are potential targets for conversion. Normal human interaction becomes impossible. &#10;


  [This is dramatically exaggerated. Sharing what you do is encouraged (and emphasized by ikeda to a degree that makes me uneasy) but the way to do it is by simply pursuing your best self and having it be proof that the practice works. In practice, people may talk about what helps them but It doesn't negate normal relationships.] &#10;


* Friends and family who are not members and are concerned about the way you WILL change and all the time you will spend away from them, are per SGI definition classified as ""evil friends"", so are, in effect, your worst enemies. You will feel it completely reasonable to isolate yourself from the people who genuinely care about you and love you. &#10;


  [Totally different from my experience. Know plenty of people married to non-believers. The only requirement is that they don't actually oppose the practice, it doesn't matter whether they participate or not. Besides, one of the points of this Buddhism, actually something I Like about Ikeda, is the focus on dialogue and on embracing people that are different.] &#10;


* The more obstacles you meet, the closer you are to a breakthrough, so, suffering is happiness. The more you suffer, the better, because the more you need SGI. &#10;


  [This is considered true, but I actually like this belief. I really like the motif of the lotus flower that grows up from mud. Bad things in life happen regardless, good coping mechanisms and community are a nice way to face adversities. Do I wish this could be done without Ikeda? yeah.] &#10;


* Any non-SGI approved writings are dangerous and will give you bad ""karma"". You will learn to reject and distrust any non-SGI material and information. &#10;


  [This is my fear about SGI. I find most writing from Ikeda to be cheesy and self-aggrandizing and very ""Source: bro trust me"", especially regarding his own experiences. And people never doubt that what he has written is true, if he's so respected it must have all happened exactly how he says it has! Part of me thinks I'm reasonably critical about this, but I never share my doubts with others. It undermines the whole thing.] &#10;


* Critical thinking and normal functioning reasoning skills must be suspended. You will learn not to trust yourself, but only SGI and their leaders. &#10;


  [I disagree on the not trusting yourself, agree on the leadership thing. Indeed the whole ""master-disciple"" concept is fundamental to the practice in a way that bothers me.] 

You will find these ""teachings"" constantly encouraged and facilitated at every meeting and event, by leaders of every level, and when you eventually begin to experience these things and dare question them, you will most likely hear something to the effect that it’s your “fundamental darkness” at play, as the organisation is perfect, but members are flawed."" &#10;



So, to round up: I'm deeply deeply suspicious of the goodness of Ikeda's intentions. Of Toda, of Makiguchi. I just struggle to believe blindly into everything that they say about themselves. And so much of the practice is to trust your master and believe in him. People hang up pictures of Ikeda next to their butsudan. I don't like the thought that this beautiful practice and the lovely people I know are funding a multimillionaire organization that is seemingly deeply entrenched in politics. I don't trust these people! I read Ikeda's multiple volumes long biography and can't help but wonder who ghoswrote it for him. And the materials for the monthly study meeting are soo cheesily written and constantly reaffirming of the goodness of the practise etcetera. Part of me wonders if it isn't just cultural differences in communication, or if it sounds cheesy to Japanese readers too.


I dislike Ikeda's focus on the importance of proselytizing, because I dislike the underlying belief that this is the only way people can truly be helped. I supposed I dislike the notion beneath it all that dialogue is the way to solve every single issue in the world, and that kosen rufu will lead to happiness. I just think it's too simplicistic. I also don't think this is what people believe in practice, they just take that as an ideal impossible goal to motivate themselves in navigating their own little worlds. It seems useful that way. I just don't like that Ikeda wants you to treat such a premise as literal in order to bring people in and tell them this is the True Way to Happines™. Who am I to tell somebody that? To round up every practice in the world and say, mine is it? 


It might be that I'm a former evangelical and that type of arrogance is the number one reason that I distanced myself from Christianity. I just don't want to push people. But is IS fundamental to the practice that you do, and maybe that's where the cultish dynamics show up.


I've mentioned that I have an addiction, and I do. It's not extreme, but it's impairing enough that I struggle with daily functioning. It's not something I can go to meetings about. 


It's not even something I want to discuss here necessarily, but all I want to say is: the philosophy behind the practice helps. Being told that you can change yourself helps. The meditation helps. The focus on building determination and faith to face everything head on without fear helps. The notion that you can help others just by modifying your reaction to things comforts me immensely. So I'll probably continue to practice. Hell, maybe I'll get the gohonzon. 


But I'm scared that getting further into it will force me to give up critical thinking as I feel my life getting better and I attribute things to the practice only. I don't know. Would I rather read Ikeda's works and nod my head saying mhmmm yeah I fully believe you or would I rather be sad? 


I know I sound like I'm fully in a cult, I likely am. I guess you are never ever immune to them. There is it is: I'm scared of life without it. Now what? ",3,1727923320.0,sgiwhistleblowers,3,1.0,False

Currently, the most successful recipe I’ve made has;

- 1.5oz Pineapple Juice
- 0.75oz Cream of Coconut
- 0.25oz Dark Cold Brew
- 0.5oz Guinness Syrup
- 0.25oz Allspice Dram
- 0.25oz Grand Marnier
- 0.5oz Irish Whiskey (Jameson)
- 0.75oz Canadian Whiskey (Forty Creek)
- 1oz Bourbon (Maker’s Mark)
- 1-2 dashes tobacco bitters

The final result ends up nice and sweet in the beginning, with a oaky-tobacco-coffee flavour at the end. I’m currently trying to tweak the recipe, and thinking that subbing in a stronger Canadian rye might be a better idea.

1fuxlqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1fuxlqy/my_personal_observations_retrospective_on_helena/,My personal observations / retrospective on Helena experience,"I live in Greenville, SC suburbs, with my pregnant wife and 8 kids. Oldest is 13.

Friday morning, height of the storm, 70mph wind. Electricity was getting shutdown, shingles pieces, siding pieces were flying from the houses. Trees were falling.

I saw few neighbors. One man helped me with some issues, other neighbor was seemingly agitated by storm, yelled at me for no reason, got upset for things, which I had little to do with.

**Observation 1: during events people can behave irrationally and unexpectedly. Really unexpectedly.**

We had no electricity for 4 days.

At our home, our gas stove doesn't work without electricity. Can use lighter.

At our home, gas tankless water heater doesn't work without electricity.

I have 2kW inverter, which I plugged to my car running 24/7 and it handled two fridges just fine. But I didn't have enough extension cords. So, I had to switch from one fridge to another, to some other appliances every few hours. Also, even though the inverter is 2kW the car can only supply around 1kW of power. Inverter was shutting off due to low voltage, when I tried coffee machine (1.5kW) and car's battery was discharging with the load above 1kW, even though I put RPM to about 2000.

On the second day, I went and brought our RV home from storage. RV has 4kW generator, and it was full with gas. I also had few additional extension cords in it. Great! Well, after few hours, the power strip caught on fire.  Probably was overloaded. I was near by, so I quickly disconnected it. So, no problem. Then plugged everything with attention to power rating. Also, learned, that full tank of my RV is enough to run generator for about 3 days non-stop.

**Observation 2: ""having items"" (inverter, generator) is not enough - need to have drills with them. Only then you'll know, what are you missing.**

My wife decided to drive 15 minutes to her cousine. When she got from our community - there was standstill traffic in the place, which never has traffics. That was because there was gas station, which had gas (very few stations were open). And even though she didn't need gas, but it would take more than hour to get through. She tried another road - it was blocked by fallen trees. She returned back home.

**Observation 3: You never know what kind of challenges you'll have. Better play safe, stay home until things settle down.**

The widow in our church lives on the acreage. The tree fell, blocked her driveway. She was stuck at home. Thankfully, most of us call to check on each other, so few man came to her property to clear driveway.

**Observation 4: Having circle of support is important. Do you have anyone to inquire about you in case of the events? Family, church, friends...**

**P.S.** I knew the storm is coming. Everyone knew. I easily could had brought the RV with generator before the storm. But I didn't know the storm would have such consequences. And in some situation it would be hard / impossible to go and get RV home AFTER the storm / the event. Or go and get fuel / food / water when nothing is working... It was very hard to buy gas first two days.

**Observation 5: You can't know ahead of time what and when will happen. Always have at least basic items at home, BE PREPARED.**",59,1727922503.0,preppers,29,0.92,False

Keep it short, during college at 22 I got accepted to do an internship with 6 other girls. Here, we do summer schools I did them and 3 other girls didnt do the summer school. (I'll call them the chancers). We found out that there were only 3 slots available for the internship so The Chancers decided to sign their names up without my consent and the 2 other ones. Their justification was ""you know its hard to study while doing work""

It has always been in the back of my mind with rage. But jokes on them I got a new internship and even a full time job here I live in my own place now and I work in a higher position here. So in one of my days off I paid a visit at my workplace and I see one of the Chancers there and she started saying hi and said we should meet up I agreed.

We met for coffee and we started talking about college and I brought up  our internships. She told me her one sucked and I said my one rocked and to be fair I couldn't help but smile, it felt like a +1 on her. She proceeds to tell me she dropped out of college because she fell pregnant, regrets being a parent at 22 and how she's struggle living from paycheck to paycheck.

To be honest with you I couldn't help but smile with glee. There was something very arousing about the law of karma biting her back. We eventually finished and I walked out of the coffee shop and I couldn't help but listen to happy songs.

1fuxj3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1fuxj3j/32_m4f_tx_looking_for_her/,32 [M4F] TX - Looking for Her,"Hello, I’m a 32 year old Hispanic male living in TX. I currently work as an engineer for a major refinery in the area, so my time outside of work can be fairly limited and I find it hard to make new connections outside of just work colleagues who sometimes go out for drinks. 

To give some history, I recently moved back to Texas late last year. Before that, I was moving around the country for work for about 3 years. First in Oregon, a few months in Iowa, and then in Chicago before making my way back to Texas on a job offer I just couldn’t turn down. Throughout that time, I’ve found it hard to make connections outside of my current (mostly online) friend group. At first I blamed it on moving around so much. But I had over a year in most places I stayed to go out, get to know the area, and maybe find some connections. So that can’t be it, right?

I find myself feeling lonely, more now than ever since I’ve decided to stick it out with this company for the long term and make the most of my career that I can here. But even with that loneliness in mind, how do I go about making friends, let along finding a partner now? I don’t really go out to clubs or party anymore. I go to the gym and a few coffee shops when I have the time, but I doubt you want to be approached by a random man while you’re doing your workout or working and enjoying your drink. Maybe I’m too in my own head, I’m not sure.

So what am I looking for? I’m looking for a companion to spend time with. Someone I can have plans for dinner with, someone to just mindlessly do nothing in the same vicinity with, to send bad memes to while we sit feet apart. I’m not looking to have a codependent relationship, been there done that, but to find someone who is stable in their life and knows what a healthy relationship is like. Age isn’t too much of a factor, to a certain degree, though I would prefer someone who isn’t going to need me to guide them through early adulthood. 

I am stable enough in my income to be able to support a stay at home partner and be able to fund their hobbies and give us a comfortable life. So if you’d rather be a homemaker, that’s fine with me. If you want to work, that’s fine as well. I don’t aim to take anyone’s autonomy away, simply to find someone to share life’s joys with. I would just ask that if you choose to stay home, please help with some organization and potential cooking when I’m running a bit too late at the office. 

I want to clarify that children aren't for me. Please don't try to change that, you won't. And it'll just be a really awkward conversation if you try to. 

Do I have physical preferences? Of course I do, I think we all do. My preferences are more with how someone presents themselves and takes care of their appearance more so than specific physical characteristics. My job has certain social functions that I sometimes have to attend and showing up well dressed and well put together can be a big factor in terms of image and perception. And you know what they say? “Perception is reality”, at least in the corporate world. I want to clarify, I’m not trying to find a model to date, I just want someone who can clean up nicely when necessary. I know it’s a vain ask, but sometimes you have to play the corporate game in order to be able to get to where you want to make a difference. 

I want to go ahead and give a disclaimer so that you don’t waste your time. I am in the larger side at the moment and am working on losing the weight for both aesthetic and health reasons. To give you an idea, I currently weight 260 and my end goal weight is 175. I am working with my doctor, a nutritionist, and a trainer to reach this and have already made progress. But if this isn’t something you’d want to be around for, or I’m just not your type that’s fine. Please don’t waste both of our time by making fun of my weight or mocking my efforts to become a better me. I know how easy that can be done through a screen and a keyboard. 

If you actually read all of this rambling mess and any of it resonated with you, shoot me a message and we can chat. No expectations, just a friendly exchanging of words. ",0,1727922260.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

I was working at a coffee shop, typing charts on my AW m15 R5 and i had to shutdown and update (it was the only option to shut down the laptop) as i was about to leave. I tried turning it on again as soon as i got home, but my laptop started having a faint fan sound and the power button started flashing red 3 and blue 6. Ive been looking for a solution online for the past 2 hours and have found nothing that works. I have tried holding the power button for 60s, 30s, 15s, and it didnt do anything. I have also tried disconnecting the MB from battery, drained power and reconnected, to no success. 

Has anyone had the same problem? A solution would be very much appreciated.

I never thought I had a problem because I only had 1 coffee a day in the morning with breakfast, and MAYBE a caffeinated tea on days I was extra tired.

I’ve always struggled with my energy levels. Even if I got 8-10hrs of sleep a night, I would be dead tired in the afternoon, and I would have to nap for 1-2hrs or else I would be completely incoherent/non-functioning by the evening. It got to the point recently where I was going to go in for testing & blood work because I thought I had something severely wrong with me. 

I decided to cut out coffee in an effort to reduce my anxiety, but I still had a morning decaf coffee. After a couple weeks, I decided to stop decaf as well.

And just like that, within a week, my energy levels have been fixed. I feel like a normal functioning adult - which I’ve never felt like for my entire adult life. It’s incredible. I can go all day without a nap. I had enough energy to go to the gym for the first time in almost 2 years. My body and mind feel strong instead of weak.

I love the taste of coffee, but I’m never going back. I have experienced such a big and wonderful life change in just a few short weeks.",20,1727921692.0,decaf,1,0.96,False

It’s not truly for cosmetic reasons, my bite is off so bad I have a lot of pain and I’m chipping teeth. I was in the middle of Invisalign when I received my cancer diagnosis, and during chemo I couldn’t wear my trays due to bleeding gums from one of my drugs. My teeth shifted over 6 months to the point my older trays no longer fit. I don’t want that possibility again. My new orthodontist said he can get me aligned in 18 months with braces, and didn’t recommend Invisalign again anyway. 

My question is this: I am a huge coffee and tea drinker. Everyone has told me clear ceramic brackets stain horribly. I suffered with invisalign staining, so should I go with all metal? I'm not really concerned about appearance, my ortho just said he usually does clear on the upper front teeth as that's most people's preference. I'm thinking about requesting all metal if it's true they stain that badly.

Thoughts on second chance?,"Hey everyone, I know the overwhelming reaction to this will be NO. However, if you do happen to keep reading this feel free to let me know what I can do about it. 

We have had a tough 6 months in our relationship. We have been going back and forth about some underlying issues regarding how I can't seem to give her the love and affection that she wants. This is even more of a problem now because we will be doing internships in separate locations. After talking to a psychologist I came to realise that there was something stopping me from giving her what she wants and needs - all of which are very reasonable things in a relationship. 

Context:

Her previous relationship and partner weren't great - I won't give details, but he was extremely manipulative, and we all know him to be a narcissist. I've not been in a relationship with my partner for 2.5 years. Was a rocky start with some prior issues with her partner who continued to harass me (threaten me, falsify rumours about me spreading shit about him, he would become aggressive if i denied that). He also kept talking to her and made her feel guilty at the start of my relationship with her. He would make her feel guilty about his mental health while me and her were a few months into our relationship - sometimes I wouldn't know that she was talking to him and once found her car near his building at a time that it should not have been there. Again, this was just a few months in. 

A few more months in I randomly asked her a question: were you still sleeping with him when we first started to unofficially see each other? She didn't answer me properly and so I asked again later and she said yes. Now I am aware that people are well within their rights to sleep with other people if they're not in a committed relationship. However, to me this felt like betrayal because it felt mo rally wrong and it took me by shock - on top of all the other instances of her continuing to talk to him during the relationship.

Current situation: 

Had a huge blow up of arguments over the last month and a few times where we almost broke up. We managed to patch things up each time but it never solved the problem. During this time I felt like my brain was exploding because I couldn't think of a clear solution. I decided to see the psych. After telling my psych all this she came to a conclusion that at some point in the relationship there was a crack. I feel like me finding about this thing between him and her while we were getting to the rhythm of things towards the start of our relationship messed me up 6 to 8 months in in addition to several other problems which I was dragged into due to my partner also making a couple of silly decisions.

We had a good chat about 2 days ago about why I felt the way I felt and she also felt guilty for the things she did. But I couldn't stop it from hurting me. In saying that, for the first time in a long time I felt like the pressure was lifted from my shoulders and I felt validated for the first time.

But here's the issue, I felt pretty fkd up in the head from all the thinking even after talking to the psych and it started to affect the way I behaved. One or two days before having that chat with my partner I downloaded tinder (approx 4 days ago now). I thought to myslef let me see how it feels to get some attention - subconsciously it could have even been payback for what she did to me earlier in the relationship. Got a few likes and I thought it was cool and all - ego boost etc etc. I didn't talk to anyone, I live with my parents and I had no intention to call anyone over, I didn't want to sleep with anyone or go meet them for coffee date etc. I just thought it would feel good to have some attention. I deleted it last night and but I think her friend found my profile on there prior to that. Its embarrassing for everyone involved and its not fair to her. We've had a chat about it already and I told her what my though process was, or lack thereof.

She is mulling over it as we speak, and given the context there have been a few complexities which have affected both of us mentally. I know this was a terrible thing to do, but only I know what I was thinking and what my intentions were - and while they were not entirely pure, I didn't want anything to do with the people I matched with. I simply swiped right and got an ego boost if we matched - nothing more. I've made a potentially fatal mistake in this lifetime - I'm not sure anything else will come close, but I am adamant that this is not who I am as a person or who I was raised to be. I'd like to make amends, accept it and rebuild.

My aim: to remain as a couple and help rebuild the trust that was lost and get over together. Our plan was to get married in a couple of years - now it hinges on how all this goes.

I really just need all the advice and support I can get from yall. I’m 20 years old and sexually active. I don’t get UTIs super frequently, but I am prone to vaginal infections so I have to take really good care of myself. Usually it’s BV or yeast that I end up with if I skip a shower or sweat a lot or something. 

A few days ago, I started keeping track of my water intake and staying well hydrated because it just made me feel good. For the last two days, I noticed I was peeing a lot more but I just blamed it on the water and coffee because there was no pain or urgency. Then all of a sudden I started having to run to the toilet because I felt like I had less control over my bladder. Then I started to notice some cramping sensations and now I have full on HORRIBLE UTI symptoms. Im literally stuck on the toilet. And yes, my bf and I had sex like two days ago so I guess that’s why but I peed right after and showered. And then drank a ton of water and I’ve been using water wipes occasionally to freshen up externally. Typically if I get a UTI from sex, I notice symptoms the morning after. So I don’t understand how I’ve been feeling fine, drinking plenty of water, and keeping myself clean and all of a sudden I’m in severe pain and stuck on the toilet.

And I don’t think I’ve ever had one this bad, and it’s getting worse by the minute. I’m having cramp like symptoms, chills, feeling the need to pee 24/7, and severe burning when urinating. You know, the kind where you pee the tiniest amount and it burns so bad you get chills and your eyes start watering. I’m dying here.

My boyfriend just left to get me some azo, and I guess I’m going to have to go to the doctor tmrw for some antibiotics, but I just need help understanding why this happened all of a sudden when I’m doing everything right!! I even take cranberry pills occasionally!! Someone, anyone, please help me lol.

ALSO: I work a 9-5 office job, so I don’t have to do any hard labor, but I just know how uncomfortable I’m gonna be and how much this is going to suck at work. I work for my mom and step dad, so I don’t really have the typical “call out” option. I’m going to have to hear from my mom about how ridiculous it is that I can’t just take an azo and some ibuprofen and get to work. But I really don’t know what to do!! I just want to go to the doctor and then rest. This sucks. I could go on and on but I don’t think anyone wants to read all of this so I’ll stop.

I've been cancelled in school for a thing I did not do, all of them just believed the rumors and one girl helped me get through depression, pinigilan nya ko sa bad thoughts of hurting myself and she went out with me sometimes to get lunch or coffee, do take note that she was also a part of my former circle of friends before I got cancelled. 

She's also friends with my former friends and to them, di naman nila minamind when girlie is sumasama saakin, I felt na genuine si girlie saken, I cried to her, she also shared stories basically what matured people do in times when they need someone to lean on. naging safe space ko sya, loyal ako sakanya, nobody talks to me at school pero sya kumakausap.

before end ng 2nd year, I got close rin kay boy kasi he also came sa same circle of friends namin, take note na itong si boy, friend rin nung nang cancel sakin, pero he was true na to me, he doesn't wanna involve in negative people's business so we started hanging out, parehas kaming magastos and parehas kami ng gusto, we became a duo and from time to time naman nagsasama pa rin kami ni girlie.

another girl went up to me and boy, ofcourse mabait naman sya and dati rin syang victim ng letcheng cancel culture na yan, lintek. pretty sya, matalino and mabait, parehas kaming tatlo na love ang makeup, fashion, and many more so ayon nagsama sama kami, lunch, break, gala after uwian, I finally found my home. it was with them. but ofcourse I also hanged out with my first girlie, nothing could make me hate her and nagselos si new girl kasi nga friend ni girlie yung taong nang cancel saakin and sakanya, so hindi nya masikmura na totoo sya saakin and ang nasa isip nya is gusto kong ibuild or makibalik sa dati kong circle, I've told them everytime na it's not that but ayon she does not really believe.

yesterday, uwian, sasabay saamin sa jeep si girlie 1, me and girlie 2 agreed pero nag cchismisan kasi kaming tatlo and nakisali si girlie 1 kasi she doesn't know naman na may off vibe sakanya si girlie 2 and I did not tell her, ayoko ng gulo, love ko sila both.

nagalit sakin si girlie 2 kasi anluwag pa rin daw ng mouth ko when it comes to girlie 1 and that she does not trust me anymore. I cried, nararanasan ko nanaman yung naranasan ko last time, take note ah, october 2023 ako na cancel, and october ngayon, si boy naman he heard my side of the story and promised not to stay away pero iba pa rin eh, ayokong ma disappoint sila,they're all I have.

Deep in my heart, I love boy and girlie 2 but I am grateful for girlie 1. I don't want this feeling, kahapon pa ako nagiisip ng dapat kong gawin, I cried, had bad self thoughts nanaman and I saw girlie 2 and boy hanging out with another person, nag bar sila kagabi sa IG live nag comment naman me pero iniignore ni girlie 2, ibang viewers lang pinapansin nya. I love her and I don't want this, I want to earn her trust back, I genuinely enjoy when I'm hanging out with them. any advice? please?

1fux6ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1fux6ra/cocoapink_perfume_small_review/,Cocoapink perfume small review,"I'm new to cocoapink perfumes and I love gourmand scents. Here are my thoughts on a few of the scents I tried for anyone else who might want some direction in purchasing scents! 

Black Kittens:
Scent description: ""Amber resin, Lemon curd, Vanilla Bean Noel, a drop of Egyptian Musk.""

My review: This scent is so good! It smells like delicious lemon dessert, which is given depth with a dark, mysterious edge. Sugary, candied lemons over vanilla custard with a splash of sophistication and darkness. I forgot I was wearing it once and I wondered who made decadent lemon cupcakes with rich buttercream icing. Then I realized it was my perfume! 10/10. 

Yellow Flipflops: 
Scent description: ""Creamy banana pudding infused with vanilla extract then blended with ripe banana slices, vanilla wafers with an extra shot of cold whipped cream. If you are looking for a realistic banana pudding scent look no further!""

My review: My boyfriend loves banana flavored desserts, so I thought I would try this one out. I didn't really get a realistic banana pudding scent from it, but rather, banana laffy taffy. The scent was nice, but it was very artificial and lacked depth. A nice summery scent but not my favorite. 6/10. 

Myrrh Coffee: 
Scent description: ""Rich black coffee bean Co2 swirled with finest vanilla absolute; a plate of sugary pralines, honey crackers, and coconut creams; wrapped in dreamy myrrh, musk, and the scent of warm summertime hay.""

My review: I'm a coffee lover and I was really excited for this scent. Upon trying it, I was immediately hit with a very bitter (and not the most pleasant) scent. I honestly didn't get much coffee with it. To me it smelled like extremely bitter pecan, or maybe overdone graham cracker pie crust. I didn't think I'd be able to wear it and I was going to give it away until I found a way to use it later. By itself, 2/10. 

Black Apple Noel: 
Scent description: ""Amber resin, juicy Golden Delicious apples smothered in a mouthwatering sticky sweet caramel coating and rounded out with ghostly ribbons of vanilla bean noel.""

My review: This was a nice caramel apple scent. I was expecting it to have the dark edge like Black Kittens had, given the ""black"" in the name, but I didn't get that at all with this one, which was a little disappointing. The scent is a bright, smooth caramel apple scent. The apple bit can come across as a little soapy, but that disappears when it dries down. If you're looking for sweet caramel apple without the dark witchiness, this is good for that candied scent. Really yummy! 7/10. 

I was determined to find a use for the Myrrh Coffee scent, so I tried layering it with Black Apple Noel. I really liked the outcome! The combination smells like spiced apple pie, and it's a perfect fall scent. Initially I thought that the scent was not too long-lasting, but I must just become nose blind to it because someone at work said that I smelled good, like some type of spiced fall scent. This combination is really delicious! 9/10. 

The Un-Red: 
Scent description: ""This blend would make any vampire or other undead creature stalk your bathroom. Buckets of bloody orange juice, sweet vanilla, bourbon vanilla, sandalwoods and ambers. Hide this one well or you will find it missing by morning.""

My review: For a spooky named scent described with reference to a vampire, I was expecting a deep orange citrus scent with a dark edge. There is no dark edge with this one whatsoever, which really bummed me out. It's a bright citrus scent that isn't all too gourmand, it's more fresh. If this perfume is about a vampire, then I'm concerned for him because he is deifnitely standing in the full sun with a straw hat and overalls on, harvesting oranges on a summer afternoon. The scent is really bright, not deep or vampy AT ALL. 
It also is quite artificial, and it honestly kind of reminded me of Orange Glo wood furniture polish. Granted, Orange Glo does smell pretty good for a wood polish (it also kills ants by the way, you're welcome), but I can't un-smell that when I use this perfume now, so I don't think I'll use it. 3/10. 

Banana Flambée: 
Scent description: ""Fresh bananas, hot dark caramel, a dash of rum and crumbled vanilla wafers.""

I read the description for this one and I thought that I might end up liking this perfume better than Yellow Flipflops. I certainly did! This one smells like delicious, warm, fresh baked banana bread straight from a picturesque little fairy cottage. The banana scent is prominent but not overpowering, the perfume has good depth, and it's so cozy, yummy, and warm. I love this one. My boyfriend said that I ""smelled good, like a fancy candle."" 😂
I see where he's coming from, it does kind of also smell like you walked into a really cool antique store and the lady in there lit some really good, expensive spiced banana bread candles. 
I also got a compliment on it at work, someone said it smelled really good. This one also lasts all day, I love it. 10/10. 

Stingy Jack: 
Scent description: ""The man behind the inspiration for the Jack O Lantern in Irish folklore comes alive in this blend showcasing notes of freshly carved Jack O Lanterns, sticky honey, mysterious black vanilla, nag champa, aged patchouli and amber.""

My review: I wanted a pumpkin scent, but I wasn't sure which one to choose. I ultimately decided to go with Stingy Jack due to all of the good reviews and the fact that the perfume sounded like it had layers to it to give it more depth. I was scared that the scent wouldn't be gourmand enough for me, but it's really nice! It smells just like you've been baking spiced pumpkin rolls. The incense note is light enough to give it a little bit of spice and a warm, cozy tone, but it really has that scent like you've just been kneading pumpkin flavored dough and some is stuck to your hands. I let my sister try it out, and after spraying it, she immediately went: ""Ooo, that one's good! It does smell like pumpkin rolls!""
I really like this one, though it is a little doughy. 9/10.",17,1727921142.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I had been with my (Now ex) fiancé for 3 years. He was honestly incredible. Kind, generous, helpful, considerate, handsome, successful.. He would take me on trips and bring me coffee in the morning. He would pack me lunch for work and make me dinner when I got home. He was always supportive and patient with me. my family loved him.

But last year, in August, something changed. This man who I had never seen get drunk in the 2 years I knew him was suddenly getting drunk all the time. He would get wasted in the middle of the day alone in his apartment. I would come over to his place and he would be drunk but deny that he had been drinking. During this time, he was also much more hypersexual and vulgar at times. Not like him at all.
Finally, in January, I had enough and I told him I would leave him, and suddenly it stopped. No more getting drunk. No more weird hypersexuality. Everything went pretty much back to normal.

But then, 2 days ago, I found a text message thread in his phone with his ex-girlfriend. Apparently, he had been reaching out to her intermittently for over a year, usually just little platonic things that honestly I’m not worried about, but then in September one night he started asking her for nudes and was clearly trying to meet up with her for sex. She rejected him. 

I was going to forgive him for it. Primarily because it happened during that weird 4-month period where he wasn’t acting like himself and he has since then not contacted her or done anything else that I could find that was not right. I reached out to her and she confirmed nothing physical ever happened between them. He states he doesn’t even remember sending the text because he was likely drunk. The texts don’t sound drunk, but he is able to text sounding sober even when he has been drinking a lot.

He knows I have the password to his iPad. I confronted him about these texts 2 days ago and asked him if there was anything else I needed to know. He said no, and I figured that even if there was something he would have deleted it off his iPad by this time.

But tonight I looked again and buried deep amongst hundreds of innocent text message threads, there was one, around the same time, where he had texted an escort and was setting up a meeting. It does not appear that it ever ended up getting confirmed or happening. He was also texting me at the same time as this was going on and he did not sound drunk but once again, can’t be sure because he is able to hide his drunkenness well over text even though he can’t in person.

I have no evidence of anything inappropriate before August of last year or after December of last year. It was just those 4 months. 

My heart is shattered. I kicked him out tonight. When I showed him the text with the escort, he broke down sobbing. States he didn’t remember that at all. Claims he must’ve been drunk. To be fair, if he had remembered doing it, I would think he would have deleted it, especially since he knew I was looking through his text messages.

This man has simultaneously treated me better than anyone ever has, and also betrayed me worse than anyone ever has. 

Seeing him sob and beg and state that he was just really “sick” during that time. He said he would go to therapy, couples counseling, AA, anything I wanted, to regain my trust and not lose me.

It’s all so confusing to me. At what point is all the good he brings to my life outweigh the way the he behaved for these few months, the lies, the betrayal. Is it worth it to give him a chance to prove that this really was just a sick time period in his life that he will not allow himself to repeat?

1fux4l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1fux4l1/a_low_waste_guide_for_living_in_a_college_dorm/,A Low Waste Guide for Living in a College Dorm,"\*this guide is mainly about the key areas where maintaining a low-waste life gets tricky in college\*

I do my best to cut back on my waste as much as possible, and I knew there would be some struggles once I moved into a college dorm (traditional setup, I lived in a double, there was one communal bathroom per hall, and a kitchen and laundry room in the basement (I lived on the 3rd floor)) last year, so here are some tips and tricks I found out. 

First of all, **refuse all the cheap plastic shit they try to give you**. The free t-shirts aren't cute either, and chances are you won't wear them. I'm so glad **I bought my college merch 2nd hand** (ebay is great for this) because it was way cheaper, and no one else had the same one.

# Food:

If you're going to be making food in your dorm room, you'll need to have access to a kitchen with a place you can do dishes (a shower caddy was great to carry my dishes in). If you don't have access to that, you could do dishes in the bathroom, but I don't blame you if you don't wanna.

**Take stuff from home**: Things like silverware and mugs are great things to take, your family probably won't miss them if you only take a few

**MASON JARS:** These are by far the best thing I brought to college. They can serve as drink cups (a great swap for red solo cups), cold brew tea, you can make yogurt parfaits/chia pudding/overnight oats in them and take them to class, bring them to a coffee shop and get a drink in them, use them to store leftovers, you can even microwave them (but keep a close eye on them and make sure it's ok with your specific jar), and in a pinch they can serve as measuring cups. You could also use old jam/sauce jars as long as you have the lids. These are also the easiest to wash in a non-kitchen sink, because you could just put in some water, dish soap, and shake till its clean. I will say, I did have a jar full of keifer and granola break in my backpack... so beware. You could make cozies for them to help prevent shattering (I think you could easily knit or crochet them).

**Stasher bowls:** These are soo expensive, but I am OBSESSED with the bowls. They can do pretty much everything a jar could do (except serve as a cup), won't shatter, and are super light. You can even make [microwave meals with them](https://www.stasherbag.com/blogs/stasher-life/microwave-cooking-for-one-college-dorm-recipes-every-student-can-pull-off). The big bowls also work as mixing bowls. Don't waste your money on the other types of bags, the bowls are by far the most versatile. 

# Hygiene

This one was tough

**Periods:** This was my toughest adjustment ([I made a post about this a while ago and people had a lot of great suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1bylc99/maintaining_a_zerowaste_period_while_living_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) 

* **Menstrual cups:** I started out changing my cup in the showers once in morning and once in the evening.  (There were 4 shower ""stalls"" separated by curtains, and they all shared one drain). This is an option but wasn't my favorite. I'd recommend finding the single-stall gender-neutral bathrooms at your school and changing your cup there. There are also some [sterilizers](https://www.amazon.com/menstrual-cup-sterilizer/s?k=menstrual+cup+sterilizer) that people recommend. 
* **Cloth pads & period underwear**: I started out rinsing these in the shower (but I didn't love bringing them into the shower with me), and then throwing them in the wash with my other clothes. Someone recommended rinsing them out by putting them in mason jars with water and shaking (once again, mason jars to the rescue), and this worked well for me

**Soap bars:** I bought a [metal tin](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/round-tin-product-holder) for my shampoo bar years ago, and it's amazing, i'd highly recommend something similar. I use a cloth bag to keep my soap bars in, and that helps stop me from dropping it. I had 2 small command hooks in my room that I hung it up on when I got back to let it fully dry (command hooks, especially the heavy-duty ones, were the 2nd most useful thing I brought to college). 

**Laundry:** My only tip for this would be to buy a [clothes drying rack](https://www.target.com/p/folding-steel-drying-rack-white-brightroom-8482/-/A-87299514#lnk=sametab) so you can air dry (at least some of) your clothes. 



Lastly, **get involved with sustainability/environmental groups on campus.** These groups have the ability to make a lot more change than you'd think, and a lot of colleges want to be more environmentally friendly (not for the environment ofc, but it's good to attract new students, after all they are non-profit only in name). My college did a wildly successful clothing swap, where there were bins for students to put old clothes around the dorms, and then after 2 weeks they had a room in our main building where all the clothing was laid out on tables and people stopped in and picked up whatever they wanted. They also gave out old college t-shirts at events.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.
