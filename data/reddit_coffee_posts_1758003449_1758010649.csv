The second thing was the degrading comments she’d make, for instance, “I’m sure you’d look better when you dress better”, giving completely unsolicited advice. At first I thought she was really quiet and calm, so maybe because my expectations weren’t met I feel stronger about this than usual. But I don’t, am I overreacting, has anyone else experienced anything similar or known/knows someone that went through this, what did you/they  do? And what do you suggest I should do?

Ps: She did say I could make racial jokes back (which I refused to do), and the environment I’m in has barely any black people and mostly Hispanics and Spanish people, white people, and the occasional brown person.",1,1758010041.0,women,0,0.67,False
1nibhtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nibhtk/treated_adhd_seems_odd_missing_urgedrivemotor/,treated ADHD seems odd. Missing urge/drive/motor,"Most of my life, I have been very depressed and anxious and very impulsive -- and feeling this motor signaled to me that I was excited and not so depressed. Ever since I started treatment, this motor has greatly diminished, which has made me more stable and predictable and it feels soothing -- but something feels off. I've always relied on this motor as a way to complete tasks, and to do things. I've always been amazing at work and very fast because of this motor.

I am definitely more happy, and managed, and I can watch TV now and sit still and not as explosive -- but that motor is gone and it feels weird, like empty-ish. I've always drank like 10 coffees a day to induce the motor and get me through the day but then I would be completely burnt out, and depressed.

My logic has always been: motor = happiness, no motor = depressed. And now that the motor is gone, I guess I need to stop thinking that way. I essentially chased the hyperactivity and impulsivity at work and some other things in my daily life -- but was horrible for other things.

Also a lot of people keep saying ""are you sad?"", ""you look calmer"", ""you seem tired"". Because I guess I no longer have that urge.

I am not complaining, I am def better. but I am wondering if this is something other people have experienced with medication? Any tips? Will I essentially rewire the association I'm making (it makes me feel like I'm missing something).

Essentially, I am associating calmness with my usual feelings of feeling empty.",2,1758010019.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I’ve been building a Chrome extension called **Fresnll**. The problem it’s trying to solve: teams spend tons of time writing docs and building knowledge bases, but they often turn into silos. Nobody reads them, or you have to stop your work to dig around for context.

Fresnll tries to fix that by bringing definitions *into the browser itself*:

* You can create a glossary (terms, tags, aliases, descriptions)
* It highlights those terms directly on any webpage
* Hover over a highlight to see the definition in a popover
* Glossaries can be shared via import/export
* All local — no servers, no accounts

Unexpected personal use case: I use it for language learning, like sticking Post-it notes on objects with translations, except online.

**Where it struggles right now:**

* Search is clunky
* Positioning — is this a “lightweight knowledge base,” a “contextual glossary,” or something else?

**Next steps I’m considering:**

* Automatic sync so sharing glossaries isn’t a hassle
* Ability to highlight full site elements, not just words

So… roast away:

* Is this useful, or just another “docs nobody reads” band-aid?
* Is the market way too small?
* Does the whole idea sound like clutter?

I can take it \*sniff\*. Be brutal 🙏

And as such when you jump into a job you need to take advantage of it too.

I know the usual ""do any free course allowed"" or ""ask for experience in xxx for CV"" but I wonder if there is more. From bigger ideas like ""start a business while working from home during down time or learn a language"" to smaller things like ""make sure to drink a work provided coffee and charge your phone on company power while at work"".

I guess I'm hoping to see what others are there that if I ever leave I do so saying well happy I got what I want out of that.

**Find your caffeine tolerance**

Figure out how much caffeine you're intaking when you're continuing to experience a lot of anxiousness, and try gradually reducing it week by week.

I was drinking an average of like 250mg per day. I slowly brought that number down below 150 and my anxiety symptoms are MUCH more manageable.

Another suggestion is to add cardio after caffeine consumption. It gives the increased nerves somewhere to go.

Like realistically, regardless of however you meet a person (be it online or IRL which, let's be honest, its online on dating apps), dont ya'll ever think to go to a coffee shop first? 

Why do you guys go like ""oh let's go to some expensive place"", like why do you feel the need to overcompensate? You dont drive ridiculously lifted trucks with big tires so theres no overcompensation needed tbh..

Theres also the idea of a movie and dinner (movie first so ya'll can have more than 1 thing to talk about other than getting to know each other)

Now im 100% sure that there are definitely red flags when talking to know whether these girls or guys are scammers and you dont need to have experience to notice them - you already will know when you feel abir uncomfortable with something they proposed or said.

That uncomfort is your biggest tell!

And also, theres nothing wrong with sharing thay you aint comfortable with whatever they suggested - if they ain't scammers and are human, then they'll have the space, understanding and openess to decide on where to go TOGHETHER.


Now here's the kicker of truth - if the other person, guy or girl (idc about your preferences tbh because dating is all the same) thinks these places for dates are 'below' them then clearly they aren't the ones.

1nibc34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1nibc34/dealing_with_a_rapid_decline_with_my_father/,Dealing with a rapid decline with my father,"**So first off, about my dad and history this year**

So January this year my dad (79 now) went to the hospital for an unrated issues to Dementia. With me already living in his home, it fell to me to take care of him, with helping him walk and go to the bathroom. 

It got to the point that by April he was doing well on his own. He was going to the bathroom, making his own food, and showering on his own. 

Around May there would be times he would be driving and get lost on very familiar streets or not remember where he parked in parking lots. So I stuck as passenger to navigate when needed. 

In July I went out of state on a planned trip for a week and gave my niece the keys to our house so she can come over when she was able to check in on him. When I returned home on July 21st I found my dad in his recliner with his hat still on that he usually only wears when he goes outside. He was speaking quietly and slowly to me. He told me he fell that day in the kitchen and hit his head. I wanted to call an ambulance but he plead with me not to. I listened to him. 

Next week I saw a severe amount of confusion from him where he was mumbling about things that made no sense and was even asking where my mom was, whom has been divorced from for 15 years and she passed away 4 years ago. I made him food since he hasn't eaten yet and he seemed to have recovered shortly after so I believed that was the issue. I then made an appointment to get him checked out in geriatrics and neurology. 

On August 27th he saw the doctor and ran some cognitive tests plus carotid sonography and determined he was in the moderate stage of vascular dementia. They wanted to run future tests to confirm. My dad was still walking around with assistance of his cane. He went to the bathroom on his own as well. He did stop driving as I would take him everywhere now on. We would still have conversations and talk about history, current events, and anything that crosses our mind. 

On September 9th, I heard my dad pounding his bathroom wall with his cane to get my attention. I rushed to check on him and found him on the toilet rambling about things that don't make sense and then demanding scissors so he can cut off the tubes of his catheter so he can change it. After some time I convinced him not to and managed to get him back to his recliner. I was scared for him that his state of mind suddenly went here again and that he was getting very hostile and aggressive. I decided to call 911 and he was checked out by EMS and taken to the hospital. 

While at the hospital, he was very confused and delirious. He was talking about we need to flip the switch so the electricity can get out and even pointing to the wall and telling me to change the coffee pot. A couple of times he got so hostile to me and staff that he had to be sedated. The doctor talking to me about his dementia and didn't sugar coat it that this was something irreversible and had me talk to the social worker about care. She talking about putting him a mental care facility and presented some options for me to look at. They also informed me he was about to be discharged the same day he arrived. I went to get the car pulled up and a nurse informed me he collapsed when they tried to get him out of the bed so that were going to keep him overnight. 

The next day I went over and picked him up. This whole week my dad has been in that same state with his nonsense rumblings and me trying to convince him that there is no hole that he is going to fall in on the side of his bed. He is not the same man I knew just a couple of weeks ago and he is rapidly declining. 



As of right now I feel so lost, drained both physically and mentally, I haven't been eating nor sleeping well, and I feel so inadequate to take care of my dad. I really want to put him in mental care where he can be monitored fully with professionals, but its was too expensive. All the income we have is from my dad's retirement and SSI. I am unemployed with no chance to getting a job so long as I am taking care of him, especially in this state. Our only family member we have contacts with is my niece and she is busy with work. The social worker did mention getting on to Medi-CAL as they can help with costs of mental care. 

Right now I should be sleeping, but find myself unable to do so. I am blaming myself fully for his condition. I just wish I did called 911 and got him hospitalized when I came home and found he fell. He may have been saved. Even now I have been skimming through looking for any options. 

I have even considered looking for end of life care like MAID since my dad even told me he wouldn't want to live like this.  Right now I can barely take care of myself and wondering how am I supposed to take care of him and feeling disgusted that the thought of him passing away in his sleep peacefully would be very welcomed right now.",2,1758009357.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

Today I received a phone call from the cardiologist about the results from it. She told me that my heart rate did spike up to 170 but would return to normal after some time. She also told me to avoid energy drinks and coffee, which I rarely drink to begin with, sometimes once every month or two. Other than that I was told it could be a panic disorder and to see a psychologist.

I've had a few panic attacks before but that only happened when I was in a very tough situation, and that was extremely rare. I don't believe I could have a panic disorder, as any time my symptoms would spike I was always fine, for multiple days.

Just after the holter monitor, I almost fainted again and when I checked my heart rate it was 136 and pulse at 106. Been following the recommendation from her of wearing compression socks and more salt.

After 6 truly amazing months together, the end of July comes and I help her move in and so starts the long distance part of the story. Neither of us were adjusting well. She was having issues getting a new job, leaving her friends and developing a social life in her new state and I became very depressed and unsure if long distance would work out ( i realize now I was just in my head too much about not having them around). Ik there's no justification and I take full accountability for my actions, but I cheated on them with my ex. I waited about 6 days before I broke down and told them.I immediately stopped all of my bad habits, started therapy and got us both workbook/ journals for the situation. After a week of talking about it we broke up. I would love to have a second chance and I really feel I can prove I'm worth it. She says she's not sure she can forgive me for cheating and wouldn't want to continue a relationship and hold it over me forever Her solution to figure this out is to go no contact until an undetermined day in the winter (Nov/Dec) where we get coffee. I have no idea if we'll get back together or not until that day. All I feel I can do now is continue to work on myself and try to get over the relationship I used to have. Any advice?

Addendum: Her dad hates cheaters from personal experience, so she hasn't told him until she's sure it's a no. To help me move on I've considered politely returning her stuff to him as it would go to his house anyhow and he's much closer. I've considered also telling him the truth should he ask. My only concern is losing an opportunity to reconnect with her however I would want a partner that I know has accepted every aspect of reconnecting and I don't think we could hide it from him forever.",1,1758008528.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Let me introduce them:

* Aura: the rich, confident, coffee-addicted, athletic elf, loves being the center of attention and left the elf capital looking for a ""real world experience"" (aka 'how poor live').
* Chiara: She is a shy, tired, part-time librarian with OCD and obsessed with plants. Spending so much time among —and even sleeping on— ancient magical codices eventually gave birth to an alter ego inside her: Chiaroscura. She manifests only in the dark but she's not evil… just mad.

1niazp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1niazp1/i_think_my_imaginary_friends_are_dangerous/,I think my imaginary friends are dangerous.,"When I was a kid, bad things happened in my house. I don’t really need to get into the details — you can probably fill in the blanks. Let’s just say I grew up with issues before I even knew how to spell it.

My way of surviving was… leaving. Not physically, obviously. But mentally. By the time I was eight, I had learned how to disappear.

People call it dissociation now. Back then it was just zoning out. I still can’t tell if it saved me or if it broke something I’ll never get back.

Teachers wrote reports about my daydreaming. Whilst My parents just called me lazy. But really, I was building entire universes inside my head. To me, it was amazing. A superpower of creativity. 

And here’s the weird part, I never stopped.

Even now, as an adult, I slip into it like a second skin. Sometimes unintentionally sometimes on purpose. On the train, in line at the grocery store, lying awake at night, I just go somewhere else. I make people. Friends. Lovers. Enemies. Heroes. Villains. I give them names, backstories, quirks. I decide how they meet, what happens to them, how they die if I’m feeling dramatic.

I have some preset worlds that I visit most. These are usually reserved to help me regulate my emotions, they’re filled with characters that agree with everything I say or help me work through a feeling. Because they are technically all me, I know I’m just helping myself through my problem but it’s comforting to think that other people want to help me too, even if they aren’t real.

When I’m bored though, these worlds can develop into anything.

One time I made myself win the lottery — six million pounds. I bought a house, filled it with cool stuff, donated a chunk to children’s charities , and created the dialogue for all the characters around me as I went along. “Oh, thank you so much” I made one character say, “you’ve single handedly solved child poverty.” I remember letting out a little giggle in the real world which resulted in all five people at the bus stop turning to look at me, eyebrows raised.

Another time, I imagined a world where every single person on earth had a countdown above their head, a glowing number ticking away to their death. I spent weeks inside that one, weaving stories of how people would act if they knew exactly when they were going to die. I made a married couple cling to each other as the husband watched his wife’s count down tick to zero whilst he still had 12 years left, as she died, I made him sob into her hair wishing he would go to. Then I had an idea, I made him sit up in resolution as his count down switched to 4 minutes…yeah, I made him...erm self-exit. What can I say, I was feeling emotional that day.

It’s like playing The Sims, except I’m the god, the camera, and every single character at the same time. I can write a whole romance in my head during a boring meeting. I can invent a tragic war epic to help me fall asleep. Sometimes I make them fight, sometimes I make them laugh, sometimes I let them comfort me when I can’t comfort myself.

It’s my own little multiverse. And I control everything.

…Or at least, I thought I did.

The first time it happened, I was in this world where I was just about to be broken up with. I wasn’t in a very good place in my relationship in the real world, so I used to go there often when I was alone, usually after arguments. Sometimes id figure out a way to fix it, sometimes id just let it happen and wallow in self-pity whilst making lasagne, this time though I guess I just wanted to get some practise in. you know, cool comebacks etc just in case the inevitable happened.

So, I had everything planned, the world was built, backstory thought of, the script ready in my head, it was going well, I decided at the last minute that this time I was going to beat him to the punch, I sat us down on a bench, I made the evening sun just about to dip below the horizon and I started to talk. “I know you don’t want to be with me” I started, I had a whole host of witty, clever things I wanted to say ready for when he was finished with his part of the script but, that’s not what happened.

“That’s not fair. You don’t know what I want.”

The words were so sharp, so clear, I don’t know if I heard them in my head… or out loud.

I hadn’t planned that. I hadn’t even thought those words before I heard them.

I actually stopped, mid-laundry, because I thought I’d misremembered. But no, this character, this fake person, just looked at me, the, in my mind me and said something I didn’t make him say.

At first, I brushed it off, the brain is a cool thing, I thought, I’d buried myself so deep into this world that my subconscious was picking up on something it thought was coming next that’s all.

Even still, I didn’t go back in there. I stayed out of my own head all day. Every time I felt myself slipping into a scenario, I’d do my best to snap myself back to reality. I didn’t know what my brain was playing at, but I had no come back for what he said. He was meant to agree, I had it all planned.

That evening I couldn’t sleep, I’d pretty much forgotten about the little brain blip earlier, it was overshadowed by my actual boyfriend not coming home that night.

I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, but nothing helped. Finally, I decided to slip into my happy place.

It’s place I’d built when I was around ten. It was a quiet cabin in the middle of dense woods, no people, just me. It was always raining there; I love the rain.

I’d always start the scenario outside, soaked through. I would walk up to the cabin, unlock the door, and be met by comforting warmth even though the fire sat cold.

I’d light the fire, usually with magic. I was ten, give me a break. And I’d snuggle in my goose down duvet, on the sofa, the soft fabric so soothing against my cold skin. and then jerry would bring me cookies. Oh, Jerry’s not a person, like I said this cabin was strictly no people allowed. He’s my kind of adopted forest pet. I’m not sure exactly what he is, I think my kid brain must have mixed two birds together because he’s as white as a dove but is most defiantly a crow. I’m 36 now so I can’t remember what I was thinking and I’ve no idea why I’d name a bird Jerry at 10 but He’s a permanent fixture here anyway.

I wanted comfort so I closed my eyes and planned to drift there. It was harder to get there this time. It was difficult to relax with everything going on, but I managed it eventually.

I walked through the forest, up the path, the familiar droplets of heavy rain beading on my skin as always. I couldn’t hear the usual bird song this time, I put it down to my brain being torn between this world and reality.

The real me was very anxious so maybe background ambience was too much for my mind to process as well.

But when I walked through the door in my mind, the fire was already lit. Someone was sitting in the chair by the hearth. A woman. Jerry was perched on her shoulder. She turned, looked straight at me, and whispered:

“Finally.”

I snapped out of it so fast I thought I was going to be sick.

Now I know I definitely didn’t make her.

 I should have left it there. But curiosity eats at you, doesn’t it?

I’ve been in therapy since I was able to pay for it myself. Doctor Ashcroft always said dissociation was just my brain protecting itself, so I told myself that’s all this was. A trick of memory. A glitch in the script. Nothing more. She said because my real world felt out of control that maybe it was bleeding into my subconscious, making me “think” I didn’t do or say the things in my head.

From that point on I tried to chill. It didn’t take long before I was sitting alone in my office, bored out of my skull waiting on Simon from accounting to email something through. I imagined what it would be like if I didn’t have to work there and before I new it I’d slipped back into my lottery win daydream.

I imagined myself at home, my new bigger home, sipping a passionfruit martini beside my indoor swimming pool. The sun’s warm rays reflecting ripples of pool water like glitter on the walls. For a moment it was perfect, the tang of fruit on my tongue, the cool tiles beneath my bare feet, the lazy sound of water lapping against the pool’s edge.

Then I noticed a wet footprint.

Just one, near the edge of the pool. Not mine. Too big. Too heavy. The droplets led toward the glass doors but disappeared halfway, as if whoever left them had just, vanished.

I tried to push it aside, chalking it up to a slip in concentration.

I set my glass down, thinking about how nice it would be to feel the water on my skin. and that’s when I saw it: a reflection rippling across the glittering wall. Not mine. Not anything that should’ve been there. A figure moving slowly, deliberately, behind me.

Before I could turn, I felt two cold hands on my shoulders. My heart pounded in my chest. I didn’t summon them. I didn’t build them.

They leaned in, close enough that I could smell chlorine on their skin, and whispered:

“You’re starting to understand.”

I was startled out of the nightmare of my apparent own creation by a knock.

“Erm, sorry Laura I cant get the email to er... email.” Simon stood in the doorway, arms stuffed full of disorganised papers. His face twisted when he saw me. “What’s with you? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I laughed too quickly, the sound brittle. My hands went to my shoulders without thinking, brushing at the fabric of my blouse. Wet. My fingertips came away damp. Maybe sweat. Maybe.

Simon frowned. “You alright? You smell like… chlorine.”

I forced a smile, but my heart was still racing. I hadn’t been near a real pool in months.

“I… I’m not feeling well, I think I need to go home,” I stammered before brushing past him.

“Er, alright,” he echoed down the hallway.

I was halfway to the car when I heard the crash behind me, Simon, cursing as he tripped over a bucket the cleaner had left outside my office door. A sharp whiff of chemicals hit the air.

For one dizzy second, I almost laughed with relief. Of course. The smell. Just cleaning supplies. Just coincidence.

But then I looked down at my blouse. The damp patches clung to my skin. And no bucket in the world could explain that. Right?

I tried to get an urgent appointment with Doctor Ashcroft, but I couldn’t get a hold of her.

On the drive home, my mind wandered without me meaning it to. One blink I was on the motorway, the next I was sitting in my log cabin. Across from that woman. The one I never made.

She smiled, leaned close, and simply said.

“Hello.”

My eyes snapped open to headlights bearing down on me. I swerved hard, tyres screaming, dragging myself back into the right lane with my heart hammering against my ribs.

I wasn’t safe anywhere now. Not even behind the wheel.

That had never happened before. I could always control everything. Every character, every setting, every detail bent to my will. Every thought was mine.

But now it felt like I was falling — falling into a world of my own creation without a choice.

My fingers drummed a frantic rhythm against the coffee table as I tried to anchor myself, to will myself to stay here, in reality.

That’s when my phone rang.

Dr. Ashcroft.

I snatched it up, desperate for answers, for something that would pull me back. But all I got were words of advice, calm and clinical. Ground yourself. Remind yourself it’s still just you. Realise they’re just parts of your mind.

Not what I wanted to hear. Not when the voices didn’t feel like me anymore.

I tried to argue, to tell her it was different this time, that it wasn’t me. But she cut me off with a barrage of urgent questions.

“You say they’re not yours, who’s do you think they are?” “I don’t know.”

“When you hear them, is it inside your head, or does it sound like it’s coming from outside?” “I don’t know.”

“Do they sound familiar to you in any way?” “No, I don’t know.”

“What do you think the voices want from you?” “I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know!”

I hung up the phone, scowling at the screen. What was that? I needed help not an interrogation. I couldn’t answer half her questions but one clung to me. The more I tried to ignore it, the heavier it sat in my chest.

That night, I lay down on my bed, exhausted but restless. Against my better judgement, I drifted back into the cabin. It still rained outside, soaking my skin that comforting way it always did. But I could see the firelight already flickering inside.

She was there. The woman. Waiting. Jerry perched calm on her shoulder.

She tilted her head, eyes bright, lips curling into a smile that wasn’t kind.  
“Well… isn’t this freeing?”

My legs carried me forward in two shaky steps before I even realised, I was moving.

Then I blinked.

And I wasn’t standing anymore. I was sitting in the chair across from her, hands folded neatly in my lap as if someone else had put me there.

A voice rose from behind me, low and certain.  
“She means… you’re not the one in control anymore.”

Her smile lingered, and then the world around me fractured.

In the blink of an eye, I was no longer in the cabin. I was back on the bench, the one where I’d practised breaking up with my boyfriend. Only this time, he turned his head and looked me dead in the eye.  
“I don’t need you to tell me what to say.”

Before I could answer, the scene shifted again. I was standing in front of the woman I’d once imagined thanking me for charity donations. Her eyes burned with something like fury.  
“I don’t need to be your puppet for your gratification.”

Then everything shifted again. I was in the countdown world, but this time I wasn’t watching him. I was in his place. A stool beneath my feet, a rope brushing my throat, his hands steadying me. His voice was calm, almost relieved,  
“I don’t have to do this… but I want to.” He kicked the stool from under me. I felt the rope tighten like a vice round my neck as the world faded to grey.

I woke gasping for air, clawing at my throat, only to find myself tucked neatly in bed, the sheets smoothed, the pillow cool beneath my head.

Which brings me to now.

I am doing everything I can to stay out of my worlds. No daydreams, no slipping, no comfort trips to the cabin. It does not matter. Lately, I catch myself halfway through things I do not remember starting.

Once, I found myself standing at the sink, cold water running over my hands, the tap opened fully. My hands were blue.

Another time, I awoke halfway down the stairs, clutching a mug I couldn’t recall filling.

These moments, stolen, half-lived, settle over my days like dust. There are gaps in the hours now, little pockets of missing time that throb at the edges of my memory. I tell myself I am fine. I tell myself this is nothing, that exhaustion can mimic madness.

Yet, this morning I woke up with my nails dug deep into my arm, skin raw. I had been scratching words into myself.

When I finally pulled my hand away, the words were there, carved in jagged red letters.

NOT YOURS.

I try to walk through my days more slowly now, clinging to routines like clockwork. That way, if time goes missing, I’ll know.

I can feel them watching. The other selves. Waiting for the moment I slip, waiting for the chance to step forward again.

Is this how they felt? Living their lives normally until I plucked them from their reality and forced them to play in mine?

But that can’t be it. I made them, didn’t I?

They aren’t real, are they?

Dr. Ashcroft wants to up our sessions to twice a week. She says next time she’ll have a specialist join us.

When I said, “I didn’t know there was a specialist in daydream characters gone wrong,” she just smiled at me in that doctor-way, like I’m crazy.

I’m not crazy.

I didn’t give these imaginary people independence. I can’t make them do what they want.

But if I didn’t give them autonomy… [who did?](https://youtu.be/bD7YEsvWpEU)

I know. The Hadley is upscale while 77 12th St is just a nice regular building without upscale pizzazz (which is totally fine). Price-wise, I'm getting a good deal at the Hadley so the price difference is only $140. 

What worries me though is, would i be overpaying for the Hadley amenities? They're not impressive at all, the gym is not open 24/7, the pool is not heated, and the common areas are tiny. I expected more from a building like the Hadley. 77 12th St has larger common areas with more options (games, seating areas, coffee), although some of the furniture could be upgraded (e.g. lounge chairs by the pool).

The Hadley unit is east facing (overlooking the park) but no floor to ceiling or large windows. The 77 12th St unit is north facing (view of the city, which i dont care for) but has floor to ceiling windows. The shelves and niches in the Hadley units are very pretty, and the white walls and lighter floor manage to make up for the smaller windows.

Which building would you choose? Is The Hadley overpriced for what I'd get? (I toured other upscale properties like Juniper, Lilli, Novel, Momentum, and I didn't like any of them. I also toured MAA Midtown and Azure, also didnt like anything there.)

I can’t do this anymore.

Third time she asked the day before my coffee was even made. I smiled. Said “it’s Tuesday” again. Helped her cut her toast. But I was filled with this unexplainable hate and anger. This isn’t my mom. This is a ghost in her skin. The woman who raised me is gone. Vanished. Now there’s just this confused person who is scared all the time and I’m supposed to fix it.

My worst secret. The one I can’t even say out loud. I close my eyes and I wish for the phone call. The one that says it’s over. I think about the relief. Just for a second. The quiet. No more questions. No more falls. No more watching her try to find a memory that isn’t there.

Then the guilt hits me like a fist to the gut and I can’t breathe.

She has no dignity left. This disease took it all. Why is it humane for an animal but not for my own mother. What is the point of this suffering.

I don’t talk to my friends. What would I say. My life is just this. A loop. I’m not a person. I’m a caregiver. That’s all. I’m just the answer to the next question. The hand that keeps her from falling. The voice that says it’s okay when it’s not.

I love my mother. The mother who was. This person, I don’t know what I feel. Pity. Anger. And I hate myself for it. I hate this disease with a rage that feels like it could burn down a house. It’s making me a person I don’t recognize. Someone who thinks about death and feels a flash of hope.

These are some of my characters so far. I'm refraining from calling them ""finished"" as i've changed them and their borders/stats etc. so many times lol. Pretty sure this is about where i want them though. Now that i have the gameplay pretty well established, and the cards cleared up, i can get back to pumping out artwork. I have driven myself insane with these guys and the gameplay. Like an obsession. A multicolored web of yarn in my head, even though the game isn't really all that complicated. Im just stupid lol. And i guess i just made things more complicated for myself. I've got a lot of stuff worked out now thanks to some lovely people on discord. They pointed things out i would have never seen myself. And i really want it to be clear and easy to play for other people. I dont care if these ""take off"" i just want to make people laugh and have fun experimenting with deck building.

I started experimenting with CBD gummies a few months ago. Stressful workdays, sleepless nights, racing thoughts, you name it. At first, it felt like a miracle. I could finally relax without reaching for coffee or endlessly scrolling my phone. Then I added CBN gummies for sleep, energy gummies in the mornings, and even CBD oil tinctures when anxiety hit hard. I even gave my dog some CBD pet treats because, well…why not? It’s convenient, it works, and it’s legal

 but I keep asking myself: can this really be a long-term strategy, or am I just masking the symptoms instead of addressing the root cause? Has anyone else made this a regular habit, and how do you balance supporting your mental health without relying solely on supplements?

1niaouk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicationQuestions/comments/1niaouk/atomoxetine_for_audhd_woman_42/,"Atomoxetine for AuDHD woman, 42.","Hi all
I'm currently in titration and have had negative experiences with both Methylphenidate and Elvanse. I am starting Atomoxetine 40mg in the next couple of days and then will be gradually increasing the dosage up to 60mg and then 78mg. 

Can I ask what side effects other people have experienced? 

I didn't keep a record of my stimulant S/E but I do know they absolutely weren't suitable for me.

My positives are; 
Cutting out tea and coffee (16 mugs a day to none in less than 4 days)
Quitting smoking (3 months quit now) 
My exercise levels increased more than 200%. I used to walk no more than 800/1000 steps a day, but since June 10th I've done nearly 1.5million steps and more than 550 miles. 
Reduced my binge eating resulting in a 9kg weight loss (75.2kg -in 65.7kg)  I've had no stimulants for 4 days now and I can't stop shoving food in my face but I've maintained the walking, with the lowest step count being 5k and the highest being 18k. 
My anxiety around leaving the house and socializing is more manageable and I recognize the burn out signs much sooner.

My negatives are; 
I used to love reading, sometimes upto 5 books a week. I read 85 in the first 6 months of the year but since meds I've not been able to focus long enough to read. Which is disappointing but I'm hoping it comes back. 
My budgeting skills took years to get under control, but whilst on stimulants, frivolous spending has been somewhat unhealthy on my bank balance. 
Meds wore off by 1400 and so my evening and socializing time I was hyper/manic. 
Couldn't go to bed and then couldn't get out of bed in the morning. 
Doom scrolling for hours at a time, vacant and not doing anything. But just standing. Not even taking my shoes off.

I'm just wondering what possible expectations from Atomoxetine there are that will be better or worse.

# Read Link: [**https://writers.spotipremiumapk.in/reborn-back-1/**](https://writers.spotipremiumapk.in/reborn-back-1/) 

Elara Hayes found herself back at 27, reborn. 

She had two children, a son and a daughter, and was married to Dominic Thorne, the global billionaire. The man who consistently topped the Forbes list, was hailed by \*Time\* magazine as “the world’s most desirable bachelor, and whom even the British monarchy reportedly wished to marry off their princess to. 

Everyone said she was incredibly lucky. Yet, the first thing she did was take a divorce agreement to 

his first love. 

She slid the papers across the table to Cassandra Sterling, her voice calm. “I want a divorce. Dominic is yours. The children are yours too.”‘ 

Cassandra stared at her, stunned, unable to believe that the woman who’d occupied the “Mrs. Thorne” title for six years would suddenly give it up so willingly. 

Elara simply added, a faint weariness in her tone, “Since they both prefer you, I’ll grant your wishes. 

Just get Dominic to sign, and once the mandatory waiting period is over, I’ll leave.” 

This time, she refused to repeat her past mistakes. She refused to remain the invisible Mrs. Thorne, overlooked by everyone. 

Cassandra’s fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her coffee cup, her brow furrowed. “Elara, what game are you playing?” 

Elara watched the shifting expressions on Cassandra’s face, repeating calmly, “No game. I’m just fed 

up.” 

“Elara, do you have any idea how many women out there would kill for your position?” 

“I do.” Elara met her gaze. “Which is why I’m giving it to you.” 

A crack finally appeared in Cassandra’s composure. 

She stared at the agreement for a long time, then finally picked it up. “Alright. Since you’re so generous, I won’t refuse.”.

“But remember, what I get my hands on, I never let go of.” 

“Don’t worry,” Elara offered a small smile. “I won’t regret it. Not ever.”” 

After all, in her previous life, she’d already tasted the bitterness of a solitary existence. 

Cassandra rose and moved to another table in the coffee shop. With an elegant flick of her wrist, she pulled out her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen. 

When the call connected, her voice instantly softened. “Dominic, I’m at the Blue Mountain Café. Can you come pick me up?” 

Elara sat nearby, a bitter smile playing on her lips. 

Once upon a time, when she called Dominic, his assistant answered nine out of ten times. 

Now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was perpetually “in a meeting” appeared at the café 

entrance. 

Through the glass, Elara watched Dominic stride into the café, his broad shoulders and narrow waist accentuated by his custom-tailored black suit. 

Six-year-old Leo and four-year-old Mia instantly rushed to Cassandra, showering her with hugs and 

kisses. 

“Auntie Cassie!” Mia chirped sweetly, rubbing her little face against Cassandra’s arm. 

Dominic placed a cake box on the table, his long fingers gently pushing it toward her. “Your favorite matcha. I specifically asked the chef to go easy on the sugar.” 

Cassandra’s eyes lit up. “You always remember.” 

Elara sat in the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palm. 

Six years of marriage, and Dominic didn’t even know her favorite flavor. 

Last life, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy a random one. It turned out to be mango, which she was allergic to. 

“What do you want for dinner tonight?” Dominic’s voice was deep. “French, or Italian?” 

3:45 pm

Cassandra smiled, taking the divorce agreement from her bag. “Before that, there’s a document I’d like you to see.” 

She opened the agreement to the signature page. “I’ve set my sights on a villa, but I’m a bit short on liquid funds. Could you…?” 

Dominic took the pen, signing without even glancing at the contents. “Between us, why be so Formal?” 

“Auntie Cassie, are you buying a new house?” Leo asked, looking up. “Dad, why don’t you buy one next door? Mia and I want to move in with Auntie Cassie. We don’t want to stay with Mom every day.” 

Dominic’s brow furrowed slightly, but seeing the children’s expectant faces, he relented. “Alright, I’ll buy one.” 

“No need for such trouble,” Cassandra quickly said. “I’ll just leave three rooms for Leo and Mia… and you. You can come and stay whenever you like.” 

The children cheered with delight. Mia even hugged Cassandra’s neck and gave her a kiss. “Auntie Cassie is the best! A thousand times better than Mom!” 

Elara’s heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand, a dull ache that made it almost mpossible to breathe. 

She saw the slight upward curve of Dominic’s lips-a gentle smile he had never once given her. 

Unable to watch any longer, she grabbed her bag and walked out. 

The moment she stepped outside, memories of her previous life flooded back. 

In her past life, she and Dominic had an arranged business marriage. She bore him a son and a daughter, lived to 62, but was never truly happy. 

All because Dominic’s heart had always belonged to his childhood sweetheart, Cassandra Sterling. 

After their breakup years ago, Cassandra went abroad. Dominic drowned his sorrows for a few days, but being too proud to beg her to stay, he soon agreed to his family’s arranged marriage.

I’m still pretty new to RV life, so I’ve been asking around and soaking up as much advice as I can from people who’ve been doing this for years. A lot of them kept bringing up certain gadgets that make life on the road easier, safer, and just a little more fun. Here are the top five that stood out to me:

1. Wi-Fi Booster/Router

Apparently, campground Wi-Fi is more of a rumor than a reality most of the time. The new boosters for 2025 can pull in weak signals and even switch between cellular data and satellite, which makes working or streaming way less stressful.

2. Portable Solar Power Station

Veteran RVers kept saying “you’ll thank yourself when you’re off-grid.” These new solar stations are compact, charge quickly, and let you see exactly how much power you’ve got left,so no surprises when you’re mid-coffee brew.

3. Smart Security System

I didn’t think about this at first, but lots of people recommended having some kind of simple RV-specific system with motion sensors and phone alerts. It seems like one of those things you don’t appreciate until you really need it.

4. Compact Grill/Air Fryer Combo

This one surprised me. More than one person swore by having a small, efficient cooking gadget that does double duty. The new air fryer/grill combos are lightweight, energy-saving, and apparently can turn campground meals into something you’d actually crave.

5. Digital Tire Pressure & Health Monitor

This one came up over and over again. Experienced RVers told me tires are the thing you don’t want to gamble with. The latest monitors track pressure, heat, and even predict when you’ll need replacements—basically giving you a heads-up before disaster.

That’s the list I’ve gathered so far, but I know I’ve barely scratched the surface. What other gadgets would you seasoned RVers add to this list? I’d love to hear your suggestions (and I’m sure other newbies would too).

We continued texting for about a week, telling each other sweet nothings and goodnight every night.

She asked about my day. I told her I scheduled therapy and actually told her why.

\
Alt text: Corporate professionals exchanging ideas in a business meeting., Bahrain’s business registrations surged 17% in 2024, with startups increasingly clustering in Seef, Bahrain Bay, and the Diplomatic Area.\
\
Reuters recently reported FDI inflows hit $1.6B in early 2025, bolstered by robust government reforms and fast-track company formation procedures (Reuters Bahrain Economy).\
\
The Economic Development Board (EDB) projects GDP growth of 3.8% for 2025, driven by digital commerce, fintech, and a significant move toward remote and flexible work models. Entrepreneurs are keenly asking: Do I still need a physical office for my CR?\
Spoiler: Yes and No—depending on your activity, business structure, and how you navigate the rules.\
Firsthand: Why Entrepreneurs Want to Work from Home in Bahrain\
I remember my team’s frustration: “Why pay BHD 400+ monthly for a Diplomatic Area office when our entire tech stack runs from our living rooms?” But the answer isn’t as simple as a “remote work” checkbox.\
Key reasons business owners prefer working from home:\
\
Save on office rent, utilities, and furniture\
Avoid daily traffic snarls around Seef and Juffair\
Greater work-life balance—especially during Ramadan when business hours (and rhythms) shift\
Digital-first, service-based startups don’t actually need daily in-person meetings\
\
However, Bahrain’s Company Formation laws and office requirements can be surprisingly nuanced.\
Understanding Bahrain Business License & Office Needs\
The Sijilat Puzzle: What Does the Law Say?\
Many assume Bahrain’s Sijilat portal or the MOICT site will have a clear, unified answer. But official advice can vary—one officer at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOICT) may wave through a home business, another might demand a full commercial address.\
The 2025 Policy Update\
From January 2025, Bahrain introduced a Remote Business Permit for select activities, including digital consultancy, graphic design, and certain types of e-commerce. (Bahrain.com – Official Government Regulations).\
\
Offices are still required for regulated activities—especially those involving client meetings, inventory, or regulated professional services.\
\
Common Business Structures & How They Impact Your Options\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professionals in a meeting.). These impact your flexibility with office requirements:\
\
Single Person Company (SPC): Allows full ownership and, with the new 2025 permit, flexible office arrangements for some activities.\
With Limited Liability Company (WLL): Still the most popular format, but usually requires a registered commercial address.\
Branch Office: Foreign firms establishing a branch must show evidence of a Bahrain address.\
Freelancer License: Popular among creatives and consultants; home office use possible but with restrictions.\
\
And speaking from experience: choosing the wrong entity can add months to your timeline and hundreds of BHD in wasted fees. Always match your structure to your real business needs.\
Read more about business types: Bahrain Business Type Structures\
Office Requirements: What’s Actually Enforced?\
The Traditional Rule\
Historically, the MOICT mandated every company have a “commercial address”—which could range from a flex desk in Bahrain Bay to a full office floor in the Diplomatic Area. Even e-commerce or freelance CRs were pressured to show a lease.\
New Flexibility (But With Limits)\
The 2025 Remote Business Permit is a game-changer, but only for specific, low-impact activities. The catch? You’ll need:\
\
To apply for the correct activity codes on Sijilat\
A landlord NOC for home-based businesses (even if you own your flat!)\
Proof of utilities and proper business signage (yes, a sticker on your mailbox counts)\
\
Importantly, if your work involves inventory, walk-in customers, or regulated advice, a dedicated office is still non-negotiable.\
Real Examples: Who Can & Cannot Work from Home\
Allowed to Work from Home (2025):\
\
Digital consultants, marketers, web/app developers\
Graphic designers, content creators, certain freelancers\
E-commerce stores with drop-shipping or fulfillment-by-partner models (no local stock)\
\
Still Require an Office:\
\
Law firms, regulated financial or accounting providers\
Retail shops with physical stock/inventory\
Medical centers, clinics, and any business requiring official inspection\
\
I once helped a friend set up a remote consulting CR; by securing an NOC from her landlord and choosing her activity carefully, she saved BHD 5,000+ over two years. But when we tried the same for an import/export venture, Sijilat flagged the application for office inspection and delayed the CR by two months. Lesson learned!\
Step-by-Step: How to Legally Establish a Home-Based Business in Bahrain\
1. Choose the Right Activity and Structure\
\
Use the Sijilat database to confirm which activities are “remote-permitted.”\
Consult the foreigner-allowed activity list if you are a non-Bahraini—some activities are 100% foreign-owned, others require a local partner.\
For remote-friendly sectors, consider an SPC for maximum ownership and flexibility.\
\
2. Prepare Documents Early\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, preparing office paperwork.\
- Proof of address (utility bill or lease agreement)\
- Landlord’s No Objection Certificate (NOC) for home-based business\
- Clear business activity description—use official MOICT codes\
Time-saving hack: Submit all scans in PDF format—Sijilat prefers this and moves your file faster.\
3. Pick the Easiest Registration Path\
\
Go direct via Sijilat for simple digital services activities.\
Use Keylink’s company formation guide for step-by-step breakdowns.\
Apply during Ramadan mornings for shortest queues at Seef Mall’s MOICT branch (personal aside: I once waited just 12 minutes by showing up at 8:00am post-Suhoor. Timing is everything!)\
\
4. Confirm Office Address Compliance\
\
For remote CRs: Home address, landlord NOC, and business signage required.\
For regulated sectors: Lease a small office at shared spaces like Regus (Bahrain Bay & Seef), which offers instant address letters and utilities in your company name.\
Free zones (limited in number, but worth exploring): Free Zones in Bahrain\
\
5. Register with LMRA and Tamkeen (if hiring staff)\
\
All commercial registrations must link to Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) portal if you plan to hire.\
Tamkeen offers fee waivers and business support, especially for remote-first businesses.\
\
6. Post-Formation: Stay Compliant\
\
Annual renewal of commercial registration (CR)\
Timely submission of accounts—outsource to experts: Bahrain Accounting & Bookkeeping\
Watch for regulatory updates via Bahrain.com and Gulf News: Bahrain\
\
Cost Considerations: Home-Based vs. Conventional Office\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculating business budget in Bahrain.:**\
\
Home Office Permit: BHD 50–100/year (just MOICT fees)\
Landlord NOC processing: Free–BHD 20 (depending on agent)\
Shared office (virtual address at Regus, Seef): BHD 40–80/month for address + mail handling\
Dedicated office (Diplomatic Area, min. 20sqm): BHD 320–600/month\
Sijilat Activity Change (to enable remote working): BHD 5–15 per update\
\
\
For a full comparison table and up-to-date fee info, check Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
\
Pro tip: Save by negotiating annual leases or leveraging Tamkeen support for startups.\
A Tangent: The Business Coffee Ritual\
Straying briefly from paperwork—never underestimate Bahrain’s coffee culture. Majlis-style networking, especially in Seef’s lobby cafés, opens doors that emails rarely can. Once, a single shared qahwa led to an expedited landlord NOC. Relationships—more than just forms—grease the wheels of Bahrain business.\
Ownership Rules: What About Foreign Entrepreneurs?\
Surprisingly, Bahrain is more open than neighbors. Foreigners can own up to 100% of their business in most sectors—with documented approvals (see allowed activities and ownership limits).\
Compared to Saudi Arabia or the UAE (where local sponsorship rules can be complex), Bahrain’s approach is friendlier:\
\
No need for a “silent partner” in most digital or consulting businesses\
Local sponsorship only for specific, protected sectors (Local Sponsorship Info)\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Staying Safe & Audit-Ready\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, business regulations in Bahrain.\
- Display business signage—even if it’s just a nameplate at your apartment door\
- File accounts annually, use trusted Bahrain accountants\
- Prepare for surprise inspections\
Common mistake: Many skip signage or fail to update Sijilat after moving flats. This can suspend your CR. Always update your address promptly.\

- Sijilat WhatsApp support (yes—it works if you’re persistent, especially for minor document clarifications)\
The Bahrain Advantage: Comparison with UAE & Saudi\
Bahrain offers simpler registration, fewer residency hurdles, and (as of 2025) more remote-friendly activities than Dubai’s mainland or Riyadh. Free zones in Bahrain are smaller, but you can launch a 100% foreign-owned consulting CR from your apartment—something that’s getting harder in neighboring countries.\
Conclusion: Work from Home is Possible—If You Play by the Rules\
The answer? Yes, you can work from home with a Bahrain business license—but only for certain permitted activities and with the right paperwork. Failing to match your activity and address to MOICT’s expectations will stall your journey.\
And for those tempted to cut corners—Bahrain’s inspectors are savvy. One missed step with signage or address updates can lead to frustrating delays. Get your documents in order, nurture your coffee shop connections, and you’ll save both time and money.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Office Requirements\
\
Can I use my residential address for my Bahrain commercial registration (CR)?\
Yes, if your business activity is eligible for the Remote Business Permit introduced in 2025. You’ll need a landlord NOC and must display appropriate signage. For regulated activities, a dedicated office remains mandatory. See Bahrain Company Formation Process for details.\
\
What are the cheapest office solutions for new companies in Bahrain?\
Home office permits cost as little as BHD 50–100/year for eligible sectors. For others, virtual office providers like Regus in Seef or Bahrain Bay offer address-only packages from BHD 40/month. Compare costs here: Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
\
Can foreigners own 100% of a Bahrain-based company working from home?\
Usually yes—most professional, consulting, and digital activities allow 100% foreign ownership with remote work. Some sectors still require a Bahraini partner or local agent. See activity-specific rules: Foreigner Friendly Activities.\
\
What documents are required for remote company registration in Bahrain?\
\
Valid passport & CPR (for residents)\
Lease agreement or proof of home address\
Landlord NOC (for home-based CR)\
MOICT-approved activity description\
Signed application forms (see Commercial Registration Requirements)\
\
\
Is ongoing compliance more difficult for remote businesses?\
In some ways, yes—as inspectors may check you’re not breaching your CR permissions by storing inventory or receiving unsanctioned visitors. Keep all accounting and address records updated. Outsourcing to a local accounting firm can prevent costly mistakes.\

Imagine this: you pour your morning coffee, head out the door — and suddenly realize that every single man on Earth has vanished. Not just today, but erased from history. No fathers, no brothers, no sons, no quiet presences holding things together in ways we barely noticed.

At first, things look fine. Women are strong, capable, and running the world without missing a beat. Trains still run, offices buzz, and laughter fills parks. But slowly, the silence starts to scream. The small voids grow — a missing pinky finger to hold when a child cries, a missing protective glance when danger lurks in the dark, a missing partner to share invisible burdens no one else saw.

What would society look like when balance is gone? Could humanity survive without men, or without women for that matter? Or is survival without harmony just another kind of death?

So he knows  the people that Im ranting about, the company procedure (the incident is about work procedure) and culture.

I was supper upset and affected about that incident thats why I keep telling it to him. So while Im cooking our dinner, I suddenly start talking about it again while he is using his phone. But suddenly he told me ""Can you stop talking about it already? You've been repeating it over and over. You're too affected by it. You don't even know if they are just affected or if they're still carrying what happened earlier even at home"" 

And I get mad at him and tell him ""I never asked for your advise, I just want you to listen.  You know Im always like this when Im this upset. I just want you to listen, until I release all the anger and irritation Im feeling about what happened. You know, you are the last person I was expecting to listen to me, to understand me, yet you are saying those things. Like my emotion doesn't matter. If thats all you're going to say, I wish you hadn't said anything. It would be better of you'd just been on your phone while I was telling this, that to say that. I feel like you dont care about what Im feeling"" 

After I say that, he did not respond. Just to clarify, he is very aware about my behavior when Im upset. So I continue cooking our dinner. Set our dinner and we use both our phone while we are eating. We did not talk during dinner, we went to bed in silence, he's not usually like that. He is ""lets not sleep mad with each other"", Im hurt by his action but Im too stubborn to break the silence first. And the next day we are still not speaking with each other, which is rare. Usually if we sleep in bed fighting the next day he will break the silence.

So I let my pride and my anger consume me therefore during breakfast I prepare my own (cereal & coffee) and I did not prepare his. I usually prepare both of our cereals or food when we are eating home in general. I do the cooking, he do the dishes after.

I started eating breakfast in silence and he started getting ready to work. After he's done getting ready, he went outside and waited in his car which is out of his character because he always wait for me therefore I was so mad again and then decided not to wear our engagement ring. 

So AITA for not wearing our engagement ring after we fight?


Note: Im still upset, mad and emotional thats why its all over the place so Ill be happy to add some context if you have question or need clarification and lastly english is not my first language so sorry for the wrong grammar. ",1,1758006073.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,7,0.67,False

Hey everyone! I’m 26F and I’ve been seriously into strength lifting for about 5 years now. For the longest time, I only trusted international protein powders because I’d had some pretty disappointing experiences with Indian brands early on. But recently, I decided to give Indian whey proteins another shot and honestly, the results surprised me!

Here’s a quick rundown of the international brands I used to rely on:

- Dymatize Elite (Cookies & Cream & Rich Chocolate flavors)
- Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard (Double Rich Chocolate)
- Isopure (Creamy Vanilla)

All of these tasted great and worked well, but the price and availability were sometimes a pain.

And then 2 years back I shifted to Indian Brands, some that have seriously impressed me lately:

- MuscleBlaze (Blue Tokai Coffee & Triple Chocolate) — The flavors are spot on, and the mixability is excellent. Plus, the protein content is solid for the price.

- TWT (Cold Coffee) — I love how light this tastes compared to most powders. Also their protein bars are accessible on every app.

- Fuel One (Chocolate Fudge) — Smooth texture, good flavor, and surprisingly easy on the stomach.

One major heads up: Avoid Big Muscles at all costs. From my experience, they fall short on every important factor : taste, mixability, ingredient quality, you name it. Just not worth it.",3,1758005717.0,AskFitnessIndia,3,1.0,False

So my Ex Husband (let's say Sascha) I have two young kids. We've been separated for over 3 years and officially divorced for 2,5 years.

For Context: A year after the separation I fell in love with Kyle, a mutual friend of Sascha an me. We've been dating since and now live in two different apartments on the same property. We have no plans of moving in with each other but we spend a lot of time together on a daily base.
Kyle's an important person in both mine and the kids' life, we all love him very much. Sascha not so much, he hates Kyle's guts now. Sascha has got a way of ignoring people he doesn't like, so sometimes he won't even say ""Hi"" to Kyle even though they used to be friends.

Now Sascha and I get along fine. It took a lot of work to get to that point but it's good for the kids. Sometimes when he came to pick the kids up or drop them off, he used to come in and stay for a moment or a while. 

Kyle told me it makes him feel weird and uncomfortable, mostly because Sascha is so hostile towards him. I get that so I reduced that and don't ask Sascha inside when he gets the kids or dropps them off. 

However today was one of the kids' birthdays and I have to work but Sascha is taking them on a day trip. I let him in in the morning and left for work before they were gone. I gave Kyle a little warning that he's there with the kids because Kyle has a key to my apartment and when I'm gone he sometimes comes in and gets a coffee or whatever. 

So now Kyle is really mad, he feels like his boundaries are over-stepped and says it's too much that I allow this.

To be honest I couldn't care less who's in my apartment when I'm gone as long as they don't leave it worse than they found it. What's between the two men doesn't seem that relevant to me that's something they need to work out.

Am I insensitive here? Sure, Kyle shouldn't feel uncomfortable in or around his own home but should I let him tell me who I can let into my apartment?

I love Kyle and I would never get together with Sascha again, even if Kyle wasn't there. And I'm pretty sure Sascha doesn't want to get back together since he's the one that left in the first place. I'm just grateful he's making an effort for his kids and I'm giving him space for that.",5,1758005486.0,AmItheAsshole,20,0.7,False

It's designed so that you put in what you would spend money on that might be an impulse buy... eg coffee.. then you put in how much it costs... eg $5... then how often you buy it, it then tells you how much you're spending per year...  
  
you can then put in some more information, then you get a report with how much you could have if you invested it or put it in a bank account and not spent it. 

one idea i haven't implimented yet, but i will do is that it will tell you what you could have spent the money on. so for example if your hobby is photography and you have spent $1000 on coffees, it tells you, that you could have bought a camera with it or something related to your hobby.

Now I’m trying to weigh options: 1) push for senior BA internally, pivot toward product management, or 2) move to a bigger company where the scope is wider. Each has tradeoffs.

I’m passionate about art and tattoos and love neotraditional, blackwork, ornamental, anime, and color tattoos. I wanted to improve my skills and eventually make tattooing part of my career. I have two mentors, but over time I’ve noticed some red flags and unsafe situations that have left me unsure how to proceed. I’ve had some past experiences that make me particularly cautious about high-pressure or unsafe environments, so these situations caused me a lot of anxiety.

Early on, one mentor told me to drop my college classes because “school isn’t serious” and made it clear I couldn’t do both. I was taking general education classes part-time and was reluctant to give up school, but eventually complied. On a day I had a family emergency—my grandma had emergency heart surgery—I couldn’t post a TikTok immediately. My mentor sent multiple long texts criticizing me for making “excuses,” even though I followed through later that day and posted the video.

About a month ago, my mentors attended a tattoo convention and didn’t invite us apprentices. I was sent to a coffee shop 30 minutes away in 102°F heat to pick up drinks. I waited outside for 35+ minutes and started feeling sick from the heat, but completed the task.

Recently, the shop went to a rave. I initially declined because I couldn’t afford it, but my mentor offered to buy my ticket. I was told mentors and others would be using alcohol, m011y, and coke. I have very little experience with drinking and no experience with drugs. My mentor’s boyfriend offered to buy me alcohol, and I thought he was just asking around, so I said yes. Another apprentice, who was also 19, was drinking the first day and doing m011y on the second day. They took six shots before the event and didn’t seem drunk, so I didn’t think I would have any issues. I had only drunk once before, and it was a very small amount, so I didn’t realize at the time how it would affect me. They also had weed, which I used as well (I was probably drunk at this point because I don’t remember much after?). When we got back, my mentor offered for me and the other apprentice to stay at her house for the night. She was drunk while driving us home, but we thankfully made it back okay. That night, about an hour after everyone fell asleep, I started vomiting and it progressively got worse. I was vomiting and shaking for several hours alone on the bathroom floor, and it didn’t seem to stop. When I felt a little better I decided to go home to rest, I was only 7mins away. When I got home I started throwing up the entire morning and throughout the day. I let my mentor know what happened and that I needed to rest and not attend the second night because I was very ill, I told them I had a client the next day and needed to get better before the appointment. They said this was fine.

Shortly before the appointment, I was told by the piercer to cancel 20 minutes before because my mentor just told them they were to sick to come in. I was told to hide in a storage closet while my client was given a free piercing since they were already on there way. I later learned the piercer told my client I was sick “throwing up on the side of the road” and that my mentors were sick too and it must just be a bug going around, so it wouldn’t reflect poorly on them, not mentioning that they themselves were hungover from drugs and alcohol.

I apologize that this is so long, it took a second to write 🥲 it is also very late (I am working on designs for a client also) I would really appreciate any advice or if anyone experienced something similar, and how did you handle it?

***Memory transcription subject:*** **Ensign Lysith, Science Officer, Starfleet** 

*Date \[standardized human time\]:June 5, 2157*

The rest of my duty shift went rather uneventfully, before I was dismissed Lieutenant Commander Iskma had reminded me of the time and place of the dinner. I had affirmed to her that I would be there on time and then left to go to my quarters to change into something more casual as I was instructed. As it so happened when I had returned to my quarters Rumi was there as well and he had been invited by Dr.Vensa, the chief medical officer to the dinner as well despite Rumi not being assigned under her command. 

I decided to throw on what I normally would wear when visiting my family in New Orleans during the weekends while at the academy, a pair of blue jeans and a simple t-shirt. I had also donned the tail band mother and father had made for me for when I became an adult, it was a piece of Arxur history and culture that was suppressed by Betterment as it was proof of our empathy and connection to one another. The tail band was two metal rings that were placed on the tail, one a third of the way from the base and the other a third from the tip, they are connected with thin strands of metal, crystal or other material. Decorations and ornamentation would be added to the strands based on the achievements of the wearer, according to tradition though the wearer could not be the one that created or sought out said decorations, they could only be gifted or rewarded with said ornaments.

Mother had a local friend of hers melt down some metal from the shuttle that she had saved somehow to make the bands for me. While I only had a few ornamentations to hang from the crystal threads due to my young age I wore them with pride at the graduation ceremony at Starfleet Academy. While it took somewhat longer to get on when done alone I was eventually able to get to them and I left with Rumi towards the tubolift to deck 3 where the officers lounge was, Rumi seemed nearly as excited as I was to be going to this dinner as well.

While the ships directory showed the location and size of the various rooms it did not show the layout of the rooms. When I walked into the rather large room I first heard the sounds of soft music playing throughout the room along with the sounds of food sizzling. I could also smell that beef was being cooked as well along with some vegetables such as garlic or onion, most likely in olive oil if I was to guess correctly. Towards the center of the room directly in front of Rumi and I was a large dark gray table like they had in the mess hall, only larger with a matching set of chairs. On the back wall behind the table was a bar of sorts that had a variety of bottles on the shelves along with a myriad of different glasses along with a food replicator, currently nobody was sitting at said bar. I saw that Dr.Vensa, the tall black haired medical officer was at the table chatting up a storm with Virnt, due to the other sounds and the distance I could not hear what they were talking about precisely.

Off to the right there were several lounge chairs dotted about with four facing one another around a small coffee table towards the center of the room, near those chairs I spotted Lieutenant Commanders Iskma and Kekoka chatting with who appeared to be Ensign Stynek while holding glasses, while the muscular Human was wearing casual clothing along with the Skalgan, Iskma’s outfit was anything but casual. She was wearing a multi layered suit of vibrant colors and conflicting shapes. Deciding not to comment on how overdressed she was I made some quick hello’s before staging that I was going to finish greeting everyone.

I walked over to the other end of the room where the cooking was happening, the “kitchen” area was separated by a small half step one would have to walk up. It was an open concept design where there was plenty of counter space to work at along with both a flattop to cook at as well as a flame top cooker which had an oven below it. At the flame cooker I saw Commander Alnajo who was cooking some vegetables while the much shorter Captain Reissig I saw was at the flattop but not cooking, he was speaking to someone much taller than himself who was actually around my height when I slouched. 

While Rumi went to greet Commander Alnajo I walked on the outside of the kitchen area to speak to the captain and whoever this mystery person he was standing next to was just as muscular as Lieutenant Commander Kekoka. When I rounded the corner and started to get a better view of the mystery person things started to fall into place, they were a Rexelian which explained his height and build. This individual had rather sharp features on his face which combined with the short yet neatly trimmed beard and messy pompadour haircut gave him a more unique look. Being that he was Rexelian that meant he had red skin which was a garnet shade. Like others of his species he had a set of horns protruding from his forehead that were semi-crescent shaped and black in color, the direction they grew combined with their length made them first protrude outward from his forehead then upwards so that the tips were several centimeters above his hair, I noticed that one of his horns had a metallic ring towards the base.  

Given the fact that his current facial hair was not within Starfleet regulations and neither was the hairstyle I had assumed that this must be the husband of the captain that Iskma had mentioned. That and the fact that the captain wore a wedding band of the same metal that the Rexelian had on his horn, also the fact I saw the captain kiss him. Such things were good indicators of a previous relationship.

“Captain Reissig.” I said as I approached. “I hope you are doing well.”

The Human and Rexelian both looked up at me and smiled. On the flattop I saw that the Rexelian was cooking several cuts of beef, I could see off to the side other meats that would take far less time to cook such as squid. I could also see several large Kebab skewers that gave a hint as to what we would be eating.

“Ensign Lysith!” Captain Reissig exclaimed when he saw who was talking to him. “Glad to see you made it. Enjoying yourself?”

“Given how exclusive the invitation was, I was able to squeeze you into my busy schedule, Captain.” I said in a half joking manner. “I just arrived here with Ensign Rumi. May I ask who this is?”

The Rexelian looked up from the food he was working on and responded as he extended a hand with black fingernails. 

“I am Zoren, Mika’s husband.” He said in a grumbling voice. “It is good to meet you.”

I shook his hand which had a rather firm grip when compared to my own. So far the only people I have met with similar strength to my own or exceeding it were my mother and Vulcans, in sparring matches at the academy I would wear weights to make things a more fair fight and give me a challenge. When I would spar with Vulcans on the other hand that was trickier, even with my larger size and extra appendage they were still a challenge due to their increased strength and the various martial arts many have trained in. That was not to say I did not pick up on a few things, it turns out the Arxur claws are suitable to learn the Vulcan nerve pinch, unfortunately it was not effective against many of the species in the galaxy that differed too far from humanoid body layout.

We made some small talk for a minute or so, apparently the captain had been married to his husband for a decade and before that they had known one another for about two years. It would also seem as though Zoren wanted Captain Reissig to mingle with the rest of the attendees while he finished with preparing the food, the captain may be in charge of the ship but it would seem as though he holds no jurisdiction over Zoren. Before Captain Reissig could try and argue with his husband I interjected stating that I would be willing to make everyone a round of drinks while the meal was being finished up. 

The captain seemed more than ready for that idea and had Rumi get everyone's drink requests while I went to the bar with Captain Ressig. I took note that at the front table there now was Stynek and a Krakotl that I had seen the first day and a few other times since then, I was pretty sure her name was Nuala and she was either a pilot or navigation officer. While Rumi was getting everyone's drink orders I took stock of what was behind the bar and saw that there were a variety of garnishes in the fridge as well so I would not have to replicate those. Captain Reissig asked for a cherry cosmopolitan which was easy enough, it was when I was shaking the beverage mixture in the cocktail shaker with the ice that the captain spoke up.

“You are very quick with that, not your first time making drinks for sure.” He commented, impressed. “You barely paused when I asked for a cherry cosmo to think about how to change the beverage.”

I smiled for a moment before straining the mixture into the chilled glass and adding the orange peel garnish as well as a cherry as well. 

“My mother owns a bar on Bourbon street in New Orleans. At first when I was little I helped out by clearing off tables or moving the produce inside after deliveries.” I said as I moved the glass in front of the captain. “As I got older I helped out with different things as I could show more responsibility. Eventually when I turned 18 she had me work the bar, on breaks when I would come home to visit from the academy I would help it. I found it oddly relaxing mixing drinks.”

Captain Reissig took a small sip from his glass to test the beverage before giving me a small nod of approval. Before we could say much more Rumi had come over and he had a pad where he wrote down all of the peoples orders. I picked it up and looked it over to see if there was anything I was not familiar with, *looks good to me, may have to replicate some of this. Especially since Virnt wants Sythohol specifically.* It took me a few minutes but I was able to make everyone's drinks and set the ones for at the table on one tray and gave the others on a different tray for Rumi who needed the use of both paws to keep steady. I took the first tray and went to the table to start passing out drinks.

“Looks like drinks are here.” Said Dr.Vensa joyfully.

“Yes they are, doctor.” I replied as I set down her drink in front of her. “For you I have a Long Island Iced Tea with a lime wedge.”

“Thank you, ensign.” She replied before taking a sip.

I then grabbed the whiskey glass that contained Stynek’s beverage and placed it in front of her. I had noticed that she had barely reacted to my presence until I moved behind her, when I did she turned her head so that I was not in her blind spot.

“For you I have a glass of Skalgan Firefruit whiskey on the rocks with a cinnamon stick and salt on the rim.” I said before moving to Virnt.

I took the highball glass and placed it in front of the Tilfish, his order was the most specific out of all of them.

“For Ensign Virnt I have a Dirty Shirley made with 1.5 shots of Vanilla *Synthahol* Vodka with 2 cherries and a lime wedge.” I said.

“I know what I like.” Said the Tilfish before taking a sip of his beverage. “Perfect, thank you.”

Last but not least was Nuala who had been staring at me this whole time, I had only dealt with Krakotl on occasion before and I could not easily discern what she was felling currently.

“For Nuala here is your distilled algae mash, room temperature.” I said as I placed the whiskey glass in front of her.

She said a quick thank you before taking a sip of her drink. I grabbed my drink from the bar and took a seat next to Dr.Vensa to pick up on the conversation that was going on currently. Apparently Virnt was talking about how well designed he thought the ship was.

“In my opinion it is the *Nebula, Sovereign* and *Intrepid* class ships all distilled into their best parts and combined into one ship. Not to mention all of the top of the line advancements put into the ship.” He said with excitement. “Bio-nerual circuitry, warp cursing speed of 8.7, ablative armor, auto-modulating shields, metaphasic shielding, regenerative Shielding, two pulse fire torpedo launchers and eight point defence batteries. This ship is truly a return of Starfleets exploration efforts.”

Virnt was correct as far as I knew on all accounts about the ship, I was excited to see exactly what it was capable of aside from getting us though Federation and RA space quickly. The main reason I wanted to serve here was that this was one of two ships on missions of deep space exploration and I wanted to be a part of that. It also helped that this ship was being captained by the officer who designed this class of ship, so that meant he knew exactly what it was capable of.

“Correct on all points Ensign Virnt.” Captain Reissig said as he sat down on the other side of me. “Can you tell me how many decks there are as well as the dimensions of the ship?”

“There are 18 decks total, captain.” Virnt said without missing a beat. “The dimensions of the *Luna* class are 450 meters long, 208 meters wide and 80 meters in height.”

It was amazing and perplexing at the same time, every single question that the captain made towards the Tilfish engineer about the ship was answered instantly and correctly. He even got the amount of replicators on the ship correct and the material used as the tracks for the turbolifts right as well. Eventually the food came and I was delighted with the meal, we were being served Kebabs as the main course and it seemed while most had a mix of veggies and meat for theirs mine were almost entirely meat save for a few peppers. I noticed that Stynek’s was a fruit kebab due to the Skalgans being the only obligate herbivore at this table. While there were side dishes I opted to not partake since the three skewers full of meat I was given were more than enough, and with my drink I did not need any more sugar.

“I don’t wish to be rude.” Said Nuala as I ate a pepper from one of my skewers. “But I thought the Arxur could only eat meat.”

“The Arxur inability to eat plants was somewhat *overstated* by the Dominion. There are a few plants on Wriss that can be eaten by Arxur and we can receive nutrition from.” I corrected as several eyes were now on me. “After we had arrived on Earth my parents and I had certain new microbes added to our microbiomes along with a few small modifications to the pancreas which allows us to digest and process things like plants, caffeine and alcohol. That is not to say my eating habits can mimic a Human though, meat still needs to make up the bulk of my diet and when I eat plants I must be careful of my sugar intake.”

The table for the next hour or so was filled with various topics of conversation, many of the senior staff were asking us ensigns what it was like serving on a Starship for the first time. In turn I asked Commander Alnajo what it was like being the first officer and he responded it was interesting as one of his privileges was being allowed to tell the captain he is wrong about something. Dr.Vensa interjected saying that she had done it many times in the past before the captain was promoted and was not planning on stopping anytime soon.

At one point the comms came to life and Lieutenant Commander Ferla who was on bridge duty stated that we had just crossed into Dratarran space and that we would be at their homeworld in a few more hours. That had then brought up some conversation about the Dratarans where Dr.Vensa had stated that the captain actually had a good relationship with the species. When asked how that came to be the captain had placed his head in his hands for several moments before speaking.

“Of course you would bring this up, Vensa, why wouldn’t you?” He sighed. “So some context this was when I was a Lieutenant Commander and still at the Utopia Planeta shipyards on Mars. We had been in contact with the Dratarran’s for about a year at this point when the Yotul Technocracy started having border skirmishes with them in an attempt to bully them into giving over their shield breaking missile tech. This is one of many things that led to them being kicked out of the Revival Alliance along with us having solid proof during these skirmishes that they used cloaking devices.”

“Anyways we see that the Yotul are using cyber attacks against the Dratarrans, we quickly found out that this was something they came up with on their own as opposed to stealing the tech from us like they did with some other things down the line.” He continued. “Since the Yotul got the idea for cyber attacks from Starfleet due to how we were able to end the War Of the Federations it was decided that Starfleet should send some personnel to help train some of their people in ways to counteract these attacks. It had been awhile since I had left the Sol system so I volunteered for the assignment, I had thought I would be good for the mission.”

“What have I always said about volunteering?” Vensa said to the captain as she took another sip from her drink. “Never do it.”

Captain Reissig’s eyes widened at what the Chief Medical Officer had just said.

“You encouraged me to volunteer!"" He said to her. “You literally said it would be good for me to do that exact assignment.”

“And look at where it got you.” She replied. “This is why you need to listen better.”

Captain Reissig laughed for a few moments to himself before continuing his story.

“So the first few days are great working with the scientists, the Dratarrans are very focused on family history and such with how one's family has helped with society. Since my family has served in Starfleet ever since it was founded they had a good deal of respect for me for that.” He said before pausing for a moment. “There was this… general I think was the right rank. He was in charge of the whole operation and the guy was big even compared to others in his species, he was always questioning what I was teaching the scientists or seemingly trying to provoke me. I had thought he was testing me on something or trying to prove something to the others of his rank so I would just explain calmly what I was doing and not let the insults get to me. Then one day we were talking and he says a few phrases that the translator is having problems with and the next thing I know he put me in a headlock, which at the time I did not know what it meant since we did not know a whole lot about their culture.”

That was something I did know what it meant, while I did not know much about the Dratarran the overview file on them had said that it is a common mating ritual for dominant Dratarran’s to put potential partners in a head lock to initiate *coupling.* This was only done with a certain amount of social interactions where the physically bigger/ more dominant of the potential coupling would act by outsider standards almost aggressive or adversarial towards the other, if returned in kind that was a way of saying they were not interested. If the potential partner would brush it off or seem fine with said treatment then that was seen as them flirting back. *Ok, I see how this happened if the Captain did not know how that worked.*

“Well one thing leads to another and I ended up insulting his honor by accidentally leading him on. The only way to right this wrong is to do some non lethal hand to hand ritual combat.” Captain Reissig continued. “Next thing I know I am shirtless in some sort of gladiator arena filled to the brim with a crowd and who do I see in the stands but one Dr.Vensa cheering me on. At no point did she offer any help”

We all looked at her with confusion at how exactly she would have gotten to an area fight that Captain Reissig would be at.

“I was there for other reasons. The Dratarrans were wanting to host a medical conference in which I was attending. I was out getting lunch when word got out that there was going to be an event at the arena so I went to see what was going on and saw that my dear friend was immersing himself in the local culture.” Dr.Vensa clarified. “I never doubted your ability to handle yourself and in the end you did win with that sneaky nerve pinch. So to recap you won the fight with minimal pain, the crowd was happy with the fight and the generals honor was restored after fighting you valiantly. And you slept with him in the end even when you would not give me details or make a recording for scientific purposes.”

Before anyone could respond to what the medical officer had just said and before I could banish the thoughts burned into my skull from what Dr.Vensa said the ship shook for a few seconds before returning to normal. Captain Reissig looked somewhat concerned and pressed his comm badge that he had clipped to his shirt.

“Reissig to bridge.” He said. “What just happened? I don’t like my ship shaking like that.”

It was a moment before a response came from the bridge.

“Ferla here, we were just hit with a FTL disruptor pulse.” Came Fera from the comms. “Thankfully the navigational deflectors were able to deal with it, the vibration you felt was the pulse passing over the ship. We did detect something concerning though when that happened.”

“Concerning how?” Asked the Drezjin first officer.

“We detected for just a moment subspace distortions near us despite being at warp.” Fera responded. “I believe we are being followed by cloaked Technocracy ships and they tried to knock us out of warp.”

Just then Captain Reissig spoke up again.

In the early seasons they even showed bottle labels, though in later seasons they got good at turning them *just* right so you couldn't quite see what it was. So I started paying attention and making note of them. Some were obvious (Alaskan) or big brands (Rainier) but there were some obscure ones I hadn't heard of (some no longer made) and were fun to learn about (Grant's Ale).

The first list are beers from The Brick, the second are from elsewhere (mostly in Cicely), while the third are from the one appearance of The Last Call Bar, where Ruth Anne visits on her motorcycle in one episode.

1nia4va,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nia4va/i_think_the_homeless_man_on_my_street_is_from_the/,I think the homeless man on my street is from the future.,"I’d lived there for just over a year, having moved from the opposite end of the city to a little brick apartment in the heart of the Northern Industrial sector.

Being an east-ender for most of my life was alright. The area was quiet and safe, and I lived just five minutes from my school growing up. Over on the north end was different. There was lots of shouting late at night and living next to a train track, I never got used to the feeling of my walls vibrating every few hours. 

Still, I liked it there as much as the next guy. Everyone was quite friendly, save for the odd ruffian looking to cause trouble. There was a little convenience store and gas station just feet away from my apartment, and that’s where I saw most of the homeless population. They sat at the door, their heads hanging low and eyes drooping. I was never sure if they're on drugs or drunk or sober, but I’d gotten used to them.

Sometimes I’d even offer to buy them a drink or a snack from the store, but I made sure not to intrude on their down time. 

Eventually though, I started to notice a new guy pursuing the area. He seemed to come out of nowhere and quickly became a part of the area over the second summer that I lived there.

He’d walk along the road across from the railroad tracks and wander around the convenience store all day. He’d sit behind it against the brick wall between trash cans, or right out front at the gas pumps. Usually I’d simply accept him as yet another member of our little community but the only difference was, he looked…off? I didn’t really know how to describe it, but he almost looked as if he’d just come from a long backpacking trip. 

His hair is long and brown, and his beard was unkempt. He wore a black cap and rarely sported a shirt, revealing a hairy chest. His cargo pants were oversized and he always, and I mean always had a massive army-green hiking backpack that was bigger than his entire upper body. It was strapped around his waist and everything. 

He was different in other ways, too. I’d had a couple of run ins with him and every time he saw me, he gave me a strange glare and then a friendly nod. 

Once, I was walking past the store with a box of fresh pizza and I saw him sitting there by the pumps. I couldn’t help myself and offered him a slice before wandering back to my place.

I suppose he took a liking to me. I have a rather disheveled look myself, with baggy clothes and messy hair.

I thought for some time that we might have some sort of understanding, but that was before the note appeared at the back door to my apartment.

  
It was late and I was heading home from a shift at the downtown mall. I looked a mess, stumbling over the concrete lumps in the parking lot. I glanced to my right to see the convenience store’s lights washing across the glowing ground. There he was, the mysterious backpacker sitting alone under the washed out light. He was wearing the same thing he always had, with his green backpack strapped across his chest. 

I started to look away but then I turned just once more to meet his gaze. He was staring at me, almost sternly. I didn’t know how to take it. He almost looked frightened by something. I looked behind me but there was nothing of note, just the train slowly chugging into view from behind the tall brick wall separating the street from the parking lot.

I looked down and made my way to the door, trying to shake off his gaze. I could still feel it though; his eyes were following me. Growing up with anxiety and constantly looking over your shoulder in fear of your own father has gifted me in a sixth sense of sorts. I truly can feel it when someone is watching.

I rummaged in my front pocket for my keys and pulled them out as I stepped toward the door. Still looking down, I noticed it.

A piece of paper, folded neatly and placed perfectly in line with the light cast from the lobby.

I glanced around me. Surely this wasn’t just for me. There’s plenty of people in the apartment. I glanced back at the man, who was still watching. My heart pounded and I slipped inside, leaving the note where I found it.

I couldn’t sleep. Though my curtains were closed and the lights were out, I had a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach about the man, and about the paper. 

Maybe it wasn’t such a terrible feeling, maybe it was some sort of excitement. Maybe I wanted there to be something up, something interesting. 

My life was quickly becoming mundane, regardless of the odd night out with friends. The local bands I saw and the one I was trying to start…it was all becoming somewhat cliche. 

Maybe I wanted to open the paper, just to see.

  


So, in my long-since dirt-stained pajama pants and my sweatshirt, I stumbled out of my bedroom and walked up to the door. I stood on my toes to see through the peep-hole, making sure the coast was clear. 

Then I unlocked the door and cracked it open slightly. Bright light poured in from the hallway and I quickly slipped out, leaving the door unlocked.

I paced quickly through to the lobby and looked outside.

There the paper was, sitting in the same position I’d left it. Perfectly folded, perfectly placed.

Without a second thought I pushed open the push-latch on the door and swiped the paper in one swift motion before scuttling back into my apartment and locking the door behind me.

	I sat on my bed with my lamp on, staring at the paper. I inhaled deeply before opening it and leaning in close to read what it said.

It was just one line, written in blue marker. It was a date.

*10/02/2025*

Two weeks from today. My heart thudded in my chest and a lump grew in my throat. 

Could this really have been for me? No, that would be ridiculous. I thought about leaving it back at the door for someone else to receive it, someone it was meant for. 

Then my hair stood up on end. I looked at my closed curtains, placing the paper down gently on my bed. 

I stood slowly, my chest growing hotter with every breath. I could feel it again. Someone watching. 

My suite was in the basement of the apartment, so I was eye-level with the ground. I could only really see people’s feet when they’d walk past my bedroom, so if anyone was out there, they would be able to look downward into my bedroom. That idea always made me uncomfortable. 

I slowly raised myself to my feet and took a few paces toward my bedroom window. I decided not to flat out open the curtains, and instead I climbed onto my little loveseat, peering around the curtains to see outside.

It was dark, but the light from the convenience store was enough to light up anything of note. 

I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, but I could see something just on the other side of the glass.

I leaned closer, my entire body starting to sweat.

It was a man, sitting cross-legged just outside. I jumped and ran back into my bed, covering myself with my throw blanket. My heart pounded, my entire body shook.

I knew exactly who it was. 

I turned off the light and huddled in the corner of my room until morning.



By the time I got to sleep, it was well past morning and the sunlight had crept from behind the curtains, washing over me and warming my feet. 

I’d woken up in the late afternoon, and once I’d woken myself fully, I realized I missed an hour of my shift at the mall.

I rushed out of bed and called my manager, saying that I’d run into a family emergency but that I didn’t feel comfortable sharing anything more than that. As usual, this was enough to get me out of any hot water. I dashed through my routine and started for the door when I remembered the note. And the man, just sitting there outside my window. My stomach dropped and I turned back into my bedroom in search of the paper. 

There it was, sitting on the floor, having fallen off my bed when I’d hurried under my covers.

I stared at it blankly before leaving for the day.

The man wasn’t anywhere to be seen when I walked to the bus stop across the street. 

I tried to assure myself that it was just a weird night, but I knew in my heart that there was something strange going on. Then the train came chugging along and silenced my thoughts.



Work was quiet, and I had a lot of time to think at the till when there weren’t any customers around. I thought of the date written on the paper, and the look on the man’s face last night before I went inside. I thought and thought until I realized I was thinking too deeply into all of it. I looked up at the store around me, trying to ground myself. Maybe it was just all in my head.



I came home exhausted, ready to sleep off my anxiety. The bus dropped me off outside my place and I started my short walk to the back door, past the store. Just like the night before and every night before that, the lights from the store and gas station lit up the ground before me, coating the concrete in a red-white gleam. 

I tried not to look around at the store as I walked. I didn’t want this to become something it probably wasn’t.

But, my eyes worked faster than my brain and I caught a glimpse of the man once again. 

He was sitting against the side of the store on his haunches, watching me walk past. 

Before I could look away, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before: A long, pinkish scar that ran from his chin to his collar bone. I winced, imagining how that must have felt.

Then I hurried to the door.

I’d already opened it and made it inside before I took note of yet another piece of paper, folded neatly at the entrance. How did nobody else take it by now? Had he waited for me to put it there? Was he trying to make sure he timed it all right? I shook my head and sighed. All day I’d hoped that this was all something I was making up in my head, something my brain was trying to create to make my life seem more interesting. 

I picked up the piece of paper, glanced back in his direction, then went inside.

I waited to finish my after-work routine before I sat down and opened the paper. I wanted to be settled before I brought any more anxiety on.

After unfolding it, I inhaled deeply. I read.

*I tried to change it. I’m so sorry.* 

It didn’t make any sense, how could it? I read it again and again, wracking my brain for anything that would make those words meaningful in some capacity. 

Nothing came to mind. 

I felt like I was losing it. Maybe all of this was for someone else, maybe the strange man hadn’t written any of the notes, maybe I was losing it.

I tried sleeping it off.



I dreamt about a storm. Not just thunder and lightning, but a massive storm that took out the entire city’s grid. I remember the cold and the deep feeling of loss wracking my body. In the dream I was alone, but far lonelier than I am now. Completely and utterly alone.

It was so dark in the dream that I couldn’t see my own hand in front of my face. I just remember waving it aggressively before my eyes for what seemed like hours before I awoke suddenly to see my real hand, flailing unnaturally in front of me. I shuddered and shot up in bed, holding the now shaking hand in my other fist. I tried a breathing exercise to calm down. 

Maybe all of this nonsense was finally starting to get to me. 

I coasted through my day’s work on autopilot, still haunted by the dream I’d had and shaken by the events of the past few days. I couldn’t stop thinking of the man and the scar down his neck. 

Upon arriving home, I scanned the sea to see no strange man outside. No paper at the door. It was a relief to say the least and I was ready to just go to bed and forget about all of it. Things seemed fine until I opened the door to the lobby and took a few steps down the stairs. 

There was something sticking out from under the staircase and I turned around quickly, my heart thudding once again. 

The man was sitting there, under the stairs. I nearly jumped out of my skin when he started to move, slowly slipping out and staggering to his feet. He was right in front of me, looking at me with a bleak expression. I looked around me before accepting his gaze. Though there was a frog in my throat, I spoke.

“Uh…he…hello?”

He just watched my face, his eyes shadowed by his hair and the hat sitting low on his forehead.

“Um…I’m sorry,can I help you?”

A long pause.

“Did you write those notes?”

He nodded slowly at that.

“Why are you…*who* are you?”

“You’ll know.”

He finally responded in a gruff, masculine voice. I shuddered and took a pace backward toward the door to the hallway behind me.

“Uh…”

“Just know this all happened before. And it’ll happen again, kid. I’m sorry.”

He started to reach out his filthy hand and with that, I turned and fled the scene, bolting down the hallway and diving into my suite.

I locked the door behind me and stared through the peep-hole, completely still. Suddenly, the man yelled out into the hall, his voice reverberating against the walls before being swallowed up by the void surrounding me.

“Something big is coming! You can’t run!”

My heart was pounding and my entire body shook violently. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, I was in shock. I waited for him to leave, but I was only met with silence. He could be there still, sitting under the stairwell, waiting for me to leave for work the next morning.

 So I called in, letting them know that my family emergency from the other day had worsened. I couldn’t care less about what my manager had to say about it right now. I wasn’t going to leave the safety of my bedroom.

	All throughout the night I thought about the man and his words. He seemed, now that I was able to really think about it; very wise. He didn’t sound like one of the other guys from around here. He didn’t slur his speech and his eyes never wavered. He was certain of what he was saying, though I couldn’t find a single thing about it that made any sense.

 I could call the cops, I knew that. I never did like having to do that, even when it had to be done. I even went to my phone to dial the non-emergency number, but decided against it. I didn’t want any more unneeded drama tonight. I decided if he comes back and makes a scene again, I’d call 911.

I spent the next day peering out of my peephole and sitting against the door. People came and went without a word and I didn’t hear the man’s voice. 

I fixed myself a coffee at around six am and sat on my couch, staring at the door. 

After a few hours of that I allowed myself to sleep, awkwardly slumped on the couch.

When I awoke, it was nearing evening. I stretched and sipped some of my now cold coffee and looked at the door.

I jumped when I saw another note, having been slid under my door who knows how long ago. I took a quick look around me before crawling toward it, swiping it with lightning speed and running back to the couch.

I opened it slowly this time, dreading whatever it would read.

*Bootstrap paradox.*

This was a familiar term, though I wasn’t sure how. Maybe I’d heard it in a movie or a TV show once, I couldn’t say. I shut my eyes tightly and exhaled sharply through my nose, trying to expel the wave of anxiety before it got to me. 

After a moment of staring blankly at the paper, I crumpled it up and threw it onto the floor. 

No. This man was on drugs, he had to be. There couldn’t be any honest reason for any of this. I started to chuckle to myself at that moment, letting out all of the stress and anxiety. I wasn’t losing it, he was. I was just letting it get to me. 

I ended up laughing on my couch until I cried.

I was suddenly met with the familiar vibration of the train rolling past. This was of some comfort. The couch hummed against the wooden flooring and my lamp shook on the stand next to me. I sat up and listened for it, waiting to hear the whistle blow. That would sort me out.

Only this time, it didn’t. 

There was no train.

The vibration stopped.



The next week was slow and the man was nowhere to be seen. I’d gone out of the front door for the next few days, but it seemed as if he’d just vanished into thin air. As if he was never even there to begin with. 

  
  


I had to shave. I wasn’t too good at keeping myself clean when I was stressed, and I had a slight stubble growing along my jawline and my upper lip. I never looked good in a mustache, and beards freaked me out. Now more than ever.

In the sudden stillness of the evening, I stumbled into the bathroom and took out my razor. It was a classic straight-razor without the handle, which I always preferred over the made-for-shaving ones. I whipped up some cream and lathered my face with it. I usually played music when I shaved but this time, I wanted the silence. Whether I wanted to admit it or not, I was still listening for the man in the hall. I knew he wasn’t there anymore but I didn’t want to be too sure. There were no other notes or anything. It was like I’d made the whole thing up. Still, I had the idea in the back of my head that it was nearing the date that was written on the first note.

	I started shaving, cleaning up my upper lip and making my way down my jaw. When I’d reached the center, my reflection in the mirror began to wobble slightly. The train was passing. The ground shook. I tried to focus on the task at hand, bringing the razor lower to my chin. 

No whistle. The ground shook more violently. My heart pounded. My soap dispenser rattled and fell off the counter, then the pipes started to groan. I shrieked and lost control of the razor as my body was nearly thrown against the wall. 

Before I could gather myself, the mirror shattered and one of the pipes above my burst and tore through the ceiling, sending freezing water down on me. I screamed and shut my eyes tightly, grappling for something to hold onto as the world shook. My head judded against the wall, my feet flailed in the air. The cabinet door above the toilet tore open violently and medications spilled out, along with skincare products that smashed on the tiled floor. 

I let out a long scream before everything came to a shuttering halt.

Car alarms rang. There was only a short pause before I could hear my neighbors all shouting in unison, some of them flying past my door. Babies cried in the upstairs suites and dogs barked.

I just sat there, staring ahead in utter shock.

Eventually, I was able to stagger to my feet. I was shaking so much I almost lost footing and collapsed, but I clutched the counter and took a look in the cracked mirror.

Blood ran down my chin. My razor sat at my feet. I must have been too caught up in the commotion, I hadn’t noticed that I’d cut myself. There was so much blood, I couldn't believe it. 

I looked closer in the mirror and realized I had a fresh tear in my skin, running from my chin all the way down to my collar bone. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


From what I could gather, there was a massive earthquake all across the country. That made sense. Only, we usually don’t get earthquakes around here. Rarely, if ever. 

The news was buzzing all night. I was able to patch myself up at home; I wasn’t exactly hoping to be in an emergency waiting room for the next week along with all of the others.

The cut wasn’t too deep, and I missed every vital artery. I was relieved at that. I hadn’t cleaned the blood off the floor but I’d cleaned it off of myself. 

I didn’t bother calling anyone about the pipe, I was sure plumbers were having a hard enough time as it was. I set myself on waiting for the commotion to die down.

After a few hours I finally allowed myself to at least take a peek outside, just to see if there was anything else of note aside from snapped tree branches and police cars. 

It was late now, though I couldn’t tell aside from the clock on my dresser. I had all of the curtains closed shut and I wasn’t planning on opening them anytime soon.

I headed out, just to look around.

When I opened the door and stepped outside, something was off. Very, very off. 

There was daylight. A whole lot of daylight, as if it were just early afternoon. 

The sun was hot on my skin, searing into me like teeth. I recoiled and shot back into the lobby, stunned. 

There was screaming again, from someone outside. I could hear something else, something familiar, like at a barbeque I’d had with family. Sizzling. 

Then a plop. And another plop. Screams. I looked up for a brief moment through the window at the perfectly blue 11pm sky, and as I did, a sudden roaring sound shook my bones. It was raining. No, it couldn’t be. Hailing? When I looked to the ground to see what was falling, I swear my heart stopped.

Birds. All kinds of birds. Chickadees, crows and seagulls were all in front of me, falling from the heights above and landing hard and stiff on the concrete before me.

Then, just as suddenly as they came crashing down, they stopped. 

More car alarms, then screams. Before I could turn back around and run into my suite, the sizzling noise grew, not only in volume but seemingly in shape, morphing into a symphony of noise. It sounded like a choir all pronouncing the letter ‘S’.

I couldn’t go back now, I couldn’t look away.

The birds were steaming, like they’d landed on a spit. The glass door in front of me cracked with a shocking thud and I tore down the stairs and back into my suite.



Huddled in my bedroom, I clutched the bandage on my neck and hummed to myself, rocking back and forth. 

I was thinking about my friends downtown, thinking of my job and the music venues I called home. I even thought of my dead mother and my father, who I didn’t even know was dead or alive. 

I cried a little, then hyperventilated. The screams from outside tore through the cracking windows. When I finally sat up, I must have passed out.

	I awoke on the floor of my room, my skin hot to the touch. 

Everything was a blur at first, but over the next moments I regained a sense of clarity.

The world was ending. At least it was here, in this city. The man came to my mind next and my body went cold. 

*I’m sorry.*

*I tried to change it.*

He knew. But how? I couldn’t think of any of that right now, I needed to find a way to safety from the sudden heat. If I didn't move somewhere fast, I’d be roasted like those birds on the spit the ground had become. There had to be somewhere I could run, somewhere safe from the heat. I thought of a venue I went to often, an underground music venue for metal bands. It was often used as a haunted house attraction during Halloween due to the vast tunnels it was connected to. A massive tunnel system created long ago during the second world war. If I could get there, that’s where I would go.

Aluminum foil. I had it somewhere in the pantry. I crawled into the kitchen and grappled past the cellophane and Ziplock bags before I clutched the box in my hand and ripped it out, pulling out the entire roll with shaking hands. I wrapped myself up in it just as the living room window shattered. I jolted at the sound as I fastened the strips of foil to my skin. 

I had to have looked like some comic book character when I’d finished. I never thought I’d ever use up the box I bought, and I couldn't even remember why I bought it in the first place. My neck ached but I persisted until only my eyes were free of the foil. I threw on some boots and shuffled out of the door. All the way through the hall, I could see clothing and goods thrown in every direction. Doors were left open and people were getting out of here before the place caved in on itself.  Where would they go?

I stepped through piles of belongings before I made it to the now-shattered door. I didn’t even need to open it. 

My heart pounded as I stepped out, starting with my leg.

I could feel the heat through the foil but it wasn’t seeping all the way through. No sizzling.

I stepped fully out, protecting my eyes with my foil-covered hands. I must have looked like a glowing robot, pacing quickly down the concrete, over the melting flesh of the fallen birds and pieces of shattered glass. 

There were distant screams, but the endless hissing sound was prominent. 

I couldn’t even tell you how I managed to get downtown. I suppose, in dire situations, we really do have a will to live that’s stronger than you can imagine. 

Once, a few summers ago, I was caught in a hail storm on one of my solo camping trips. I hated the cold and I was terrified. I was being pelted left and right and the winds were so strong I could barely breathe. The ground around me was covered in what seemed like snow, and all I had on were my shorts and a tank top. It had been so hot just minutes before the storm. 

I was terrified, I could barely move. But I knew I had to get somewhere safe, and fast. Before I even knew it, my bare feet were pelting through the summer snow at high speeds, bringing me into safety in a nearby outhouse.

That solace was the most relief I’d ever felt in my life up until that moment, and I knew that in this moment I was going to get that back. I had to get downtown.



Luckily for me, moving across the city did me good. North Industrial was close to the downtown area.

My boots were starting to stick to the ground as I trudged through the streets over birds and burned flesh. 

I could feel the heat and it was unbearable. I could hardly breathe as I swerved around a vehicle that tore past me, the tires turning to a melted tar. I was so numb at that moment, I hardly paid any mind to the bodies. There weren’t too many, as everyone else was hiding indoors. Even then, the buildings were sure to cave in. Everyone alive must have been underground, and I was going to join them. 

The skin on the people in the street was spread, almost like butter. One of them was alive, I caught a glimpse of their darting eyes as I fled past, trying to at least remain in the shade of the towering buildings.

The stench, of course, was overpowering. Hot, sizzling flesh and burning rubber. 

Suddenly, as I turned the corner that would quickly lead me to my soon-to-be sanctuary, the world around me started to morph in one direction. East. Shattered glass from the towering buildings came crashing toward me and bricks were thrown overhead. I was aggressively thrust against the concrete where I almost felt myself begin to sink. I screamed bloody murder as a crane in the distance creaked and moaned, louder than any sound I ever heard. My brain felt as if it was being pushed against my skull and I nearly blacked out. No. I had to hold on, I had to find that will inside of me.

The foil stuck to the pavement. I was being swallowed by the ground as everything leaned. I wanted to cry simply because I knew my sanctuary was so close. I was on the same street-

Someone was pulling me. 

Strong hands were suddenly wrapped around my exposed arm and they were heaving. The gravitational pull was suddenly on my side, pulling me up from my indented place in the street and throwing me against a building, in the shade. 

The man who pulled me was thrown alongside me, and without looking at each other, we both grappled against the building and gravity, practically crawling against the wall toward the open door of the venue.

I realized quickly the only way we’d make it to the door was if we rolled against the wall. I pushed myself and rolled once, flattened again against the wall. Once we’d pushed ourselves to the doorway, we were tossed down the stairs and suddenly, just as we’d landed, gravity shifted back and the world stopped leaning east.



	It took a long time to get settled into the underground venue. I’d taken off my foil and shuffled inside where, as I’d imagined, a couple dozen people had already been piling in. 

It was dark as I’d also imagined, but people were using flashlights. All of their phones had stopped working, some of them crushed in the heat. Some people were crying and others had limbs broken or third degree burns. The stench was unfathomable.



It would take me a good while to relax, but I eventually did. I learned that the man who’d pulled me away from my certain demise happened to be an old friend from the music scene. We all shared our stories, cried and shook and eventually, we even laughed.

Little did we know, we were going to become somewhat of a family down there.

Still, aside from the obvious trauma we’d all endured, I couldn’t stop thinking of the man. The strange backpacker who seemed to know me, and who seemed to know what was going to happen. To the day. He was probably dead now, burned to a crisp in the midnight sun.



It would take about a year before the heat would subside. It would also take that long for people to figure out what had actually happened. Some of us would say the earth stopped spinning, and that made some sense to me. Maybe we came an inch closer to the sun than we should have. Maybe both. Regardless, the world as we knew it would never be the same.

Power was cut completely. 

I’d made quite the world for myself in those tunnels, mapping all of it out and living down there with the rest of the survivors. We had our music. All of the house instruments were there. We had shows every Friday and Saturday, and each fortnight a group would go out to scavenge. I grew a beard. My scar had healed, though the indent remained. There was even talk of some facility somewhere far away that was creating some kind of strange form of electricity, and some of my bedmates spoke of cern. The scavengers recalled seeing some strange lights in the distance.

I only concerned myself with what was in front of me, but from time to time all I could do was remember.

Remember my old apartment, the closed curtains and that awful feeling of being watched.

I was half the man I was back then. Or, maybe I was twice the man. I really couldn’t tell anymore.

The food became bland and the feeling, that universal feeling of wanting had altogether faded from our lives. All we wanted now was to live.

I started considering leaving the nest once a few of the others started making their own way. I knew there wasn’t really anywhere to go but I needed to see everything for myself.

Maybe I’d make my way toward the supposed light, maybe I could find something for myself. 

It must have been a good five years until I finally left the nest. I hadn’t seen myself in any reflection for the entirety of my stay. Mirrors were long-since shattered and the shards used as knives, I never got to see the man I’d become. 

A good friend, Noel, someone I’d call my brother, woke me up the morning I was to leave. We had planned my escape for months now, and today was the day. I call it an escape because none of the others could stand to see me go.

“Hey,” Noel whispered, shaking my shoulder lightly.

“Time to get up, bud.”

I stretched and peeled my shoulder-length hair back from my face. I was happy to see his smiling face. 

I put on everything I had, though with the residing heat outside, I didn’t have use for a shirt. It never got cold above ground anymore.

As I was turning to take my final walk up with steps and into the broken world, I stopped to look around me one last time. Everyone was peacefully asleep in their places, all but me and Noel. 

“Oh hey,” He hissed quickly before running to grab something. I leaned against the wall and waited, my heart pounding with excitement and terror. As ready as I was, I was petrified of what lay before me.

Noel came hustling back with something under his arm.

“Here, I grabbed this for you on our last run, you’re gonna need it.”

He tossed it my way and I caught it before holding it up in the darkness. I nearly fell to my knees when I saw that I was holding a massive army-green backpack with chest straps and all.



I’m headed to the lights now; I can see them every night. I wonder if they’ll bring me any answers, or any meaning to whatever the world has become.

They’re getting closer now and I can’t help but let a certain thought enter my mind:

If I could try to change any of this, any little part of all of it, I would do my very best to.

1nia3ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RandomAccessGoodGirl/comments/1nia3ay/the_cafe/,The Cafe,"My nerves hummed under my skin. We had been building this fantasy for so long that I didn’t know if it would translate in person. But I wanted the first moment you saw me to be one you would never forget. I wanted it etched into you, something you’d replay later while your cock was in your hand, stroking yourself to the memory of me.

I chose my dress carefully for you. I wanted to be presentable but still revealing, the kind of chic that draws the eye for its elegance before anyone notices the hidden delights it holds. Something understated but made for the body wearing it. I wanted you to see me and know I had chosen this for you alone.

When my Uber pulled up to the café, anticipation flooded me like heat. I stepped out knowing how tight the dress was against my body, how every curve demanded your attention, how my ass would catch your eye the second I turned. That knowledge only sharpened the quiet surge of confidence that comes when you are exactly who you want to be in that moment, a woman aching to be taken, aching to be ruined.

Inside, the café you chose carried the scent of coffee and something sweet, thick in the air. Vietnamese, a subtle nod to my culture, thoughtful in a way that made me want you even more. The space was small and intimate, with only a few customers. I ordered my drink, sat down with my book, and tried to steady myself. I had come early on purpose. I wanted to be settled when you arrived, already waiting, already aching, already yours.

Every time the door opened, I thought it might be you. Once, twice, three times. And then, when I finally decided to stop glancing up, you walked in.

The moment you stepped inside, my mind went blank. I couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe, only feel the weight of your eyes raking over me. The intensity of it made my clit throb, a slow, hungry ache that spread through my whole body. I didn’t dare hold your gaze for long because the need was already too much.

You ordered at the counter, and from where I sat, I felt the shift of power. You towering above me, broad and commanding, my body already imagining you forcing me down beneath you. My pussy clenched just from the thought of your cock pressing inside me, heavy and relentless. Then you turned, crossed the room, and chose the chair across from me by the piano. Like our countless video calls, you sat opposite me, but this time I could feel the heat of you in the air between us.

That was when it became unbearable. You just looked at me, claiming me with your stare. Every second your eyes devoured me, the ache inside me sharpened into something feral. My thighs pressed together under the table, rocking, desperate for friction. I could feel the slick heat gathering and pooling, my body already preparing for you.

When they called your name, you stood and collected your coffee. But instead of leaving, you came to my side. You slid into the booth beside me, one foot of space where there had been thousands.

“You’re beautiful,” you whispered.

In that moment, I had never felt more beautiful in my life. Not because of the dress or the way I’d done my hair, but because of the hunger in your eyes when you said it. The way your voice dropped like you were already imagining how I’d sound moaning under you.

You placed your bag between us, pulled out your laptop to work, and I lowered my eyes to my book. On the outside, we were just two strangers. But beneath the table, I could already feel the leash between us, pulling me closer.

Eventually I built up enough courage. I slipped off my coat, revealing the dress in its entirety. I wanted you to drink me in, every inch I’d prepared for you. The cream fabric clung to me, hugging the curve of my waist, the round of my ass. The square neckline and long sleeves looked modest at first glance, but the slit whispered everything else. When I shifted, the open back gave you a glimpse of your tattoo, the one that brands me as yours. I leaned slightly to make sure you saw it, a silent promise: I am your good girl, and you can do anything you want to me.

The café buzzed around us, but for me there was only you. You stretched your foot forward, tentative at first, and I met you. I pressed my toes against your ankle, traced up your calf. Each time my foot slid up your leg, I pictured pressing against your cock, rubbing against the thickness I knew was there. My body clenched at the thought, my pussy aching for you to break your calm and grab me right there.

I slid my fingers beneath the slit of my dress, hooked them into the lace thong I had chosen for you that morning, and began to tug it down. Slowly. Past my thighs, my knees, my ankles. I bent to scoop it up, slipped it quietly into your bag without a word. I imagined you later, hand reaching in, fingers curling around the fabric still warm and damp from me, lifting it to your face and breathing me in. That thought alone almost made me come right there at the table.

We sat like that for a while, the air between us thick, electric, obscene. You typing, me pretending to read, though both of us knew neither of us was focused. Every now and then I felt your eyes crawl over me again, stripping me bare, memorizing me as if I were already spread beneath you, begging.

Eventually, you began to gather your things. When you stood, you leaned down, your hand found my thigh, and you gripped me.

Firm. Certain. Possessive.

“I’ll see you later,” you murmured.

Later meant the hotel. Later meant your cock finally splitting me open, stretching me. Later meant the dress shoved up, my thighs forced wide, your weight crushing me into the bed while I gave you everything. Later was you using me the way I’d been craving for the last two years, crying your name and coming undone beneath you.",1,1758004532.0,u_RandomAccessGoodGirl,0,1.0,False

Noong Grade 11 pa, may konting crush na ako kay Lesley (classmate ko), pero never ko sinabi sa kahit sino. Ngayon na graduating na kami, biglang nagkaroon ng chance na mag-spend time together.

First meet namin sa coffee shop na sinet-up ko with my friend Rick (note: may crush si Rick sa friend ni Lesley na si Ell, at alam niya rin na may gusto ako kay Lesley). Ang saya nung bonding na yun, tapos kinabukasan nag-inuman kami sa bahay ni Ell — kaming apat. Ang solid ng vibes kaya naging halos everyday after class yung inuman.

Si Rick naging clingy kay Ell, kaya nainggit ako — sana ganon din kami ni Lesley. Kaya nag-try ako mag-flirt kay Lesley pero ramdam ko na tinataboy niya ako, parang wala siyang interest. Medyo sad, pero di ko dinamdam kasi at that time nililigawan ko si Mika (17, other school). Mga 8 months na akong nanliligaw pero bihira kami makabond.

Yung kulang na presence ni Mika, nakita ko kay Lesley. Pero kung ikukumpara, si Mika talaga panalo — achiever, mabait, mahinhin, at loyal (lagi niyang sinasabi pag may nagpapapansin sa kanya). Si Lesley maganda, same humor kami, parang matagal na kaming magkakilala. That was the first time na naka-feel ako ng ganong connection. Hindi ko alam kung dahil lang ba lagi siyang andyan kaya nahulog ako.

Pero pucha, biglang naging clingy si Rick at Lesley. As in harap-harapan kay Ell, pero parang di naman nagseselos si Ell. May time pa na nasa kama sila ni Ell, nagkakagatan through uniform habang andun si Ell nagpe-phone lang. Call me seloso, pero parang sobra na yun. May isa pang beses na manghihiram ng helmet si Rick kay Lesley, tapos sumama pa si Lesley sa kanya. Nung nag-angkas si Rick, super dikit si Lesley, yakap na yakap pa — sabi pa ni Rick na dumidikit raw yung boobs ni Lesley sa kanya. At FYI, si Rick pa nagkukwento sakin nito, kahit alam niya na crush ko si Lesley.

One night, nag-invite ako ng pinsan ko sa inuman at sinabi ko sa kanila yung problema ko — bakit ba ako nafa-fall sa ganitong type ng tao kahit meron na akong nililigawan. Pinagalitan nila ako, sabi nila mali ako, tanga ako, at wala akong respeto sa sarili. Doon ko na-admit na mali nga ako. After nun, nag-usap kami ni Mika, di ko sinabi yung full problema, niyakap ko lang siya ng matagal. Gumaan naman yung loob ko.

Pero pagpasok ulit sa school, ewan ko ba, nasasaktan pa rin ako kapag may kausap na ibang guy si Lesley. Tapos nalaman ko pa sa isang classmate namin na nag-asikaso ng research si Rick at Lesley sa bahay ng kaklase, at natulog sila doon magkatabi. Ang sakit, kahit alam ko namang wala akong karapatan magselos. Alam naman ni Lesley na may gusto ako sa kanya, pero wala lang talaga siyang pake.

Ang ending, kahit masakit, I already decided na si Mika yung ipu-pursue ko. Pero minsan naiisip ko, kung hindi ko nakilala si Mika, baka mas grabe pa yung sitwasyon ko ngayon",1,1758004514.0,u_WinterOutcome5530,1,1.0,False

1nia0xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1nia0xc/long_distance_issues/,Long Distance Issues.,"So hopefully to turn a long story short. I met someone in January and we fell in love very fast and unexpectedly. She already had plans to move several states away to pursue her masters degree at the end of the summer but the relationship felt so perfect we decide to continue on anyway. After 6 truly amazing months together, the end of July comes and I help her move in and so starts the long distance part of the story. Neither of us were adjusting well. She was having issues getting a new job, leaving her friends and developing a social life in her new state and I became very depressed and unsure if long distance would work out ( i realize now I was just in my head too much about not having them around). Ik there's no justification and I take full accountability for my actions, but I cheated on them with my ex. I waited about 6 days before I broke down and told them.I immediately stopped all of my bad habits, started therapy and got us both workbook/ journals for the situation. After a week of talking about it we broke up. I would love to have a second chance and I really feel I can prove I'm worth it. She says she's not sure she can forgive me for cheating and wouldn't want to continue a relationship and hold it over me forever Her solution to figure this out is to go no contact until a day in the winter (Nov/Dec) where we get coffee. I have no idea if we'll get back together or not until that day. All I feel I can do now is continue to work on myself and try to get over the relationship I used to have. Any advice?

Addendum: Her dad hates cheaters from personal experience, so she hasn't told him until she's sure it's a no. To help me move on I've considered politely returning her stuff to him as it would go to his house anyhow and he's much closer. I've considered also telling him the truth should he ask. My only concern is losing an opportunity to reconnect with her however I would want a partner that I know has accepted every aspect of reconnecting and I don't think we could hide it from him forever.",1,1758004286.0,Breakupadvice,0,0.99,False
1ni9zxn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ni9zxn,The story of my creation of a sandbox for RCT1 Vanilla .... .....,"**The Goal:**

RCT1 doesn’t have sandbox mode — but I wanted one. Without cheats. Without tools. Just me vs. the game.

**The Problem: No official RCT1 Sandbox.**

As you all know, RCT1 does not have an official sandbox mode. So if you want free play back in the day, you oftentimes went to a no-money scenario and had to make-do with the rides you researched as the game progressed.

Of course, nowadays, life is much easier. OpenRCT2 has a sandbox outright, you can download umpteen number of fancy workbenches and flatlands created by users, and you can use tool like the Saved Game Modifier to remove boundaries, money, and objectives.

However, I happen to be an RCT1 player who likes to ""take their coffee black"" so to speak. Playing RCT2 with cheat features at my fingertips just isn't the same as reliving the challenges I had to face when my uncle got me the game for $50 retail price in the early 2000's. I went through all the scenarios following the rules by the book, and only reluctantly installed the Drexler patch to open RCT Station downloads. But I never was one to cheat or take the easy way out.

**The Easy Part: Winning the scenario and doing all the research.**

So I challenged my self to create a sandbox for RCT1 Vanilla without any creature comforts provided by cheats, utilities, tools, or OpenRCT2. I also needed a go-to when I wanted to test something out in RCT1 Vanilla without having to deal with money or research.

So I set out to turn a scenario into a sandbox. I used the Saved Game Modifier to find out that Arid Heights has all of the assets of the game researchable. So I played the game normally, winning the scenario, and waiting for all the research to complete. I then had to delete all the rides and tell all the peeps to vamoose. This is where the hard part comes in.

**The Hard Part 1: Keeping new guests from coming in.**

I thought it would be easy at first. I just close the park, shut the rides, and wait for the people to leave, before bringing in the bulldozers. But that was FAR from true.

After playing the game and winning the scenario, I realized I was up against some challenges. The Park red/green traffic light button is removed for non-money parks. The park rating cannot go below 700.

So I tried several things. First I needed to stop peeps from entering an open park. I could not just place a No Entry sign, as the sign is at least one tile from the park entrance, and the trapped peeps would get angry and push my Park Rating off a cliff. I then remembered Marcel Vos talking about using a sloped piece of path in front of the entrance that causes incoming peeps to fall through the ground. Viola! I can keep new peeps from entering the park while I clear it out.

**The Hard Part 2: Getting the old guests out.**

Now to get everybody out of the park. I tried and failed at several attempts. First I closed the rides and used no entry signs to direct guests to the park entrance, but because I kept them too happy (to keep the park from closing due to low park rating!) and they could not run out of money, they would not willfully leave the park quickly. The no entry signs just caused them to pile up at the entrance and complain ""Its too crowded here!"" while flushing my rating down the toilet.

So I came up with a clever solution. I would leave the rides open, and raise the land by two cubes in front of the entrance to 3 of the most popular rollercoasters. This would cause guests to quickly disappear with  no drowning penalty. I kept a meticulous eye on the messenger to see if any rollercoaster would break down, as a few times I had the nasty Station Breaks Failure that no mechanic could service. During a breakdown, I lowered the land to let a mechanic in. I would then start deleting rides from the back of the park forward, hiring tons of each type of staff to keep the guests from getting mad from crowding, cleaning the paths, curbing vandalism, and keeping the remaining rides from having dangerous breakdowns. I then deleted a majority of the park in a controlled manner, while staring at the park rating to stay above 700.

**The Victory: Park bulldozed without razing park rating.**

After multiple attempts .... viola! I was able to get all but one of the guests out of the park, and restore the map to the way Chris Sawyer designed it. I did leave two rides, three stalls and one guest because when those are deleted, the park rating for some reason dives to like 200 or something. These rides can be used as a starter for keeping your park rating up while you build your park.

**Four files available for download:**

You can download my sandbox from my GitHub collection of RCT files at the link below. It leads to a directory with four files. The two files that say WITH money I did not make (downloaded it from the Internet Archive of gamebeacon), but the two files WITHOUT money I created. On one of them, I used the Saved Game Modifier just to enable the garden gates (never appears through the research in any scenario). This slight modification did not cause any problem on my computer with File Contains Invalid Data, but just to be safe, I included a save file without the gates enabled.

**The Finished Product: Download my RCT1 Sandbox Today!**

So, if you take your RCT1 coffee black, give these sandboxes a shot! If you create anything you want to share, feel free to share it here.

1ni9yvo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ni9yvo,"New dentist replaced composite bonding, having issues","Hello.

In 2015 I had composite bonding placed on my two teeth to the sides of my front teeth due to them being short/smaller.

I chose bonding because I wanted something reversible if I decided I didn’t want to deal with it someday. These were great, I had no issues and they lasted a really long time.

Some discoloring was happening so decided to get the bonding replaced with a different dentist (moved states) that I trusted. He tried to tell me I should do veneers instead but would be willing to do bonding again if that’s what I wanted. I decided on bonding again because I’ve never wanted something permanent and couldn’t really afford veneers at this time.

Well this new bonding has not been great. It looks orange and has a sort of texture on it and I never had these issues before. I don’t drink much, don’t smoke, don’t drink coffee. Nothing about my health has changed. 

Yesterday I was eating a piece of pizza and a large chunk of the bonding came off. What scared me was the huge gap between my teeth that I do not believe was there and was created by this new dentist.

QUESTION: could he have shaved my teeth even when I asked him not to? Would there have been a reason to? Can these teeth be fixed/saved? I am so upset by this and feel my trust was violated majorly. You can really see the color distortion now too. And while I want this fixed, I’m not sure I trust him to do it and don’t know what to do/ask for at this point.

Context: There was a delay of 5 mins for IC 2012, that surprised. But upon reaching the destination that delay was roughly 20-30 mins. 

I paid for a quick coffee at the Mannheim station, quickly got into the train and sat. 

I remeber, I tried opening the board/stand that helps us to keep food on it. And while doing that, the board hit my coffee cup and it spill onto me. 
I quickly removed things from my pocket which included wallet, wiped everything off. 

That was the last time I remeber seeing my wallet. 

The wallet has 1 US dollar, ans somewhere around 150-80 Euros. 
But majorily, it consists my Student ID card, TK health Insurance card, Sparkasse Card and a very special wallet card given to me by my girlfriend on our 1st Anniversary. And my simcard(removed it because I had some glitch with PUK/PUN and I put wrong sim pin code three times.)

I tried contacting the Lost and Found service at Dortmund. Filled the form and description. But haven't found it yet. I am getting very desperate as I am fully locked, Can't get groceries, can't make calls... I have taken some money from freinds, but i am in the hope to get back my wallet.

So the question remains,

It was supposed to be for quick check ins and peace of mind. At first it was chill and kind of cute. Then my older sibling started popping up wherever I was like clockwork. I would leave the house and five minutes later they would stroll into the same coffee shop like oh hey just passing through. It happened at the park and at the grocery store and even at the gym parking lot. One time I went to the pharmacy and they arrived while I was still at the counter which felt creepy. Another day I met friends at a food truck and they pulled up with lawn chairs like it was a stakeout. I asked the sibling to chill in the group chat and they called it being protective which made my skin crawl. After that I tried moving around with random stops just to see and they still found me fast. They liked to bring snacks or errands as excuses and it always sounded helpful on paper. It stopped feeling like family safety and started feeling like surveillance with a smile. My phone would ping and ugh my stomach would drop because I knew a pop in might be coming. I turned off notifications for a week and the surprise appearances slowed but did not stop. It clicked that they were checking the map in real time and using my location like a live itinerary.

I told the group I wanted to pause my sharing and switch to manual check ins on trips and emergencies. Half the siblings said do what makes you feel safe and the other half said the map keeps everyone calmer. The clingy sibling said I was ungrateful for their care and my cheeks went hot. I tried offering compromises like only sharing during long drives or after dark or when traveling. They kept showing up anyway and I started planning my errands like a spy which is ridiculous lol. My social time got weird because friends kept asking why my sibling materialized everywhere. I like being close to family but I also like breathing without someone tracking my groceries low key. I even asked a neighbor to text me if they saw that car the next week and the texts kept coming. The whole point of the app was safety not surprise audits of my day. I get that location sharing can save lives and yeah I know it helps in storms and breakdowns. I also know that consent matters and constant drive bys feel lousy and invasive. If I turn off the app and just send updates I can still be reachable without being chaseable. My plan is to announce the change and keep one emergency channel like a quick call or a pinned chat. I am bracing for fussing and side eye and maybe a long lecture about family unity. AITA if I switch off sharing for a while and keep my sanity.",7,1758003914.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,12,0.9,False
