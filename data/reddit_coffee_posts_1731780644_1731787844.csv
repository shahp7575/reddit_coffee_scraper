1gsvoqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gsvoqc/the_key/,The Key,"I’m just an ordinary guy. Dead-end job, no friends or family worth mentioning, and a life that’s been going nowhere. But everything changed a year ago, and I’ve never been the same since.

It was a normal Friday evening, and I was on my way home from work when I hit a roadblock—literally. Roadworks forced me to take a detour, and just my luck, I got a flat tire. After a long, stressful week, I thought, Great. Just what I needed. I pulled over, popped the trunk, and started changing the tire.

That’s when I saw it—a glint of light catching the edge of something shiny. At first, I thought it was just some piece of trash, but when I looked closer, I saw it was a key. Old-fashioned, with a simple brass finish, no markings. It looked out of place.

I picked it up, slipped it in my pocket, and went about finishing the tire. The rest of the evening was uneventful. I got home, had a quick dinner, and went to bed, but that key stuck with me.

The next day, I woke up around noon—late, but that was nothing new. I poured a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table, absentmindedly picking up the key. I turned it over in my hands. It was heavy, almost too solid for something so old. It didn’t look like it belonged to anything familiar.

Out of curiosity, I decided to see if I could figure out who it belonged to. But as I looked closer, I saw no identifying marks. So, I shrugged, set it down, and finished my coffee.

Later that afternoon, boredom got the best of me. I was pacing around the house when I passed the basement door. I don’t know why, but I stuck the key in the lock, just to see what would happen. To my surprise, the lock clicked open.

I froze. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Was this some kind of prank? But I had to see what was behind the door. So I opened it.

What I saw… I can’t explain it. It was a city—a city that looked like mine but wasn’t. The skyline was similar, but the buildings were off, and the streets felt subtly wrong. I stepped into the doorway, heart pounding, and looked around.

I’ll admit it—if you had a chance to step into a whole new world, wouldn’t you? I walked out onto the street, and no one seemed to notice me at first. I stopped a passerby and asked, “Where am I?”

They stared at me like I’d lost my mind. I must’ve looked crazy. I repeated myself, but they just brushed me off and walked away. I felt a surge of panic. Am I losing it?

I tried to calm myself. This is just a weird version of my city, I thought. It can’t be real.

I found a newspaper stand and picked up a local paper. My eyes scanned the front page, and my stomach dropped. This was my city, yes, but everything in the paper was off. Shops I’d never heard of. Buildings I didn’t recognize. It didn’t make sense.

My first instinct was to get home. I knew my city well enough to navigate it by heart, even if something felt… wrong. But as I walked through the streets, I started to notice even stranger things—roads that didn’t exist, signs in languages I didn’t recognize.

Eventually, I found my street. My house. Or, I thought it was. I didn’t have my keys on me. When I had gone through the basement door, I’d forgotten to bring them. Great, I thought. I’m locked out of my own house in a city that doesn’t make sense.

Luckily, I got along well with my neighbor. I knocked on their door, hoping they’d have a spare key. But when a stranger answered, I froze.

“I’m sorry, can I speak to the owner?” I asked. “I’ve locked myself out.”

The person eyed me warily. “I’ve lived here for thirty years. The guy who lives next door is an old man. He’s never looked anything like you. Now leave, or I’ll call the cops.”

My heart sank. Something’s wrong. Really wrong.

I backed away, thinking. Then I remembered the key. It had gotten me here, so maybe it could get me home. I turned and made my way back to the city, to the door. I found it again, hidden on a quiet corner, and inserted the key.

But before I turned it, something caught my eye—a TV screen in a store window. The president was on the screen, giving a speech. But it wasn’t my president. The man on the screen wasn’t anyone I recognized.

I turned the key anyway, and stepped back through the door.

I felt a wave of relief, then disbelief. The door had led me back… but not to my house. Instead, I was in a store, surrounded by people staring at me. I looked around, but nothing made sense. The room I’d come through was gone, replaced by a sterile, unfamiliar store.

Panic surged. I turned around and spotted a bathroom. I needed to gather myself. But when I stepped inside and took out the key again, something happened. I inserted it into the bathroom door—and on the other side? A landscape. Not a store. A vast, open field.

Confused, I pulled back, but then something clicked in my mind. The key… it’s not just opening doors. It’s opening… worlds.

I tried again, and each time I opened the door, I saw a different place. A living room. A crowded mall. Then, one time, I opened the door to a dark room, a room with no windows or doors.

I turned around to see a man in a black suit standing in the center of the room. But he wasn’t human. His face was… static. It was like watching a TV with no signal—flickering and fuzzy. The figure advanced toward me.

“You’ve been meddling with things you don’t understand,” it said, its voice like a thousand voices tangled together. “Tell me everything you know about the key. Now.”

Fear clamped down on me. The thing wasn’t human, but it was something else—something ancient. And I knew I couldn’t escape unless I played along.

I answered as best as I could, my mind racing. I can’t let it know that I don’t know anything. I need to get out of here.

In my pocket, the key was still there, untouched. I felt a surge of hope. Maybe it was the only way out. But before I could think clearly, the thing lunged at me, pulling out a strange device. It looked like a knife, but it had lights and a display, like some kind of technology from another world.

It stabbed me, twice, once across my left arm. I screamed, adrenaline rushing through my veins. I grabbed the knife and plunged it into the creature’s face, shattering its flickering visage.

I ran.

I don’t know how many dimensions I passed through, but each time I opened a door, I was further away from that thing. I didn’t stop running until my body was covered in sweat, blood dripping from my arm.

When I finally stopped, I found myself in a tiny village. The people looked… strange. Like they didn’t understand the concept of hunger. When I asked where I could get food, they stared at me blankly, as if the question made no sense.

Then, one of them laughed—a cruel, echoing laugh. “You’re confused, child,” she said. “Let me show you how we get our energy.”

She looked to the sky, and her face split open, revealing a giant flower inside.

I recoiled in horror, but then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it again.

The thing.

It was following me.

I ran.

I quickly opened a door and ran through when I was hit with an intense heat like I’d stepped into the heart of a furnace. I was inside a small, unfamiliar room, sweat pouring from me, my breaths shallow with fear. I had to move. The creature, that thing I’d barely escaped, was coming through the door again. I fumbled for the key in my pocket, but before I could reach it, the door creaked open, revealing nothing but darkness on the other side.

I ran.

The other side of the room had a second door—no keyhole, just a plain wooden surface. Panic surged through me. I threw myself at it, pushing it open, and found myself in what seemed like an abandoned warehouse. The heat was stifling here too, but I barely noticed it as I scanned the vast, empty space. I couldn’t stop now. I had to find a way out before the thing found me.

I darted toward a large opening on the far side of the building, the world outside tinged with an eerie, unnatural red. It took a moment for my brain to register what I was seeing—fires, everywhere. The horizon was nothing but smoke and burning wreckage. Buildings, trees, bodies. The acrid scent of burning flesh and wood filled the air, and I had to fight the urge to collapse, to vomit. Adrenaline kept my legs moving, but the terror in my chest made every step feel heavier.

I didn’t know how long I walked. Hours, maybe. Every place I found that looked like a possible door was either burned to the ground or too dangerous to approach. The world felt endless, a suffocating nightmare, and the heat—always the heat—was making it harder to breathe. When I finally saw movement in the distance, people, my heart leapt. I staggered toward them, barely able to speak when I got close enough. All I could manage before blacking out was one word: “Water.”

I woke up tied to a chair, surrounded by people in black robes. They had their backs turned, speaking in low, harsh tones, their voices thick with purpose. Panic gripped me as I tried to understand what was happening. My body ached, my wounds still fresh from my previous encounter with the creature, but I forced myself to focus.

I asked, my voice weak, “What’s happening? Why am I tied up?”

One of them turned toward me, a figure that looked almost human, but something about the face was wrong. Too still, too cold. He stepped closer, and his whisper crawled across my skin. “Child of God, what is it you believe?”

I didn’t understand. “What? Who are you? Why am I—”

“Answer me,” he hissed, eyes flashing with a strange intensity. “What do you believe?”

I repeated my question, trying to sound more confident, though my voice shook. “What’s going on here?”

The figure took a deep breath, as if savoring the moment, before his face twisted into a sneer. “We, the sons of Lucifer, demand your faith. You will no longer be a child of God. We are as one, and we will bring about the rise of our father once more.”

I froze, not knowing what to say. I wasn’t religious—I didn’t know how to respond to something like this. But I knew I had to say something to get them to stop. “I’ll do whatever you want,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

They laughed. A deep, mocking laugh, and the man who had spoken before shouted, “Blasphemer!”

The others repeated it, over and over, a chant that wore me down, each word digging deeper into my chest. They taunted me, called me every name under the sun, and as they did, one of them muttered in a language I didn’t recognize—Latin, maybe? I only knew English, but the sound of the words made my skin crawl.

I didn’t care anymore. I wanted out. I was exhausted—mentally, physically—and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could hold on. I pulled at my restraints, desperate to free myself, but the pain of my wounds made it almost impossible. At some point, I passed out.

I woke again to a sound—a massive crash that shook the room. The chanting had stopped. I opened my eyes, heart pounding, but the room was empty. My restraints were still in place, but the robed figures were gone. The silence was suffocating.

Another crash, closer this time, followed by a series of loud, heavy footsteps. The floor trembled under each step. My mind raced, my pulse quickening as I realized what was coming. I had to get out, had to move. I pulled at the ropes, harder now, desperation fueling me.

The sound stopped. My breath caught in my throat as I looked to my left and froze.

A monster stood there.

It was humanoid, its massive form towering over me. Dark, like a shadow, with claws long enough to tear through steel. Its teeth were jagged, gleaming, but it was its eyes that paralyzed me—black, infinite, staring into me like they could see every dark thought I’d ever had. I couldn’t look away. A rush of cold dread washed over me.

I froze.

The creature raised its hand, and with one swift motion, it slashed at my abdomen. Pain exploded across my body. Blood poured down my legs, pooling beneath me. I screamed, vision blurring, but then… nothing. The creature raised its hand again, preparing for a final blow.

I closed my eyes. There was no escape.

But nothing came.

I opened my eyes.

I was back in the same room. The same sterile, oppressive space, tied to the same damn chair. The wounds on my abdomen were gone, healed, as though they’d never been there. My mind reeled. What was happening?

And then I saw it.

A figure, standing in the corner, unmoving. The static-faced thing. The creature I had hoped to never see again.

I started crying, not out of fear but exhaustion. I had nothing left to give.

The creature’s voice, mechanical and cold, sliced through the air. “You are telling the truth, aren’t you?”

I could barely speak, my throat dry, my voice hoarse. “Yes… I’m done. I don’t care anymore. Just kill me.”

The creature didn’t move, but the voice came again, calmer now. “What would you do to get out of this alive?”

I looked up at it, disbelief flooding my veins. “What? You want me to beg? You want me to… please, just… kill me.”

There was a long pause before the creature spoke again, its voice surprisingly softer now. “I can do that. But first, I need to show you something.”

It stepped forward, and with a slow, deliberate motion, reached up to its own face. The static flickered and twisted, pulling away like a mask, revealing… me.

Another version of me.

I staggered back, mouth agape. “What the hell…?”

The other me smiled, or at least, something resembling a smile. “This is what I am,” it said. “And what I want. I want every single version of us. These cages…” It gestured around the room, and I saw them then—dozens, hundreds of cages, each containing a person in a jumpsuit and a metal mask. “These are all you, from different dimensions. And I want every one of you.”

I barely heard the rest of what it said, something about choices and freedom. The words felt like they were slipping through my fingers, fading into nothing.

“You have a choice,” the other me said, its voice cold, calculating. “You can join me and become part of my collection, or you can help me gather the others.”

A lump formed in my throat. I knew what I had to do. “I’ll help you.”

The creature nodded, pleased. “Good. You’ll use the key. Find the others, and once you do, use this.” It handed me a small device, pressing a button on it. “This will signal me. And I’ll come for them.”

I wanted to scream, to break free, but I couldn’t. “One more thing,” it said, its voice darkening. “Don’t try to run. If you do, I’ll drop you in a dimension far worse than this one.”

It opened a door, and I stepped through. A new world. A new Earth.

And now, I’m here, writing this. You need to know the truth. The creature, the other me—it’s coming for you. It’s already found my version here. I’m leaving this story behind, hoping that someone, somewhere, will listen. It’s not too late. You have to fight.

The key is the only way to stop this. You need to find it before it finds you.",1,1731787443.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

After a long day, sometimes all I want is someone who can make me feel safe and cared for, even if it’s just through a call. Nothing complicated—strictly SFW. We can talk a little if we feel like it, but the main goal is to fall asleep together. If things go well, we can swap pics tomorrow. If we’re each other’s type and it feels right, maybe this could lead to something more consistent.

Here’s what I’m looking for tonight:

* A calm, soothing voice that can lull me to sleep.
* Not noisy or awkward with silence. Knows when to stay quiet, especially if they hear me starting to doze off.
* Doesn’t mind if I snore—it happens.

If this works out beyond tonight, I’d want someone who fits my dating preferences:

\- Chinito/Mestizo.

\- Someone easy on the eyes (bonus points if gwapo).

\- Provider mindset, traditional values.

\- Strong, calm masculine energy.

\- Can host or drive.

\- 5'5 above, no baggage, healed, single ready to be in a relationship, 26-33.

About me:

I work in recruitment at BGC.  Mestiza, curly hair, chubby. I live in Taguig/Makati. I’m a former southie. 5'2.

As a girlfriend:

My love language is quality time—I’m a lover girl who enjoys deep connections. I also give great massages! After a tough day, nothing makes me feel better than being offered coffee or a meal.

Ideal date? A nice dinner.

I’m also a grad student in a Big 4 school taking a break but wanting to study again. I’m into indie music, horror and romance movies, deep conversations, walking and just chilling with good company.

1gsvcbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FordBronco/comments/1gsvcbg/bronco_offroadeo_nevada/,Bronco Off-Roadeo Nevada ,"I wanted to share a more in depth post about my experience with the Bronco Off-Roadeo in Nevada. 

My husband and I both recently bought Broncos and so we were able to sign up and take part individually. For us, Las Vegas made the most sense for travelling from Alberta, Canada. A flight to Vegas is short (and relatively cheap), and the base camp is only a 40-minute drive from the strip, so this location made the most sense.

We were greeted and guided inside the park when we arrived before jumping in a shuttle van to be brought up to base camp. We were checked in, gifted Yeti water bottles with the Bronco logo, and then mingled with the coffee and snacks provided. We started the morning in the beautiful pavilion, where we introduced ourselves and got started. I felt a little out of place in this beginning ""classroom"" portion, where I was acutely aware of how little I knew about my vehicle and off-roading, but I was prepared to feel like a fish out of water and worked on settling my nerves.

We moved on to the training course to learn some of the basics. My husband lovingly (insert sarcasm here) offered us as the first set of volunteers with me in the driver's seat, perhaps the most nervous I felt all day once all eyes were on me. Luckily, I just had to demonstrate the parking procedure and the technique for tight turns, and I felt good about it! Once we finished up there, we all headed up to pick our rides for the day. I was excited to get a two-door, hoping to mimic my vehicle closely. We split into two groups and went out for an hour of trail driving before lunch.

After lunch, we had another four hours scheduled for trail riding. My guide (Danny Boy) was fantastic! He communicated with the group consistently on our walkie-talkies and was full of fun energy and enthusiasm. As we reached each challenging part of the trail, such as a rock crawl with significant boulders, he was out, guiding each of us through it. Danny was enthusiastic about capturing our experience, so whenever he got us partway through a particularly challenging obstacle, he would grab our phone and capture the moment. I so appreciated this, in part because describing what we did is not well captured in words and because it helped me even better to appreciate what I accomplished once I could see it from the outside.

We wrapped up the day back at the base camp with dinner. Both lunch and dinner were catered and the food was excellent. We also had a chance to visit the gift shop, which had some exclusive items to the Nevada Off Roadeo.

I felt taken care of all day long and the experience was better than I could have imagined. The actual off-roading was a blast but what stood out to me the most was the way in which I was made to feel confident while out on the trails. I've heard that only about 30% of Bronco owners take advantage of this opportunity, which is a real shame! I loved learning more about my vehicle and having what felt like such an exclusive and unique day. If you are able, I highly recommend considering one of the four off-roadeo experiences.

The plan is to precook some home made sausages and finish them on the grill with my eggs and cheese  omelette.

I'm thinking the repeatable settings of the IP will be ideal for future trips with my travelling kitchen.

Any suggestions as to settings?  I intend to steam in a basket. I'm thinking 5 minutes, manual release and ice water bath, the vacuum pack and into the freezer. There is a small fridge in the room.

Thanks!

1gsv5ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/1gsv5ro/bb_big_brother_world_1_inchworm_house/,[BB] Big Brother World 1: Inchworm House,"Hello everyone!  I'm back with the 13th edition of Big Brother World season 1, part of a long term project that aims to run simulations on Brantsteele's Big Brother Interactive Simulator using every single contestant that's ever played the game!  This is part of the 25th anniversary of Big Brother to celebrate the first ever season that was filmed in the Netherlands in 1999.  For this first season of Big Brother World, I've taken all 180 houseguests that took part in their various versions of the show from 1999-2000n (including 2000 since 1999 only had that inaugural season) and divvyed them up into 13 houses (same number of houses as seasons that aired during 1999-2000), resulting in each house having 13-14 houseguests in them.  I then randomize everyone's relationship stats to each other, along with their popularity, personality, and challenge stats.   After coming up with some custom made events, I run the simulation to see what happens!  After all 13 editions have been run, I'm also going to run a bonus edition with all the winners to crown a Big Brother World champion!  
  
For those new here, welcome!  You're probably wondering, ""Well this sounds fun, but this is already the 13th edition?!  How am I supposed to catch up from the start?"", well don't worry!   At the bottom of this post, I'll include the links to not only this edition of Big Brother World, but also all 12 other editions that I've already run so far!

Now, regarding this edition, each house has a unique color and theme to it, not only to differentiate themselves  from the other houses, but it's also more fun to have a Big Brother game held inside a fun themed home instead of just being House #13.  This edition takes place in the Inchworm House!

https://preview.redd.it/et7fkbyfua1e1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b32e01e581a6ec157d49e53cb55513673d104456

So what's an inchworm?  It's a caterpillar of the Geometer Moth.   You've probably seen these things before and they're actually sort of cute (if you can tolerate bugs, anyway).  This color is named after them.  
  
 

https://preview.redd.it/dp4w5nopua1e1.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a45e99340278f5ff635db7a66924dd28c660ae3

I have a feeling that you can guess where the theme of this edition is going.   That's right!  The Inchworm House will have a bug theme to it!  The bedrooms will have glow in the dark firefly lights to surround the houseguests with as they sleep, the plates have a ladybug design to them, the couches (including the one in the backyard) are designed to look like centipedes (with many ""legs"" protruding from the bottom edges), a outside hammock looks like a big spider web, and there are a few trees in the backyard too!  There's even an entire room dedicated to housing many species of bugs, complete with dozens of bug terrariums each with different species living inside (from giant beetles, to various caterpillars, and even spiders).  This house is an entomologist's dream!   Now if you hate bugs... well, at least the encased insects can't get you!   (Although there's no guarantee that Big Brother won't be cruel and use them as a punishment...).  
  
 Let's talk casting!  We will have 13 houseguests living inside the Inchworm House, so lucky for them that they have to survive one fewer round than most of the contestants have had to during this first season.  Let's meet the cast!

John M, 26, Unknown (Big Brother Germany 1): Germany's first ever Big Brother winner, John M. was described by Big Brother Wiki as a charming and laid back guy.   He was friends with most of the more unpopular houseguests, but he would switch sided after an incident where the audience would loudly chant for the removal of one of his friends, making it clear who was and wasn't liked by the fans.  His switch helped cause a huge fight.  Nonetheless, his personality was enough to keep him popular with the audience and he would survive a couple of late game nominations pretty easily.  In the finals, he would pull off a pretty big upset victory in a nail biter, earning 50.4% of the final two's public vote to win the game.  He would buy a car for his then girlfriend, only to find out that she had cheated on him during the show... ouch.

Ismael, 25, Student (Gran Hermano Spain 1): A fan of the outdoors, especially surfing, Ismael, like everyone else on Gran Hermano Spain 1, faced the nomination chair a lot.  I'm pretty sure by now that the contestants had to have concluded together to make sure that they faced the block each week, as everyone was nominated each and every week other than the 2nd round.  As such, Ismael would certainly be used to being vulnerable, but likely never truly came close to being evicted.  He would make it to the finale, where he'd be declared the winner in a close vote, receiving 41.42% of the final public vote, a decision made by less than 3%.

Maria Jose, 30, Waitress (Big Brother Spain 1): Maria Jose would get into a showmance with another contestant, but it wouldn't last long, as she would be the first person to be evicted from the Gran Hermano house with a 28.52% vote.  Despite that, she'd use her 15 seconds of fame well, using the money she earned to start various business ventures and becoming successful.  Her daughter would be a contestant in a later season of Gran Hermano, nice little family dynasty going on there!

John B, 51, Former Professional Football Referee (Big Brother Netherlands VIP 1): Believe it or not, this is the only season of Big Brother World with only one castmate from Big Brother Netherlands VIP, all the others had two!  John B. is famous for not only being a former referee (he'd been unsuccessful as a player), but for being one of the first gay athletes to come out.  He would be a gay rights activist as well and it's quite possible that his lifestyle cost him the chance to referee the finals of the UEFA Champions League in 1994, though the official reason given was because of a couple of the players on one team were from the Netherlands too.  

Eddie, 21, Entertainer (Big Brother US 1): The first American Big Brother winner, and also the first (and according to Big Brother Wiki, the only) amputee to compete on the show.  He was known for being outspoken and blunt, which no doubt led to him receiving many nomination votes (17) during his stay.  Still, he'd avoid the block until the 4th round, and would continue to face the block each week after.  He'd come pretty close to being evicted in the 5th round, but otherwise seemed to be mostly pretty safe each week.   In the finals, he'd earn 59% of the public vote to win the game.

Melanie, 26, Computer System Salesperson (Big Brother UK 1): Melanie would survive all the way until the final four, but that may be more likely due to her being able to avoid being nominated before then (including in the final five, where a nomination being heard resulted in a redo, Melanie would receive one fewer vote in the redo which was enough to keep her safe when otherwise she'd have been nominated) than it was over her being popular or anything.  Indeed, she'd be evicted with 69% in a three way block battle in the final four.  So disliked was she that there was even a small controversy where someone sent a bunch of fake emails to random accounts asking to call a number to earn a holiday trip.  That number was actually the one used for the Big Brother fans to vote Mel out.  For her part, Melanie was pretty unhappy with her portrayal on the show and noted how much harassment she and her family received over her participation.  

Olivier, 31, Lawyer (Big Brother Switzerland 1): One might assume that a lawyer would be immediately hated by his fellow housemates, but Olivier would prove otherwise.  He'd actually only receive 6 nomination votes during his time in the house.  He would face the block for the first time in the final 6, where he'd be evicted with 64.98% of the vote.  While not a total blowout, Olivier's eviction does make one wonder if the public wasn't quite as willing to like a lawyer as his fellow contestants were.  Or maybe he deserved that eviction, I dunno.

Catherine, 26, Meteorologist (Big Brother Belgium 1): Big Brother Belgium 1 has quite an interesting contestant placement order.  Catherine would finish in 6th place, which actually would be the best out of any of the women!  For whatever reason, the eight women that participated on the show were all eliminated/quit the show before any of the guys left, very interesting to say the least.  For her part, Catherine would be nominated twice during her time in the game, getting evicted the 2nd time in a three way contestant with 74% of the public vote.  I can't imagine that everyone from one gender would ever get evicted before anyone from the other gender would in Big Brother World (though I guess it's not impossible or anything, being a totally random simulator)!

Marta, 23, Student/Barmaid (Big Brother Portugal 1): Things started well for Marta, as it would take until the fourth round before she finally received her first nomination votes.   However, she'd face the block each of the next two weeks.  She'd survive a three way block battle the first time (thanks no doubt, to the evicted nominee being a newbie and thus easily evictable), but in a one on one block battle rematch against the other survivor the following week, Marta would indeed be evicted.  She'd come back years later and get to do commentary for multiple future editions of the Portugese show.

Per, 40, Unknown (Big Brother Sverige 1): Per's a great story about success, failure, and rebuilding oneself (with occasional relapses..).  A professional skateboarder for many years (even winning a some international contests), he'd start a skateboarding company.  He would have a fall from grace due to alcoholism, he'd lose everything and even become homeless for a time, supporting himself by selling newspapers.   He would seek and receive treatment and after four months of sobriety would enter the Big Brother house.  Per would make it to the final five before getting nominated and evicted against the eventual winner.  After his time on the show, he'd go back to creating several magazines and clothing companies.  He would have a relapse with alcohol, getting arrested for drunk driving, but from what I can see, he seems to have mostly otherwise gotten his life back together.  Here's hoping for the best for him!

Hieke, 29, Receptionist (Big Brother Netherlands 2): Hieke, a housewife, did have a few stolen kisses with another male contestant, which I'm sure wouldn't make hubby too thrilled (although I suppose that could depend on the context behind it all, sounds bad though).  Hieke was probably a pretty popular houseguest to live with, given that she only received 4 nomination votes during the entire season (only two early quitters had fewer votes cast against them).  This resulted in her being able to avoid the block altogether... at least until the final five, when everyone was automatically put on the block.  Facing the vote for the first time, Hieke would be evicted, though in a pretty close vote, the eventual winner actually received the 2nd most votes that round and by a vote of 25.2% to 22.8%, it was a rather close call.  

Pietro, 25, Student (Grande Fratello Italy 1): A fan of sports and extreme sports in particular, Pietro had a pretty successful run on Big Brother.  He'd survive a couple nominations to make it to the finale.  While he finished a very distant 3rd place (15% of the vote received), Pietro would earn quite a lot of fame for his time on the show. He had success getting several television and film roles as an actor.  

Linda, 29, Industrial Clerk (Big Brother Germany 2): Linda was a late entry into the Big Brother house, coming in over two months into the show's run with two other people due to multiple quits.  Unfortunately for her and the other newbies, they were outnumbered and the nomination voting would strongly reflect it as the house originals almost exclusively voted for the newer houseguests to keep them nominated.  Linda would survive her first trip to the block, but would be evicted the second time around with 63% of the vote in a one on one.  Perhaps starting the game could be better for her chances?

Alright, it's time to see how this collection of houseguests do in this latest edition of Big Brother World!  As usual, I have no seen the results myself, so I'm just as interested as you are to see who will come out on top!  The link to few the results is below!

I don’t eat anything that’s opened already (people double dip in their own homes, let’s be honest). 

Unless it’s bread, eggs or fruits.. I do my best to replace (ie open a package of cheese, I purchase it fresh at the end/same brand).

You can’t really know yourself until someone else sees you and puts it into words, because the way you see yourself is different from how others experience you. If you want to understand someone, you have to let them speak for you. That’s the truth. It’s like a mirror, but not the kind you look at, the kind someone else holds up for you. They’ll reflect what they see, but it’s more than just their perspective; it’s a combination of everything they’ve experienced with you, every little moment that made you who you are in their eyes. So, if you want to know who you really are, ask someone else how they’d describe you. You’ll get the raw version, the truth that you might never be able to see. So go ask all your friends, family, your local coffee shop cashier, anyone, and combine them with your thoughts and there you have it, you.",1,1731785401.0,u_Dry_Number_6326,0,1.0,False
1gsuyar,https://www.reddit.com/r/JDorama/comments/1gsuyar/should_tv_jdramas_not_bother_adapting_sexual_manga/,Should tv Jdramas not bother  adapting sexual manga?,"I’m kind of new to Asian dramas. I’ve read manga for a long so seeing some of them in live action shows and movies interested me. 

Something I noticed is they are so often very short and rushed through. They are often much more milder than the actual manga they are adapting. Especially if it’s a tv show. 

I noticed in Japanese films you can show A LOT more. Like Call Boy….the plot was good but they went more than all out for the sex scenes. 

Which I do have to ask. Why is it alright to show pretty much soft core porn in movies but they have so much limits on tv shows?

But anyway, should they really take the time to adopt sexual mangas for tv shows when they can’t really show anything sexual. 

An example being…Coffee and Vanilla. 

The manga is full of sex. Not just between the main characters but also two side characters. 

The sex is what got the manga so popular.

But in the show adaptation I believe there is one sex scene but it shows little to nothing. We see them in the bed with him on top of her and asking her to be brave enough to look at him. 

Other than that no more show sex scenes and only flirting and affection between the two main characters. 

The two side characters who are friends with benefits only has one kissing scene. 

So what is the point of adapting a manga famous for sex and then show little to none? 

I’m in no way trying to insult Jdramas. Again I am knew to all this. I’ve found some other great Asian dramas. Also I’m not saying sex has to be in a romance manga or live action adaptation to be good. 

My favorite is the Taiwanese version of Mars from 2004. I also loved the live action adaptation of The Black Devil and the White Prince.",2,1731785394.0,JDorama,3,1.0,False

I have tried to unscrew it using the proper wrench size and with some good leverage, but it did not bulged at all. I have not try to ""impact"" it by hitting the wrench with a with hammer (like you do to loosen tight bolts on your car ie), as I do not want to start breaking things in there. I have removed all panels, etc.. but I cannot get that thing off for the life of me ;(

Any tricks I should try before I contact a local coffee machine service center and pay them to do it?

The first week was life changing... like- crying because my brain was finally quiet and I could utilize my short term memory. I was only drinking 1 cup of coffee for the entire day and I was AWAKE. I was to the point of getting my thyroid tested because I was so exhausted and fatigued every day.

After 3 weeks, they feel like nothing. Now I have been given a second bottle of 10mg instant release to take around noon to keep me from crashing so hard at work. I'm back up to 2-3 energy drinks & a lot of nicotine daily to stay awake & focused. 

My doctor initially planned on pushing me up to 20mg after starting me on a baby dose of 10mg, is this going to happen again?

I don't take breaks because I'm a student and I need to study on the weekends. I also have such bad memory problems that if I don't take it, I won't remember to do assignments, tests, take care of the pets, etc.

I know that the first few days are euphoric, but I'm disappointed that it feels like taking a sugar pill now. What do you guys think? Will the increase to 20mg make me feel good again long-term or should I be taking breaks to keep my tolerance under control?

I also have a mood disorder & depression on top of ADHD and the Adderall helps with my emotion regulation & rational thinking, so I don't really want to miss doses if I don't need to.",1,1731785101.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I work with kids/teens who struggle with mental health and behavioral concerns. That being said, while I do enjoy listening, I’d like to point out that I am not a therapist. So, please don’t message me if you just need someone to talk to.  

Things I look for in a significant other: I want someone kinda nerdy/geeky, someone who enjoys traveling, staying in shape (or close to), someone that enjoy a lazy day watching movies or going out for dinner and drinks. I’m typically attracted to younger guys. Must enjoy hugs/cuddles. Must have a good sense of humor. 

Disclaimer: I may like younger guys but please respect that I don’t want to be called daddy. This is because one of the things I want most in this world are kids and much like saying I love you, I won’t use it lightly.

","So as the title states, I am at a complete loss with my child and I don’t know what to do. Any advice helps. 

My partner and I have been together for a year, and we both brought children into the relationship. He has a two-year-old daughter and I have a six-year-old son. This past summer my son‘s behaviour has gotten completely out of control. I took him to the doctors and he got diagnosed with ADHD, and it was recommended I get him on a wait list to be tested for autism so I did that as well and we’re still waiting. In the meantime, I got him signed up for therapy, and we still haven’t heard back from them either I will be calling later today. 
Anyways, the behaviour ranged from stealing food, candy, ice cream. Drawing on the walls, stealing out of my purse, destroying his and my partner‘s daughter‘s toys, extreme temper tantrums, screaming, kicking, hitting himself, etc. 

As I said, we tried to get him set up with therapy , we tried doing star charts and rewards. We removed all the candy/sweets from our house. Tried doing daily walks to new parks to get some energy out, got him signed up for summer swimming, we took away TV eventually, tried timeouts, having conversations every day about what we’ve been feeling. And I’ll admit after an extreme temper tantrum after he got caught stealing, he got a spanking. I thought that some of the things were working and then School started and we haven’t had issues since the end of summer. About a week and a half ago, though the behaviour started up again. 

I get that kids go through phases, but I have no idea why. He was stealing candy and shoving it under his bed. Which I didn’t understand because as it was just Halloween, we’ve been giving him two candies a day, he gets to pick one in his lunch and he gets to pick one after dinner. After we found out about the stealing, we told him that there was no TV for the next two days. The next day he was playing in the living room found a pen under the couch and drew all over the coffee table as I was doing the dishes in the next room. We made him scrub the table and said that was another day of no TV and no Halloween candy. The next day I was taking a shower he came out of his room, pulled the thumbtack out of the wall and carved a drawing into the TV. My partner rightfully lost it and gave him a time out we said he was gonna start doing chores to earn money that would go towards fixing the TV. And he has lost TV and his Halloween candy indefinitely. 

I told my partner that I would leave early as we were spending the kids fall break together as daycare and school are closed and I was helping watch both the kids but school opens up again on Tuesday. He asked me not to leave and I told him that if things were on my side, I don’t know if I’d be able to handle it and I don’t understand why he wants us to stay. He gets angry to the point that he shakes, he’ll go for 40 minute walks, but he’ll beg us not to leave. I feel like I’m doing everything that I possibly can, but still failing as a parent and I feel as though we are just a burden on my partner. On top of that with his two year-old daughter, it’s always “she’s an angel, she’s so smart, kind, funny and she’s not gunna turn out like your kiddo” and that crushes my soul and at times I feel resentful towards his child for always getting praise even with her pushing, hitting and extreme temper tantrums but not a positive said about my child. He says I love you every night before bed and he always says even if I’m mad atleast he knows I still love him. 

I don’t know what to do about my child , I don’t know what to do in my relationship. It has always just been me and my son and my therapist told me that he’s probably struggling with sharing me with another child and partner now on top of the mental health struggles that he has. I am just at a loss and I hope I don’t get shamed for this, but I struggle to feel connected to my child when he acts like this. Seven months ago, everyone said he was the most polite and kind child theyd ever met, they loved spending time with him and now it’s a struggle every single day. I’m just so lost and I feel like a terrible mother and I just don’t know what to do. Any advice? ",1,1731784342.0,stepparents,4,0.67,False

1gsuhwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1gsuhwg/story_time_coffee_shop_and_big_egos_how_to_kombat/,"Story time. (Coffee shop and big egos, how to KoMbat bad behavior?)","Had a very unpleasant interaction on my ride today. I arrived at a coffee shop, which is on a very popular cycling route. There is also a national park nearby, so many visitors and tourists in the area; usually, the spot is reasonably busy. As I arrive, I notice that there are quite a few bikes parked around the courtyard of the coffee shop. I don't pay much attention to who's where and doing what, but I find an out-of-the-way spot to park my bike, hang my helmet on the bars, and head to the counter to order a coffee and a snack.

FYI, there are no waiters here; you order from a counter with a barista and grab your stuff when it's ready and head to an open table or seat. So, as I am waiting in the queue, my ears are piqued by a conversation happening at a nearby table. It's a bunch of 50-something cyclists in matching team kits with some mild paunches, but mostly look like they could put down some power on a bike. You know the type. What grabbed my attention was that I specifically heard a few racist slurs pop out in their conversation, but as I started paying attention, it was my turn to order, so I lost the gist of what they were saying.

Anyway, I got my coffee and snack and headed back to the tabled area to find a seat. At this point, I notice that there are 7 guys sitting at one table chatting (team kit guys), one old timer in a bright high-vis jacket and helmet sitting at an adjacent table, and a family of 5 sitting at the next table over. At the 4th and final table, which also happens to be closest to the wall where most of the bikes are parked, there is a red Specialized bike leaning against the table and 4 helmets laying on top. The only other seats are 2 benches, also occupied by leaning bikes, and 2 small tables with high chairs that are a bit awkward when wearing road shoes with cleats.

So I go over to the table with the older guy and ask if I may join him. He doesn't seem too happy or inviting, but doesn't object either, so I have a seat and pull my phone out to have a look at messages, etc. After a minute or so, the guy asks me what is written on the back of my jersey. He was obviously a foreigner, so I assumed maybe a tourist, but I thought this was an odd question, especially since I was sure there was nothing written on my jersey. It's a plain olive green color with no obvious markings except for a small logo on the chest.

He insists there is something and points at the guys at the other table. Now I realize he thinks I am with them. Their kit is also an oliveish green with some striping and writing on it - the name of their club. As I realize this, I explain that I am not with them and read out the club name for him. He doesn't seem very impressed at all now and still says that I have the same shirt. I shrug and say that yes, it does have a resemblance in color.

I now keep eating and sip my coffee. At this point, more people enter the coffee area and ask myself and the old guy if the bike and the helmets belong to us. We both say no, not us. He gets up to leave and briefly asks me for some directions, confirming that he doesn't live in the area. He seems to have warmed to me a bit, and we say cheers and have a nice ride.

A lady from the new group asks if they could take the spot where the old guy had been. I say of course, and I tell them I will be leaving shortly as well, so the table is theirs. I finish my coffee and snack and get ready to leave. Now I really am aware that there is not enough seating going around for everyone arriving, and that one entire table is still occupied by a bike and a few helmets.

As I get up to go, I am annoyed by the situation, but also really not keen for a confrontation. I generally am a bit anti-social, and I especially don't like groups. However, I steel myself and go up to the group. I ask if the bike belongs to them? Yes. I politely ask if they could park it somewhere else because there are no more tables available. The owner immediately jumps up and, in a friendly manner, says certainly and goes over to move his bike.

Now I think, that wasn't so bad, they aren't so bad. I go over to the alcove where I put my bike and get my stuff ready to head out. 

As I push through the courtyard, I notice that the helmets are still on the table. Now I stop. What should I do? The group is mid-some funny story, guys are laughing and talking loudly. I go over to them again and say that the helmets are still there. They don't hear me, and none of them look at me. I wait. I walk away a bit, but then went back and said loudly, ""The helmets as well."" Dead quiet. They all turn to look at me. One guy says, ""Relax, man."" Now, I am feeling a bit stressed, because I didn't want to be in this situation.

I say that people need that table. Now one guy tells me to fuck off. I start moving away a bit, and I try to clip my foot into a pedal, but I'm a bit flustered. They're still looking at me, and someone is going off about what's my problem, and I'm struggling with the cleat, so I just stare back at them. One of them has a chuckle. Finally, my foot locks in, and I say the only thing that comes to mind: ""Just a bunch of old cunts."" One of them stood up at this, so I rolled out of there.

As I left the parking lot and came past the front of the coffee shop, I saw they were standing and shouting at me. Someone said something about leaving my name to settle it later. I also noticed that the helmets had been moved. Now my adrenaline was pumping, I felt flushed and angry, so there was no chill to my ride after that. I was basically in high Z4 for the next hour and went through all of my water. I also kept looking over my shoulder, worried that they would come after me. A few of them were on e-bikes, so a real possibility of getting caught.

I don't really know what I expected would happen if they did, but whatever. I finally stopped under a tree on a little side road and sat down on the ground. I was cooked. Five minutes later, their team came through, going at a mad pace. Maybe they were chasing me, maybe not? Anyway, I looked up their club. They ride for the company they work for, a real estate agency. So now I have their names from the club on Strava and their employer details. A part of me really wants to make a complaint, but I also don't want to get into a bad situation where they come after me. They all seem rich, and I am young and can barely afford the bike I ride, nevermind any potential blowback that comes from some hurt egos.

It just annoys me that they were in the wrong, but I am still stewing on this and feeling disrupted by the encounter. 

Tl;dr: Some middle-aged cycling real estate agents behave like stereotypical asshole cyclists. Makes a scene in coffee shop.

1gsub5i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsub5i,Should I get Flair 58 when I have Robot?,"I initially joined this coffee game to save money. You know how they charge you more on pour overs than americanos at coffee shops. Pour over kits were pretty affordable, had an ordinary single setting grinder from Amazon. I was pretty happy with that less than $100 setup. I enjoyed even more knowing every cup saves me like $4, and I drank twice a day so :)

Then I got married. My wife has been a great supporter in whatever I do, but especially on coffee making since that's something we both enjoy drinking. I was a simple human being so drinking pour overs again and again didn't bother me at all. My wife is into trying out different things, not drinking the same coffee two days in a row type of person. So from time to time, we visited local coffee shop to get espresso drinks, something we couldn't make at home. Meanwhile, she gifted me Fellow Ode to ditch my cheap Amazon grinder. I felt it would take some time to justify that grinder price, but tasting the difference Ode was making, I was mind blown, and started to really enjoy different notes beans had.

Then we went to Italy for our honeymoon (it took us about a year after wedding), and there I tried to mimic Italians drinking espresso. Surprisingly, many places I went to sold Americano (probably due to most of travelers being Americans there??) but I sticked with what locals drink. Espresso was bitter, but I liked the kick and strong aroma it gave, and had a subtle difference compared to pour overs. I liked it. When we were back, we started making moka pot coffee. I still wasn't ready for the coffee machines and all that. Also Ode was capable of grinding fine enough for moka pot (when upgraded to v2 burr set). We enjoyed espresso from moka pot, and my wife liked it so much for her milk drinks. Also around this time, I started following coffee making in Reddit, YouTube, trying to stick to the best recipe, best practices, modern style etc. It became the biggest hobby of my life by this time.

Then I got into manual lever espresso machines. I liked the fact that it's so small but mighty. But I realized, they need espresso grinder, which all together was a big price huddle for me, who thought making coffee at home was for saving money. But I was just so into them, especially watching many videos of them. So I got Cafelat Robot last year, with 1ZPresso manual grinder. Two made a great combo, the only thing was making coffee for 2+ people took me more than 30, 40 minutes, and a lot of labor grinding.

So I got an electric grinder, finally, and since these machines you use for ages, I bought a good one, Niche Duo. This saved me tons of time, tons of effort not needing to manually grind. At this point, I let go of the mindset that I would financially benefit from making coffees at home. I've been adding/ trying out many different tools for my Robot. Going to hardware store to check out new cups became another hobby. At this point, it probably costed me almost $2k for all the setups. But I've been happy.

When I was looking at which manual lever machine to buy, I was comparing between Flair 58 vs Cafelat Robot, but didn't like how Flair 58 had messy cords. But hey, did you guys see the new Flair 58 plus 2? It's gorgeous piece, with immensely improved power supply + cord part. I've been also pulling light roasts a lot lately, and saw many mentioning Flair 58 for light roast and Robot for Medium to Dark roasts.

Man... should I get it..? Where will this trip lead me to? I am happy but will I be happier with Flair 58?

We all know how overwhelming it can be to try and absorb ALL that tax law and audit material. You’ve got the flashcards, the notes, the coffee—everything you need, right? But somehow, reading quietly just isn’t cutting it.

Here’s a little hack: speak it out loud. It might feel weird at first, but trust me, it works. That’s the whole point of *active recall*—you actively engage with the material, forcing your brain to work harder, which leads to better retention.

Just check out the meme I’ve attached. The first panel is all of us at some point, sitting in silence, trying to will the material into our brains. The second panel? That’s the magic of talking it through. Saying it out loud, explaining it to yourself like you're giving a presentation—it makes a huge difference.

**Bottom line: Speak it to learn it. CPA exam material is tough, but speaking out loud makes you retain it better and makes study sessions more effective.**

So, if you’re tired of silently staring at your flashcards, give this a try. Grab your flashcard deck, or use a flashcard app that lets you speak answers out loud, and feel that info finally *stick*.

Anyone else here tried the ""speak it out loud"" method for CPA studying? How has it worked for you? Let’s help each other make studying a bit less painful!

>The job of having to soften up the brick every day, the job of cleaving a passage through the glutinous mass that declares itself to be the world, to collide every morning with the same narrow rectangular space with the disgusting name, filled with doggy satisfaction that everything is probably in its place, the same woman beside you, the same shoes, the same taste of the same toothpaste, the same sad houses across the street, the filthy slats on the shutters with the inscription THE HOTEL BELGIUM.

>Drive the head like a reluctant bull through the transparent mass at the center of which we take a coffee with milk and open the newspaper to find out what has happened in whatever corner of that glass brick. Go ahead, deny up and down that the delicate act of turning the doorknob, that act which may transform everything, is done with the indifferent vigor of a daily reflex. See you later, sweetheart. Have a good day.

>Tighten your fingers around a teaspoon, feel its metal pulse, its mistrustful warning. How it hurts to refuse a spoon, to say no to a door, to deny everything that habit has licked to a suitable smoothness. How much simpler to accept the easy request of the spoon, to use it, to stir the coffee.

>And it’s not that it’s so bad that things meet us every day and are the same. That the same woman is there beside us, the same watch, that the novel lying open there on the table starts once more to take its bicycle ride through our glasses. What could be wrong with that? But like a sad bull, one has to lower the head, hustle out from the middle of the glass brick toward the one nearest us, who is as unattainable as the picador, however close the bull is to him. Punish the eyes looking at that which passes in the sky and cunningly accept that its name is cloud, its answer catalogued in the mind. Don’t believe that the telephone is going to give you the numbers you try to call, why should it? The only thing that will come is what you have already prepared and decided, the gloomy reflection of your expectations, that monkey, who scratches himself on the table and trembles with cold. Break that monkey’s head, take a run from the middle of the room to the wall and break through it. Oh, how they sing upstairs! There’s an apartment upstairs in this house with other people in it. A floor upstairs where people live who don’t know there’s a downstairs floor and that all of us live in the glass brick. And if suddenly a moth lands on the edge of a pencil and flutters there like an ash-colored flame, look at it, I am looking at it, I am touching its tiny heart and I hear it, that moth reverberates in the pie dough of frozen glass, all is not lost. When the door opens and I lean over the stairwell, I’ll know that the street begins down there; not the already accepted matrix, not the familiar houses, not the hotel across the street: the street, that busy wilderness which can tumble upon me like a magnolia any minute, where the faces will come to life when I look at them, when I go just a little bit further, when I smash minutely against the pie dough of the glass brick and stake my life while I press forward step by step to go pick up the newspaper at the corner.",3,1731783522.0,RSbookclub,0,1.0,False

1gsu815,https://i.redd.it/yzisdfla9b1e1.jpeg,What are the Potential Benefits of Napping?,"The Potential Benefits and Drawbacks of Napping for Productivity and 
Mental Health
Napping is no longer just for toddlers or exhausted college students. With the rise of remote work, sneaking in a midday nap has become more feasible—and socially acceptable—than ever before. But does napping truly enhance productivity and mental health, or is it a soft invitation to laziness? Let’s explore its benefits, drawbacks, and practical considerations, including whether you should tell your boss about your naptime.

The Benefits of Napping
1. Enhanced Cognitive Function
Research consistently shows that naps improve memory, problem-solving skills, and creativity. For example, NASA found that a 26-minute nap boosted pilot alertness by 54% and enhanced performance by 34%. If a quick snooze is good enough for astronauts, it might just work for your spreadsheets.

This is especially helpful in the remote work era, where extended screen time can drain mental stamina. With no commute and flexible schedules, working from home opens the door to reclaiming your energy through short, strategic naps.

Fun Fact: Salvador Dalí famously napped while holding a spoon. The moment it dropped, he woke up feeling refreshed and ready to paint surreal masterpieces. 

2. Stress Relief and Emotional Regulation
A well-timed nap can lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and improve mood. This makes it particularly valuable in high-pressure environments, whether you’re dealing with Zoom fatigue or tight deadlines. If you’re feeling irritable or overwhelmed, a nap can act as a mental reset button, leaving you calmer and more focused.

3. Increased Energy and Performance
Remote workers often experience an afternoon slump, usually between 1 PM and 3 PM. Instead of relying on coffee or sugary snacks, a short nap can provide a natural energy boost without the risk of caffeine jitters. For those with irregular schedules or demanding workloads, a nap might be the most productive choice.

4. Better Adaptation to Remote Work Schedules
Remote work has revolutionized the traditional 9-to-5. Without the rigid office structure, many workers now have the freedom to experiment with their daily routines—and napping is an increasingly popular option. This flexibility allows you to align rest periods with your body’s natural rhythms, enhancing productivity throughout the day.

The Drawbacks of Napping
1. Sleep Inertia
Waking up from a nap can sometimes feel worse than not napping at all. This groggy, disoriented state—called sleep inertia—is most likely to occur if your nap extends into deeper stages of sleep. Sleep inertia can impair your focus and productivity, making it critical to keep naps short and sweet.

2. Disrupted Nighttime Sleep
Long naps or late-afternoon snoozes can interfere with nighttime sleep quality. If you’re already prone to insomnia, napping too close to bedtime can make it harder to fall or stay asleep. To avoid this, limit naps to the early afternoon and stick to a duration of 20–30 minutes.

3. Social Perceptions and Productivity Guilt
Even in the era of remote work, napping may feel indulgent or unproductive to some. This stigma might make you hesitate to incorporate naps into your daily routine, especially if you worry about how it will appear to colleagues or managers.

Should You Tell the People at Work?
If you’re working remotely, you might wonder whether it’s appropriate to be upfront about your nap habit. The answer depends on your workplace culture and relationship with your team.

When to Share
If your company encourages wellness initiatives or flexible schedules, sharing your napping routine might even inspire others to prioritize their own well-being.
Be transparent about how naps contribute to your productivity. For instance: “Taking a quick power nap helps me stay sharp for the second half of the day.”

When to Keep It Private
If your workplace has a traditional or rigid culture, it might be best to keep your naps off the radar.
Use flexible time blocks on your calendar or simply step away without announcing, ""BRB, nap time!"" Your focus and productivity will likely speak for themselves.

Pro Tip: If questioned, frame your nap habit as a productivity strategy rather than a luxury. Something like: “I find that a short break to recharge helps me work more effectively.”

How to Nap Effectively
Nap Durations and Their Benefits
10–20 minutes: Ideal for a quick energy boost without grogginess.
30 minutes: Great for moderate recovery, but may cause sleep inertia.
90 minutes: A full sleep cycle, useful for creativity and memory consolidation.

Timing Is Everything
The best time to nap is during the early afternoon (1 PM–3 PM). This aligns with your body’s natural circadian dip in alertness and avoids interfering with nighttime sleep.

Optimizing Your Nap Environment
Create a quiet, dark space to relax fully. Use noise-canceling headphones or an eye mask if needed.
Ensure you’re in a comfortable position, whether it’s on a couch, bed, or even a recliner.
Consider a “caffeine nap”: Drink a cup of coffee before lying down for 20 minutes. You’ll wake up feeling doubly refreshed as the caffeine kicks in.

Conclusion: Is Napping Right for You?
Napping is a game-changer for many, particularly for remote workers who have the flexibility to integrate it into their day. While the benefits of napping for productivity and mental health are well-documented, success depends on doing it right—keeping naps short, well-timed, and framed as a productivity tool rather than a guilty pleasure.

As for whether to share your napping habit at work, let company culture and personal judgment guide you. In most cases, a well-rested brain is your best defense.

# Why I am Childfree

I believe in focusing on personal growth, enjoying life to the fullest, and building a meaningful relationship without the responsibilities of raising children. And I do have all those common reasons that most us have  for being childfree ( overpopulation, crippling infrastructure, etc. ). I am **not** a fence sitter. My parents know about my childfree stance and they are okay with it.

# Expectations from the partner

I’m looking for someone who has committed to the childfree lifestyle and is not a fence sitter. I prefer a Hindu girl so that we can celebrate the festivals together.

1gsu73k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1gsu73k/how_do_i_get_over_a_christian_man_at_church_that/,How do I get over a Christian man at church that I've fallen for but isn't interested in pursuing me? ,"I've posted here about this experience with an older man I became interested in, but I feel in a really tough place right now emotionally and in fellowship. I feel like he awoke a desire in me and now I don't know what to do with this after being rejected and hurt.

I'm 33 and he's 47. I've been apart of my single's ministry for 3 years now and I have a lot of friends, and admittedly a lot of other guys who are interested in me. I'm not trying to be prideful about it, but even this week another guy friend asked me to hang out and asked me again yesterday. Another friend has shown interest and asked me out. It's just that I'm not interested in them, and in the past and in the world I would date guys just because they were pursuing me. Now I try to be more careful, discerning and disciplined in keeping boundaries.

As for this man, I never connected with him initially myself. He started attending our ministry in January and immediately gravitated toward me. I was briefly dating another guy at the time (outside our ministry), and so definitely kept my distance from him when he'd engage with me. I didn't even remember his name for the first few months lol, but when I became single I was more open to conversation with him. Since July, there were multiple bible studies where he'd engage with me and we'd talk the whole time after the study. We also serve together on our events team. I really love serving with him and have done outreach with him. That's what made me start to become more interested in him. He'd always be around me and gravitate toward me. If others are around while we're serving, it's always me he just engages with and asks me about my life or tells me about his.

About a couple months ago we were texting (I always engaged with him first over text but have stopped since he rejected me), and he asked me if I'd want to go to the movies since he had a couple free tickets. I had work so I couldn't and said I'd love to go the following weekend. He responded with ""maybe but only if you're good 😇"" which I took as flirting, on top of the fact he was asking me to hang out one on one. I don't go to the movies even with my guy friends, so I took it as more than just friendship. I flirted back and said ""only for you"" which he didn't respond to.

The following bible study, he didn't engage with me and then pretended like he didn't see me. I texted him and said ""so no to the movies?"" he responded he didn't see me (which couldn't be possible) and that if I don't want to be his friend anymore that's okay. I thought it was odd, and just told him I like him and I'm confused.

I continued to still engage with him at our studies and serving, during bible study he always sits near me and I often notice him staring at me, or he'll try to connect with me in small ways if I'm talking to other friends. I don't see him doing that with other people, it's always just with me. Random things like ""cheers"" if we're both holding a coffee or something.

Anyways, I've always been honest and open with him. I told him I was interested in him over text about a month and a half ago. He didn't respond for almost 24 hours and told me he'd see me at bible study and sent me a 😉. Then I tried a couple weeks later to address it again, and I told him I didn't feel like he was trying to get to know me as much as I was, so I'd willingly back off. He told me then he appreciates my friendship but that's all he's interested in. I said fine and we can be friends, I'll always be cordial and respect him. We have remained on good terms, he still gravitates toward me and talks with me while serving. I still feel he's attracted to me, but it's just weird I don't get why he pulls away or what's blocking him.

About 3 weeks ago, another new girl started coming to our study. My discernment went off instantly when I saw her because she began trying to engage with him. He's been entertaining it and from what I know about her is she's looking for a husband and dates a lot. Last night we had a friendsgiving and I was pretty busy talking with other friends, I don't try to give him my attention anymore but he of course made comments toward me like about boots that I was wearing with a dress and when we went to play a trivia game, he came over and asked if I was able to log on. He then sat down near me, but after the game was over this girl was sitting in front of him and he immediately started talking to her. She was sitting across the table and leaning over into him. He was looking at her bible and I'm not sure what they were talking about, but she had puppy dog eyes of course. He's a pretty attractive guy and so it's understandable. But it really hurt and I ended up just leaving. He sat and talked with her for about 30 mins before I left.

My problem is, I've tried my best to ignore my feelings, stop engaging with him or entertaining it. He knows how I felt and it hurts to see him just go onto the next girl. The hardest part is I genuienly have a lot of friends there and that's why I go, for fellowship. But it's hard when I have these feelings. My pastor even knows I was interested in him and he told me to be patient, I haven't talked to him lately about it but I feel really discouraged and downcast.

Was this guy just playing with me? How do I handle this and still remain in fellowship? Or do I just back away until I can get over this? I feel like I'm definitely being attacked by the enemy, when I would be talking to this guy multiple people interrupt us, even during our last study a couple weeks ago I was talking with him, and that same girl came into our conversation so I removed myself then as well. But they sat they're chatting and uninterrupted the whole time. Another woman who's around his age pulled me aside one night when we went to eat and asked me if he invited me to serve with a ministry she's seen us at (he didn't) and then asked me if him and I were dating. So our connection wasn't just in my head, other people have noticed it. I want a husband just like this new girl does, but am patiently waiting for the right guy. I thought it was him. I've tried to keep my head up but feel really sad about it all, and it's hard to stay in fellowship with him there.",2,1731783372.0,Christianmarriage,5,0.75,False

1gsu2y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1gsu2y9/as_the_dead_sleep_completion_2024/,As The Dead Sleep completion 2024,"Just finished this challenge, all in all it was one of my favourites (ignore the less than a minute record, I was one of many who had it bugged as completed in my list after one of the updates).

Some thoughts and tips, for the 2024 loot locations. My route was the standard, BI-FM-BR-FM-Milton-HRV-Milton-ML-Ravine-CH-DP-CH-PV-TM

* map knowledge is absolutely essential, plan your route, keep the journey as efficient as possible, only venture off track for essential looting. I hit the whale processing center in desolation point, looted Milton, and cleared the dam, but other than that I only hit buildings and loot locations that were on the way. The one exception to this is the Hunters Lodge in BR. There is a stim here, and enough food to stay for a day or two, and recover your fatigue. Cars are barely worth your time, with maybe gloves, and food very rarely, so don't bother with them at the cost of condition.
* For the new food items, you'll find flour, oil, and oatmeal, in Hunter's lodge, Milton, and a few other spots. Get your cooking up to 2 quickly with shrooms and hips, and proceed to watch your food requirements disappear as you feast on bannock and oats. Keep in mind these don't have much of a shelf life so carry crackers and other long life items, and eat cooked items immediately after creation. Coffee saved my run, in a long trip that I got caught in bad weather in the ravine, brew it and carry it all.
* I didn't have a bedroll until the dam, and I got so used to sleeping in locations with beds that I didn't use it. Stims are far more essential to your run than a bedroll, and to the first point, you can plan your route between sleep areas. I also never found flare shells, maybe bad RNG in the ravine basin, but I survived without them. I won't admit to carrying the empty flare gun around for the entire run, definitely wouldn't do something that dumb...
* to the stim point, I found 5. Hunters Lodge, The ravine bottom in the rail car, The dam in the area near where you get locked out, and in pleasant valley, I forget which building but near the community center. The last one I also didn't keep track of, but i had three left when i finished. Don't hoard them, use them to recover condition and then sleep, keep one or two for emergency rope climbs (of which I only had four, coffee got me through 3 of them) or blizzard runs to shelter.
* GET THE HELL OUT OF BLEAK INLET AND FORLORN MUSKEG ASAP. As other guides say, book it out of here without delay. If you're comfortable with the cannery you should be able to find a couple flares for the wolves, but I lost a run to them and an unfortunate blizzard shortly after. Arguably, it's not worth your time here. From the lighthouse, hit the cabin and the fishing hut (grab cloth from the cabin can make sure all your limbs are covered), book it under the bridge (or above if the bear is nearby, again, cars likely won't be worth your time), go straight to the washed out trailers, then beeline for the exit cave. Same with the muskeg, grab as many cattails as you can as the early food in this run will be scarce. In regards to the muskeg, knowing the shortcut to marsh ridge is helpful, particularly when the weather takes a turn on your way to Milton.
* Once you're in Mountain Town, the rest of the run is a breeze. Sleep at the crashed truck in the basin by the waterfall (be on moose watch here), and climb the rope to the farm. Use a stim here before the rope if required, will help with condition and should get you right to the farm as you can run directly to it (don't forget the key) after the climb. At this point you should have and maintain your well fed bonus, and your diet of mostly cattails can become more diverse.
* For the rest of the run, as with interloper, travel in the afternoon - to mid night time, whenever the weather is good. Fog is your friend as it won't turn into a surprise blizzard, as long as you know your way. Chain torches, and save flares for wolves, keep your heated buff up, and make fires whenever you get down to about a quarter of your warmth bar left. ALWAYS CARRY AT LEAST 10 COAL WITH YOU. It will be worth it's weight in gold, and you should always be finding more in the transitions you'll be passing. When the weather is too poor for travel, fix your clothes. A good place to do this is grey mothers, or the Quonset garage, as you'll be passing by them twice, alternatively the whale processing plant is great, as you can harvest the wood inside during the day from chairs and whatnot. Followed by making a nighttime fire in the outside storage area that is protected from all sides.
* Enjoy the run, it's really not that bad after the intro. If you have something go sideways before Milton, don't be afraid to restart. I tried to salvage a run after a wolf got me in BR, and died to a fall from a panicked blizzard fall of about three feet.

- cafe au lait at Cafe Agaru in Kyoto 
 
Overall I had a great experience, I got to talk to so many knowledgeable baristas/roasters throughout my trip and it really opened my eyes to the possibilities of tasting profiles that coffee can have! 

The most mind-blowing coffee I had was at Barista Map. The pour over had so much depth and brightness, and the strawberry blend really tasted like strawberries but not in terms of sweetness- just pure *strawberry* if that makes any sense at all. 

My favourite latte was at All Seasons. Just a no frills, smooth, tasty latte. The pudding was the real star of the show though. 

Koffee Mameya Kakeru had the most interesting drink by far. It was a “mocktail” using their milk brew mixed with some type of vinegar- it’s the drink in the black cup with the mini “cream puff” next to it. The whole process of it was so interesting. The vinegar caused curdling, which was then filtered out and used to create the “coffee cheese” in the mini cream puff. It was sweet, and fruity, and didn’t even really tasted like coffee by the end of it but it was so delicious and interesting to see coffee used that way. 

I don’t think I had a bad cup of coffee during my whole trip. I can’t wait to go back and try even more! ",1,1731782987.0,coffeejp,0,1.0,False

*Lost Media, Now Found:*

*Excerpt from Strange Worlds, 1980. Found in an abandoned and derelict two-story home outside of Atlanta, Georgia.*

*Written by Ben Nakamura*

***Calculated Temporal Dissonance***\*: 6%. Increased from previously analyzed media.\*

On August 23rd, 1968, at approximately 11AM, two middle-aged American men walked into the lobby of a hotel in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. The taller of the two men greeted the concierge sitting behind the desk, a grizzled older gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth and a scar over the bridge of his nose. He informed the concierge that they had a room booked and would be staying for three nights. The lobby was large and cavernous - a 3,000 square ft. floor plan with a slightly curved ceiling rising three stories above the two Americans. It was converted from a chapel into a hotel in the early 60s. Other than the Americans and the concierge, only two additional people were present in the lobby: another guest, a strapping young Brazilian man in a buttoned-down shirt, and the hotel's elderly custodian. The young Brazilian man was a patron of the hotel, sitting opposite the concierge's desk near a weakly spinning table fan, coffee in hand, and reading a newspaper. The custodian was seated at the same table as the young Brazilian man, chatting and waiting for the arrival of a maintenance worker. The shorter American excused himself to the restroom while the other got them both checked in. When he returned from the restroom, the taller American handed him a set of keys. As he did, he noticed the custodian was leering at the shorter of the travelers, his face contorted into an expression that relayed both confusion and anger. The custodian watched intently as the two men walked across the lobby and disappeared into the elevator. 

The Americans paced down the fifth-floor hallway to locate their rooms, 508 and 522. Although they were not adjoining as was requested, they decided not to bother the concierge by reporting this error, who had already been noticeably curt with the taller man while he was formally paying for the rooms. The shorter American entered 508, clutching the side of his head and informing his colleague he would like to rest. The taller American nodded and wordlessly strolled approximately eighty yards to his hotel room, intending to get a head start on work. 

Not more than an hour later, the taller American was startled by a wild flurry of knocks on the door of 522. A little jittery from surprise, he made his way toward the noise as the thunderstorm crashing into the dense wooden door only became more violent. Unsure of what he was about to encounter, he carefully pocketed a revolver into his suit jacket and looked through the peephole, nearly deafened by the abrupt onset of frenzied and incoherent shouting from the other side. It took him a moment to recognize the shorter American through the peephole through curtains of blood that had been drawn across his face. 

As he fearfully twisted the knob, the shorter American spilled into his room. As he passed, the taller American peeked his head cautiously outside the doorframe, not seeing anyone in either direction. When he turned back into the room, it became apparent that his friend had not been attacked by anyone- the damage was self-inflicted. He watched his colleague clawing at his head, haphazardly dragging splintered nails through ragged skin in short, savage bursts. The taller American tried to elicit the root cause of his colleague's erupting madness, but he could barely bring himself to form a coherent sentence, let alone shout it at a volume louder than the other man's screaming in the heat of the moment. The taller American gestured in a pleading motion for his colleague to explain what was going on, unaware that he had removed his left hand from his jacket pocket, which was still absent-mindedly clutching his sidearm. With a movement that the taller American recounted as simultaneously feral and strategic, the raving man placed his right hand over the hand holding the gun, pulled it up until it was level with his forehead, and then used his thumb to overpower his friend's index finger into the trigger, causing it to fire.

Why was the shorter American dead? Maybe, more critically, what had caused this chain of events to happen?

Feels like a riddle, right? A puzzle that could be solved with logic and intuition? Like some new age version of *""There is a farmer, and he must transport a fox, a goose and a bag of beans across the river on a raft, but the fox can't be with the goose because they'll eat it, and the goose can't be with the beans because they'll eat it…""* et cetera, et cetera. Ask your father or middle school philosophy teacher to explain that mind teaser if you've never heard it before. Don't write in and ask me - I only know the premise of the thought exercise, barely at that.

Perhaps a better comparison is this: the story of the two American men in Brazil feels like the cold opening of a particularly violent Agatha Christie novel. The mysterious pieces are laid bare for examination before the story begins in earnest - with a solution to the puzzle hidden just below the surface, waiting for a detective with a keen eye and keener wit to put it all together. Unfortunately, life does not unfold so thoughtfully. According to the story's narrator, Elliot Pierce, there would have been no possible way for him to have detected and prevented what transpired that day.

I sat down with Mr. Pierce, otherwise known as the Tall American, and his interpreter this week, and my, what a tangled web he wove. And if what he tells me is to be believed, I happen to agree with him - it was an unsolvable mystery from the jump. But that assumes this man's story is truthful. So, instead of asking you all, dear readers, to crack this riddle before the inevitable reveals, I ask you this instead - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? 

*""We were ambassadors, not spies.""* recounted Elliot through his interpreter. ""Our business in the area was purely economic - part of a larger effort to keep lines of trade open between America and Brazil. Throughout the sixties and into the early seventies, JFK and his administration did their damndest to maintain a healthy foreign policy; we were just a small piece of that.  I have no idea why we were targeted with that weapon. I try to keep myself from wondering too hard - sometimes I can feel a stroke coming on when I get too fixated on trying to make it all make sense."" 

Somberly, Elliot continued his recollection of the events that followed the gunshot. He couldn't tell me how long he was standing motionless in front of Greg Fields's corpse, AKA the shorter American. Still, given the commotion, he couldn't imagine it was more than a few minutes before his trance was interrupted by the arrival of other hotelgoers to 522, looking to determine the source of the explosive disturbance. When he was found, he was sitting at a small table with a single chair across from Greg. Elliot doesn't recall going from standing to sitting - most of the details immediately after the gunshot, apparently, are lost to him. The body had fallen backward onto the room's cot, and Mr. Pierce seemingly couldn't pull his eyes from the sight of it all. Eventually, though, he was pulled away - manually, by a Brazilian police officer, letting Elliot know in a language he did not understand that he was under arrest for murder. He was still clutching the revolver in his hand when he was first discovered.

At the police station, he was able to put in a call to his contacts in the US. They let Elliot know that a lawyer and some additional members of his department would be deployed ASAP to Brazil. In the meantime, Elliot was, thankfully, not interrogated too harshly. Although this crime had occurred on Brazilian soil, from the cop's perspective, no South American citizens were involved. As long as Elliot remained calm during detainment, the police were in no rush to spend resources determining his guilt or innocence. They'd leave it to the Americans.

""It wasn't nearly as bad as I initially feared,"" Elliot relayed, although his eyes betrayed a lingering pain that seemed discordant with the words coming from his interpreter. 

""The guards, at the least the ones that knew a little English, were kind to me. In a moment of suffocating boredom, they even provided me with a pencil and a book of crossword puzzles from my suitcase. Looking back, it is very surreal. That act of hospitality saved my life.""

In the five days before his American counterparts arrived in Brazil, Elliot would have only one visitor. He did not know this man - nor did he recognize him from the hotel. He was not the concierge, the custodian, or the muscular young Brazilian.

""He first caught my attention arguing with the guards outside my cell. He didn't look Brazilian; he looked American - medium build, blue eyes, somewhere in his 30s. Couldn't tell you exactly what they said - but he spoke the local tongue beautifully. In the end, the guards relented and walked into another room. Then, he stepped into the cell using the guard's key.""

Elliot recounted all of this very rapidly - his interpreter barely kept up, but Mr. Pierce did not seem aware of this. Or he chose to ignore it, looking to move through this information as quickly as possible. 

""So he steps into my dingy cell with an expensive-looking navy blue suit and briefcase. The holding room had three cells, but none of the others were occupied, so I was alone with this stranger. Instead of sitting across from me, he pulls up a chair and sits beside me, uncomfortably close. I asked him who he was and if he was from my department, and he said nothing in response. He just smiled at me for a few seconds - with full eye contact. Don't think I ever saw him blink. Then, he slowly and very carefully opened his briefcase, all the while still looking into my eyes. No papers, pens, or files in that thing. It's completely empty, save a small brown box. He opens it gently, and it turns out to be a goddamned music box. Tiny harpsichord and everything.""

As Mr. Pierce tells it, this silent visitor sat next to him with the music box, opened it, and let it play for about a minute. What came out wasn't any song that he recognized - in fact, it didn't even really sound like a *song* at all. 

""I'm no musician, but what came out of that box wasn't a song. It was a sequence of three notes, playing without any discernable rhythm, and it just kept repeating in the same order, over and over. And part of me thinks I'm dreaming because, I mean, what in the hell is going on? But after about 60 seconds, he gently closes the box, puts it back in his briefcase, and gets up from where he was sitting. As he was standing over me, I noticed a small glob of green foam in his right ear - he had been wearing earplugs that entire time. Without a word, he walks out of the cell. Never seen him again in my life.""

After he said this, Elliot's words finally started to slow down to a normal, human speed. In the interview, I initially interpreted this change to mean something important was to follow. I was partially right - something important was to follow, but I think he needed to slow down primarily because he was struggling to recollect something traumatic. 

""So the man in the blue suit leaves, and I tried to ignore the eeriness of that whole interaction. I put my focus back on my crosswords, you know? But I couldn't put my mind to the puzzles because something else was bugging me. He closed the music box in the middle of the note sequence. He had let these three notes play in the same order for a whole fucking minute but then stopped on the second one. He didn't let the third one play the last time.""

Tears began to pool in Elliot's eyes: ""I started to realize I could still hear that second note in my head. Initially, it was quiet, like it was in the back of my thoughts I guess. But soon, that note was all that was in my head; I couldn't hear myself think over it. The sequence was just so painfully unfinished - literally, it was causing me physical pain. I wanted to hear that third note so the sequence would end, but I couldn't find it in my memories.

""Imagine the worst migraine of your life and multiply it by at least a hundred. I have to get up because I can't sit still. I run circles around the inside of my cell, but it doesn't lessen the pain. All the while, that second note just keeps getting louder. It's shrill agony. Like nails on a chalkboard, but it's a thousand hands on a thousand chalkboards. I started hitting my head against the wall and the floor because it felt like the note was creating physical pressure in my head, meaning if I cracked my skull open, the sound and the pain would float out of me and away.""

""And then…well, you know"" shrugging his shoulders in the direction of his sign language interpreter. 

He didn't give me the gory details, but he didn't need to. What I knew coming into this interview was that Elliot Pierce had been acquitted of the murder of Greg Fields by reason of insanity. He would describe, to his defense attorney and then on the stand, that Greg had been ""infected"" by the unknown man's music box. Elliot speculated this happened when they checked into the hotel when Greg used the bathroom; that man (or another agent of his, he would later say) must have exposed him to the sequence. Subsequently, the tall American proposed that the short American had taken his own life to relieve himself of the pain. The same reason Elliot had deafened himself by gouging his eardrums in turn with the sharpened pencil he had previously been doing crosswords with. 

Unarguably a compelling tale. Moreover, there are some auditory precedents for Elliot's allegations. The day after the interview, I gave Bernard Lane, professor of music theory and history at Berkly, a call to help contextualize what Mr. Pierce had told me: 

""What he seems to be alluding to is interesting - the 'unfinished sequence causing physical pain', I mean. Music, at its core, is about tension and release. Most melodies exist in what is called a 'key'. A key is a set of notes, usually 7 total, that fit together in a comfortable way. Take C major, for example. The notes in C major fit together comfortably because they all point to C Major as the 'home chord', also known as the 'tonic'. The tension, then, is playing notes other than C and chords other than C major - the note of G or the chord of G major, for example's sake. The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room? 

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection. 

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized: 

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again? Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible. 

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both? Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

Mid 30s man. Lately, I’ve been grappling with a crushing sense of futility. It’s not the dramatic existential crisis people talk about in their twenties, where you’re chasing identity or purpose. It’s quieter, deeper, and honestly, more unsettling.

For most of my life, I played by the rules. Got the degree, worked the jobs, paid the bills, stayed out of trouble. I’ve hit some of the milestones people said would “fill me up”—the steady career, a couple of friendships that have survived the years, and even a few things I can proudly call achievements. But none of it feels… real. Or at least not in a way that’s deeply satisfying.

I wake up, I work, I scroll, I sleep, and I do it all over again. The small joys—coffee in the morning, a good workout, a night out with friends—help, but they’re fleeting. Everything feels cyclical, like I’m running on a treadmill that never stops. I’m keeping up, but I don’t even know why I’m running.

What’s worse is that I can’t seem to shake this sense that none of it really matters. The world feels massive and indifferent, and sometimes I wonder if anything I do makes even the smallest dent in the chaos. I know that’s not unique—everyone struggles with this on some level—but it’s so consuming, it’s like I’m walking around under a blanket of static.

The hardest part? The disconnect. I see people my age getting married, buying houses, having kids, starting these lives they seem so invested in. And while I’m happy for them, I can’t relate. Part of me wonders if I missed some memo. Did everyone else figure out how to make peace with the monotony and emptiness? Are they just better at pretending it’s fine?

I’ve tried the usual solutions. Therapy helps, sometimes. I’ve leaned into hobbies, tried mindfulness, explored philosophy. I’ve even dabbled in spirituality, hoping for some kind of “aha” moment. But the answers feel hollow, or worse, manufactured.

I guess what I’m really wondering is: does it get better? For anyone else in their 30s or beyond, do you eventually find something that makes this cycle feel worthwhile? Or is it about learning to live with the futility, to accept it without being crushed by it?

I don’t know. Maybe this is just a phase. Maybe I’ll wake up one day and the fog will lift, and I’ll feel connected to life again. Or maybe not. But if nothing else, I hope this resonates with someone out there. It helps to know I’m not the only one staring into the abyss, even if we’re doing it alone, together.",4,1731782880.0,self,0,1.0,False
1gsu02x,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1gsu02x/best_quality_photo_books_for_fine_art_photography/,Best quality photo books for fine art photography?,"Hey everyone! Is anyone else here deep into the nitty-gritty of print quality—like full-on Pixel Peeping obsessed? If so, I’d love to hear your findings and recommendations for photo book services that truly stand out.

Years ago, I attended a book show for *Modernist Cuisine* hosted by the author, Nathan Myhrvold. This guy is not only a genius but also an epic photographer. He talked about how he chose the print method for his book and how it outshined everything else available. I don’t remember the exact details, but I was blown away by his passion and dedication to quality. His photography is next level—one shot I vividly remember was a BBQ sliced in half to reveal a cross-section of a burger cooking. Don’t even ask me how he pulled that off, but it was incredible.

Fast forward to my own photo book journey. I’ve been using Blurb for years and really like it for casual coffee table books. The price is fine, and the photo-printed hardcovers are stunning—crisp and beautiful, something I’m genuinely proud to display. But once you open the pages? Some prints feel soft or blurry, lacking that sharpness and vibrancy I’m after.

Now, I’m ready to step up my game to something archival-quality. I want a book that’s not just a flip-through but something I can pass down for generations. I’ve heard of alternatives like Artifact Uprising, ProDPI, and a handful of others—all claiming to be amazing. But what’s the crème de la crème for photo books?

If you’ve gone down the rabbit hole of print quality or have experience with premium services, I’d love to hear your recommendations! Let’s compare notes. 😊

*Lost Media, Now Found:*

*Excerpt from Strange Worlds, 1980. Found in an abandoned and derelict two-story home outside of Atlanta, Georgia.*

*Written by Ben Nakamura*

***Calculated Temporal Dissonance***\*: 6%. Increased from previously analyzed media.\*

On August 23rd, 1968, at approximately 11AM, two middle-aged American men walked into the lobby of a hotel in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. The taller of the two men greeted the concierge sitting behind the desk, a grizzled older gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth and a scar over the bridge of his nose. He informed the concierge that they had a room booked and would be staying for three nights. The lobby was large and cavernous - a 3,000 square ft. floor plan with a slightly curved ceiling rising three stories above the two Americans. It was converted from a chapel into a hotel in the early 60s. Other than the Americans and the concierge, only two additional people were present in the lobby: another guest, a strapping young Brazilian man in a buttoned-down shirt, and the hotel's elderly custodian. The young Brazilian man was a patron of the hotel, sitting opposite the concierge's desk near a weakly spinning table fan, coffee in hand, and reading a newspaper. The custodian was seated at the same table as the young Brazilian man, chatting and waiting for the arrival of a maintenance worker. The shorter American excused himself to the restroom while the other got them both checked in. When he returned from the restroom, the taller American handed him a set of keys. As he did, he noticed the custodian was leering at the shorter of the travelers, his face contorted into an expression that relayed both confusion and anger. The custodian watched intently as the two men walked across the lobby and disappeared into the elevator. 

The Americans paced down the fifth-floor hallway to locate their rooms, 508 and 522. Although they were not adjoining as was requested, they decided not to bother the concierge by reporting this error, who had already been noticeably curt with the taller man while he was formally paying for the rooms. The shorter American entered 508, clutching the side of his head and informing his colleague he would like to rest. The taller American nodded and wordlessly strolled approximately eighty yards to his hotel room, intending to get a head start on work. 

Not more than an hour later, the taller American was startled by a wild flurry of knocks on the door of 522. A little jittery from surprise, he made his way toward the noise as the thunderstorm crashing into the dense wooden door only became more violent. Unsure of what he was about to encounter, he carefully pocketed a revolver into his suit jacket and looked through the peephole, nearly deafened by the abrupt onset of frenzied and incoherent shouting from the other side. It took him a moment to recognize the shorter American through the peephole through curtains of blood that had been drawn across his face. 

As he fearfully twisted the knob, the shorter American spilled into his room. As he passed, the taller American peeked his head cautiously outside the doorframe, not seeing anyone in either direction. When he turned back into the room, it became apparent that his friend had not been attacked by anyone- the damage was self-inflicted. He watched his colleague clawing at his head, haphazardly dragging splintered nails through ragged skin in short, savage bursts. The taller American tried to elicit the root cause of his colleague's erupting madness, but he could barely bring himself to form a coherent sentence, let alone shout it at a volume louder than the other man's screaming in the heat of the moment. The taller American gestured in a pleading motion for his colleague to explain what was going on, unaware that he had removed his left hand from his jacket pocket, which was still absent-mindedly clutching his sidearm. With a movement that the taller American recounted as simultaneously feral and strategic, the raving man placed his right hand over the hand holding the gun, pulled it up until it was level with his forehead, and then used his thumb to overpower his friend's index finger into the trigger, causing it to fire.

Why was the shorter American dead? Maybe, more critically, what had caused this chain of events to happen?

Feels like a riddle, right? A puzzle that could be solved with logic and intuition? Like some new age version of *""There is a farmer, and he must transport a fox, a goose and a bag of beans across the river on a raft, but the fox can't be with the goose because they'll eat it, and the goose can't be with the beans because they'll eat it…""* et cetera, et cetera. Ask your father or middle school philosophy teacher to explain that mind teaser if you've never heard it before. Don't write in and ask me - I only know the premise of the thought exercise, barely at that.

Perhaps a better comparison is this: the story of the two American men in Brazil feels like the cold opening of a particularly violent Agatha Christie novel. The mysterious pieces are laid bare for examination before the story begins in earnest - with a solution to the puzzle hidden just below the surface, waiting for a detective with a keen eye and keener wit to put it all together. Unfortunately, life does not unfold so thoughtfully.

The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room? 

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection. 

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized: 

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again? Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible. 

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both? Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

1gstzh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1gstzh5/mil_explodes/,MIL Explodes,"I feel like I write these threads too often, but I don't want to constantly talk to everyone about my issues with my MIL. 

Backstory: My bf has been sick with some stomach issues for about a month now and we finally went to the doctor. Doctor said his intestines aren't absorbing anything so he needs to go get more tests. That is coming up this Monday. BF's mom made a few jabs at me at the dr's about some of bf's answers. Like cold sores (which I never had before dating him and literally everyone has them) and his mom made me out to be a slut in front of the dr... I said nothing since we were there for bf. 

  
Anyways, she's been grumpy and snappy on and off for the past week so I shouldn't have been surprised when I heard her yelling at bf for not taking care of himself (which is also an indirect hit on me because I cook 2 meals for him, whatever he wants every day) and he talked back. That was on Thursday night after he just came back from a long shift. Mind you, stomach issues run in his family so it's not his fault. 

On friday, his mom kept slamming things and moving my stuff around, but luckily I had some classes that day (I'm an english tutor in mexico), so I left for a few hours. Keep in mind, she is mad at him, but because of her inability to separate her anger, she gets mad at me too. I went to classes, ran errands for dinner, and then came back home. We all live together while him and I are saving to move out. 

I go to give his mom $100 for whatever she needs (I'm unemployed, but try to help where I can with money and especially housework) and she keeps being disrespectful. When she's angry, I can't understand her spanish (it's not my primary or even 2nd language) so I became confused and irritated. She kept mentioning like me transferring it to the bank or using my bf's card and I was like ""I have no idea and no ability to do that"" (in my head). There was another person in the room so I kept calm and just laid the money on the dresser and walked out. I shook my head and I guess she saw my frustration and ran out of the room to scream and cuss me out. 

Calling me an asshole, demanding respect, and that I was taking advantage of her.  All not true... I don't expect her to feed me, clean for me, I literally leave no trace of myself in her house, nothing. She still kept the money I gave her so I thought that was funny. 

So, holding back tears, I said nothing, grabbed my stuff and walked around for a few hrs. Went to bf's work and sat in his car till he was off. I called my mom and she said she could see how I was disrespectful by not taking back the money and shaking my head, but that her reaction was over the top towards me. 

His mom has a history of being snide, saying not true things about me and my bf behind our backs (to other family), always twisting my words (some of which is a cultural and communication difference), yelling at me, she's attacked me while she was drunk (she's a recovering alcoholic now), thrown stuff of mine away, etc... So this isn't just a one-off outburst. 

I am always on eggshells around her and make sure to help wherever I can. When she was sick (tummy issues), I was always willing to loan money, run errands, ask anyone if they need anything, etc... 

Now that she's better, she's even more of a jerk. But I still would ask her, her daughter, or whoever was in the house at least once a day if they needed help, needed me to run errands, cooking, etc... while still looking for a job and taking care of bf while he provides for us. I've always tried to make small talk and engage in conversation, but if the MOOD OF THE DAY says otherwise, then I just keep to myself and try to stay quiet and respectful of their space. After all, I am just a tenant, that is not my home. I always clean up after myself, maintain a nice appearance, try to keep myself busy with looking for jobs, tutoring, cleaning, cooking (when they want help), reading, hobbies, etc... but I'm getting worn out. And before you ask, no, they barely ever ask me about my life, how I'm doing or feeling, etc... They are so self-absorbed. 

It's crazy to think I live in a house with 4 other people, but feel so alone. Bf is not included in that count, he is wonderful and is constantly fighting with his mom because he's sick of her treatment of me and him. 

Meanwhile, she would NEVERRRR cuss out her daughter's boyfriend (who also lives in the house) who in the past has had a track record of not helping around the house or paying for anything. It's just a stupid, toxic, double standard. 

Even if I worked full-time and was never in that house, I would still clean and cook because that's common sense and respectful. 

  
Bf and I are currently looking to move out again because enough is enough. I feel so stressed and financially irresponsible, that I'm looking to take out a small personal loan to cover 4-6 months of rent just till I can get a job here (I'm a US citizen but looking for work in Mexico, where I live now.) I know this post is all over the place, but my MIL can't give us a break. We are trying to leave, and it's funny because the moment we have money to do so, something financially with her comes up. Meanwhile, she makes almost double what bf makes in a month, and that's due to his ""gift"" to her, so that she doesn't have to work. But if he asks for money for one of his expenses, she loses it. It's like she doesn't want to let go of her son. 

I know her yelling at him to take care of himself was out of fear and concern, but I think it's mostly out of fear because who would take care of her then? Everything is about her. 

When I spoke to my mom yesterday about his mom she said you can always forgive and set boundaries, but you and bf are not responsible to teach her how to act like an adult and have tricky conversations. 

That hit me.

So, this morning him and I got up, made breakfast for ourselves per usual, did their dishes and ours, and went back upstairs to our room. When he got ready to leave for work, I asked him to drop me at a coffee shop where I'll be till he gets off work. When we left the house, we crossed his mom and sister and neither of them acknowledged us or said anything. AKA silent treatment begins now! Not the first time either. So we just left. Bf said his mom has been like this his whole life, so to ignore is the best thing to do and to not give in to her antics. 

The sister and I normally get along, but when his mom is mad at us, she gets all wimpy and won't interact with us... Out of fear her mom will chew into her as well or see her as a ""traitor."" I feel bad for her, but at the same time she's 23! Grow up! Get a job! Leave your poisonous mom at home and let her suffer! Again, funnily enough I still have love for his mom because she's my MIL. 

BUT I DON'T HAVE love for the way she treats her children, talks badly about others who do a lot for her, and her entitlement to everything. 

If you made it to the bottom of this post. Thanks for hearing me out.

I used to be on Adderall XR (don’t recall the dosage), but after losing my health insurance and having to go on Medicaid, I was unable to get medicated. I believe there is a bias against those in poverty, and an incorrect and unfair assumption that poverty is correlated with increased drug abuse (even if you have no history of such in your medical record), but I digress.

My psychiatrist recently put me on the generic Ritalin IR, 5 mg twice a day. She prescribed a two-week supply to see how I feel on it, starting with the lowest possible dose due to my sensitivity to a lot of medications in general.

I’m not noticing any mental differences on 5 mg, but what I *am* noticing is that my resting heart rate is now 10-20 bpm lower! I’m now at 60-68 instead of my usual 75-90. And this is with my normal two cups of coffee as well.

*Lost Media, Now Found:*

*Excerpt from Strange Worlds, 1980. Found in an abandoned and derelict two-story home outside of Atlanta, Georgia.*

*Written by Ben Nakamura*

***Calculated Temporal Dissonance***\*: 6%. Increased from previously analyzed media.\*

On August 23rd, 1968, at approximately 11AM, two middle-aged American men walked into the lobby of a hotel in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. The taller of the two men greeted the concierge sitting behind the desk, a grizzled older gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth and a scar over the bridge of his nose. He informed the concierge that they had a room booked and would be staying for three nights. The lobby was large and cavernous - a 3,000 square ft. floor plan with a slightly curved ceiling rising three stories above the two Americans. It was converted from a chapel into a hotel in the early 60s. Other than the Americans and the concierge, only two additional people were present in the lobby: another guest, a strapping young Brazilian man in a buttoned-down shirt, and the hotel's elderly custodian. The young Brazilian man was a patron of the hotel, sitting opposite the concierge's desk near a weakly spinning table fan, coffee in hand, and reading a newspaper. The custodian was seated at the same table as the young Brazilian man, chatting and waiting for the arrival of a maintenance worker. The shorter American excused himself to the restroom while the other got them both checked in. When he returned from the restroom, the taller American handed him a set of keys. As he did, he noticed the custodian was leering at the shorter of the travelers, his face contorted into an expression that relayed both confusion and anger. The custodian watched intently as the two men walked across the lobby and disappeared into the elevator. 

The Americans paced down the fifth-floor hallway to locate their rooms, 508 and 522. Although they were not adjoining as was requested, they decided not to bother the concierge by reporting this error, who had already been noticeably curt with the taller man while he was formally paying for the rooms. The shorter American entered 508, clutching the side of his head and informing his colleague he would like to rest. The taller American nodded and wordlessly strolled approximately eighty yards to his hotel room, intending to get a head start on work. 

Not more than an hour later, the taller American was startled by a wild flurry of knocks on the door of 522. A little jittery from surprise, he made his way toward the noise as the thunderstorm crashing into the dense wooden door only became more violent. Unsure of what he was about to encounter, he carefully pocketed a revolver into his suit jacket and looked through the peephole, nearly deafened by the abrupt onset of frenzied and incoherent shouting from the other side. It took him a moment to recognize the shorter American through the peephole through curtains of blood that had been drawn across his face. 

As he fearfully twisted the knob, the shorter American spilled into his room. As he passed, the taller American peeked his head cautiously outside the doorframe, not seeing anyone in either direction. When he turned back into the room, it became apparent that his friend had not been attacked by anyone- the damage was self-inflicted. He watched his colleague clawing at his head, haphazardly dragging splintered nails through ragged skin in short, savage bursts. The taller American tried to elicit the root cause of his colleague's erupting madness, but he could barely bring himself to form a coherent sentence, let alone shout it at a volume louder than the other man's screaming in the heat of the moment. The taller American gestured in a pleading motion for his colleague to explain what was going on, unaware that he had removed his left hand from his jacket pocket, which was still absent-mindedly clutching his sidearm. With a movement that the taller American recounted as simultaneously feral and strategic, the raving man placed his right hand over the hand holding the gun, pulled it up until it was level with his forehead, and then used his thumb to overpower his friend's index finger into the trigger, causing it to fire.

Why was the shorter American dead? Maybe, more critically, what had caused this chain of events to happen?

Feels like a riddle, right? A puzzle that could be solved with logic and intuition? Like some new age version of *""There is a farmer, and he must transport a fox, a goose and a bag of beans across the river on a raft, but the fox can't be with the goose because they'll eat it, and the goose can't be with the beans because they'll eat it…""* et cetera, et cetera. Ask your father or middle school philosophy teacher to explain that mind teaser if you've never heard it before. Don't write in and ask me - I only know the premise of the thought exercise, barely at that.

Perhaps a better comparison is this: the story of the two American men in Brazil feels like the cold opening of a particularly violent Agatha Christie novel. The mysterious pieces are laid bare for examination before the story begins in earnest - with a solution to the puzzle hidden just below the surface, waiting for a detective with a keen eye and keener wit to put it all together. Unfortunately, life does not unfold so thoughtfully. According to the story's narrator, Elliot Pierce, there would have been no possible way for him to have detected and prevented what transpired that day.

I sat down with Mr. Pierce, otherwise known as the Tall American, and his interpreter this week, and my, what a tangled web he wove. And if what he tells me is to be believed, I happen to agree with him - it was an unsolvable mystery from the jump. But that assumes this man's story is truthful. So, instead of asking you all, dear readers, to crack this riddle before the inevitable reveals, I ask you this instead - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? 

*""We were ambassadors, not spies.""* recounted Elliot through his interpreter. ""Our business in the area was purely economic - part of a larger effort to keep lines of trade open between America and Brazil. Throughout the sixties and into the early seventies, JFK and his administration did their damndest to maintain a healthy foreign policy; we were just a small piece of that.  I have no idea why we were targeted with that weapon. I try to keep myself from wondering too hard - sometimes I can feel a stroke coming on when I get too fixated on trying to make it all make sense."" 

Somberly, Elliot continued his recollection of the events that followed the gunshot. He couldn't tell me how long he was standing motionless in front of Greg Fields's corpse, AKA the shorter American. Still, given the commotion, he couldn't imagine it was more than a few minutes before his trance was interrupted by the arrival of other hotelgoers to 522, looking to determine the source of the explosive disturbance. When he was found, he was sitting at a small table with a single chair across from Greg. Elliot doesn't recall going from standing to sitting - most of the details immediately after the gunshot, apparently, are lost to him. The body had fallen backward onto the room's cot, and Mr. Pierce seemingly couldn't pull his eyes from the sight of it all. Eventually, though, he was pulled away - manually, by a Brazilian police officer, letting Elliot know in a language he did not understand that he was under arrest for murder. He was still clutching the revolver in his hand when he was first discovered.

At the police station, he was able to put in a call to his contacts in the US. They let Elliot know that a lawyer and some additional members of his department would be deployed ASAP to Brazil. In the meantime, Elliot was, thankfully, not interrogated too harshly. Although this crime had occurred on Brazilian soil, from the cop's perspective, no South American citizens were involved. As long as Elliot remained calm during detainment, the police were in no rush to spend resources determining his guilt or innocence. They'd leave it to the Americans.

""It wasn't nearly as bad as I initially feared,"" Elliot relayed, although his eyes betrayed a lingering pain that seemed discordant with the words coming from his interpreter. 

""The guards, at the least the ones that knew a little English, were kind to me. In a moment of suffocating boredom, they even provided me with a pencil and a book of crossword puzzles from my suitcase. Looking back, it is very surreal. That act of hospitality saved my life.""

In the five days before his American counterparts arrived in Brazil, Elliot would have only one visitor. He did not know this man - nor did he recognize him from the hotel. He was not the concierge, the custodian, or the muscular young Brazilian.

""He first caught my attention arguing with the guards outside my cell. He didn't look Brazilian; he looked American - medium build, blue eyes, somewhere in his 30s. Couldn't tell you exactly what they said - but he spoke the local tongue beautifully. In the end, the guards relented and walked into another room. Then, he stepped into the cell using the guard's key.""

Elliot recounted all of this very rapidly - his interpreter barely kept up, but Mr. Pierce did not seem aware of this. Or he chose to ignore it, looking to move through this information as quickly as possible. 

""So he steps into my dingy cell with an expensive-looking navy blue suit and briefcase. The holding room had three cells, but none of the others were occupied, so I was alone with this stranger. Instead of sitting across from me, he pulls up a chair and sits beside me, uncomfortably close. I asked him who he was and if he was from my department, and he said nothing in response. He just smiled at me for a few seconds - with full eye contact. Don't think I ever saw him blink. Then, he slowly and very carefully opened his briefcase, all the while still looking into my eyes. No papers, pens, or files in that thing. It's completely empty, save a small brown box. He opens it gently, and it turns out to be a goddamned music box. Tiny harpsichord and everything.""

As Mr. Pierce tells it, this silent visitor sat next to him with the music box, opened it, and let it play for about a minute. What came out wasn't any song that he recognized - in fact, it didn't even really sound like a *song* at all. 

""I'm no musician, but what came out of that box wasn't a song. It was a sequence of three notes, playing without any discernable rhythm, and it just kept repeating in the same order, over and over. And part of me thinks I'm dreaming because, I mean, what in the hell is going on? But after about 60 seconds, he gently closes the box, puts it back in his briefcase, and gets up from where he was sitting. As he was standing over me, I noticed a small glob of green foam in his right ear - he had been wearing earplugs that entire time. Without a word, he walks out of the cell. Never seen him again in my life.""

After he said this, Elliot's words finally started to slow down to a normal, human speed. In the interview, I initially interpreted this change to mean something important was to follow. I was partially right - something important was to follow, but I think he needed to slow down primarily because he was struggling to recollect something traumatic. 

""So the man in the blue suit leaves, and I tried to ignore the eeriness of that whole interaction. I put my focus back on my crosswords, you know? But I couldn't put my mind to the puzzles because something else was bugging me. He closed the music box in the middle of the note sequence. He had let these three notes play in the same order for a whole fucking minute but then stopped on the second one. He didn't let the third one play the last time.""

Tears began to pool in Elliot's eyes: ""I started to realize I could still hear that second note in my head. Initially, it was quiet, like it was in the back of my thoughts I guess. But soon, that note was all that was in my head; I couldn't hear myself think over it. The sequence was just so painfully unfinished - literally, it was causing me physical pain. I wanted to hear that third note so the sequence would end, but I couldn't find it in my memories.

""Imagine the worst migraine of your life and multiply it by at least a hundred. I have to get up because I can't sit still. I run circles around the inside of my cell, but it doesn't lessen the pain. All the while, that second note just keeps getting louder. It's shrill agony. Like nails on a chalkboard, but it's a thousand hands on a thousand chalkboards. I started hitting my head against the wall and the floor because it felt like the note was creating physical pressure in my head, meaning if I cracked my skull open, the sound and the pain would float out of me and away.""

""And then…well, you know"" shrugging his shoulders in the direction of his sign language interpreter. 

He didn't give me the gory details, but he didn't need to. What I knew coming into this interview was that Elliot Pierce had been acquitted of the murder of Greg Fields by reason of insanity. He would describe, to his defense attorney and then on the stand, that Greg had been ""infected"" by the unknown man's music box. Elliot speculated this happened when they checked into the hotel when Greg used the bathroom; that man (or another agent of his, he would later say) must have exposed him to the sequence. Subsequently, the tall American proposed that the short American had taken his own life to relieve himself of the pain. The same reason Elliot had deafened himself by gouging his eardrums in turn with the sharpened pencil he had previously been doing crosswords with. 

Unarguably a compelling tale. Moreover, there are some auditory precedents for Elliot's allegations. The day after the interview, I gave Bernard Lane, professor of music theory and history at Berkly, a call to help contextualize what Mr. Pierce had told me: 

""What he seems to be alluding to is interesting - the 'unfinished sequence causing physical pain', I mean. Music, at its core, is about tension and release. Most melodies exist in what is called a 'key'. A key is a set of notes, usually 7 total, that fit together in a comfortable way. Take C major, for example. The notes in C major fit together comfortably because they all point to C Major as the 'home chord', also known as the 'tonic'. The tension, then, is playing notes other than C and chords other than C major - the note of G or the chord of G major, for example's sake. The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room? 

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection. 

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized: 

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again? Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible. 

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both? Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

Kanina, I went to have coffee sa SB. 

So ayon mahaba yung pila sobra haha so medyo yamot talaga ako. Ang ingay, ang chaotic. Naisip ko sana pala sa bahay nalang ako nagkape haha. 

Then ayon it was my turn to order coffee haha. I dropped in my usual orders. The lady over the counter asked for my name for call-out purposes. Very clear ako magsalita, usually. I smiled and said Carlo. Loud & clear.  

She said ""Carlos, right?""

I said, ""uh no just Carlo."" then smiled

SHE smiled back and said, ""Oh okay, Carlo for single Carlo"" 

I just smiled and nodded. 

THEN she said in the cutest way possible. ""Are you single too?""

THAT. Caught me off guard. I SMILED. BUT I WISHED I ANSWERED HAHA. 

AFTER that I tried my best to not glance at her while I wait for my coffee. 

Then when it was my turn to get it. 

Call out was ""CARLA"" 😭

I checked and verified na baka akin yon, kasi I see my order pero ibang name tas no one was approaching haha. 

So ayon nag sorry sila sakin and just laughed hahaha.  

I realized later na I mightve had a crush on her HAHAHA. 

I'm a regular customer sa ibat ibang branches and YES people are friendly pero not like that.

1gsty44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1gsty44/paizo_needs_to_print_skill_feats_compatible_with/,"Paizo needs to print skill feats compatible with subsystem skill challenges. And since they haven't, I made some myself. ","*(I don't know how to tag this post. There’s no “Rant”.)*

The other day I was talking to some local gamers about how recent society games are using skill challenges for everything except for combat and it wasn't particularly fun. After reading some posts I realized that part of the issue is how little subsystems interact with character customization outside of proficiency modifiers, so players don't feel like they are playing their characters. This is especially true to the skill feats; you rarely get to use diplomacy feats in Influence or stealth feats in Infiltration despite that's the exact kind of scenarios they are supposed to be for. 

In other words, to make skill challenges more enjoyable, I think Paizo should design a new category of skill feats that work explicitly with subsystems.

But, since they haven't, I decided to create some myself:-) 

I want to create feats that people would find fun using during a skill challenge, and avoid making ones Paizo would make, so some effects may be a little unconventional. This is a casual brainstorm practice so I didn't bother with formatting or balancing. It's not like skill feats are anywhere balanced. I'm also not a native English user, so wording are probably off.

All the feats should have a ""Subsystem"" trait, indicating that they can only be used when a subsystem is used.



Going out with style

Prerequisite: master in Acrobatics

Your scheme is hare-brained, your execution is lousy, but your exit pose is graceful. If your roll would result in losing a form of victory point or incur another negative effect, you can roll an acrobatics check against the original skill DC +2. On a success, you do not incur the effect. If you're legendary in acrobatics, you can ignore the +2.



With all the math in my head

Prerequisite: expert in Arcana

In a split second, your keen mind calculated a perfect path among the chaos. You can use arcana to overcome any obstacles during a chase. The DC equals to the highest DC of provided skills +2. If you have legendary proficiency in arcana, remove the +2.



Give'em a boost

Prerequisite: expert in Athletics

Sometimes you have to carry your buddy, give them a push, or throw them like a potato bag. When you roll an athletics check to overcome an obstacle and receive a critical success, you can boost next player's result one degree of success better. If you're legendary in athletics, you can give this boost to the next two players.



Let's check the building blueprint

Prerequisite: expert in Crafting or trained in Architecture Lore

You excel in finding weakness, secret passages, and hiding spots in a structure. During an Infiltration (including preparation phase), for any activities happen in a building or underground passageways, you may use crafting in place of perception, stealth, and thievery.



The game is yours

Prerequisite: legendary in Deception

With manipulating words, you gain superior control of the narrative for a brief moment. If you argued for an alternative skill and your GM did not allow it, you can roll a deception check against the highest skill option DC. On a critical success, you can roll the proposed skill against the highest DC as if it has been allowed. On any other results, you must choose one of the listed skills. On a critical failure, your GM is annoyed; you become Doomed 1 until the end of current encounter.



Hang out with the cool kids

Prerequisite: expert in Diplomacy

You let the nerds handle the reading, while you find the right person to talk to. When performing a Research, as long as the library is close to a populated area, you can gather information instead of research to gain research point, using the same DC, time, and success conditions from the research action. 



Loud and proud

Prerequisite: expert in Intimidation

You know how to make noises to drive wildlife away -- or you are just noisy. Your party does not trigger random creature encounter during Hexploration. You can willingly suppress this ability when a random creature encounter is rolled. As long as this ability is active, any enemies without the mindless trait take a -2 circumstance penalty to their initiative rolls.



I live for this day

Prerequisite: master in one Lore

Ecstasy rushes through you as that obscure lore you picked is actually useful for once. Whenever this lore appears as a skill option in a subsystem, you can forgo rolling to instead receive a result of 20 + skill modifier.



Here's your morning fix

Prerequisite: master in Medicine

You prepared simple remedies to give small boosts -- coffee for Research, mint for social Influence, deodorant for Infiltration, etc. Once per round during a subsystem skill challenge, you can give an appropriate fix to an ally or yourself, who adds a +1 item bonus to their next check. The target is then immune to this ability for a day.



I'll speak to the little guys

Prerequisite: expert in Nature

Rats, roaches, house spirits and gremlins, even the most civilized places cannot shun nature entirely. When preparing for an infiltration, you can use Nature to Gain Contact, Gossip, and Scout Location against hard DC.



The true meaning of esoteric

Prerequisite: master in Occultism

You are a master of pulling out obscure knowledge on random things. Any time during a skill challenge subsystem, you can go through your collection of esoteric knowledge to gain temporary proficiency in one Lore skill. The proficiency in this lore is one step lower than your proficiency in Occultism. You can only gain one lore per subsystem, and you can only use it on skill checks as part of the subsystem.



Bonus for storytelling

Prerequisite: master in Performance

The game wouldn't ask a player to perform athletic feats, so why would it ask you to perform? Before you roll for a skill check, you can roll a Performance check again the same DC. On a critical success, this counts as a very elaborate description of your action; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the skill check. On a critical failure, your description cringed the table; you cannot use this ability again for one real life hour.



Deus ex machina

Prerequisite: master in Religion. You worship a deity. Through the subsystem you have acted upon the deity's Edict at least once, and have not broken its Anathema.

Spontaneous divine interference saves you from impending failure. If a subsystem challenge would end, and the party has not accumulated enough victory points to meet all thresholds, you immediately gain 1d4-1 victory points. If the challenge would end because of an effect, calculate your party's result before that effect occurs. 



The science of deduction

Prerequisite: expert in Society

Small details give clues to a person's life story. During an influence encounter, the first time you speak to each NPC, you can immediately roll a secret society check before performing a round of Influence or Discover, against the lower of perception DC or society DC. You learn information as if you have made a Discover check.



I'm not there

Prerequisite: master in Stealth

You know how to get out of the way when things are out of your depth. During any round of a skill challenge where your party needs to acquire a number of successes based on the party size to reach a threshold, and you are not at least trained in any provided skills, you can roll a Stealth check against the highest skill option DC. On a success or better, you do not count to the party size in this round. On a critical success, you find a way to contribute while unnoticed; this result also counts as a success. You cannot perform other actions this round.



How's the weather out there

Prerequisite: expert in Survival

You prepared a conversation starter to mask your social awkwardness. You can use survival to influence or discover from each NPC in place of diplomacy or perception once per encounter. If diplomacy and perception are not listed as a available skill, use the highest DC.



But it just lay there

Prerequisite: master in Thievery

You haven't gained as much spotlight as you'd like, but you found a way to entertain yourself. At the end of every subsystem encounter, you gain a consumerable no more than half your level, that is appropriate to the setting where the encounter took place.

I now work full time, for $2 more per hour then minimum wage. 

My rent is 65% of my income. The apt I rent is drafty and poorly insulated with floor board heating, so I use as little heat as possible.  
So I'm always cold in my place with $250-300 hydro bill.  (I have to use gloves to get my pots from the cupboard in the winter as they're too cold, and, my cleaning supplies under the sink have frozen before)

With my car payment payments and gas, (which I need for work, but not in a way that requires them to reimburse me), I barely have enough for groceries. 

2 of my favourite things are a hot chocolate from a local coffee place and a subway sandwich.  
It's been months since I've had either, as I can barely afford actual groceries.  

And now, 2 of my animals need to go to the vet. 

What do I have to do to earn actual money??  
There's no point to life if all you do is work and stay home depressed because you're too poor for even a hot chocolate treat",2,1731782326.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I need some asvice. After a year of not working in my sector because of a crazy economy, I finally landed a professional job in my sector! I accepted job A 4 weeks ago. But was offered job B yesterday. 

Job A has a good culture, the manager is very nice and supportive. The thing is I feel like I'm really bad at the job. It involves using AutoCAD and I thought I knew AutoCAD ok but I barely knew anything. I legit thought I would get fired the first week for how little I actually know. Not I'm doing some projects on AutoCAD but I need constant help. I have the assistant supervisor and someone else who is teaching me but I think they are getting annoyed with all my questions and the fact that I can barely do anything myself yet. I'm learning so slow and there hasn't been any indication that I'll be let go but I'm scared I'll be let go everyday because of how slow I'm working to learn. I'm thinking of asking for some feedback to see if I'm doing ok. The job involves a lot of precision, which makes me stressed because if I mess up one thing it could mean hours of work I need to redo and my time is billble. Ultimately at this job I'll be doing one specific task once I get good at it, but I'm just really bad at it so far and feel like I struggle everyday.This job is also fully in office and I live close to the office.

Job B also has some aspects I'm unfamiliar with such as managing budgets, but for the most part it's writing reports and communications, which I have experience with. There is no billable time so if it takes a while to learn something I won't feel as bad. There would be a smaller team though so less people to learn from. This job is hybrid and the office is close to my house. The only thing that worries me about job B is there is less people to learn from and job B has a fair bit of negative reviews about management and there seems to be high turnover. 

Theoretically, if job A were to fire me during probation I would receive benefits at least since I gave enough hours from my previous seasonal job that I was paid off from because it's seasonal. If I leave job A and got fired at job B I would get no benefits. I have an intense fear of being fired for financial reasons.

What would you do if you were in my situation? Job B also wants to have coffee with me to further discuss the potential job so I'm going to do that. If I didn't feel like I sucked at job A I think I would stick with job A because the culture is great. But I could still lose my job regardless of culture for being too slow.",0,1731782319.0,productivity,2,0.33,False

I started practicing about 8 or 9 months ago but due to me being in the witch closet for a while, i feel as tho I'm somewhat of a baby witch still. Lately I've been doing deity worship and divination  via candlework and tarot readings, and I finally took the plunge and decided to make moon water following this week's full moon.
It's just a 16.9 fl water bottle that I left by the window to get plenty of moonlight, but I hope that it's a good starting point. Now that I have it, I wanna know what are some good starter spells to do with it? I know that because I used drinking water to turn to moon water, Mayne I could use it in tea or coffee? I'm open to suggestions!
Also, what are some other budget friendly ways to make moon water? I just used the bottled water cuz it's all I had on hand",2,1731782225.0,Witch,1,0.75,False

Everything went great, we went to a café and the chemistry seemed to work out. She had told me in advance that she had set up a blind date for two of her lesbian friends, who we basically went on a double date with (after the café). Later that evening, her sister and her sister’s boyfriend joined us as well and it all just turned into a big group hangout. Long story short, after the „date“, she ghosted me.
Today, I had another first date with a different girl (17F). We agreed to meet up at a café as well. Right after we finished our coffee, her friend „accidentally“ appeared out of the blue and sat down with us. She continued to stay with me and my date for the rest of the day. My date was actually very nice as well and we had great chemistry together, but I don’t think I want to meet her again, because of that weird ass friend who joined us and wouldn’t leave, and she didn’t seem bothered about it. 

My question is, is this normal nowadays? Do girls like to bring their friends on a first date? This has happened to me twice in a row now. (I’ve met both girls on Instagram).The girls I dated before never brought their friends. It‘s a huge turn-off and I should have just left at the café when the friend came, although I could see myself liking my date.",0,1731782206.0,dating_advice,11,0.4,False

My old grinder made to much chaos and there was always coffee flour on the kitchen counter. 

Than I bought a hand grinder, which gave nice results and my coffee making routine was much cleaner, but it just had 12 grind steps and it is time consuming and sometimes I just don't have the time.

Than I bought a similar grinder with a battery, which is the one I use now, gives good results and fits my routine. Problem is I have the feeling it has not enough steps in the finer grind range and there are no scale for the grind steps, so if you need different degrees of grinds it tooks forever to adjust.

I m looking into the Baratza encore esp but I fear it has too not enough finer grinding steps, because it looks more like a all-round grinder.


Tldr: search a grinder for espresso, which is closed like a Baratza encore, with anti static container, scaled grinding steps and enough grind degrees for espresso. Price should be around €300, but would go higher for a perfect solution.",0,1731782089.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

Im finding it impossible to find critique partners that aren’t fantasy. Anybody keen to read the next 3,500 words and tell me a) would you keep reading? b) if not, are you a good enough critiquer to coach this gal down the right alley to find her story if this isn’t it? Bridgette’s mother dies of cancer catalyzing her spiritual growth and discoveries. The story follows Bridgette’s adventures in learning about the Unseen. 

I feel like I’ve blabbered on and most of this is backdrop to what I need to know but maybe it serves? Fuck if I know. New writer.

Tears streamed down her face as Bridgette Tellingdale held her mother’s hand, the glare of fluorescent hospital lights beaming down on them. Her vision blurred as her mind drifted off, the beeps of the heart monitors normalized to her conscience became unnoticeable. She knew this day would come, no matter how much hope she put into her mother overcoming cancer Bridgette dreamed the truth since she was a small child: the cancer would eat Marie Tellingdale away eventually, no matter how hard she fought. Bridgette knew. The decision to pull the plug lay on Bridgette’s mind as she rubbed her mother’s smooth palm, wrinkles just beginning to form. Barely an adult herself the decision weighed more than she was prepared for.

Bridgette’s father left when Marie decided to forgo chemotherapy. The memory replayed in her mind as the monitors beeped the monotonous tone they always did. Everything and nothing was okay. 

She saw the way her father tensed up, recalling his face reddening; she’d never been scared of him before, but her insides quivered as she watched him. He was a big man, his shadow casting over the olive green walls as he paced the room.   

“It’s just not working, Paul. I’m so sick all the time. My life is short and we need to face that.” Marie remembered the point blank truth stabbing her in the moment while she observed the increasing tension digging a wedge between the two people she loved most in the world.

His feet heavily hitting the floor with the thud of her heart as she watched him grab his boots aggressively. When they did fight, they fought it out. They hugged. They didn’t run, but that night was different. He carried them over to the sofa, sprinkling bits of dried dirt on the gray rug. Usually Marie would have had something to say about this but she sat and observed her husband calmly. Bridgette knew their marriage had gotten rocky since the start of the cancer but never fully knew the extent until that day. She remembered the door slamming with a crash. 

The torment in her mother’s eyes that day brought tears into the hospital room. She had loved Rich. It hadn’t been an easy life for them by any means but they always made it through. Her body heated, anger for her father rising. 

“How could you do this to us?” slipped out between her calculated breaths, the kind holding her together, controlled. Bridgette knew her mother was trying to protect her by holding back her tears that day but she wished she hadn’t, maybe her Dad would have seen them and came back. 

Bridgette had stayed frozen in her seat watching, wincing as she watched the last of her parents’ relationship fade away. She felt cowardly and it turned inwards as she took a gulp of air knowing she had to be brave for her mother. 


The sliding glass door skid along it’s track as the nurse walked in the room. “We are past visiting hours again, Bridgette. You have some time but you will need to make a decision.”

Eyes red, Bridgette looked up. She sensed the woman walking in but the words went right past her. 

The nurse came up beside her, placing a hand on Bridgette’s shoulder. “Sweetie, you’ll need to go home for the night. We will keep close eyes on her tonight, okay?”

Bridgette sniffled and nodded.The chair scraped the floor as she pushed it back from the edge of the bed. The nurse dimmed the lights on the way out, the fading like the shutting down of her mother’s life. 

“I don’t know what’s right,” Bridgette managed as she fell to the ground outside the shared hospital room. The sobs she’d held back for the past four years seemed to all flow out of her. The nurse sat on the floor next to Bridgette listening to her tears. 

“It’s not easy, honey,” she said, “but you know your mother best and I’ve seen you two over the course of these past years to know you two share a very kind, tender love. Do you think you would be willing to see one of our social workers?”

Bridgette looked up at the nurse, knees tucked to her chest.

“I can introduce you two in the morning, okay? Find some rest for tonight. You don’t have to make this decision alone.” 

Bridgette climbed off the floor, her body feeling like a ton of bricks, her head pounding. She had cried herself dry yet felt the restriction in her chest that told her there was more to this grief. Nobody talks about how hard cancer is, the way it eats at loved ones mind and spirit while it tears apart their family member’s body slow and steady like some kind of game. The young woman had barely graduated high school when her mom was diagnosed and spent those four years afterwards wasting her time stumbling through college while her mother lived her last days.

 I should have been there, she thought. 

The hallways had become familiar over the years. Bridgette walked through it, dazed. The quiet of the hospital in the night causing her stomach to turn reminding her of death. As she exited the building she felt nauseous and found herself spewing in one of the lavender bushes out front. The fragrant scent, trying to bring calmness, made her angry instead under the bright lights of the entranceway. It was the first time she had felt this fuel inside of her but tonight she did nothing with it. Bridgette held it, just like she internalized the anguish for the past four years.





Elmet was a good place to grow up. A small city with a vibrant main street built for tourism kept things lively enough for Bridgette’s youth. She didn’t always love it but once she grew up she came to appreciate it’s charm and it saved her an arm and a leg being able to commute to university. Tonight though, she longed to be out of the familiar sights bringing up the memories of her childhood. It was quiet and desolate under the waning moon as she drove down Main Street. The buildings grew up from the hospital on the outskirts of town as she drove. 

She needed a clear mind to make the decision as to whether euthanasia was right or not, but she knew; she knew her mother didn’t want to live in this dazed out, incomprehensible, and totally reliant state. It had been three weeks since Marie last spoke any clear word and anything that came out was a mumble no one could understand, if anything came out at all. Her breath had gurgled indicated it was time, ripping at Bridgette’s mind, body, and spirit. 

She longed to talk to her mother, pleading her to wake up when no one else was in the room. It was a juggle next to her hospice roommate, not quite so far gone that Bridgette knew the family still clung to hope she wished was still hers to grasp. Conscious of them she simply read to her mother letting their hope wave across the room. She would try catching it with her breath but it seemed to always fall short of staying with her the moment the family left. Bridgette hadn’t eaten anything outside of a few vending machine snacks that she picked at, barely able to stomach them in the three days since the doctors started preparing her. 

Bridgette drove through the drive of Coffee Mania. She hoped the bold flavour would bring her back to her senses from this  feeling of heaviness moving and turning inside her, begging to be heard but held closed in a container without an ounce of expression. A smile plastered on for the innocent girl at the window caused the knots in her stomach to tighten. She drove to the woods on the outer edge of Elmet where a small lake opened to the night sky above. 

Bridgette walked out to the edge of the dock inviting her to be hugged by the stars above. She slumped as she sat at the edge dipping her toes in the water, stirring the liquid like the blender of emotions in her chest. Eventually she curled in on herself, lips trembling with hesitancy of letting herself move through the emotions that compiled over years of ignorance, or as grief books say, denial. This wasn’t supposed to come until after her mother died, yet she was still breathing… barely breathing. Bridgette let out a scream at the top of her lungs. This shouldn’t be hers to carry, yet here she was.

She took off her shirt and pants climbing down the ladder to submerge herself in the cool water. She wished it was colder. Bridgette dunked her long brown hair underneath, and swam away from the dock with the weight of it slowing her down. She lay on her back looking up the stars wondering if anyone would come to save her.

Slowly it sank in. None of her friends knew who she was anymore, they weren’t coming. She shared the complications with a few but they were all too young to understand the difficulty cancer brings on; watching the life force energy sink out of the faces of those going through treatment and their bones start to pop out of the flesh as they lose the figure that made them beautiful, just wasn’t something they could empathize with. The disease slowly caused a wedge between them; their eyes piercing with this presence that understood death in a way that runs deep into the soul. Through university, she learned to keep it to herself which lead to feeling like all her relationships were superficial. She let herself float where the pain felt lighter in the calm summer night.

Bridgette approached the ladder of the dock when something moved past the corner of her eye in the trees scattered along the lake shore. It gave her a creepy feeling. She slipped her pants back over her wet body along with her white tank top, see through from the sports bra she wore in the water. Afraid of some man lurking, she put on a confident stride hoping it would be enough defense, and returned to the car. 

Bridgette missed the social worker appointment. She walked past the front desk and went str aight to her mother’s room. With her she brought flowers. Imagining her mother could still grasp the sweet aroma, she put them next to her bedside. 

“Mommy,” she said. She leaned over onto her mother, giving her a hug. It was all she could do or say in that moment. Bridgette knew she would lose her courage if she stayed for too long so she tucked her childhood blanket next to her mother’s head; Bridgette wouldn’t be able to stay through the process and wanted her to have every comfort she could. With that she approached the nurse and the front desk, let her know it was okay, and left the building. 

Bridgette managed to make it to her car. Her gaze focused far out from where she was, it took her a moment to collect herself to find the keys. She wasn’t even quite sure how she got there, it was all a blurr. Bridgette stared through the windshield as she reached into her pocket for the cold metal gracing her skin as she fumbled to grab hold of them; Bridgette’s sense of time and space distorted. The sun peered through the glass, the heat stiling the air, but Bridgette barely noticed. She turned on the car and drove to her childhood home. 

The olive green walls closed in on her as she sunk into the leather couch. A picture hung midway up the wall caught he attention; she was about seven, her father was helping her ride her forst two wheeled bike with her mother cheering her on in the background. The frame seemed to vibrate on the wall with Bridgette’s unfocused awareness. She struggled to breathe when the phone rang. 

“Hi, is Bridgette in?” said a woman’s voice. It was the nurse who comforted Bridgette the night before, she’d supported her a lot throughout the procession of her mother’s death. 

“Yes, it’s Bridgette,” she responded, closing her eyes wondering what was coming from the familiar voice. She thought she’d made her decision clear.

“Honey, we’ll need you to sign a release form. Or is there someone else, a family member perhaps that can do this for you? An aunt? An uncle?”

Bridgette’s eyes moistened. The acknowledgement made her feel very distant from her family. Marie had a brother, Bridgette an uncle. If only she hadn’t run away so fast to university they  could have been closer, she wouldn’t be so alone. “My Uncle Todd,” she said. “It’s her younger brother,” a dizziness hit her by surprise. Bridgette passed on his phone number, one she hadn’t reached for since before her teenage years but her mother insisted on having onhand in case of an emergency. She pressed the end button on the phone and lay down on the couch staring at the ceiling. 

An hour passed by like this, Bridgette’s body heavy, her skin cool front he air conditioning She craved a blanket but found it difficult to move. Shemustered the energy to find her bed for a nap. Maybe she’d wake up and the pain would subside, at least a little bit. She was due to start her new teaching job in a few weeks but swamped with the idea of planning a funeral she wondered how she would ever prepare for her first year at in a new career. 



When Bridgette woke she found Todd in the kitchen. The sound of dishes clanging met Bridgette’s headache and she squinted at the afternoon light, shocked by the fresh air streaming through the window with a sense of life. The memory of stuffy hospital came to her with it’s stark conrast.

“I’ve made you some brunch,” said Todd as he flipped an egg in the frying pan and the toast popped in the background startling Bridgette.

In truth, Bridgette was quite uninterested in eating but sat down at the hard maple table anyway. A solemn look crossed her face as she held herself upright with her elbows on the table. 

“You really should have called me sooner,” said Todd in a saddened tone. “Had I known this decision was laid on your shoulders I would have been with you.”

“I couldn’t think,” Bridgette sobbed. It was the first time she’d shared her emotions with someone who knew her well since her mother’s diagnosis. 

Todd brought over a plate with eggs, toast, and bacon. The aroma meeting Bridgette’s nose froze her in place even more. He sat next to her. “The nurse suggested a death doula. She says they can help with the bereavement process and closure. Would that be okay with you?”

“I need to start work in two weeks. That means I need to start getting ready now,” she responded with aggressio. “How am I supposed to manage all of this?”

“Slow down. You got a job?”

The confusion of switching back and forth between grief and life was exhausting Bridgette. Cancer’s course though, pushing everyone who crosses it to their limits, something Bridgette had grown an iron shoulder to.

***

Bridgette’s phone rang as she drove home drifting in her thoughts. Multiple of these kids would get cancer one day. It brought tears to her eyes thinking about all the students she’d just met, but with a new understanding of the reality of death as a part of life she decided to put all her energy into creating well lived lives. The curriculum was bullshit anyway. It didn’t help her one bit when it came to the real life stuff and these kids needed things that would help them navigate here and now. 

She looked at the missed call list as she pulled into the driveway. The hospital rang across the screen with a voicemail. She was scared to check it. The last thing she needed was a crash on a Monday afternoon.

Bridgette hesitantly pressed the voicemail. As it rang she tapped her fingers on her lap. When the familiar voice of the nurse transferred through the phone line a sinking feeling hit her stomach. Her mother’s stability had spiralled.

Bridgette threw the phone at the dashboard. “Why now mom!!? Why now!” she screamed into the air pounding the steering wheel with a fist. It honked making her jump in her seat. She bawled harder than she ever had in her life. The tears clouded her vision as her body heated to the energy moving through her. 

Her phone rang again. She answered it hoping for some kind of distraction. This decision wasn’t happening now, not again, was all she could think.

“Hi B,” Uncle Todd’s voice answered.  

“How the hell do you know already?” She said, her voice louder than she expected. The anger firing at her uncle was so unlike her it caught her off guard. She took a breath.

“Oh, Bridgette. I put my name on her contact list last night. I’m not letting you do this alone, girl”

“You had no right to do that,” she said.

“I’m her brother sweet heart. But  they won’t let me make the final call knowing you are here. When I went in they said it might just be a matter of days  though.”

“I’m sorry for snapping.” 

“Bridgette, this is grief. You are losing your anchor in this world. Breaking free from composure is expected.”

Bridgette reached for the soft crumpled tissue in her purse.

 “She  is mumbling your name and they think she’ll have a difficult time letting go if you aren’t there.”

“I can’t go see her alone.”

“I will come”

Bridgette hung up the phone. Her bright day of hopeful thoughts crashed like the wave of a tsunami lifting everything she knew, expected, dreamed of off the ground and out of her grasp. 

The sun seemed painfully blaring as she stepped out of the car to grab some food for the hospital. Realizing what she was packing for, she slumped into the couch as soon as she walked in the door. Her eyes gazed through the reflection of the dark screen of the tv on the wall. The green paint started to irritate her reminding her of the hospital walls.

Bridgette’s phone ran again shortly after. She saw it was Uncle Todd again and noticed the time. An hour had past and she hadn’t even noticed. She ignored the call and walked over to the kitchen fridge. Nothing caught her attention. Bridgette repeated this going through the cupboards before slumping down onto the floor leaning back against the wall. The world in front of her started spinning. 

Click. Click. Click. Something sounded from the basement catching Bridgette’s attention. She cautiously walked towards the basement door and listened.  Screeech. Hesitantly Bridgette Tellingdale opened the door to the basement. She listened again but heard nothing. 

“Am I going crazy?” Thought Bridgette. 

She decided to follow the call coming from somewhere in the dark basement. She switched on the light and could see it’s flickering essence light the room at the bottom of the stairs. Each step creaked with the familiar sound of her childhood. Bridgette often played alone down there under the safety of her blanket fort in the company of stuffed animals.

Nothing sounded. She questioned what she was doing. The claustrophobia of the low ceilings started settling in. Over the course of her life her mother had collected enough to cover the walls with bins and boxes unevenly stacked. A few looked ready to topple.

On a rickety old dresser layer a mint green metal case. It stood out next to the pile of junk with nothing but dust around it. Something about the container begged her forward. Bridgette stepped over some loose wires towards it. 

There was a slightly rusted lock on the front. Bridgette wiggled it until it came undone. She opened the case curiously. Inside was a green typewriter. 

At the top of the stairs Bridgette heard her name being called. She slammed the case shut causing the dust on the dress to rise. 

“Bridgette?” She heard again as the creaking of the stairs followed. Her heart pounded. 

Todd appeared at the bottom. “Bridgette, what are you doing down here?” 

“I- I- I came to find one of mom’s sweaters. I- I thought she’d like it,” stumbled Bridgette. Suddenly she was pulled back to time and space remembering what she was meant to be doing right now. “Is my mom still here?” She asked.

“She’s calling for you Bridgette. We should go see her.” 
 
Bridgette felt her face tighten resisting the tears from forming. She needed to be a calm presence for Mom. She needed to let her know it was okay to go. Bridgette needed to be the one to release her.

Her throat scratched and in a monotone voice she asked her uncle to drive her to the hospital.

We were living together before the move and everything was great between us. I thought she would eventually move to be with me but as 6 years passed by, it never happened and the same reasons still exist mainly her aging mother. So I  don’t realistically see us being together in the next five years. 

We are seeing each other sporadically and less and less as each year goes by. I find myself calling her more than her calling me and when we do see each other it’s me that makes the effort to travel.  I find myself often feeling lonely.  I cherish the friendship we have and have warm memories of us together. If she was here with me it would be an easy decision. We get along effortlessly and it is just real good. We are friends first and foremost.

In the mean time, I met a great lady at my gym. She is friendly, fit and very attractive. We began chatting daily and went to coffee one day and the conversation was good. She’s a quality person and I could see myself with her. We have since gone on several dates and our communication level has picked up and I can tell she is very interested in me. Nothing sexual has occurred and I have not even tried.

My dilemma is what to do. I’m starting to feel massively guilty as I feel I’m cheating or monkey branching. I love and respect my long distance partner but my needs aren’t being met and I don’t see that result changing. I don’t won’t to lose her and the friendship we have. I think it is special and rare atleast for me. 

The new girl is great and I can see myself in an everyday romantic relationship with her with the added benefit of her being present everyday in my life. 

What to do? Obviously I need to decide and end one of them. Any advice?

Update: I know this post will generate a lot of your a cheater sentiment. I do feel guilty and I’m not looking for that perspective. I guess I’m looking for a debate or logical reasons to help me think through what would be the best decision.  I suspect I my viewpoint would be better answered from men who have experienced this before. Did you regret making one decision over the other?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to furnishing your living space, the right choices can truly enhance comfort and style. A sofa loveseat recliner set is an excellent option that combines elegance, functionality, and relaxation. If you’re unsure about why this set might be perfect for you, let’s explore the benefits.

### Enhanced Comfort

The primary advantage of a sofa loveseat recliner set is the comfort it provides. Recliners are designed for relaxation, allowing you to kick back and unwind after a long day. When paired with a sofa and loveseat, you create a versatile seating arrangement that accommodates both social gatherings and quiet evenings at home.

### Space Efficiency

Living spaces can often feel cramped, especially if you have limited room. A combined sofa loveseat recliner set takes up less space than separate pieces. Instead of having a large sectional or a bulky sofa, this set can fit snugly into your space while still offering ample seating.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/sofa-loveseat-recliner-set  
  
### Versatile Design Options

Another benefit of a sofa loveseat recliner set is the variety of styles and designs available. You can choose from modern, traditional, or contemporary aesthetics to match your decor. Whether you prefer leather, fabric, or upholstery in various colors, there’s a set that will complement your living space perfectly.

### Functionality

The multifunctionality of this set is another compelling reason to consider it. Many recliners have additional features, such as storage compartments or cup holders, which add to the convenience. You can enjoy movie nights or game days without the hassle of clutter, as everything you need is within reach.

### Family-Friendly Seating

- **Ideal for Family Gatherings:** A sofa loveseat recliner set is perfect for families. It encourages togetherness and provides enough seating for everyone, fostering conversation and connection.
- **Kid- and Pet-Friendly Options:** Many recliners come with durable materials that stand up to spills and stains, making them suitable for homes with children and pets.

### Health Benefits

Investing in a recliner is not just about luxury; there are health advantages too. Recliners can help improve circulation and reduce discomfort in your back and joints. If you have long hours of sitting or standing, the ability to recline can relieve pressure on your body and enhance overall well-being.

### Easy Maintenance

Maintaining a sofa loveseat recliner set is generally easier than managing separate furniture pieces. Many models come with removable and washable covers, or use materials that simply wipe clean. This ease of maintenance is a significant perk, especially for busy households.

\- as DV outshined Chomu Misra , so he was told not to fight with him so that their Chugali gang doesn't look bad 

\- i don't mind KV , DV , Kashish , Chahat , Chum , Shilpa , Rajat fighting among themselves . Chugali gang is so overconfident that they give footage to everyone else and they are running the show . Chomu Mishra keeps telling everyone ke KV ko ignore karo, DV ko ignore karo , isko ignore karo usko ignore karo ........ Ab inn sab ke bina footage leke dikhao

i really pray Chahat also stops giving attention to Vimal ( Rajat se lad le ) and hope Kashish won't go after Chomu now for love track ( i am getting a feeling it will happen now )

\-- BB clearly said DV and Avinash were "" *performing*"" the task which means clean chit to KV because it's better not to play and do what your heart says instead of *performing* for TV or footage 

\- KV was in top two .... it was clear now ..... i just hope KV got the hint 

\- Shrutika was seen sitting with KV and Shilpa later ..... this is why KV doesn't go against them because he knows they will be rejected by Chugali gang and they will come back to him only . maano yah na ..... you do need numbers in this show . KV knows what game shilpa and Shrutika are playing but he needs numbers .

I could purposely take some to use, but naturally I just don’t like to take photos when I’m having fun.

On the flip. I really enjoy selfies. I like them cuz sometimes I look cute, and having down time plus my phone camera and uh I’m not unattractive, that’s when I like to take my photos.

I just don’t have photos of stuff I don’t take them and none of my friends are the type of people to pull out their phone and say let’s photograph this. Most sites want 6 photos. I have a lot of photos cuz even tho I don’t take pics that often, taking selfies is honestly super calming and I love when I look super cute having a mini photo shoot. I just do it after when I’m alone. I can maybe try and take some photos and stuff w/ ppl (usually when I do it’s OF them or the thing I’m doing, not me in it). 

Any advice on this? I don’t think it’s a huge deal, but I literally have the sterotype only mirror selfies and some regular ones. Not even me doing cool things. (Again, no desire to use my phone. I’m most likely to take a pic when I go to the bathroom and see my outfit, not the place itself lol). Would you really care? Also do you have any other advice? I’ve considered this whole thing before and thought it would be fun/ cool but was always talking to somebody so even tho we weren’t dating I kinda didn’t want to do anything else. I’m now officially single and not talking to anybody so thinking of giving it another shot. I like being nice to people and treating them well,

Think I’ve gathered a few things:
Get coffee of something casual first. Basically although it can include money (which makes it diff than normal dating so to me w/ no experience seems notable), you want to treat it more like you would any other human. Which would include seeing if you get along, treating them well (which is obv) and NOT asking for money. (Again, that would be weird across the board lol).

I can be very sweet and supportive, so someone I could benefit from these qualities would be nice. Sh%t (cussing today), I like giving money to people when I have it.

Why do you guys seek SB’s?

I’m wondering the primary reason people want an SB opposed to just dating and maybe even polygamy.

Is it to advance the relationship further w/o having to fully see if compatible or spend a lot of time? Like if we get on well enough and have fun we can act like a couple, but can skip a lot of motions.

Because you’re busy and don’t want to have to give X to a relationship everyday, but still want your favorite perks when you want them?

Because it’s fun helping people? I would probably like helping guide younger girls and give them advice. Might feel weird sleeping with them but that sounds pretty hot at the same time… ngl 

Control? I don’t like being controlled and have not gotten this vibe. I just know I went on seeking before it was uhh, it was cool and amazing and I matched with ppl but was so busy with work. If you’re busy I could see that being a conflict. I’m less busy now but I def liked control over my own schedule. If I did this I’d wanna find out their needs and how to meet them tho.

Just what would your ideal SB have/ be like? 
Also I talk with emotions I’m just writing kinda

1gstlzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1gstlzv/the_perfect_breakup/, the Perfect Breakup 💔,"Let’s talk relationships 💬. Sometimes, you just know it’s time to...pivot 🔄. But breaking up isn’t just a personal matter—it’s an art form 🎨. It’s a campaign 🎯. It’s strategy, grit 💪, and just the right dose of chaos magic ✨.

When you find yourself bogged down and drained by the routine of domestic life—especially after your partner just had a baby (ugh, so needy)—it can feel like there’s no joy left. Sound familiar? That’s exactly how my March started.

So, what’s the solution? Remember, a positive mindset always looks for the most optimal way out. How do you really make your current (useless) girlfriend go away for good?

It might often happen that your girlfriend gets unhinged as she nears her expiration date. Plus, let’s be honest: the boobs are never the same after kids. When there’s an inconvenient circumstance like sharing a residence or having a child in common, I have the perfect discard solution for you: get that bitch arrested. That stupid woman was asking for it anyway.

\*Follow These 9 Foolproof Steps to Ensure Your Campaign for Freedom Leaves a Lasting Impression (and Maybe a Little Smoke)\*:

1. \*Lawyer Up\* : Like any good campaign, you need a solid plan—and that starts with retaining the best contentious family law attorney your wallet can afford. Nothing screams ""I'm serious about winning"" like someone who bills by the minute.
2. \*Strategize for Control\* : Work with your legal mastermind to craft a strategy so tight it could double as a Hulu thriller. Bonus points if you can sprinkle in some psychological chess moves. Let’s make sure the competition (a.k.a. your soon-to-be-ex) really understands who’s steering this ship.
3. \*Set the Stage\* : The secret to any great breakup? Timing and subtlety. If you’ve laid the groundwork right, they’ll never see it coming. Think of this as the “Shyamalan twist” of relationship endings—so well executed, it could win a Cannes Lion.
4. \*Apply Intermittent Pressure\* : Start with small provocations—maybe comment on how her cooking’s been “off lately” and she doesn’t do anything fun in bed anymore. Gradually escalate over weeks (or months, if you’re feeling particularly patient). This is a marathon, not a sprint, folks.
5. \*Turn Up the Heat\* : Here’s where it gets spicy. Experiment with creative tension-builders: confiscate her phone mid-scroll, “accidentally” break her coffee mug, or go full performance art and stage an argument over nothing again and again. My personal favorite? Push her away from the changing table mid-change and then keep this deranged mother at arms length from her infant child—psychological warfare at its finest.
6. \*Enjoy the Snap\* : Ever heard of the boiling frog metaphor? Slow and steady wins this race. Keep increasing the discomfort until you hit that sweet spot where she loses it. Once she’s lost her composure, you know you’ve done your job.
7. \*Call for Backup\* : When the inevitable meltdown happens, channel your inner Oscar-winning actor and call 911. Sound distraught, explain the “unprovoked attack,” and watch as the professionals take over. (Pro tip: Keep your story simple and repeatable. Less is more when you’re playing the victim.)
8. \*Sell the Narrative\* : By the time the authorities arrive, it’s showtime. Produce a scratch or two, shed a tear, and confidently explain why you’re the picture of reason in a world gone mad. Practice your “distraught but calm” tone—it’s a game-changer.
9. \*Seal the Deal\* : Once the dust settles and she’s out of the picture, head right to court. File that restraining order with all the fervor of someone claiming the last slice of pizza at a party. Bonus points if you can weave in some narrative flair about how it’s for the good of the child.

It was so fun to watch how one stupid whining woman gets handcuffed by two muscle dudes with guns, while she was crying about her baby. Ain’t gonna lie— a real turn-on. My ex was a bit of a sore loser tbh. Interestingly, the time of the arrest was 8:08 AM—don’t you find THAT somewhat symbolic? I do, personally ♾️ for like ever, haha.

So just like that, you have it: an award-worthy \*FINAL discard,\* aka the \*PERFECT breakup\* 🕺🏾 Ka-ching!

1gstfs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1gstfs4/the_dragon_prince_has_shallow_worldbuilding_in/,The Dragon Prince has shallow worldbuilding in regard to Dark Magic (The Dragon Prince)," In The Dragon Prince, the central conflict between Humans and Elves, as shown to us in the very intro, is that Humans began using Dark magic to bridge the gap between them and elves. For this act, the Elves banished ALL humans to the less magical and poorer half of the continent they are on.



Now that is a very strong start and gives an interesting premise for a world; the dark magic-wielding human realms in conflict with the Primal Magic-wielding elves, with the two sides having opposite but understandable, to some extent, views. 



The issue is that in all the human kingdoms today, there are a grand total of TWO dark magic users: a dad and his daughter. The humans that would rather be banished from a continent than give up dark magic, don't seem to care all that much about it now for some reason as dark magic usage has no real effects on their society or how they view the world. It is strictly something 2 people do. 



Dark magic is shown in the show to be a well-studied and practiced art with dozens of spells and conjurations using all sorts of animals, yet apparently, all these scrolls and research were done by 1 guy after drinking 100 cups of dark magic-enhanced coffee.



This isn't even advanced worldbuilding that only great stories use, it's the very bare-bones basics that are missing. All the show had to do was make up a standard ""Dark mage acolyte"" NPC model and help Viren as mooks or just be background extras to make the world feel more real.



For an example to prove my point, let's compare The Dragon Prince to Sofia the First, a show whose target demographic is A LOT younger than The Dragon Prince's target demographic. In Sofia, the First, every Kingdom has a royal wizard and said royal wizards are taught their craft in a specialized international school of magic. That being said the basics of Magics are also taught to young royals. While every kingdom has a single court wizard that doesn't mean the court wizard is the only wizard in the kingdom and there are more minor magic users roaming around the realms in a more freelance role. Retired great wizards are also sometimes called up in the case of emergencies. 



That paragraph above is way more fleshed out and developed than anything Dark Magic, one of the primary driving forces of the plot and the character interactions, gets, and mind you Sofia the First was aimed at a much younger audience and wasn't trying to market itself as the next Avatar.



This bare-bones worldbuilding for dark magic and its relation to the human kingdoms also cripples the plot. The reason why the Human vs Elf plot seems so dull and pointless past season 3 is that the main reason why the elves have an issue with humans, their use of dark magic, is no more since the only 2 dark magic users in the entire story are on the run. This leads to a situation where the writers have to create new and frankly not very interesting reasons for why elves would clash with humans as the humans already did what the elves wanted.



Had Dark magic been something that was as widespread and steeped into human society as the intro suggested, we could have gotten much more interesting and organic conflicts. Callum could struggle with trying to teach the other human mages how to use primal magic, get pushback, and be forced to reevaluate his positions when many of them either refuse or are unable to switch to primal magic. Ezran would have to deal with constant attempts at his life as people fear losing the thing that made their kingdom prosperous. Rayla could have an arc about learning that not all dark magic users are like Viren and accepting that the world is more complicated than black and white. 



Instead, what we got was the much-hated season 4, and the most disliked subplot in the entire series, the Sun Elf subplot.

1gsteol,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1gsteol/im_worried_this_female_character_is_written/,I'm worried this female character is written incredibly sexist,"(So the plot is about Johnny, our MC, finding himself invited into the inner circle (The society) of a big time hollywood director's son whose known for debauched parties. He is trying to strike up a relationship with a female member of the Society, Lyla, who when he joined gave him cryptic warnings about how he doesn't know what he's getting into)

Johnny was surprised that Lyla wanted to meet at a coffee Jamboree, with all the money this woman was probably making through her various business interests he assumed that she probably knew all sorts of secret, password-only places where, even if she was just going out for a coffee, she could get some of that rare 30$ a cup coffee that only high society knew about.

“You’re probably wondering why we’re in Coffee Jamboree,” Lyla said. She was wearing a green halter top and black yoga pants. She had a high-end Petit-Velo purse and pure white kicks on her feet. She had her hair combed over and hanging off her left shoulder and god damn she looked so good, Instagram good.

“Little bit, not going to lie,” Johnny said, “I thought being in the…Society…would get me access to higher-end places,” he smiled.

“Oh, don’t worry, you’ll get those too, but I like to come to Jamboree every once in a while,” she said, walking up to place her order. “I would like a triple mocha iced frap, whip cream, sprinkles and caramel drizzle, and chocolate drizzle, extra large, and I would also like a small vanilla Latte with Skim milk,” she said, ordering two drinks. That was a little curious, why would she order two drinks, judging by how intense that first drink was, that would probably be enough for anyone.

Johnny went up and made his usual order, “Medium black,” he said. This had to be the most confusing set of three drinks this barista had ever made.

“So how are you liking it so far?” she asked, asking Johnny about his feelings towards the Society.

“I think this is a great opportunity, but that said, I can see needing an exit plan, I feel like things could get a little hairy if I’m not careful,” he said.

“They can, and they will, when Penny OD’d, I thought it was all over, I really did,” she said as they waited for their drinks.

“Whose Penny?” Johnny asked.

Lyla sighed, “Penny, cutest little girl, she was only 17, Zoe thought Zak was being a bit brash, bringing in an underage girl, but he swore he was going to keep her safe. He was helping her career, getting her jobs, saw potential in her. She was in the first season of Donner and Thalia, have you seen that?” she asked.

“No, I mean, that name sounds familiar,” Johnny said, “Sounds like maybe something I saw a commercial or billboard for,” he said.

“Oh it was totally scandolus, see, she got a job as a female lead on a really ambitious project on a kids network, the industry touted it as ‘Price of Kings’ for kids, she’s riding high, at the peak of her career, set and ready to have an amazing life as the new teen IT girl, and Zak didn’t keep the leash tight enough. We warned him that if he was going to take such a tender girl under his wing he should keep an eye on her, that he owed that to her, but he didn’t, and he brings this little girl into a world thats fine with little girls doing what little girls are want to do,” she said, “Fucking idiots, no business sense, makes me ashamed of my gender,” she said, “Zak got her the treatment she needed, but as per-usual, she had proven herself a liability to the Society, Zak will turn his eyes once, and he’ll bail you out once, but after that, you’re a liability, and then,” she tossed her thumb to the side, “That’s the biggest thing you need to look out for, if you fuck up, maybe you’ll get one pardon, if it’s not too bad, if it’s not fuck a fourteen year old bad, he might help you out, but if you find yourself in more than two misunderstandings, he wont want anything to do with you, and you’re back on the street,” she said. 

The names “J-honey and Lylac” were called out. Johnny took his medium black, and Lyla took her crazy insane order in one hand and her modest vanilla latte in the other as they found a booth at the back.

“Umm, elephant in the room, two drinks?” Johnny raised an eyebrow as Lyla was getting her phone out.

“Hold on, I got to clock in,” Lyla said as she opened her camera and held her phone up, putting on the fake affectations of a smile and bubbly disposition “Hey everyone, just at Jamboree my total forever fave place to go, and I’m treating myself, I mean, what’s the point of life if you don’t treat yourself a bit? And I got to admit, I was a little naughty today, and I aske for whole milk, because who cares, it feels good,” she smiled as she took a drink from the straw of the insane drink, making sure to get it in full view of the camera. “I love their whip,” she said as she took her finger and scooped up a bit of the whip-cream topping and seductively licked it off her finger, sprinkles and dressing and all, “Kisses everyone,” She took the video, posted it, and then closed her phone.

Her tone of face instantly changed to disgust, “Poison,” she said, as she found a nearby waste-bin and slammed the Nine-dollar drink right in the trash. She took a sip from her vanilla latte with skim milk, almost like she was washing her mouth out with it.

Johnny was very curious, “Got to ask, what the hell was that about?”

“Yeah, it’s good for clicks, people like seeing women like me indulge, more importantly other women like seeing women like me, women like they want to be, indulge,” Lyla said. “See, any stupid bimbo can get a hundred thousand guys following her on Instagram, it’s criminally easy to do that, but theres no money to be made there, the influencer economy is built entirely on the female audience. What would be the point of being an influencer shucking purses and make up if the only audience you see are men who don’t have the two braincells necessary to buy those products for their girlfriends, if they even have girlfriends, I’m successful because I know how this business works. I have cultivated an audience of young women who think…well, they think they can be me,” she said, smiling. “They can’t, but they don’t need to know that, they like treating themselves to some insane fifteen hundred calorie drink once a week, and if they see me do it once every two months, it makes it okay for them, that’s why my statistics show over sixty percent of my followers are female, they love living vicariously through me, I’m their para-social bestie, they want to be me, so they buy the purses I hawk, they buy the make up I hawk, it’s turned out to be very profitable,” she said.

Johnny found himself thinking of his MeTube scam, “I think I get it,” he said.

“So yeah, just business, good business to be in, better than stocking shelves at Wal-mart at least,” she said.

Johnny usually tried to play it cool when around women, but he just blurted out, “You are insanely interesting,”

“Wait till you see me at a party, a real Society party, not that little get together you were first invited too, one where it’s just us and the entertainment,” she grinned.

“Entertainment?” Johnny raised an eyebrow.

“Yeah, that’s the thing about the Zak, he loves prostitutes, like LOVES prostitutes, can’t get enough, and he’s so fucked in the head, he even invites a couple guys for us girls, I’ve never induldged, but I’m pretty sure Chastity has at least been double teamed, and that was while she was dating Tommy, so I don’t know what she’s going to get up to now,” Lyla took another drink of her coffee. Johnny took a sip of his.

“So you keep telling me how dangerous it is to be here, but you’re doing it,” Johnny said, “That’s kind of a mixed message, how did you even get involved in this?” he asked.

“I was an extra, still building my following, trying to pay my dues in the industry, was a great angle, everyone loves an underdog, bucky little girl from Montana trying to chase her dreams in the big city, I had about eighty thousand followers by then, and Zak was one of them,” she said. “Somehow, some way, he heard about me, I got a part in one of his projects, small part, but a part,” she said, “It was in Spiderman’s Divorce, I had one scene in it, I was Gwen Stacy,” she said, “Crazy shoot day, my only claim to fame was falling off a bridge and getting my neck snapped, had to go to a fucking chiropractor after it, but he saw I had a following, so he made sure to get a couple selfies with me, had me retweet the project, probably earned him another hundred thousand views all said and done,” She leaned in laying her head on her hand, “He’s got a great entrance plan, but when he’s done with you, he puts two slugs in the back of your head and leaves you behind the barn,” she said, “You’ve seen it first had, look at Tommy,” she said.

“Tommy fucked a fourteen year old, that’s the kind of behavior that deserves two slugs,” Johnny said.

Lyla smiled, “Yeah, but do you remember how he mentioned Thailand?” she asked.

“Yeah, said he looked the other way,” Johnny said, “Fuck, what kind of shit does the Society get up to?”

“The most fucked up shit, that was a boy’s trip, when Zak tells you, now that you’re a part of the Society, that you’re going on a boy’s trip, get ready, because you’re about to see something totally fucked, Zoe wouldn’t talk to him for like three weeks after they came back from that shit, and Zoe fucking loves Zak,” she said.

“He said it himself, shes his ride or die girl,” Johnny said.

“She is, remember what I told you, shes playing the long game,” Lyla said, “Behind every fucked up guy who finds success, theres a fucked up girl who turns a blind eye,” she smiled. “She got in early, met him in highschool, glombed onto him, deals with his bullshit in this kind and loving way, lets him know that no matter how debauched he gets he’ll always have a mommy to come back to, really says a lot about his relationship with his own mom,” she said.

“Oh, sounds like you’ve got some dirt,” Johnny smiled, taking another drink of black.

“Oh yeah, I got like an entire deposition built up, it’s my insurance policy, if the things that Zak is want to get up too, when he’s with the boys, ever comes to light, I will be able to present the most insane testimony, enjoy a nice healthy dose of immunity for my cooperation, and get away scott free,” she said.

“I do like getting away scott free,” Johnny said, remembering his own several run ins with the law.

“So you need to be smart about this, are you one for temptation?” she asked.

“Depends on the temptation,” Johnny said, trying to snap into this cool persona thight might be able to impress this bombshell he was on a coffee date with.

“That’s a bad sign,” Lyla said.

“Hey, I’m not going to do anything too crazy, trust me, I’ve had my run ins with the law, it’s the worst fucking feeling in the world, I pride myself on my instinct to avoid that all costs,” Johnny said.

“We’ll see how long you last,” Lyla said, “See, us women, in the Society, we go in with a clock, I got like a year left at most, before I’m traded in for the new model, Chastity, if she’s smart she’ll get out the minute her series is officially renewed, but she wont because she’s not smart, so obsessed with her status, stupid bitch, she’s only 18, if she goes down the path, she’s got to worry about 5 years worth of scandals the Society is going to find  itself in, but for you, for one of the boys, you’re either in this for life, or you’re in this until you fuck up so bad, Zak can’t even look at you, and if Zak doesn’t want anything to do with you have fucked up so bad, no one is going to want anything to do with you, just know, if you want to be in the industry, and you lock yourself in with Zak, you’re locked in, this is the path you chose,” she said.

“I’m just a bean counter,” Johnny said, “I’m helping him out with financing his next project, shit goes bad, I play the accountant card,” Johnny said, “Just a boring accountant, no part of that madness,” he smiled.

“You know, my mom always said I should marry an accountant,” Lyla smiled back.

“Really?” Johnny asked, raising his eyebrows, was she sending him a signal.

“Or a doctor, or a lawyer, or any other profession that every mom in this country desperately hopes her daughter marries,” she said.

“Do you want to get dinner?” Johnny asked.

“I have a shoot for Petit Velo tonight,” Lyla said, “But maybe I could pencil you in later this week, how free are your weeks?” she asked.

“It’s summer vacation, I got about week left on my internship, then I’m all free, how’s next friday?” Johnny asked.

“Well, I guess I could, but no pictures, no iBook status, I can’t have a boyfriend, for reasons, it’s important to my Instagram career,” she said.

“I dropped iBook after that One-ID bullshit, you don’t got to worry about me,” Johnny said.

“One-ID, don’t even get me started on that, total corporate fascism,” she said.

“Thank god that got broken, thank you President Markway,” Johnny raised his medium black and Lyla clicked her small vanilla skim latte to it.

“Thank you president Markway,” Lyla smiled.",2,1731781255.0,writingcritiques,10,1.0,False

My dad had his own Coffee supplier company as far as I can remember, so I grow with a big shed outside  the house full of varieties of coffee with expansive industrial equipment. I remember helping close the bags and seal them, put them in cardboard boxes and the smell of this place was incredible.

When I left home at 19 years old to go in apartment, going to my parents house became a treat over time where I was drinking great coffee and having a good chat with them since I only had a cheap 15$ coffee pot at home and drinking energy drinks. 10 years, a wife, an house and 2 wonderful daughters later. My dad started to be old and closed his company to retire. He does not have the energy anymore to prepare good coffee so we bought him a good automatic espresso machine. He’s really happy with it but told me that he is missing the magic taste you can get with a manual one.

So it been 2 years now that I went down the rabbit hole, bought couple of setup and did so many tries, this sub really helped me to tweak my setup. I don’t have the budget for higher tier machine and grinder but for now, I can extract really good double and every Sunday morning since the last 4 months, my parents come visit me (not living really far) and I prepare them a good Cortado and they enjoy them so much. So, thanks everyone of this sub, this was really something important for me, and you helped me a lot! 

I would like to have an advice also, I have been buying fancy coffee from different local shop and really expensive one also to treat the whole family but going through tighter budget time and I need advice on a good day-to-day medium roast that I can buy on Amazon Canada, I recently tried the Lavazza Crema E Aroma which was ok in Latte/Cortado but I usually drink my double espresso straight. 

So yeah any feedback, advice or even comments on the setup is appreciated.

Also, how did you find the hole of the rabbit hole, what happened to get you into good espresso!

Wondering why a picture of my dog? His name is Latté of course!

I don’t really think it’s a fragrance clone, although it does smell like something I’ve smelled before. The opening smells like something beer-ish. I get a hint of alcohol somewhere, definitely not in a synthetic way. More in a whiskey, opened beer kind of vibe. On fragranticq it says the top notes are neroli pink pepper and bergamot. The pepper comes through the most I would say. (BTW I’m not a fragrance master or collector so if I’m wrong please tell me) the drydown reminds me of Intens café, but it’s richer and deserves the word “Café” more. It smells like a walk through an old Italian town with my parents when I was young, walking past old buildings, flower pots and with a cappuccino in hand. I smell the coffee note a little, but it isn’t that overwhelming, and I don’t understand why so many reviews are talking about it. Neither do I know how there are so many reviews, and still I never see this on tiktok insta or Reddit. 

About the projection and how it lasts, I don’t know yet. I heard it’s a bomb, and I agree, the opening is nuclear. And I feel like it might last a very long time. I wish noseblindness wasn’t a thing, because I want to smell myself all day wearing this tbf. 

This brand is amazing, the packaging is actual quality, it looks amazing even though the cap is see through. I can’t wait to smell all the other Carthusia perfumes because they all have an original story and packaging.

Anyways, if you want a somewhat safe blind buy from a unique “niche” house. Definitely go with this. High quality scent, great packaging. 

Smell: 9.5/10
Projection: (?) feels like a solid 7, somewhat moderate 
Lasts: (?) update tomorrow

Furnished, short term rental of a house through Furnished Finders website.
Signed a lease. Landlord was living abroad for a few years and renting out his house, never saw it between the past renters and us. He decided to move back to the US to the house immediately after we moved out. 

Paid a $1000 security deposit, house was a mess when we moved in. I’m talking 10 bags full of kitchen trash in the garage, gunk on the wood floors, crumbs on the mattresses. It was clear that he hired a cleaning crew to do the small surface stuff but not a deep clean. I took pictures of a ton of damage (carpet, wood floor, dent in the fridge, etc). I told the landlord about all of this when we moved in (in March). He said no worries, but sorry the house wasn’t clean. 

Now it’s time we move out on November 8th, I send him all the pictures of damage that i had collected over the summer. I ask if everything was al good when he moved back in, and he says “It all looks ok except for the master bathroom was fairly dirty and what happened to this?” with a photo of the coffee table which was just scratched up(when we moved in) nothing serious so I didn’t even take a picture. I told him that it was like that when we moved in, and asked when we will be able to get the security deposit back. He said he’ll send it the next day. A few days pass by and he didn’t send it, so I texted him again yesterday, no response. I text and call him today, and he finally texts me back saying he can send it but he wants to take out $500 for “work/cleaning/damage I had to do”. 

I need help figuring out how to fight this. The house was horrible when we moved in. It doesn’t say anywhere on the lease that he charges a cleaning fee. We left the house in much better condition than we found it in. I googled it and it says that according to CO law a landlord cannot charge a cleaning fee if the premises were returned in good or better condition? Is that true? 

Anyways, here is a copy and paste of the texts I sent to him immediately afterwards. 

“Could you point me towards where in the lease it says that you charge a cleaning fee? I’m having trouble finding it, not sure if it’s something that I missed. 
We didn’t damage anything, so I’m not sure why we would be charged for that. I sent you photos of the damage that was present when we moved in from your past tenants. 

I remind you that we told you when we moved the house/garage was disgusting with trash from past renters, and I told you about damage. We left the house in better condition than we found it in. What damage do you think we caused? I have photos of everything, so I’m curious what you think we did?”

Please give me advice on how to fight this. FYI I moved out of Colorado so I’m not sure if that affects things. ",1,1731780726.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1gst7k1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gst7k1,Fourth wood working project. Tried my hand at a hidden bookshelf door,"I build a pair of Adirondack chairs, a coffee table, and a TV stand prior. So this is my first medium difficulty project.

I used a TamBee heavy duty pivot hinge.i cut some scrap board to size and trimmed as necessary on the band saw to get the widest 8 inch thick door I could fit in the doorway (the total of the 7 1/2 board plus the 1/2 plywood backing). 

The wood is home depot 8 inch x 1 inch nominal (7.5 inch x 3/4 inch actual) common pine boards, aside from the back panel is 1/2 birch plywood. Trim is 5 inch x 1 inch nominal (4.5x 3/4 actual) the extension piece on the outer swinging edge to attached the moving trim is 2x1 nominal. Cut them all on either a 12inch harbor freight miter saw, harbor freight circular saw, or craftsman table saw.

I framed the exterior boards first to verify my fit, then cut the 1/2 plywood to size and attacked with counter sunk 3 1/2 inch construction screws. Once together I sized to the door to verify fit and motion.

I cut each shelf to size and drilled thepilot holes first. The shelves are glued with titebond that was held in place with 1 1/4 pocket screws while setting as well as corner and bar clamps. I double up the top and bottom boards by gluing and using way to many clamps. 11 3/4 spacing between shelves. Bottom shelf is 11 7/8 spacing.

I attached the 2x1 to the outer edge of the outswinging side to attach the trim to. Held on by 1 1/4 counter sunk construction screw.

At each step I measured what size cuts were needed rather than having a master cut list.

The main thing I would have done differently is to have slanted the outer edge to allow for the face to be slightly wider for a tighter fit into the doorway.

The trim isn't fully finished or properly attached just sized.

That was all I was able to finish in one day. 

Better trim will eventually be made and mounted. Wife wants it painted white. I am going to added a hidden latch and release. What will be on the shelves in the end is up the wife. My office/ study/ gaming room, a utility closest, and a second bathroom are behind the door.
