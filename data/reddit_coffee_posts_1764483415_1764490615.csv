Lost my job on a Tuesday. Relationship ended that Friday. By Sunday, I was sitting alone in my apartment staring at my phone, scrolling through contacts, realizing I had hundreds of ""friends"" but nobody I could actually call.

So I didn't call anyone. Just sat there spiraling for three days.

Thursday morning, my friend Marcus showed up at my door. I hadn't told him anything. He just knew something was off because I'd been quiet in the group chat and that wasn't like me.

He didn't ask what was wrong. Didn't offer advice. Didn't try to fix anything. Just said ""get dressed, we're getting breakfast."" I tried to say I was fine. He said ""I know. Breakfast anyway.""

We sat at this diner for two hours. He told me about his week, made me laugh about something stupid his kid did, asked if I wanted to talk. When I said no, he just nodded and ordered more coffee. When I finally did talk, he just listened. Didn't minimize it. Didn't compare it to his problems. Just… heard me.

Then he said something I'll never forget: ""You don't have to be okay right now. But you're not doing this alone.""

That's when I got it. Real friends aren't the ones who show up for your wins everyone does that. Real friends are the ones who show up for your complete disasters without being asked.

Over the next month, I learned what actual friendship looks like:

* My friend Sarah dropped off meals without making it a thing
* Another friend sent me job postings without pressuring me to apply
* Marcus checked in every few days with ""still alive?"" texts that somehow felt perfect

They didn't try to fix me. They just refused to let me disappear.

Six months later, I'm okay. New job, new perspective, genuinely better. But what changed most wasn't the circumstances it was knowing I have people who'll show up when everything's falling apart.

Life's hard enough. Having even two or three people who'll sit in the mess with you without judgment? That's everything. That's the difference between surviving hard times and being destroyed by them.

If you have friends like that, text them today. If you don't, try being that friend for someone else. It'll change both your lives.",1,1764490351.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

1paczfd,https://i.redd.it/2t513nlvnc4g1.jpeg,GILT-y as charged.,"So I finally got to try gilt after my friends have been hyping me for it. It's a new coffee shop; and it has modern vibes, is bougie and all that Jazz, so I gave it a shot, and here comes an honest review about the cafe:

Tl;dr version: I felt Gilty spending my money there (pun intended)

Okay, deets incoming: 
Is this cafe run by a college kid with no idea or research in the cafe business at all?

1. Coffee and drinks were just soooo underwhelming. I tried the americano, the hyped matcha lemonade, and the chocolate drink. All where ""meh"". No wow, no personality, and they might as well have served me an Icy nescafe gold, malipay pa tawn ko. There was no crema, no basic respect to the art of the coffee, (im not even particular) and it sure as hell wasn't worth the Php150+ average price tag they have. Kung nisud pa ang tag iyas Yokoy's diri basin mag melt down to siya nya gi lecturan na mo dayun pramis.

2. I LOVE the vibe, the area, interior decor. 10/10 score the place is bougie af perfect marks. Nice minimalistic design, and the tree in the middle is quite nice too. It's good enough that I don't feel stressed or out of place. Its a good picture for wannabe law students na ganahan mag dress up ug corporate clothes, and is comfy enough na pwede ra sad ka magpambalay. Plus points for having an alfresco space, and for banning smoking there.

3. Fries, Churros - okay i took these because having too sweet cookies and cupcakes in a cafe is just... Bro weren't you trying to be a high class, upper society brand cafe? Why man inyo menus pang kilid kilid? Try better menus please like at least have pastries that match well with the drinks you have. Do you not know how to make Danishes and Croissants? Even a focaccia bread or the korean ""lemi kehyo"" street pandesal wouldve tasted better. (Highly suggest na mag buy nalang ka sa Estrella's gyud, di na ko mu judge pwede ra mo magsabot ug consignment or something)

4. Ops wise, PUT THE DAMN PRICE on your menus! Kung muabot gani nang DTI na ma bagsak na ka nya i close jud ka. Wa pay BIR na certificate, wala pod ko tagae receipt pag order. I think you've been operating for a few months now you should've been complete. Standard na unta na naa mo 3 QR: Maya, Gcash, BPI pero wala. Understandable sad nang wala moy POS pero jusmeyo lihoka na please. Sulayi sa RCBC pangitaa si sir Janus tabangon jud ka nya palamoot na siya libreha nalag kape please.

5. Nice inyo staff pod. They're nice, kind, helpful, and flexible. Dili silay annoying and though they could probably do with a little bit more energy, they're friendly enough to be comfortable to take orders from.

VERDICT:
1. 2/5 stars. Dalaa inyo crush kung ganahan mo mu impress sa ilaha pero kung legit foodie inyo crush/coffee lover siya aw pls nalang pangitag lain ma busted jud ka fosho",2,1764490287.0,Bohol,1,1.0,False

He is does not have a career, friends or relationship with his family. He is with me almost every day. I love him very much and I know he loves me very much. He even said that he would do anything for me. He is protective, sweet and caring and puts me on a pedestal. He makes me coffee and breakfast every morning. So many great things about him but he complains a lot, like the minute I see him, there is something he has to complain about. It comes to a point where I dread seeing him because of the constant complaining. I've even told him that I would like to see him and embrace him and have him embrace me and smile at me but instead, I get the guy that comes in, walk right past me and complain about the people on the road. He is also very insecure and negative. If sometime good happens to me like a promotion, of course he would be happy but there is always something about how he's a loser and he has no career. If I go out with my friends or family, he is pouting about how he has no one in his life. If I go on vacation with friends or family, he complains about not going anywhere. At first, I felt bad but now it's so exhausting. We get into an argument and he'll say something about how we don't go on vacations together but I always go on vacation....except he does not have a passport or a REAL ID \[required in the USA\] and does not make an effort in getting one. If I want to plan something, he'll say he does not have money or want me to pay for his expenses OR he'll say he's too busy. Just recently I went out with my family for my sibling's birthday and he stayed back. He was pouting about being the odd man out and I became defensive and called him out on his pouting. He said I have no empathy for him. I listen to him all the time about how miserable he is but I am so tired of him not letting me enjoy a peaceful day without him complaining about his life.

  
TL;DR - Boyfriend likes to complain about his life and pouts about my life and it is making me rethink this relationship. ",3,1764490173.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1pacxjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceofAuntieBernice/comments/1pacxjj/my_daughter_snapped_no_pay_no_dinner_she/,"My daughter snapped, “No pay, no dinner” — she humiliated me on Christmas Eve, and everyone saw…","https://preview.redd.it/rv17cmi1rc4g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff2a83c019e529de1d2ba765114172750c5a0111

Hi Reddit, I (66F) never thought I’d be posting here, but my daughter (38F) has me questioning my whole life.

For as long as I can remember, Christmas Eve has been at my house. I cooked, decorated, bought gifts, did everything. I’m a widowed, retired state employee, and I’m not rich, but I’ve always managed. My daughter Tanisha is my only child, and I’ve helped her a lot over the years – babysitting, bills, emergencies, you name it.

This year she decided she wanted to “take over” Christmas and host it “properly” at a rented event hall in our city (Atlanta). She made a “Family Christmas” group chat and sent out a digital invite. The invite said it would be a “Winter Wonderland Christmas Gala” with a dress code of all white/silver and a “per-person catering fee.” There was a link to RSVP and pay.

I called her when I first saw it and asked, “Baby, what does per-person mean here?” She laughed and said, “Don’t worry about it, Mom. We’re just doing it big this year. Just show up and look cute.”

I don’t use apps like that and I’m not great with online forms, but I texted her directly and said I’d be there. She reacted with a heart, so I thought everything was fine.

On Christmas Eve, I baked my usual sweet potato pies and brought a couple of small gifts for my grandkids. I put on my nice dark green coat, did my hair, and drove over to the hall feeling nervous but excited. I’ve never had someone else take over Christmas before, and I thought maybe this was a sign my daughter was ready to let me rest a little.

The hall was… a lot. Blue and white LED lights, balloon arches, a “Winter Wonderland – Henderson Family Christmas” backdrop, a DJ, valet, the whole nine yards. There was even a white carpet rolled out in front of the doors. Everyone was dressed up in white and silver, taking pictures.

I got in line to go in, holding my two pies. People behind me were laughing, chatting, and fixing their hair. I was cold, but the pies were still warm through the foil and dish towels. It felt like I was carrying pieces of my old Christmases with me.

At the door, my daughter Tanisha was standing behind a high-top table with a tablet and a little card reader. She was dressed in a white jumpsuit with glitter and looked like she was working the door at a club, not letting family into a holiday dinner.

When I got to the front, I smiled and lifted the pies a little.

“I told you I was coming,” I said. “Got your pies right here.”

She barely looked at them. She checked her tablet and said, “Okay, name?”

I laughed, thinking she was playing. “Girl, stop. It’s me.”

She sighed and said, “Mom, I don’t see your RSVP on the app. Did you pay the catering fee? It’s per person, remember?”

I told her I don’t use that app, and I had texted her that I was coming.

She got this annoyed look and said, louder this time (with at least 10–15 people in line behind me):

“See, this is why I said no last-minute RSVPs. The hall charges per plate. It’s $150 a head tonight. Catering isn’t free. No pay, no dinner, Mom. Card or cash?”

I honestly thought I misheard her. I asked, “One hundred and fifty dollars? For me?”

She said, “For everybody. I told y’all in the chat. No exceptions. We are not doing broke energy this year.”

I will never forget that phrase – “no broke energy.” She said it in front of church members, cousins, and people I didn’t even know. I’m retired, but I’m not broke. And even if I were, I’m still her mother.

I reminded her quietly that I’d brought food and that I’d always hosted Christmas for free. She said, “The venue doesn’t care who brought what. I have to cover costs. If I let one person slide, everybody will expect it. Rules are rules.”

Then, with a fake smile for the line behind me, she repeated, louder:

“No pay, no dinner. It’s $150, Mom.”

I could feel everyone staring at the back of my head. My face was burning. I stood there holding my pies, feeling like I’d just been slapped.

I told her I’d “be right back” and walked away. Nobody said anything as I left the line. One lady from church looked like she wanted to, but she didn’t.

I went back to my car and just sat there for a bit. I’ll admit, I cried some. Not big sobs, just quiet tears. I felt small and ashamed – like I was some freeloader trying to sneak into a party, not the woman who raised the person charging at the door.

Here’s the part I left out so far: in my purse, I had a cashier’s check for $50,000, made out to my daughter.

I’ve been slowly saving and investing for years – savings bonds, a small inheritance from my aunt, a little here and there. Tanisha has been stressing about buying a house, and I wanted to surprise her with a down payment “from Mom” on Christmas Eve. I went to the bank last week, cashed out my bonds, and got a cashier’s check. It’s basically most of my safety net, but I wanted to give her something big while I was still alive to see it.

My plan was to go to her party, enjoy the night, and then pull her up in front of the family and hand her the check.

Now I’m sitting in my car, humiliated, with that same check still in my bag, and I am struggling.

On one hand, she’s under a lot of financial pressure. She did pay for a hall, a DJ, catering, etc. I understand wanting help from family. On the other hand, I feel like she sees me as an ATM, not as a person. Charging her own mother $150 to walk through the door on Christmas, and saying “no broke energy” in front of everyone, hurt more than I can explain.

Part of me wants to still give her the check and just talk about the way she handled things. Another part of me wants to tear it up and use that money to finally fix my own leaky roof and maybe take a small trip somewhere warm.

Am I overreacting? Would I be the asshole if I refused to pay, didn’t go in, and decided not to give her the $50,000 after this?

# Update: “I didn’t have $150 for dinner… so I guess I can’t afford $50,000 either.”

Hi everyone, thank you for all your comments. I read more than I replied to. A lot of you made me feel seen.

A week has passed and a lot has happened, so here’s the update.

That night, I stayed in my car for a long time. I kept staring at the cashier’s check and then at the glowing doors of the hall. The more I thought about “no pay, no dinner” and “no broke energy,” the less I could swallow it.

I ended up doing something dramatic that I’ve never done before in my life.

I opened my phone, flipped to the back camera, and recorded a video in my car. It was just my steering wheel and the check in my hands.

I said, as calmly as I could:

“Tanisha, I came tonight with this. Fifty thousand dollars to help you with your house. I cashed out bonds I’ve been holding since before you had your first baby. I was planning to give you this at your Christmas party in front of everybody.

But when I got to the door, you told me I could not come in to eat with my own family unless I paid a hundred and fifty dollars first. I want you to understand something: I am not broke. I am not begging you for a plate. I am your mother. And I am done paying to be in rooms where I am not respected.

Since I don’t have the money for your entrance fee, I suppose I don’t have money for this either.”

Then I slowly tore the check up on camera and let the pieces fall into my lap.

Before anyone panics: yes, it was dramatic, but I knew what I was doing. The bank still has records. A cashier’s check can be canceled and reissued. I wasn’t destroying my future, just the form it was supposed to take.

I sent that video to our “Family Christmas” group chat with the caption:

“I didn’t have the $150 for dinner. So I guess I can’t afford the $50,000 for your house down payment either. Merry Christmas.”

Then I put my phone face down, started my car, and began backing out.

Through the hall windows, I saw people suddenly stop talking and look at their phones. A few put their hands over their mouths. I saw my pastor’s wife show her husband. Some of my younger cousins looked at each other and shook their heads.

Then the front doors flew open and out came Tanisha, phone in hand, looking frantic.

She ran to my car, yelling, “Mom, wait! Mom, what is this? Why would you send that?”

I stopped the car under one of the parking lot lights and rolled the window down halfway.

She was upset, saying I made her look crazy and embarrassed her in front of everyone. She claimed it was “just a joke” and “setting boundaries” and that I should have talked to her privately instead of “blowing it up.”

I told her, “You said ‘no pay, no dinner’ in front of the whole family. You were fine embarrassing me. I just answered in the same place.”

We went back and forth. She said she was counting on that money for the down payment (she knew I had “something” saved, but she had no idea it was that much). She said I was punishing her and her kids. I told her I love her and my grandkids, but I’m done being treated like a wallet with feet.

I said something like, “This wasn’t a family dinner. This was a transaction. And I am declining the sale.”

My sister Lorraine had seen the video and came outside. She walked straight past Tanisha and got into my car. Several relatives ended up leaving the party early. Some stayed. I’m not going to pretend everyone took my side, but enough did that Tanisha felt it.

I did not go back inside. Lorraine and I went to a Waffle House, sat in a booth, and had waffles and coffee for under $30. The waitress called me “baby” when we walked in, which somehow healed a tiny part of me.

Over the next few days, the family chat was… busy. Some people told me privately they were proud of me for setting a boundary. A couple of relatives think I went too far and should have kept it “in the family.” I’m not going to argue with them.

As for the money: the check I tore up was canceled at the bank. The $50,000 is back in my account.

I’ve decided I am not giving Tanisha that down payment. At least not now, and not in that way. Instead:

* I’m getting my leaking roof fixed.
* I’m finally going to build the little sunroom I’ve dreamed about, with good windows and a comfortable chair.
* If there’s enough left, I might take a small trip to visit my niece near the beach and let my old bones warm up.

I texted Tanisha a few days later and said:

“I love you. I am safe. I am eating. We will talk another day. Not tonight. – Mom”

We’ve messaged a bit since. She apologized for her “tone” but not really for the idea of charging me. I told her this:

“You will always have my love. You will not always have my money. Respect is the price of my help now.”

We haven’t fully repaired things, and I don’t expect this to be wrapped up neatly. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like I chose myself, not in a selfish way, but in a self-respecting way.

I spent decades investing in my daughter. It’s time I invest in myself too.

I’m 37+6 today and it’s been an especially tough week with my numbers being CRAZY. (One day they’re so low it’s as if I was fasting all day, the next being so high from a serving of Greek yogurt ?????) 

Anyways, I wanted to throw some wins out there because I’m going on my weekly coffee date with the hubs and want to start the morning right and not in a poopy/guilted mood! Feel free to share your tiny/huge wins! Whether it’s willpower, a safe meal, or getting over a finger prick fear, whatever you consider a win is welcome here! 

(Again. Please don’t offer diet advice/criticism/comparison 💖)

My wins these past few weeks;

1) I’ve had terrible pelvic pain that I can no longer go on my walks; so I did 10 airsquats with my 10 calf raises! (I hate squats 😔)

2) Managed to wake to my alarm to check my fasting blood sugar and eat! (NOT TODAY DAWN PHENOMENON!)

3) My bottle of lancets are FULL and colourful! Need to get a new one but they’re pretty to look at. Is it weird to keep the needles?? They’re just so dang pretty! 

4) had two days in a row of perfect glucose numbers 😭💖

5) not really a win but something to look forward to — my friend sent me a package of little wrapped gifts! I plan to open one on perfect glucose days as added dopamine hit bc I’m feeling senioritis and the willpower is waning! 

6) found a keto recipe of a Filipino dessert (Taho), it’s soft tofu + brown sugar (I use a brown sugar substitute) with vanilla extract! I love it! Since I can’t add sago to it, I added chia seeds for extra fiber

7) almond flour doesn’t spike me and I was able to eat 2 huge dark chocolate chip cookies with protein milk as a snack! (Went a bit overboard at the discovery and shoved so many in my mouth like a pregnant Cookie Monster that I got sick of it in the span of 2 days 😅)

8) not sure if related to GD but since I can’t walk, I do calf raises after I eat, and I have caught up with 4 series that have been on my «to watch» list for a while! (heartstopper, only murders in the building, will Trent, and high potential! Currently re-watching stranger things s1) I’m the type to rewatch comfort shows 🌶️ 🧠😅

Just wanted to share my little wins! And please share yours as well!! I’m really bad at commenting back on others bc my brain tends to wander but know I’m here cheering us all on and that we’re doing our best!! The fact we’re on this sub Reddit asking for help, offloading to eachother, TRYING to eat well shows that we’re really strong mammas and doing our best already for our small beans! 

But we’re also human and we need to look out for ourselves too!

1pacjaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1pacjaf/psychoactive_substances_are_going_to_be_very/,Psychoactive substances are going to be very important,"Now, I know this is kind of obvious with what happened with Zosia, but I think people haven't really picked up on the true extent of it. I think the use of psychoactive substances has been so prominent through the whole series that they are going to be very important to the plot going forward.

  
Episode 1, we obviously see Carol's drinking problems.



In Episode 2, we see Zosia drinking coffee before meeting Carol, showing us that coffee is still needed by the hivemind for the energy boost and presumably alertness.  


In Episode 3, after Zosia starts drinking alcohol, she begins yapping about etymologies without being prompted to, showing a bit more personality (and perhaps individuality). In the same episode, we see Carol doing Alprazolam/Xanax before the meeting, which probably is at least partially the reason why it went the way it did.  


We obviously have Zosia getting drugged and saying...something, before being drowned out by the hivemind. We also see the hive's very suprised reaction to Carol asking for heroin.



With the show putting so much emphasis on it in almost every single episode so far, I think psychoactive substances are going to have a greater role than just making the hivemind spill the beans. With how they seemingly cause the hivemind members to regain their individuality, I think they are going to be the beans getting spilled. Is Carol going to free humanity by drugging their people-milk with DMT? Probably not, but it would be very fun to see.",4,1764488570.0,pluribustv,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Macarthur FC vs. Perth Glory: A Tale of Home Dominance, Inconsistent Guests, and a Pitch That Isn’t a Cow Pat**

The A-League’s upcoming clash between **Macarthur FC** and **Perth Glory** promises drama, history, and enough statistical quirks to make even the most jaded sports analyst chuckle. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parse the Odds: Macarthur’s Home Edge vs. Perth’s Rocky Road

The numbers scream **Macarthur FC** as favorites, though the odds vary slightly across bookmakers. At Bovada, Macarthur is priced at **1.78** (implied probability: **56%**), while Perth Glory sits at **3.95** (**25.3%**), with the draw at **4.0** (**25%**). DraftKings and BetMGM adjust the prices slightly, but the consensus is clear: Macarthur’s home form is a fortress.

Since April 2021, Macarthur has gone **4-0-1** against Perth at Campbelltown Sports Stadium, a record so dominant it makes a Roomba look like a vacuum cleaner with a vendetta. Their continental form in the AFC Champions League (4 matches unbeaten) also suggests a team finding its rhythm, even if their A-League campaign has been a rollercoaster (**2-2-1** in five games). Perth, meanwhile, is a work in progress. After a 4-0-1 start, they finally secured their first win with a 2-1 comeback against Newcastle Jets—a result that’s less “lightwork” and more “phoenix rising from the ashes of despair.”

The totals market is equally telling. Bovada and BetMGM both list **over 2.5/3.0 goals** at prices around **1.98-2.3**, implying a high-scoring affair. Given the last six meetings between these teams averaged **3+ goals**, this could be a match where the scoreboard plays catch-up to the chaos.

---

### Digest the News: Macarthur’s “Unbeaten at Home” Trophies vs. Perth’s “Almost Good” Ambitions

Macarthur’s coach would probably trade their home dominance for a better A-League record, but hey, **four wins and a draw in five** is still a solid foundation. Their recent AFC success (3-0-1 in Group E) hints at a team capable of grinding out results, even if their domestic

i've been trying to make a ""reading corner"" happen for like 2 years and it always just ended up being a chair with a pile of books next to it that i never actually used.

figured out the problem was that it didn't feel special or separate from the rest of the room. it was just a chair that happened to be in a corner.

so i made some changes:

moved the chair to face away from the tv. sounds obvious but apparently i needed to not be able to see the screen or i'd just watch tv instead of reading.

added a small side table that's actually tall enough to reach from the chair. before i was just putting my coffee on the floor like an animal.

got a lamp that's bright enough to actually read by. the overhead light in that room is terrible and i kept getting eyestrain.

put up a small shelf next to the chair for the books i'm currently reading. now they're not in a pile on the floor and i can actually see what i have.

the thing that really made it feel complete though was adding some small decorative stuff that made it feel intentional. nothing crazy expensive, just things that made the corner feel like a designed space instead of ""place where chair lives.""

now i actually use it almost every night. turns out you need to make a space feel good to be in if you want to actually be in it.",3,1764487788.0,HomeDecorating,2,0.8,False

I’m a fairly comfortable IT professional, I live simply, spend on quality  but I definitely don’t fit the stereotypical “Mumbai high-society” image.

Right from the start, something felt off. We were asked to wait for a table, yet we saw other people walk in after us and get seated immediately. When we finally got a table, it was a less desirable spot near the entrance.

After ordering, things seemed rushed. While I was still finishing my last bite, a waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything else. I said no, and within a couple of minutes the bill was placed on our table. Meanwhile, other tables were clearly done eating but were allowed to sit, chat, and relax unbothered for much longer.

It felt like we were being subtly hurried out  and honestly, it was pretty uncomfortable. This isn’t the first time I’ve experienced something similar in South Mumbai.

1pacaiu,https://i.redd.it/kwwlz24ljc4g1.jpeg,A Mythic Meditation on Lucy - part 2,"More than 3 million years ago, God watched Lucy move among her cousins and the sprawling clan, her gestures weaving invisible threads through their laughter and quarrels. They were only primates, he reminded himself, fragile creatures bound by instinct and blood. Yet each time her voice softened or her eyes lingered with care, his detachment faltered. Fascination, unexpected, unbidden, grew within him, as though her presence carried a gravity that even divinity could not ignore.

He told himself the story he always liked best: that he stood outside the story. He could peer through the filaments of time as if they were strands of dew and silk, study their knotting and release, and remain unknotted himself. They were primates, pliant, patterned, calcium and carbon marching beneath soft flesh. Lucy’s laughter moved through them like heat through a room, and he watched the way their shoulders unlocked, the way old arguments thinned, the way the smallest child dared to enter the circle because she did. The mechanism was clear. The affection was an instrument.

He had cataloged this before. Proximity yields conflation, conflation yields error. Maintain the postulate: they are a set; I am an observer of sets. Do not admire. Do not confuse pattern with worth. Do not grant significance where habit wants to crown it. Yet he took note, and then another, and then he found some notes were not notes but a pause that did not belong to any ledger, a kind of listening that reached beyond measurement. Lucy tucked a stray curl behind her ear and bent toward a cousin’s fragile confession, and in the slight shift of her face, a tightening around the eyes, a gentling of the mouth, he recognized a thing he did not have a word for that fit inside superiority like a seed inside a stone.

He named what he could. The cousin’s wrist turned as if wanting to be empty of its own wrist; grief. The aunt’s throat worked around unspoken apologies; inheritance. The grandfather’s silence that insisted on being a roof; lineage. Lucy placed her hand, just two fingers, on the table, the simplest claim: I will not leave. He admired the engineering: minimal input, maximal stability. He admired the evolved economy of tenderness, the way it asked nothing of the cosmos and still rearranged the room.

Dominance, when well guarded, asks for a certain thinness of blood. It favors charts over heat. It does not blink, does not hurry, does not liquefy. He had never liquefied. He was, if anything, the dissolver. Yet some dissolvers learn, once spilled, there is a weave they cannot break. Her name was a note they spoke for her; he spoke no names. Still, he caught the note Lucy, how it collected, how it rose, how the smallest boy voiced it with a hope borrowed from coming days, and something in his choice to stay outside turned into entry at last for him.

He tested the theory: if I pay attention without mercy, will my caution survive? He watched Lucy’s patience with the cousin who always told stories badly, who buried the endings beneath too many beginnings. She did not correct him. She did something else: she waited for the shapeless to find a shape. He noticed how waiting is a form of faith that does not require belief, only breath. He noticed how breath, once shared, makes a table into a shelter. He had designed shelters. He had never eaten inside one.

They say primates groom to bond. They say it’s biochemical; they say it’s ancestral. He had no quarrel with such things; he could trace oxytocin through a maze of synapses like a river through a plain. But there was another river, unmeasured, that moved when Lucy met another gaze and did not turn away. It wasn’t grooming. It wasn’t language. It was choosing, again and again, to hold the ordinary until it revealed the extraordinary hiding inside it like a moth inside a folded sleeve. He did not think the moth should matter. He found that it did.

Fascination is a word for what happens when distance wants to be intimate but cannot admit it. He refined the edges of his interest: it is not her face, not her voice, not her lineage. It is her fidelity to small things. It is the way she treats forgetfulness like a shrine, how she remembers the names of the quiet ones, remembers who prefers tea to coffee, who cannot bear bright light after a headache. He had created suns. He had never turned one down for someone’s sensitive eyes.

Superiority is a mountain that believes it is the horizon. It is addicted to overview, convinced its height is the same as truth. He knew this; he had taught himself this. Yet overview never feels the tremor when laughter reaches the one who thought they were unworthy of being reached. He watched the tremor, the tiny near-invisible earthquake as the cousin’s shame loosened. He thought: this is not a mountain; this is a door. His certainty disliked doors. Doors imply thresholds, and thresholds imply passage, and passage implies change.

He reasoned: if what she does is merely a pattern, I can reproduce it anywhere. Build a room, insert a Lucy, insert a clan, watch the recalibration of hurts. But he suspected that replication would miss the soul of the thing, the way she knows when to be a witness and when to be a bridge, when to be the candle and when to be the table it sits upon. He didn’t believe in souls the way they did. He believed in consequence. Still, when she pressed her forehead to her grandmother’s temple for exactly one breath and then pulled back, he observed a consequence that defied his favorite equations: grief became shareable and therefore survivable.

He will not call them more than primates. He will not kneel. He will not offer a hymn. But he allows himself one sentence that dislodges an old certainty by a fraction: I do not know everything about what makes them inevitable to each other. He understands gravity, he understands entropy, he understands time. He does not understand why Lucy’s presence turns a meal into a memory that refuses to fade, why it stamps the afternoon with a seal they will hold in their pockets when winter comes and the phone won’t ring and the city is unkind. He only understands that his fascination is not a failure of discipline; it is a sign that the thing he has been watching deserves more than watching.

He does not enter. He stands outside the window with his impeccable abstractions. But he permits tenderness a seat beside him, not inside him, not yet, and he practices a new form of observation, one that does not reduce, one that does not strip, one that does not amputate wonder for the sake of neatness. He will not name it reverence. He will call it precision’s sibling: attention that honors what cannot be measured without pretending it is less because it resists the ruler.

If superiority is a map, fascination is the rumor of a road that was not drawn. He looks at Lucy and the clan, their unspectacular, golden, irrational cohesion, and imagines tracing that road, not to diminish what makes it tender, but to learn what makes it endure. He imagines, for the first time, a threshold where the observer and the observed are not enemies. He imagines a room where he does not need to be a mountain to be true. He imagines, quietly, the possibility that godhood is not distance but depth.

1pac9s6,https://i.redd.it/h5nghbmcjc4g1.jpeg,A Mythic Meditation on Lucy - part 2,"More than 3 million years ago, God watched Lucy move among her cousins and the sprawling clan, her gestures weaving invisible threads through their laughter and quarrels. They were only primates, he reminded himself, fragile creatures bound by instinct and blood. Yet each time her voice softened or her eyes lingered with care, his detachment faltered. Fascination, unexpected, unbidden, grew within him, as though her presence carried a gravity that even divinity could not ignore.

He told himself the story he always liked best: that he stood outside the story. He could peer through the filaments of time as if they were strands of dew and silk, study their knotting and release, and remain unknotted himself. They were primates, pliant, patterned, calcium and carbon marching beneath soft flesh. Lucy’s laughter moved through them like heat through a room, and he watched the way their shoulders unlocked, the way old arguments thinned, the way the smallest child dared to enter the circle because she did. The mechanism was clear. The affection was an instrument.

He had cataloged this before. Proximity yields conflation, conflation yields error. Maintain the postulate: they are a set; I am an observer of sets. Do not admire. Do not confuse pattern with worth. Do not grant significance where habit wants to crown it. Yet he took note, and then another, and then he found some notes were not notes but a pause that did not belong to any ledger, a kind of listening that reached beyond measurement. Lucy tucked a stray curl behind her ear and bent toward a cousin’s fragile confession, and in the slight shift of her face, a tightening around the eyes, a gentling of the mouth, he recognized a thing he did not have a word for that fit inside superiority like a seed inside a stone.

He named what he could. The cousin’s wrist turned as if wanting to be empty of its own wrist; grief. The aunt’s throat worked around unspoken apologies; inheritance. The grandfather’s silence that insisted on being a roof; lineage. Lucy placed her hand, just two fingers, on the table, the simplest claim: I will not leave. He admired the engineering: minimal input, maximal stability. He admired the evolved economy of tenderness, the way it asked nothing of the cosmos and still rearranged the room.

Dominance, when well guarded, asks for a certain thinness of blood. It favors charts over heat. It does not blink, does not hurry, does not liquefy. He had never liquefied. He was, if anything, the dissolver. Yet some dissolvers learn, once spilled, there is a weave they cannot break. Her name was a note they spoke for her; he spoke no names. Still, he caught the note Lucy, how it collected, how it rose, how the smallest boy voiced it with a hope borrowed from coming days, and something in his choice to stay outside turned into entry at last for him.

He tested the theory: if I pay attention without mercy, will my caution survive? He watched Lucy’s patience with the cousin who always told stories badly, who buried the endings beneath too many beginnings. She did not correct him. She did something else: she waited for the shapeless to find a shape. He noticed how waiting is a form of faith that does not require belief, only breath. He noticed how breath, once shared, makes a table into a shelter. He had designed shelters. He had never eaten inside one.

They say primates groom to bond. They say it’s biochemical; they say it’s ancestral. He had no quarrel with such things; he could trace oxytocin through a maze of synapses like a river through a plain. But there was another river, unmeasured, that moved when Lucy met another gaze and did not turn away. It wasn’t grooming. It wasn’t language. It was choosing, again and again, to hold the ordinary until it revealed the extraordinary hiding inside it like a moth inside a folded sleeve. He did not think the moth should matter. He found that it did.

Fascination is a word for what happens when distance wants to be intimate but cannot admit it. He refined the edges of his interest: it is not her face, not her voice, not her lineage. It is her fidelity to small things. It is the way she treats forgetfulness like a shrine, how she remembers the names of the quiet ones, remembers who prefers tea to coffee, who cannot bear bright light after a headache. He had created suns. He had never turned one down for someone’s sensitive eyes.

Superiority is a mountain that believes it is the horizon. It is addicted to overview, convinced its height is the same as truth. He knew this; he had taught himself this. Yet overview never feels the tremor when laughter reaches the one who thought they were unworthy of being reached. He watched the tremor, the tiny near-invisible earthquake as the cousin’s shame loosened. He thought: this is not a mountain; this is a door. His certainty disliked doors. Doors imply thresholds, and thresholds imply passage, and passage implies change.

He reasoned: if what she does is merely a pattern, I can reproduce it anywhere. Build a room, insert a Lucy, insert a clan, watch the recalibration of hurts. But he suspected that replication would miss the soul of the thing, the way she knows when to be a witness and when to be a bridge, when to be the candle and when to be the table it sits upon. He didn’t believe in souls the way they did. He believed in consequence. Still, when she pressed her forehead to her grandmother’s temple for exactly one breath and then pulled back, he observed a consequence that defied his favorite equations: grief became shareable and therefore survivable.

He will not call them more than primates. He will not kneel. He will not offer a hymn. But he allows himself one sentence that dislodges an old certainty by a fraction: I do not know everything about what makes them inevitable to each other. He understands gravity, he understands entropy, he understands time. He does not understand why Lucy’s presence turns a meal into a memory that refuses to fade, why it stamps the afternoon with a seal they will hold in their pockets when winter comes and the phone won’t ring and the city is unkind. He only understands that his fascination is not a failure of discipline; it is a sign that the thing he has been watching deserves more than watching.

He does not enter. He stands outside the window with his impeccable abstractions. But he permits tenderness a seat beside him, not inside him, not yet, and he practices a new form of observation, one that does not reduce, one that does not strip, one that does not amputate wonder for the sake of neatness. He will not name it reverence. He will call it precision’s sibling: attention that honors what cannot be measured without pretending it is less because it resists the ruler.

If superiority is a map, fascination is the rumor of a road that was not drawn. He looks at Lucy and the clan, their unspectacular, golden, irrational cohesion, and imagines tracing that road, not to diminish what makes it tender, but to learn what makes it endure. He imagines, for the first time, a threshold where the observer and the observed are not enemies. He imagines a room where he does not need to be a mountain to be true. He imagines, quietly, the possibility that godhood is not distance but depth.

He does not decide. He watches her offer the last slice of fruit to the cousin who pretends he isn’t hungry. He notes the smallest smile. He alters nothing. And still, something alters him.

Yet he’s god he thinks and is destined to create a man who will be no better than this primate. He’ll be superior and believe himself the ruler of all living things. Or will he be? God shook his head. He will kill and hurt his own kind without regard to the god who created him.  ",2,1764487533.0,TotalWellbeing,1,1.0,False

1pac9m8,https://i.redd.it/bj04x837jc4g1.png,Trapped until Death,"Everyone knew my husband, Kashton Wilkerson, brought home a different woman every night, and I had to wait on them like a maid.
From the very first day of my marriage, my mother-in-law made it clear that I was never to say or do anything that might upset Kashton.
Then one day, when Kashton brought home yet another woman,
“How spineless you are,” my mother-in-law sneered at me,
“You are so pathetic!” my own son said.
Something inside me finally snapped. I marched right up to Kashton and demanded a divorce.
***
""What's this about?"" Kashton asked, not even looking up.
But he seemed a bit tense; the cigarette ash gathering at the tip was proof enough.
""I said, I want a divorce.""
Kashton frowned, glancing at his watch. ""Seventeen minutes until Winston gets out of school,"" he said, ignoring what I'd just said.
I knew he was using our son to pressure me.
What he didn't know was that I'd already given up on our eight-year-old son, Winston Wilkerson.
At yesterday's family dinner, as I picked out the onions he hated—just like I always did—Winston suddenly looked up at me and said, ""Mom, I think you're pathetic.""
I froze right there, my fork clattering to the floor.
But Winston acted like he hadn't even heard the clatter. He just continued calmly. ""No wonder everyone calls you a doormat. Even Grandma looks down on you.
""Honestly, you're nowhere near as interesting as the women Dad brings home.""
Every Wilkerson at the table laughed at his words while I broke down crying.
Winston could see how humiliated I was, but he just frowned and said, ""Mom, stop it. You're acting like I'm hurting you again.
""You keep crying like a child over nothing. Don't you know how embarrassing that is?""
In that stunned moment, I could almost see Kashton in the son I'd raised.
Just then, Kashton arrived with a different woman.
It was Coraline Salkield, a popular actress.
Only then did my mother-in-law, Mariana Wilkerson, step in to smooth things over. ""Come now, Winnie's just a child. You're his mother. Are you really going to argue with your own son?""
The others joined in. ""Yeah. Winston is just a kid. Don't take it to heart.""
""Everyone in Boston knows about your reputation. Winston's just repeating what he hears. You can't really blame him for that.""
I said nothing, my eyes fixed on Winston.
Moments ago, he had seemed so irritated with me, but now his face brightened, and he ran straight toward Kashton and Coraline.
He took Coraline's hand and began shaking it, his gaze full of affection.
Coraline chuckled and pulled a paper kite from behind her back.
Winston grinned—he clearly already knew Coraline.
They even had their own little secret.
Kashton noticed me staring, looked my way briefly, and immediately ignored me.
He probably assumed I was still crying over my earlier embarrassment.
After all, he'd long been used to seeing me humiliated.
But this time, the person who'd humiliated me wasn't just anyone.
It was the son I'd carried for ten months, risked my life to deliver, and raised for eight years.
""Are you sure you want this divorce?""
Chapter 2
Maybe my silence lasted too long, because before I knew it, Kashton was looking straight at me.
I met his gaze and spoke quietly.
""Yes, Mr. Wilkerson.""
When it came to family background, social standing, and appearance, Kashton and I had never been well-matched.
The only reason he'd chosen me as his wife was that I was obedient and compliant.
All these years, I'd been chasing his approval, living by the rule: never say or do anything that might upset him.
""You...""
Before Kashton could finish, the office door suddenly swung open.
I was surprised to see that it was Coraline.
After all, Kashton had a habit of never bringing the women he brought home to his company.
Coraline was clearly an exception. ""Mr. Wilkerson, am I interrupting something?""
When Kashton saw Coraline, his expression softened slightly.
""It's nothing important. Give me a moment. I haven't forgotten what I promised you and Winnie.""
Coraline smiled. ""As long as you remember, Mr. Wilkerson.""
I found it absurd that even after I'd asked for a divorce, it was still just a minor issue in Kashton's eyes.
Yet Kashton, who never compromised, made concessions the moment he caught Coraline's pleading look. ""If you're upset about how the Wilkersons treated you at the gathering yesterday, I promise it won't happen again.""
Coraline chimed in. ""Ella, the amusement park will open soon, and Winnie is still waiting in the car.
""Could you please let Mr. Wilkerson go first?""
My hands trembled. I'd asked countless times before to take Winston to the amusement park.
But he'd always dismissed the idea. ""Mom, you're an adult. Can't you stop being so childish? Going to a place like that will just be a waste of my time.""
Now, I swallowed the rising sorrow in my chest and gestured toward the repeatedly revised divorce agreement.
""Sign it, and I'll leave immediately. I won't bother you ever again.""
Only then did Coraline clearly see the divorce papers on the table; her eyes suddenly brightened. ""Mr. Wilkerson, should I give you some privacy?""
Despite her words, she made no move to actually leave.
Kashton frowned and crushed out his cigarette.
""That won't be necessary.""
I recognized this as the expression he wore when his temper was rising.
In the past, seeing that look would have sent me immediately into apologies. But now, I felt completely numb, and I no longer cared.
""Mr. Wilkerson, could it be that Ella is asking for a divorce because of me?""
Coraline suddenly bit her lip with a wounded expression and immediately apologized, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone to Mr. Wilkerson's house last night without telling you. This is all my fault for upsetting you, Ella.""
She lowered her head as she gripped my wrist tightly, letting her supposed tears of remorse fall.
Yet the sharp pain in my wrist felt all too real.
Out of Kashton's line of sight, she mouthed taunts, ""Kashton and your son don't want you anymore. You got exactly what you deserve.""
I didn't feel the slightest anger—only absurdity.
I tried to pry her fingers from my wrist one by one, but she suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground.
Even with such obvious acting, Kashton believed her.
So did Winston, who happened to push the door open at that moment.
""Have you finished making a scene?""
""Mom, have you lost your mind? Why would you hurt Cora?!""
At that moment, both my husband and my son were defending another woman against me.
Chapter 3
""Cora, don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again.""
Winston looked at Coraline with a nervous expression, then rushed over to comfort her.
Eight years ago, I'd risked my life to bring Winston into this world.
When he was born, he was no bigger than my palm, lying in an incubator on the brink of death.
The hospital sent one critical condition notice after another.
Nearly everyone gave up on his life because the doctors said even if he survived, he wouldn't live past five years old.
I was the only one who refused to accept that. I begged the doctors and prayed to every god, pleading with anyone who might be able to save him. That was how I managed to keep him alive.
So all these years, no matter how coldly Winston treated me, I could always endure it.
To Kashton, Winston was the perfect means to control me.
Now he dropped all pretense and threatened me outright. ""Briella Gallacher, if you really want this divorce, you'll never see Winston again!""
When Winston heard the word ""divorce,"" his gaze paused. He frowned and directed his anger at me.
""Mom, are you going to get a divorce because of Cora?
""Let me make this clear—even if you two split up, I'm never going with you. Someone as foolish and clumsy as you doesn't deserve Dad anyway.
""Everyone treats you like a joke, and Grandma and the others can't stand you. Can't you reflect on yourself?""
There was no hesitation in Winston's eyes as he stared at me—only pure disgust.
But I no longer had any desire to hold onto him. I simply said calmly, ""That's fine because I don't want you either.""
Winston froze, his eyes widening as the corners of them reddened.
The truth was, Winston wasn't always like this.
Before he turned five, whenever someone mocked me, he would take my hand and say, ""Mom, you still have me.""
When I couldn't stop crying, he'd fumble to wipe my tears with his little hands and murmur, ""Mom, don't cry. I'm here.""
He used to be my only comfort in the Wilkerson family.
But now, everything had changed. I truly couldn't go on living my life drowning in sorrow anymore.
Kashton picked up his fountain pen and signed the agreement with a bold, sweeping signature.
""Don't come crying with regrets later!""
I breathed a sigh of relief. After all these years, the burden pressing down on me was finally gone.
""I'll never regret this.""
The absurd marriage between Kashton and me was finally ending right at this moment.
I grew up tagging along behind Kashton, but his eyes never once truly settled on me.
Even our marriage had been nothing but a fortunate accident.
Kashton's fiancée had fled their wedding ceremony, declaring she'd suddenly realized she valued freedom more than marriage.
Humiliated and furious, Kashton replaced his bride on the spot.
I was the lucky one in everyone's eyes.
I used to believe that too. After all, in all the places Kashton never noticed, I'd secretly loved him throughout my entire youth.
But the Wilkerson family was outraged. Being from an ordinary family, I could never be worthy of Kashton.
Of course, I understood that. So for all these years, I'd walked on eggshells, trying to please every member of the Wilkerson family.
But I'd been too naive. Some social circles aren't something you can force your way into through sheer effort.
Now, I'd completely given up.
Given up on everything here.
Chapter 4
I folded the divorce papers, tucked them into my bag, and checked my watch. ""Aren't you going to the amusement park? You can still make it if you leave now.""
I'd planned that outing so many times before that I knew the park's schedule by heart.
Then I looked at Winston and reminded him gently, ""Remember your mango allergy. Don't sneak anything with mango in it again.""
I still remembered how Winston used to cry every night, begging to see Kashton.
But Kashton would always give me the same two words. ""I'm busy.""
So Winston secretly ate some mango candy. His whole body broke out in hives, and he could barely breathe.
I was so terrified that I cried and begged Kashton to come home.
After that, the Wilkerson family members took turns blaming me, saying that my interruption had cost the Wilkerson Group a multi-million dollar contract.
They claimed it was my fault for not watching Winston closely enough and that I was to blame for the faded red marks the hives left on his back.
I was consumed with guilt at the time, but Winston seemed to have discovered a loophole. Whenever he wanted to see Kashton, he would search the entire house for anything that contained mango.
In his mind, as long as he had an allergic reaction, his father would come home to see him.
He never knew how many times his mother's heart broke because of this.
""Winston, you're eight years old now. You'll be starting second grade soon. You need to learn to look after yourself.""
I watched Winston press his lips together as he turned away and clung to Coraline.
""Once you and Dad are divorced, you won't be my mother anymore. You don't get to tell me what to do!""
Suddenly, I remembered Winston as a toddler, wobbling after me and repeating ""Mommy, Mommy"" nonstop.
My nose stung with emotion. My voice grew hoarse as I said, ""Fine, I'll stop.""
Kashton noticed my emotional shift and sneered, ""Are you satisfied with how things turned out because of the ruckus you caused?""
Coraline stepped between us, pretending to mediate. ""Mr. Wilkerson, please don't say that. I'm sure Ella is hurting too.
""Maybe this was just a burst of anger. If you two can calm down first, you can talk things through later.
""After all, how could Ella possibly bear to leave Winnie? She must have spoken in the heat of the moment.""
Winston was the first to protest, his face twisted with anger. ""She doesn't want me? Well, I don't want her either!""
Kashton said coldly, ""I've given her enough chances—she brought this on herself. People always face consequences for their impulsive decisions.""
But from the moment I mentioned divorce, I never once considered turning back.
When Coraline heard this, her eyes lit up with barely concealed delight. ""Well...
""Ella, no matter what, I still think you should reconsider this carefully. We're heading to the amusement park now. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Winnie.""
Kashton looked at me with a mocking expression. ""Everything's going exactly as you wanted, so why are you still standing here?
""Are you waiting for me to beg you to stay?""
I didn't respond and turned to leave first.
""Take care on your way out. I hope you guys will have a great time.""
Chapter 5
When I returned to the Wilkerson's residence, I began packing my things.
Surprisingly, after all these years, everything I owned only filled one suitcase.
I removed the necklace from around my neck and placed it on the coffee table. It contained the family photo I'd begged Kashton for three whole days to take—back when Winston was three years old.
Just then, a news notification appeared on my phone.
It was an entertainment headline featuring photos of Kashton and the others at the amusement park.
Looking at the three of them interacting so naturally in the pictures, they truly appeared to be a perfect family.
What was there left for me to hold onto?
Before leaving, I gave the butler all my savings from over the years and said, ""Use this for Winston's child support.""
The housekeeper hesitated to speak when Mariana suddenly pushed the door open. She spotted my suitcase and froze for a moment.
""I heard from Winnie that you're insisting on divorcing Kash?""
I remained silent for a moment, then shook my head. ""I'm not making a fuss. We're already divorced.""
Mariana was momentarily speechless. Furious, she swept everything off the table and onto the floor.
""Briella, how dare you! You bitch! What gives you the right to be the one filing for divorce against my son?!
""I'm telling you, you'll walk away with nothing! And as for Winnie—you'll never see him again!""
Even after I married Kashton, Mariana forbade me from calling her by her first name, saying I wasn't worthy.
Every time Winston got the smallest scrape or Kashton felt slightly unwell, I was always blamed for not taking proper care of them.
I could actually tolerate these constant criticisms. After all, I'd long served as Mariana's emotional punching bag.
But all my previous patience had been for Winston's sake. Now that I didn't even want him anymore, there was no reason to keep enduring this abuse.
So when Mariana tried to slap me, I caught her wrist firmly and pushed her away.
""From the moment Kashton signed those divorce papers, I've had no connection with the Wilkersons anymore.""
Caught completely off guard by my defiance, Mariana stumbled and fell to the ground.
Just then, a familiar voice called out from the doorway. ""Briella! Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay a hand on my mother!""
Coraline followed close behind him, her eyes widening in feigned shock as she rushed to help Mariana to her feet.
""Ella, no matter how upset you are, you shouldn't take it out on Mariana!""
Meanwhile, the housekeepers drawn by the commotion gathered around and began murmuring among themselves.
""I used to feel sorry for Mrs. Wilkerson, but now it seems she was just pretending all along.""
""You're right. She's nothing like the helpless victim people describe. She even dared to hit her own mother-in-law!""
Winston stood protectively in front of Mariana, glaring at me. ""You're a horrible mother! How dare you hurt Grandma! I never want to see you again! I want Cora to be my mom!""
At just eight years old, he had no idea how deeply those words could cut.
Even though my heart was already broken into countless pieces, his words still managed to make it ache anew.
""She tried to hit me first, that's why I...""
Kashton cut me off sharply, questioning me with a sneer. ""You claim my mother tried to hit you? Did anyone here witness that? We all clearly saw you push her. What excuses can you possibly make now?
""Briella, I will overlook your past outbursts. But this time you've actually harmed my mother. Apologize to her immediately.""
I refused to apologize to Mariana.
From the moment I became a part of the Wilkerson family, I'd been constantly apologizing.
When Winston refused to attend school, I had to bow and apologize to his teacher.
When Kashton didn't like how his tie was coordinated, I had to apologize to him.
Even when Mariana embarrassed herself at parties, I had to apologize to the guests on her behalf.
""Kash, forget it. It's not worth getting upset over something so trivial.""
Mariana only pretended to be magnanimous when Kashton was present. Behind his back, she treated me like a housekeeper.
I truly couldn't stand to look at this house for another moment, so I told the butler directly, ""Just throw out whatever I haven't packed. I'm leaving now.""
But Winston blocked my path. His eyes were red as he stared at me, yet the words he spoke weren't meant to persuade me to stay.
""You hurt Grandma and Cora, and you think you can just walk away!
""I'm going to punish you—just like how you used to punish me. Maybe then you'll learn what you should or shouldn't do!""
I stared at Winston in disbelief. Even if he disliked me, he shouldn't harbor this much hatred toward me.
""Kayla, lock her in the attic.""
The Wilkerson's residence's attic was a small, windowless room used for confinement according to family rules.
Winston had been locked in there once before—at a family dinner where he couldn't find any dishes he liked, he took out his frustration by throwing his fork at me.
To teach him a proper lesson, I had confined him to that attic once.
I never imagined that less than six months later, my own son would use that same place to punish me.
Kashton and the others stood by with indifferent expressions, silently allowing Winston to go through with it.
Following the order, the housekeepers forced me to the ground. I struggled desperately, watching Winston's face grow blurry through my tears.
""Winston! I'm your mother! How could you treat me this way?""
He looked at me coldly, his expression mirroring Kashton's exactly. ""You stopped being my mother the moment you divorced Dad.""
The son I'd raised with my own hands stood with them against me back then.
I'd truly, completely lost all hope.
That night, before they locked me in the attic, I took one last look at Winston's room through the window.
There was a time when he loved nothing more than playing hide-and-seek with me in that very room.
Now, he had a mother he preferred, and I'd chosen to let him be.
I made one final phone call, then set fire to the pile of clutter in the attic.
Flames quickly consumed the entire space.
I managed a bitter smile amid the blaze. ""Everything here should end now.""
Before jumping from the window, I thought I heard an anguished scream coming from the main bedroom in the main building.

After all, he'd long been used to seeing me humiliated.
But this time, the person who'd humiliated me wasn't just anyone.
It was the son I'd carried for ten months, risked my life to deliver, and raised for eight years.
""Are you sure you want this divorce?""
Chapter 2
Maybe my silence lasted too long, because before I knew it, Kashton was looking straight at me.
I met his gaze and spoke quietly.
""Yes, Mr. Wilkerson.""
When it came to family background, social standing, and appearance, Kashton and I had never been well-matched.
The only reason he'd chosen me as his wife was that I was obedient and compliant.
All these years, I'd been chasing his approval, living by the rule: never say or do anything that might upset him.
""You...""
Before Kashton could finish, the office door suddenly swung open.
I was surprised to see that it was Coraline.
After all, Kashton had a habit of never bringing the women he brought home to his company.
Coraline was clearly an exception. ""Mr. Wilkerson, am I interrupting something?""
When Kashton saw Coraline, his expression softened slightly.
""It's nothing important. Give me a moment. I haven't forgotten what I promised you and Winnie.""
Coraline smiled. ""As long as you remember, Mr. Wilkerson.""
I found it absurd that even after I'd asked for a divorce, it was still just a minor issue in Kashton's eyes.
Yet Kashton, who never compromised, made concessions the moment he caught Coraline's pleading look. ""If you're upset about how the Wilkersons treated you at the gathering yesterday, I promise it won't happen again.""
Coraline chimed in. ""Ella, the amusement park will open soon, and Winnie is still waiting in the car.
""Could you please let Mr. Wilkerson go first?""
My hands trembled. I'd asked countless times before to take Winston to the amusement park.
But he'd always dismissed the idea. ""Mom, you're an adult. Can't you stop being so childish? Going to a place like that will just be a waste of my time.""
Now, I swallowed the rising sorrow in my chest and gestured toward the repeatedly revised divorce agreement.
""Sign it, and I'll leave immediately. I won't bother you ever again.""
Only then did Coraline clearly see the divorce papers on the table; her eyes suddenly brightened. ""Mr. Wilkerson, should I give you some privacy?""
Despite her words, she made no move to actually leave.
Kashton frowned and crushed out his cigarette.
""That won't be necessary.""
I recognized this as the expression he wore when his temper was rising.
In the past, seeing that look would have sent me immediately into apologies. But now, I felt completely numb, and I no longer cared.
""Mr. Wilkerson, could it be that Ella is asking for a divorce because of me?""
Coraline suddenly bit her lip with a wounded expression and immediately apologized, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone to Mr. Wilkerson's house last night without telling you. This is all my fault for upsetting you, Ella.""
She lowered her head as she gripped my wrist tightly, letting her supposed tears of remorse fall.
Yet the sharp pain in my wrist felt all too real.
Out of Kashton's line of sight, she mouthed taunts, ""Kashton and your son don't want you anymore. You got exactly what you deserve.""
I didn't feel the slightest anger—only absurdity.
I tried to pry her fingers from my wrist one by one, but she suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground.
Even with such obvious acting, Kashton believed her.
So did Winston, who happened to push the door open at that moment.
""Have you finished making a scene?""
""Mom, have you lost your mind? Why would you hurt Cora?!""
At that moment, both my husband and my son were defending another woman against me.
Chapter 3
""Cora, don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again.""
Winston looked at Coraline with a nervous expression, then rushed over to comfort her.
Eight years ago, I'd risked my life to bring Winston into this world.
When he was born, he was no bigger than my palm, lying in an incubator on the brink of death.
The hospital sent one critical condition notice after another.
Nearly everyone gave up on his life because the doctors said even if he survived, he wouldn't live past five years old.
I was the only one who refused to accept that. I begged the doctors and prayed to every god, pleading with anyone who might be able to save him. That was how I managed to keep him alive.
So all these years, no matter how coldly Winston treated me, I could always endure it.
To Kashton, Winston was the perfect means to control me.
Now he dropped all pretense and threatened me outright. ""Briella Gallacher, if you really want this divorce, you'll never see Winston again!""
When Winston heard the word ""divorce,"" his gaze paused. He frowned and directed his anger at me.
""Mom, are you going to get a divorce because of Cora?
""Let me make this clear—even if you two split up, I'm never going with you. Someone as foolish and clumsy as you doesn't deserve Dad anyway.
""Everyone treats you like a joke, and Grandma and the others can't stand you. Can't you reflect on yourself?""
There was no hesitation in Winston's eyes as he stared at me—only pure disgust.
But I no longer had any desire to hold onto him. I simply said calmly, ""That's fine because I don't want you either.""
Winston froze, his eyes widening as the corners of them reddened.
The truth was, Winston wasn't always like this.
Before he turned five, whenever someone mocked me, he would take my hand and say, ""Mom, you still have me.""
When I couldn't stop crying, he'd fumble to wipe my tears with his little hands and murmur, ""Mom, don't cry. I'm here.""
He used to be my only comfort in the Wilkerson family.
But now, everything had changed. I truly couldn't go on living my life drowning in sorrow anymore.
Kashton picked up his fountain pen and signed the agreement with a bold, sweeping signature.
""Don't come crying with regrets later!""
I breathed a sigh of relief. After all these years, the burden pressing down on me was finally gone.
""I'll never regret this.""
The absurd marriage between Kashton and me was finally ending right at this moment.
I grew up tagging along behind Kashton, but his eyes never once truly settled on me.
Even our marriage had been nothing but a fortunate accident.
Kashton's fiancée had fled their wedding ceremony, declaring she'd suddenly realized she valued freedom more than marriage.
Humiliated and furious, Kashton replaced his bride on the spot.
I was the lucky one in everyone's eyes.
I used to believe that too. After all, in all the places Kashton never noticed, I'd secretly loved him throughout my entire youth.
But the Wilkerson family was outraged. Being from an ordinary family, I could never be worthy of Kashton.
Of course, I understood that. So for all these years, I'd walked on eggshells, trying to please every member of the Wilkerson family.
But I'd been too naive. Some social circles aren't something you can force your way into through sheer effort.
Now, I'd completely given up.
Given up on everything here.
Chapter 4
I folded the divorce papers, tucked them into my bag, and checked my watch. ""Aren't you going to the amusement park? You can still make it if you leave now.""
I'd planned that outing so many times before that I knew the park's schedule by heart.
Then I looked at Winston and reminded him gently, ""Remember your mango allergy. Don't sneak anything with mango in it again.""
I still remembered how Winston used to cry every night, begging to see Kashton.
But Kashton would always give me the same two words. ""I'm busy.""
So Winston secretly ate some mango candy. His whole body broke out in hives, and he could barely breathe.
I was so terrified that I cried and begged Kashton to come home.
After that, the Wilkerson family members took turns blaming me, saying that my interruption had cost the Wilkerson Group a multi-million dollar contract.
They claimed it was my fault for not watching Winston closely enough and that I was to blame for the faded red marks the hives left on his back.
I was consumed with guilt at the time, but Winston seemed to have discovered a loophole. Whenever he wanted to see Kashton, he would search the entire house for anything that contained mango.
In his mind, as long as he had an allergic reaction, his father would come home to see him.
He never knew how many times his mother's heart broke because of this.
""Winston, you're eight years old now. You'll be starting second grade soon. You need to learn to look after yourself.""
I watched Winston press his lips together as he turned away and clung to Coraline.
""Once you and Dad are divorced, you won't be my mother anymore. You don't get to tell me what to do!""
Suddenly, I remembered Winston as a toddler, wobbling after me and repeating ""Mommy, Mommy"" nonstop.
My nose stung with emotion. My voice grew hoarse as I said, ""Fine, I'll stop.""
Kashton noticed my emotional shift and sneered, ""Are you satisfied with how things turned out because of the ruckus you caused?""
Coraline stepped between us, pretending to mediate. ""Mr. Wilkerson, please don't say that. I'm sure Ella is hurting too.
""Maybe this was just a burst of anger. If you two can calm down first, you can talk things through later.
""After all, how could Ella possibly bear to leave Winnie? She must have spoken in the heat of the moment.""
Winston was the first to protest, his face twisted with anger. ""She doesn't want me? Well, I don't want her either!""
Kashton said coldly, ""I've given her enough chances—she brought this on herself. People always face consequences for their impulsive decisions.""
But from the moment I mentioned divorce, I never once considered turning back.
When Coraline heard this, her eyes lit up with barely concealed delight. ""Well...
""Ella, no matter what, I still think you should reconsider this carefully. We're heading to the amusement park now. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Winnie.""
Kashton looked at me with a mocking expression. ""Everything's going exactly as you wanted, so why are you still standing here?
""Are you waiting for me to beg you to stay?""
I didn't respond and turned to leave first.
""Take care on your way out. I hope you guys will have a great time.""
Chapter 5
When I returned to the Wilkerson's residence, I began packing my things.
Surprisingly, after all these years, everything I owned only filled one suitcase.
I removed the necklace from around my neck and placed it on the coffee table. It contained the family photo I'd begged Kashton for three whole days to take—back when Winston was three years old.
Just then, a news notification appeared on my phone.
It was an entertainment headline featuring photos of Kashton and the others at the amusement park.
Looking at the three of them interacting so naturally in the pictures, they truly appeared to be a perfect family.
What was there left for me to hold onto?
Before leaving, I gave the butler all my savings from over the years and said, ""Use this for Winston's child support.""
The housekeeper hesitated to speak when Mariana suddenly pushed the door open. She spotted my suitcase and froze for a moment.
""I heard from Winnie that you're insisting on divorcing Kash?""
I remained silent for a moment, then shook my head. ""I'm not making a fuss. We're already divorced.""
Mariana was momentarily speechless. Furious, she swept everything off the table and onto the floor.
""Briella, how dare you! You bitch! What gives you the right to be the one filing for divorce against my son?!
""I'm telling you, you'll walk away with nothing! And as for Winnie—you'll never see him again!""
Even after I married Kashton, Mariana forbade me from calling her by her first name, saying I wasn't worthy.
Every time Winston got the smallest scrape or Kashton felt slightly unwell, I was always blamed for not taking proper care of them.
I could actually tolerate these constant criticisms. After all, I'd long served as Mariana's emotional punching bag.
But all my previous patience had been for Winston's sake. Now that I didn't even want him anymore, there was no reason to keep enduring this abuse.
So when Mariana tried to slap me, I caught her wrist firmly and pushed her away.
""From the moment Kashton signed those divorce papers, I've had no connection with the Wilkersons anymore.""
Caught completely off guard by my defiance, Mariana stumbled and fell to the ground.
Just then, a familiar voice called out from the doorway. ""Briella! Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay a hand on my mother!""
Coraline followed close behind him, her eyes widening in feigned shock as she rushed to help Mariana to her feet.
""Ella, no matter how upset you are, you shouldn't take it out on Mariana!""
Meanwhile, the housekeepers drawn by the commotion gathered around and began murmuring among themselves.
""I used to feel sorry for Mrs. Wilkerson, but now it seems she was just pretending all along.""
""You're right. She's nothing like the helpless victim people describe. She even dared to hit her own mother-in-law!""
Winston stood protectively in front of Mariana, glaring at me. ""You're a horrible mother! How dare you hurt Grandma! I never want to see you again! I want Cora to be my mom!""
At just eight years old, he had no idea how deeply those words could cut.
Even though my heart was already broken into countless pieces, his words still managed to make it ache anew.
""She tried to hit me first, that's why I...""
Kashton cut me off sharply, questioning me with a sneer. ""You claim my mother tried to hit you? Did anyone here witness that? We all clearly saw you push her. What excuses can you possibly make now?
""Briella, I will overlook your past outbursts. But this time you've actually harmed my mother. Apologize to her immediately.""
I refused to apologize to Mariana.
From the moment I became a part of the Wilkerson family, I'd been constantly apologizing.
When Winston refused to attend school, I had to bow and apologize to his teacher.
When Kashton didn't like how his tie was coordinated, I had to apologize to him.
Even when Mariana embarrassed herself at parties, I had to apologize to the guests on her behalf.
""Kash, forget it. It's not worth getting upset over something so trivial.""
Mariana only pretended to be magnanimous when Kashton was present. Behind his back, she treated me like a housekeeper.
I truly couldn't stand to look at this house for another moment, so I told the butler directly, ""Just throw out whatever I haven't packed. I'm leaving now.""
But Winston blocked my path. His eyes were red as he stared at me, yet the words he spoke weren't meant to persuade me to stay.
""You hurt Grandma and Cora, and you think you can just walk away!
""I'm going to punish you—just like how you used to punish me. Maybe then you'll learn what you should or shouldn't do!""
I stared at Winston in disbelief. Even if he disliked me, he shouldn't harbor this much hatred toward me.
""Kayla, lock her in the attic.""
The Wilkerson's residence's attic was a small, windowless room used for confinement according to family rules.
Winston had been locked in there once before—at a family dinner where he couldn't find any dishes he liked, he took out his frustration by throwing his fork at me.
To teach him a proper lesson, I had confined him to that attic once.
I never imagined that less than six months later, my own son would use that same place to punish me.
Kashton and the others stood by with indifferent expressions, silently allowing Winston to go through with it.
Following the order, the housekeepers forced me to the ground. I struggled desperately, watching Winston's face grow blurry through my tears.
""Winston! I'm your mother! How could you treat me this way?""
He looked at me coldly, his expression mirroring Kashton's exactly. ""You stopped being my mother the moment you divorced Dad.""
The son I'd raised with my own hands stood with them against me back then.
I'd truly, completely lost all hope.
That night, before they locked me in the attic, I took one last look at Winston's room through the window.
There was a time when he loved nothing more than playing hide-and-seek with me in that very room.
Now, he had a mother he preferred, and I'd chosen to let him be.
I made one final phone call, then set fire to the pile of clutter in the attic.
Flames quickly consumed the entire space.
I managed a bitter smile amid the blaze. ""Everything here should end now.""
Before jumping from the window, I thought I heard an anguished scream coming from the main bedroom in the main building.

Half the Floor Vanished

Bex

 

The time clock beeped when Lena punched in Tuesday morning, loud enough to make her flinch. It was probably the only thing in the building programmed to remember her. She straightened her shirt, smoothed her name tag, **Lena**, as if reminding the fabric who she was, and practiced her greeting under her breath.  
Light smile.  
Warm tone.  
Don’t look desperate.  
Don’t look like you’re trying.

The breakroom was already full. People laughed around a box of cheap donuts.

She stepped in. “Morning.”

Three heads turned with the vague, polite smiles reserved for strangers asking for directions.

A woman she’d worked next to for six weeks frowned slightly. “Oh, hi. Are you shadowing  today?”

Her stomach flicked, tight and sour, like a string pulled too hard. She laughed softly, the way you do when you don’t want anyone to feel bad. “No. I’m… Lena. I’m here every day. I stayed until close last night.”

“Really?” The woman blinked, puzzled, but not unkind. “I swear I haven’t seen you.”

That was the worst part. The gentleness. No malice. Just absence.

Lena smiled the way she’d practiced in the bathroom mirror. “Happens.”

The others nodded vaguely. Someone offered her a donut. She declined. She didn’t want to see their faces wrinkle with confusion if she took the last one.

\-

Ten minutes later, at her desk, she opened the Anderson file, completed yesterday, triple-checked until her eyes felt bleary. She overheard her supervisor outside the cubicles.

“Lisa, great work on Anderson. Really thorough stuff.”

 Lena froze. That was her file. She’d stayed late three nights to finish it.

Lisa murmured, “Thanks?” like she didn’t remember doing any such thing.

Of course. Lena, Lisa, whatever. Enough letters in the right order. That’s all anyone ever saw.

She didn’t correct anyone. She never did. Correction required acknowledgment.

Lena kept typing.

Before lunch, she slipped her sandwich order onto the clipboard, her handwriting neat, careful, pressing the pen hard so the indent would show even if the ink didn’t.

When the delivery came, the driver handed out bags.

“Ham on wheat? Turkey no tomato? Veggie wrap?”

People collected them. Voices rose, chairs scraped, the office filled with small, ordinary life.

The driver read the last name, looked at the single sandwich left, then at her.

“Oh, sorry,” he said, “I don’t have one for you. Must’ve been a mix-up.”

She didn’t say she’d put her order on the list. Twice, actually. She always wrote it twice now, just in case someone smudged one.

“It’s fine,” she murmured.

He nodded and left.

When she returned to her cubicle, her chair was missing. Rolled across the aisle, being used by someone else.

She stood in the empty space, her space, and watched a coworker gesture to the person beside her.

They didn’t say excuse me.

They hadn’t seen her.

“We should get a new hire. Feels like we’re understaffed.”

Lena opened her mouth.

Nothing came out.

She wasn’t sure they’d hear her anyway.

She sat on the edge of someone else’s chair until they noticed and asked for it back.

\-

The vending machine swallowed her dollar again.

Lena jabbed the plastic with two fingers, then gave it a flat-palmed slap. The machine rattled but didn’t move the bag of pretzels dangling by one twisted corner, limp and mocking in its little lit-up grave.

She sighed through her nose.

“Classic,” a voice said.

She turned.

A man in a navy lanyard stood beside her, holding a protein bar and a bottle of something green that looked like it hated him as much as the pretzels hated her. Tallish. Office-fit, not gym-fit. Somewhere between thirty and forty. Brown hair, starting to think about receding. No ring. Shirt one button too high, like he kept meaning to relax and never quite got around to it.

She cataloged the details without trying; habit, the way some people count exits.

“Let me guess,” he said. “B6?”

“D4.”

He winced, big and theatrical. “Rookie mistake.”

Lena smiled politely. “Only been making it for five months straight.”

“That’s commitment,” he said. He stepped closer and gave the machine a practiced thump, the kind of hit that said he’d been losing to appliances his whole adult life.

Nothing.

“Well,” he said, stepping back, “I admire your commitment to suffering.”

She laughed, short, surprised, the kind of laugh she didn’t have to rehearse in her head first.

He seemed pleased he’d earned it, but not overly invested. Just a man passing time between emails.

“Anyway,” he added, already angling his body away, eyes flicking toward the hallway, “hope the next dollar’s luckier. Or you give up entirely. That’s always a good move.”

She nodded. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

He walked off. The lanyard swung once and disappeared around the corner.

Lena stood there for a moment, listening to the low hum of the machine, the click of distant keyboards, the muffled ring of a phone no one answered fast enough.

Then she fished another bill from her pocket, smoothed it against her thigh, and fed it into the slot.

This one worked.

The pretzels dropped with a dull, hollow thud.

She picked them up, not smiling. Not thinking about him. Not storing his face.

Just… Tuesday.

\-

On Friday, after lunch, she was standing by the narrow breakroom window with a paper cup of coffee, watching a crow hop between oil stains in the parking lot. The kind of moment no one ever remembered, not even her, most days.

Her name tag was flipped backward on its clip, logo facing out, her name pressed against her shirt.

“Hey, Lena.”

She didn’t react at first. The word slid past her like background noise. Then her brain replayed it a half beat later.

Lena.

She turned.

It was the vending machine man. Navy lanyard again, today with a granola bar and a can of something fizzy instead of the green sludge. Up close he just looked tired in a familiar way: brown hair, faint stubble, tie a little off-kilter, like the week was already heavier than it had any right to be. He smiled, easy. Not bright, not flirty. Just like they knew each other.

“Back from the wars with D4?” he said.

She gaped at him. For a second she had no idea what he was talking about. Then the pretzels surfaced in her memory, bobbing up like something left too long at the bottom of a pool.

“Oh,” she said. “Right. Yeah. I, uh… won that one.”

“Good,” he said. “I was emotionally invested.”

Her fingers found the edge of her name tag automatically, like they always did when someone looked directly at her. She pinched it, turned it over.

The plastic flashed her name at her, freshly exposed.

He hadn’t seen it.

Her heart did a small, stupid stutter.

“You, um…” she started, then heard how it sounded and tried again. “We’ve met?”

He frowned, but not in the way people did when they realized they’d forgotten someone. Not embarrassed. Just briefly confused that she was confused.

“Yeah,” he said. “Downstairs. The machine ate your dollar.” His mouth twitched. “Tragic day for pretzels.”

“Oh. Right. Sorry.” She forced a light laugh. “Long week.”

It had only been three days.

“You on this floor too?” he asked.

“Second,” she said. “Accounts payable.”

“Mark,” he offered. “Finance. Third. We send you numbers and apologies.”

There it was: a name she hadn’t asked for and hadn’t earned. People didn’t usually give her names. They saved those for the ones they expected to see again.

“You remembered me,” she heard herself say.

It sounded wrong out loud, like she’d accused him of something.

He looked… amused? Not in a cruel way. Just like she’d told a joke she didn’t realize was a joke.

“Sure,” he said. “You don’t forget someone trying to physically intimidate a vending machine. That’s a core memory.”

He took a sip from the can. Completely at ease. This was normal to him. A tiny, throwaway moment he’d filed and pulled back up without effort.

Normal for him.  
Impossible for her.

“Yeah,” she said. “Guess I made an impression.”

Her voice came out thinner than she wanted. She sipped her coffee to hide it. It had gone lukewarm.

Behind him, two coworkers brushed past into the breakroom. One bumped her shoulder lightly and muttered “sorry” to the space between them, not looking at her face.

Mark stepped aside automatically, but his gaze stayed on her.

“Well,” he said, glancing at the clock above the microwave, “back to the spreadsheet mines.” He lifted the can in a small salute. “Try not to pick any more fights with heavy machinery.”

“I’ll do my best,” she said.

He left. The door swung shut behind him with a soft hydraulic sigh.

Lena stayed by the window, coffee cooling in her hands, the crow still worrying at something unidentifiable on the asphalt below.

He remembered.

Not just that someone had been there.  
Her. Pretzels. A dollar. The way she’d slapped the machine.

Her mind began lining up reasons like sandbags:

He’d probably had a boring day.  
She’d been loud.  
Anyone would remember that.  
Maybe he was just one of those people who remembered everything.  
Maybe it didn’t mean anything at all.  
She couldn’t let it go. No one ever remembered.  
(But he had.)

By the time she threw out her coffee and walked back to her desk, she’d almost convinced herself.

Almost.

Something small in her chest had shifted its weight, like a passenger on a bus standing up before their stop.

Not moving yet. Just bracing.  
For what, she didn’t know.  
Only that it was coming.

\-

By Monday the next week, she’d decided not to look for him.

Which, of course, meant she caught herself looking for him everywhere.

Not obviously. Not turning her head or slowing her steps. Just a tiny tightening in her chest when she passed the vending machines, a prickle at the back of her neck in the breakroom, the quick scan of faces whenever an elevator door slid open.

She told herself it was curiosity. Anomalies were supposed to be studied. That was all.

Near the end of her shift, the copier outside her row of cubicles gave up with a sad, grinding noise and an error code that meant nothing to her. Lena cleared the jam, like she always did, fingers dusted with gray.

When she straightened up, there he was at the end of the hall, a stack of folders tucked under one arm. Mark. Third floor, finance, pretending trail mixes were a personality trait.

He didn’t see her at first. He was reading something as he walked, mouth moving a little like he was silently arguing with it. She could have slipped back to her desk and been invisible again.

She didn’t move.

He looked up and his face did that small, unremarkable lightening people reserve for someone they recognize but don’t know well.

“Hey,” he said. “Lena.”

Her name landed softer this time, but it still hit. Her hand went to her name tag out of reflex. It was clipped to her drawer handle, lying face-down.

He hadn’t read it.

“Hi,” she said. Her voice sounded normal. That felt like an achievement.

He nodded at the open copier. “Heroic work. That thing’s eaten more reports than my shred bin.”

“Occupational hazard,” she said. “Paper-based carnivores.”

The joke came out before she could overthink it. He smiled, genuinely this time.

“See, that’s consistent,” he said.

“Consistent?” she repeated.

“Yeah.” He shifted the folders, leaning one hip against the cabinet. “You make jokes when you’re annoyed. Like with the vending machine. ‘Only been making it for five months straight,’ remember?”

Her lungs forgot how to work for half a second.

She hadn’t remembered the exact words until he said them. They’d been nothing, just filler, a cheap line to cover the embarrassment of slapping a machine in public.

“You… remember that?” she asked.

It came out too direct. No softening, no laugh.

He shrugged, like it was nothing. “Yeah. It was funny.” A beat. “You laughed after I said the suffering thing. That helped.”

She stared at him.

You laughed after I said the suffering thing.

He hadn’t just stored the sentences. He’d filed the order of them. The cause and effect. The moment her laugh had happened, small and stupid and unpracticed. A blip in a day she’d already forgotten before she went to bed.

She somehow managed, “I didn’t think it was that good of a joke.”

“It wasn’t,” he said easily. “But you were clearly having a day, and you laughed anyway. Felt like a win.”

He said it casually. Not fishing. Not performing. Just offering his version of that moment like he was handing her a photocopy she’d asked for.

Behind her, a printer started up again, spitting out pages. Someone hurried past, eye contact sliding over Lena like she was part of the furniture. The fluorescent buzz pressed in against her skull.

“You always do that,” he added, almost as an afterthought. “Make a joke when something screws you over. Like it’s a rule.”

She swallowed. Her mouth felt dry.

“You’ve seen me twice.” she said. “That’s a big conclusion.”

“Three times,” he corrected. “Vending machine, breakroom window, now.” He glanced down the hall. “Plus I’ve probably walked past you a hundred times and not been paying attention. That’s on me.”

He said it like an apology for a minor oversight, like forgetting to reply all.

Lena forced the corners of her mouth up. It was the only expression she trusted not to crack.

“Guess you’re very observant,” she said.

He huffed out a breath that was almost a laugh. “I do spreadsheets for a living. I notice patterns or they yell at me.”

He checked his watch, then pushed off the cabinet.

“Anyway. I should dump these on someone before they become my emotional support reports.” He lifted the folders a little. “Good seeing you again, Lena.”

Again.

“Yeah,” she said. “You too.”

He headed down the hall, lanyard swaying. No big moment. No dramatic look back. Just another guy going to make someone else’s inbox worse.

When he turned the corner, sound seemed to rush back in: phones, printers, someone laughing loudly two cubicles over at a joke Lena hadn’t heard.

She stood by the copier with her hands still faintly dusted in toner and replayed it.

Only been making it for five months straight.

He’d remembered the *exact phrase*. The laugh. The way she used humor when she was annoyed. He’d taken a nothing moment and turned it into a pattern.

Her mind reached for the old explanations, the safe ones:

Maybe he had some kind of freak memory.  
Maybe he did this with everyone.  
Maybe she’d been louder than she thought.  
Maybe this is what normal is and she was the strange one for finding it strange.

None of them fit right.

Back at her desk, she tried to lose herself in invoices, but the numbers slid on the screen. Every time her fingers hovered over the keyboard, she heard him again.

“You laughed after I said the suffering thing.”

Like her reaction had weight. Like it had taken up space in his head.

She pressed her pen down hard enough on the next sticky note that the tip tore through.

For the first time in a long time, Lena wasn’t sure which scared her more:  
that he might forget her like everyone else…  
or that he absolutely, unmistakably wouldn’t.

That kind of memory left a mark.  
And she’d spent her whole life trying not to

\-

On Wednesday Lena told herself she was only going up to third to drop off invoices.

Technically, it was true. The email had said *interoffice mail is fine*, but she’d printed them anyway. Paper was safer. Paper needed hands, needed routes. Paper could justify a detour.

The third floor always felt brighter, even though the lights were the same. Finance had plants near the windows and a bulletin board full of charity runs and potlucks. Someone had drawn a smiley face in dry erase marker on the water cooler.

She spotted him before he saw her.

Mark stood by the kitchenette, one hand wrapped around a mug, the other gesturing mid-story to a coworker. There was a smudge of ink on his thumb. His lanyard was twisted. He laughed at something the other person said: short, automatic.

Lena slowed without meaning to. Not a full stop. Just enough that her stack of envelopes suddenly seemed very interesting.

You do not detour for a man, she told herself. You are walking this way anyway.

Her body didn’t buy it.

His coworker peeled off toward a conference room. Mark turned toward the sink, rinsing his mug. When he looked up, his gaze slid across the hallway and caught on her.

That tiny lightening of his face again. Recognition. Like a pilot light flickering on.

“Hey,” he said. “Lena.”

Her name. Again. It landed a little easier now, like her ears had been rehearsing for it.

“Hey,” she said. She lifted the envelopes slightly. “Doing the glamorous paper shuffle.”

He snorted. “Ah, the noble courier of bad news.”

He stepped away from the sink, shaking a drop of water off his hand.

This is normal, she told herself. Two coworkers talking. No one is clinging. No one is chasing.

“Any more battles with D4?” he asked.

The question made something flutter in her chest. He’d remembered the code. Again. She smiled, too quickly, she realized a second too late.

“No, I’ve retired from vending machine warfare,” she said. “I decided to stop, you know…” She waved a hand, searching for something light, something clever. “…showing such commitment to suffering.”

She waited.

That had been his line. ‘Well, I admire your commitment to suffering’*.* He’d said it, she’d laughed, he’d stored it. It had become a touchstone in her mind, proof that a nothing moment could stick.

Now he just frowned faintly. Not offended. Just blank, like she’d referenced a joke from a show he hadn’t seen.

“To suffering?” he repeated.

Her stomach dropped a centimeter.

“Yeah,” she said, forcing a laugh. “From the, um. Machine. Last week. When you said-”

“Oh.” Realization hit his face a heartbeat too late. “Right. That.” He gave a small, awkward smile. “Yeah. Guess I was in a mood.”

The word *that* sat there between them like a placeholder for something he no longer quite owned.

Lena felt heat creep up the back of her neck.

“You remember, though,” she said. It came out sharper than she meant, like a test she hadn’t warned him about.

He glanced at the clock on the microwave. “Kind of? I remember you slapping the thing and looking like you were about to file a formal complaint with the universe.”

He chuckled at his own phrasing.

It was almost right. But not exactly. The line she’d held onto, ‘*I admire your commitment to suffering*’, didn’t seem to have lodged anywhere special for him. Just static. Just one more quip in a day full of them.

“I thought you said it was a ‘core memory,’” she said.

“Did I?” Mark made a face, half-apology, half amusement. “I exaggerate. Occupational hazard. Everything’s dramatic when you’re avoiding spreadsheets.”

He was looking past her now, toward a man who’d just stepped out of an office and was beckoning with a folder.

Lena felt something tilt inside her, like the floor had shifted a degree.

“Right,” she said. She shifted the envelopes in her hands, grip too tight. “Well. Sorry. I just…”

Wanted to know if I still exist in there.

She swallowed the rest.

“…was trying to be funny,” she finished.

His gaze snapped back to her for a second, more out of politeness than anything else. “No, you’re funny,” he said. “That’s your thing, right? Joking through disasters.”

He tossed it off lightly, like it was nothing. A casual observation. A label he didn’t know he’d just affixed to her.

Joking through disasters.

The words caught somewhere behind her ribs, sharp and lodged. For a moment she imagined them sitting in his head too, just as solid. A file card with her name on it.

Then the man with the folder called his name.

“Mark. Hey, you got a sec?”

“Yeah, coming.” He lifted his mug in a little half-salute toward her. “See you around, Lena.”

She nodded. “Yeah. Around.”

He walked away. No backward glance. No sense that anything had gone wrong.

Lena stayed in the hallway, the envelopes digging into her palm.

She replayed the last thirty seconds in high definition.

The blank look when she referenced *commitment to suffering.*  
The delayed “Oh. Right. That.”  
The way the line she’d replayed a hundred times was just… fog to him.

He remembered some things. The slap, the pretzels, the joke about her commitment. Enough to prove she wasn’t entirely a ghost. But not the way she remembered it. Not with the same weight.

Her chest felt tight, crowded.

She forced herself to walk down to the mail slot and slide the envelopes in, one by one. Her hand shook on the last one, just enough that the corner crumpled.

On the way back to the stairs, she passed someone she vaguely recognized from orientation. He glanced at her, eyes skimming over her face, then kept walking.

No flicker. No name. No pilot light.

By the time she hit the second floor, the story in her head had already shifted.

He’s busy.  
It was a throwaway line.  
People don’t remember everything.  
No one could.

In her cubicle, she sat down, opened a new invoice, and stared at the blinking cursor.

“You’re funny. That’s your thing, right? Joking through disasters.”

She wrote the vendor name too hard. The ballpoint skipped, leaving a bald scratch in the paper.

For the first time, the idea slipped in uninvited:

*If she had pushed a little less, would he have remembered more?*

\-

On Thursday, Lena woke up with a sentence in her head.

Not a profound one. Just something like, *“Some of us are born to be background noise.”*

She spent her shower editing it, sanding off the self-pity, turning it into something that might sound wry if she said it out loud. By the time she was toweling off, it had become, *“Some of us are just here to fill in the silence between emails.”* That sounded lighter. Almost clever.",1,1764487478.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False
1pac7wt,https://i.redd.it/5cvgfthric4g1.jpeg,"Real Memories, Fake Love","Chapter 1
 In front of the memory extraction machine.
 Countless sharp needles were arrayed before my eyes.
 Soon, they would pierce my brain, sift through my neurons, and extract all of my memories.
 ""Deborah, you never really lost your memory, did you? You must remember what the kidnappers looked like, right?""
 Braylon's hands clamped down hard on my shoulders, his eyes bloodshot.
 ""You knew to scream for help when that creep was on top of you! So why can't you think about how much it must have hurt when Mila was killed? Why won't you help us find who did it...""
 He pleaded hoarsely, ""I promised I'll marry you. Our engagement still stands. Just tell me what they looked like! I just want to bury Mila properly...""
 My biological parents stood by, looking at me with pure resentment.
 They said I'd brought nothing but bad luck since I returned to the Roswell family.
 They accused me of being jealous that Camille Roswell had lived my life for eighteen years, so I was faking amnesia to hog all the affection for myself.
 But I truly couldn't remember.
 In my previous life, I ran away from this out of fear.
 It ended with retaliation that destroyed my adoptive parents' lives.
 This time, I didn't dare resist.
 Trembling, I looked at Braylon and asked with difficulty, ""Will this ... help find the killers? Will it hurt?""
 Braylon snorted, ""Still acting? Guess you won't give up until you're staring death in the face! Fine, let's start the extraction!""
 He shoved me roughly toward the operating table, each word sharp. ""You think I'm stupid? The reason you won't talk is that you were jealous! You're the one who handed Mila over to those monsters! You're scared we'll find out! I wish it had been you who died! After this, you'll be convicted as Mila's murderer! I'll make sure you pay!""
 The doctor spoke up, ""Mr. Sutton, after the memory extraction, the patient may never wake up. If you're certain, please sign the consent form.""
 Braylon signed without hesitation. ""I just want the memories—not her.""
Chapter 2
 The longest needle was shoved straight through my temple.
 A violent shudder wracked my entire body.
 My eyes flew wide with terror as a jolt of electricity surged into my brain. I tried to fight back.
 But I was strapped down tight, completely immobile.
 Tears streamed down my face as my consciousness started to fade.
 I clenched my palms so tight that my nails dug into the flesh, forcing myself to stay awake.
 ""It hurts ... so much...""
 But I also needed to see how the most beloved Camille had really died.
 Soon, the memories flashed up on the screen in front of Braylon and my birth parents.
 It was the day I'd barely escaped the kidnappers.
 I'd made it back to the Roswell's house on sheer willpower before passing out completely.
 When I woke up again, I was lying in a hospital bed.
 The room was packed with strangers.
 I was terrified and helpless.
 Finally, Braylon's figure appeared when my mind was still hazy.
 I latched onto him like he was my last lifeline, but he shoved me away hard.
 ""Why did you come back alive? Why couldn't it have been Mila?
 ""What did the criminals look like? What the hell happened in that warehouse? Tell me!""
 His rapid-fire questions sent a stabbing pain through my forehead.
 I shook my head in agony, but nothing came to mind.
 Enraged, Braylon grabbed a handful of my hair and slammed me against the wall in a fit of rage.
 He snarled through gritted teeth, ""Headache? I'll fix it for you! Now think! Damn it! Think!""
 Crimson blood trickled down from my temple, mixing with my tears.
 If the doctors hadn't rushed in, he probably would've beaten me to death right there.
 The memory cut out as I gasped for air.
 Braylon snapped, ""What is this crap? This isn't what I wanted to see! You bragged you could extract all her memories! I want everything!""
 The doctor quickly explained, ""Mr. Sutton, the patient truly has amnesia. Just accessing her surface-level memories caused significant harm. If we attempt a deep extraction, I'm afraid ... the odds aren't in her favor...""
 Braylon didn't even register the last part.
 He barked impatiently, ""I paid you 15 million dollars! This isn't some game! Keep going!""
 The doctor gave me a pitying look before starting the machine again.
 Then, a thicker, longer needle was driven into the back of my neck.
 I let out an uncontrollable wail as tears poured down relentlessly.
 ""No... please stop... It hurts so much...""
 As the deep extraction began, the screen lit up again.
 This time, we were taken back to the day I first returned to the Roswell family.
 Since I, Deborah Prescott, the real heiress, had been reunited with my birth family, Camille's engagement to Braylon was no longer valid.
 Camille was standing on the windowsill, threatening to jump.
 I tried to reach out to save her.
 But before I could even touch her, she threw herself from the second-floor window.
 Everyone thought I'd pushed Camille.
 My parents invoked the family punishment.
 They struck my back eighteen times with a salt-soaked cane before Camille finally woke up. She pleaded for me with tears in her eyes, ""Mom, Dad, I'm sure Deborah didn't mean it! Please stop hitting her!""
 Braylon grabbed me by the throat and threatened, ""I'll marry you, but don't push your luck. If you ever hurt Mila again, I'll make you pay.""
 Mom snapped angrily, ""So what if she didn't push Mila? Mila still begged for her! I should've sent her back to the village that day. Otherwise, my Mila wouldn't have died in such a terrible state...""
 ""Yeah..."" Dad's eyes were tearful. ""Mila was so kind. How could you just leave her in that warehouse to fend for herself?""
 Suddenly, the screen flickered wildly.
 My body went into violent convulsions, foam bubbling from my mouth.
Chapter 3
 The doctor screamed, ""Hurry, the patient is going into shock! Get the defibrillator!""
 As they fought to save me, my body rose and fell with each effort.
 The doctor explained, ""Given the patient's brain injury, continuing this will cause severe damage and potentially leave the patient in a vegetative state...""
 Braylon roared, ""Isn't there a special drug for this? Give it to her! I don't care how much it costs! I only want the truth!""
 Moments later, I was forced to drink some unknown liquid.
 My stomach started churning.
 But slowly, my pulse steadied.
 I opened my eyes, staring at the white ceiling, while a cold numbness seeped into my very soul.
 The extraction resumed.
 This time, more needles pierced through me.
 More unknown drugs were added to the syringe.
 They flowed into my veins, coursing through my body, eventually fusing with the blood.
 Agonizing pain crept through every corner of my body.
 I howled in despair.
 But what awaited me was only Braylon's voice, cold as steel.
 ""You should've seen this coming when you left Mila to fend for herself. All that you suffer now is what you owe her! You deserve this punishment!""
 The third memory played on the screen.
 Those nights at the club, entertaining the clients, were the rock bottom in my life.
 I couldn't understand why those lecherous old men always leered at me with crooked grins.
 One night, a man gave me a grand to sing for him.
 The manager ignored my fear and shoved me into the private suite. ""Listen, kid, when clients pay for your service, don't snub it! Make them happy. If it affects my cut, I won't let you off!""
 I trembled, clutching the microphone, my voice breaking as I began to sing.
 The man smiled at me. Every time I finished a line, he inched closer.
 The moment I sang ""love you"", he pressed me under him and exclaimed, ""Babe, I love you, too! I love you so damn much! Let's be together now. I'll take care of you.""
 I struggled desperately to free myself.
 Dazed, I caught a glimpse of Braylon's familiar silhouette.
 I even thought I was dreaming.
 I watched Braylon walk over to me in big strides.
 But he just gazed at me calmly.
 Hysterical, I implored, ""Help me, please! Save me. I'm so scared. Please, take me with you. I wanna go home...
 ""Take me, Braylon. I'll do everything for you...""
 Upon hearing my plea, Braylon finally took action.
 He paid the man off and sent him away.
 Although the man's mood was spoiled, he had no guts to defy Braylon. With tail between his legs, he took off.
 Braylon stared me down, his eyes sharp and hungry, threatening to consume me whole.
 ""Everything? Including memory extraction?""
 ***
 Braylon, at the end of his tether, kicked the coffee table before him.
 He issued an ultimatum. ""Show me the memories from the day Mila was kidnapped. Stop stringing me along. Otherwise, I'll have your hospital shut down right now.""
 The doctor broke out in a cold sweat.
 While doubling the dose in the syringe, he explained, ""Mr. Sutton, the patient sustained severe trauma, and those memories were buried in the deepest corner of her brain. I'll do my best to...""
 Braylon moved in quickly, emptying the syringe with one push. ""If double dosage won't work, then triple it. My patience has its limits.""
 Trembling, the doctor activated the device.
 This time, I felt my veins were about to rupture.
 Soon, my nose started bleeding.
 Blood, mixed with my tears, trailed down to my mouth, tasting unbearably salty.
 My head was going to explode, and I gasped for breath.
 As a gush of blood escaped my lips, the screen flickered to life.
 Braylon and my biological parents goggled at the screen, afraid of missing a single detail.
 In my memory, Camille held my hand and said, ""You just got back. I'll introduce you to a few friends I have in New Orleans.""
 Before I could refuse, Camille picked out a dress for me.
 Once I finished changing my clothes, she took my hand eagerly and hurried me out.
 We arrived at an underground parking lot.
 In the next second, two sacks were thrown over our heads.
 Two dull, crushing whacks followed.
 I heard Camille let out a muffled grunt, and I blacked out shortly after.
 Upon waking, I found myself lying in a dusty warehouse.
 Dazzling sunlight filtered through the slits in the sack, and I caught sight of the thug's face.
 Everyone widened their eyes.
 Braylon was the first to shout, ""It's that man, Carson Merritt, Mila's cousin!""
 Lyla chimed in, ""Yes, that's him! After Mila's identity was exposed, Carson and his family visited us. I had a bad feeling about that man and sent him away immediately. I never expected him to take revenge on Mila! My poor girl, abducted by her own cousin...""
 Then the scene changed.
 Camille stood before my eyes, unscathed.
 She wasn't tied up like me.
 Seated on the sofa, Braylon had a brief look of surprise on his face.",3,1764487337.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I mean no disrespect to anyone with this question. I tried to search online for information but couldn't find anything relevant.

I met a female thru a website.
We were initially considering dating but then She revealed that she knows Tantric practise.
This scared me a little. I still strongly believe She is a good and honest human.We may want to stay friends thou.

I have her address with me.

I want to send her a few gifts thru Amazon as a good gesture...
Something silly like an alarm clock....a coffee mug ..maybe earrings...and something else.


I have two questions .


Although I believe she is a good human and won't harm me, but she has my online pictures and also a picture or two of my family. She obviously also knows my birth details...and approximately knows the city where I live
Is it possible for her to harm me using these details and pictures alone?



Secondly, is it possible for her to harm me if I send these gifts to her?..I am just sending them as a token of friendship... nothing more.Is it better for me to not send them at all?..The gifts will be delivered online of course l.



For background, I am just a normal human ..who visits the temple once a week and that's it. ",5,1764487312.0,Tantrasadhaks,5,1.0,False
1pac6sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketouk/comments/1pac6sg/back_to_keto_i_go/,Back to keto I go,"So I did keto in 2019 covid times it was great I loved it , fully took to it like a swan on water went from 85kg down to 70kg, fast forward to now 2 children later and it's just not hitting the same, I'm not falling into it as easily as I was.  

I'm currently sitting at 77kg which I'm not mad about, the main reason I'm doing keto again is for the energy it gave me, my eldest is a bed wetter and we have a wetting alarm to try for 2 months which means I'm up to change him and get him to go to the loo and then back to bed normally takes 10/15mins total and can be 2/3 times a night, so I'm very tired and moody lol 

I've been back on keto since Wednesday, I'm just trying to keep it simple for the first week or two before I go and spend a fortune on all the almon flours ect, but in the mornings I'm waking up starving I nornally have a cup of tea with cream or a bulletproof coffee, last time I did keto I could go from lunch time to the next lunch time without eating or feeling hunger like this. 

Maybe this time I'm expecting to much to fast or maybe because I'm getting up 2 to 3 times a night my body dosnt have a clue what's going on lol 

I definitely don't feel as tired and I've lots 1kg in 4 days and I honestly can't tell you how good eating a Silesian sausage smothered in pate and sauerkraut is with out having to think oh hold on 🤣 I've not been restricting calories I have been logging them and averaging about 1800 a day and 20-25g carbs  

I just feel a bit lost this time round, last time there was kinda a keto bubble around everyone was trying it, I watched YouTubers had some amazing recipes, people in my town even gave them selves keto names 😭 

I just need to get back into it although it's harder now with a 6 and 3 year old

Did not give much information about the color, but I just liked it, and it had the specifications I required. The range, speed, and weight capacity all cleared.

It turns out that people have attitudes towards pink scooters. Colleagues crack a joke, a stranger made a remark, some man in a coffee shop had to inform me that the pink scooters are childish. It's bizarre.

The scooter works great. It is my daily use over 3 months, saved me approximately 150 / month in gas and parking, and it took me 15 minutes to get to the job, as compared to 30 minutes in the traffic. The impact of the color on its functionality is literally zero.

I located it in the urban mobility suppliers in Alibaba when comparing between models. It was also the pink one which was available, and it cost 40 less than the black model with the same specifications. Practical choice.

However, it seems that the act of riding a pink electric scooter as a grown-up man is somehow controversial? I really do not know why they care. It's transportation. The color is irrelevant with respect to speed, range, or reliability.

Anyone feel like their scooter color might be causing him or her to act strangely or am I in an abnormally judgmental neighborhood?",1,1764486944.0,ElectricScooters,1,0.67,False

As a kid, I was busy trying to figure out what 1+1 meant. In my 20s, I was restless — chasing goals, trying to conquer the world, always running after something. But in my 30s, I started to understand life differently. Happiness wasn’t in big victories, it was in small everyday joys: cooking something my family loves, burning 500 calories at the gym, walking 5 km in one stretch, sipping a good cup of coffee, or reading my favorite book.

Life isn’t perfect, work isn’t perfect, and the world definitely isn’t perfect — but who cares? The fun is in making the best out of what comes your way. Bake a cake and it turns out dense? Call it a brownie and enjoy. Go for a run but end up sitting in the park watching kids play? That’s joy too. Try to enjoy your morning coffee but your toddler spills it? Great — now you’ve got a story to tell when he grows up.

In my 30s, I learned to embrace life as it throws things at me. Expectations weren’t always met, but I enjoyed every bit anyway. My wife isn’t the “ideal” partner I imagined in my 20s — we argue about finances, food, and raising kids — but without that, life would be dull. And when she visits her parents, I miss her more than I’d like to admit.

At 38, I’ve realized life isn’t about living in some ideal way. It’s about making the most of the situations we’re given. I’ve met powerful, successful people who seem trapped in endless work, constantly trying to change the world — and honestly, they don’t look happy.

Me? I just want to be happy, not on top of the world. Even when I pray, I don’t ask for anything. I simply thank God for the life I’ve been given. Religion, for me, is solace — not bargaining with God like a sanyasi doing tapasya to impress Him.

So here’s my takeaway: the 30s aren’t depressing. They’re liberating. They teach you that joy is in the small things, and that happiness is about living, not conquering.

1pabw98,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1pabw98/lf_trapped_until_death/,LF: Trapped Until Death,"Chapter 1
Everyone knew my husband, Kashton Wilkerson, brought home a different woman every night, and I had to wait on them like a maid.
From the very first day of my marriage, my mother-in-law made it clear that I was never to say or do anything that might upset Kashton.
Then one day, when Kashton brought home yet another woman,
“How spineless you are,” my mother-in-law sneered at me,
“You are so pathetic!” my own son said.
Something inside me finally snapped. I marched right up to Kashton and demanded a divorce.
\*\*\*
""What's this about?"" Kashton asked, not even looking up.
But he seemed a bit tense; the cigarette ash gathering at the tip was proof enough.
""I said, I want a divorce.""
Kashton frowned, glancing at his watch. ""Seventeen minutes until Winston gets out of school,"" he said, ignoring what I'd just said.
I knew he was using our son to pressure me.
What he didn't know was that I'd already given up on our eight-year-old son, Winston Wilkerson.
At yesterday's family dinner, as I picked out the onions he hated—just like I always did—Winston suddenly looked up at me and said, ""Mom, I think you're pathetic.""
I froze right there, my fork clattering to the floor.
But Winston acted like he hadn't even heard the clatter. He just continued calmly. ""No wonder everyone calls you a doormat. Even Grandma looks down on you.
""Honestly, you're nowhere near as interesting as the women Dad brings home.""
Every Wilkerson at the table laughed at his words while I broke down crying.
Winston could see how humiliated I was, but he just frowned and said, ""Mom, stop it. You're acting like I'm hurting you again.
""You keep crying like a child over nothing. Don't you know how embarrassing that is?""
In that stunned moment, I could almost see Kashton in the son I'd raised.
Just then, Kashton arrived with a different woman.
It was Coraline Salkield, a popular actress.
Only then did my mother-in-law, Mariana Wilkerson, step in to smooth things over. ""Come now, Winnie's just a child. You're his mother. Are you really going to argue with your own son?""
The others joined in. ""Yeah. Winston is just a kid. Don't take it to heart.""
""Everyone in Boston knows about your reputation. Winston's just repeating what he hears. You can't really blame him for that.""
I said nothing, my eyes fixed on Winston.
Moments ago, he had seemed so irritated with me, but now his face brightened, and he ran straight toward Kashton and Coraline.
He took Coraline's hand and began shaking it, his gaze full of affection.
Coraline chuckled and pulled a paper kite from behind her back.
Winston grinned—he clearly already knew Coraline.
They even had their own little secret.
Kashton noticed me staring, looked my way briefly, and immediately ignored me.
He probably assumed I was still crying over my earlier embarrassment.
After all, he'd long been used to seeing me humiliated.
But this time, the person who'd humiliated me wasn't just anyone.
It was the son I'd carried for ten months, risked my life to deliver, and raised for eight years.
""Are you sure you want this divorce?""
Chapter 2
Maybe my silence lasted too long, because before I knew it, Kashton was looking straight at me.
I met his gaze and spoke quietly.
""Yes, Mr. Wilkerson.""
When it came to family background, social standing, and appearance, Kashton and I had never been well-matched.
The only reason he'd chosen me as his wife was that I was obedient and compliant.
All these years, I'd been chasing his approval, living by the rule: never say or do anything that might upset him.
""You...""
Before Kashton could finish, the office door suddenly swung open.
I was surprised to see that it was Coraline.
After all, Kashton had a habit of never bringing the women he brought home to his company.
Coraline was clearly an exception. ""Mr. Wilkerson, am I interrupting something?""
When Kashton saw Coraline, his expression softened slightly.
""It's nothing important. Give me a moment. I haven't forgotten what I promised you and Winnie.""
Coraline smiled. ""As long as you remember, Mr. Wilkerson.""
I found it absurd that even after I'd asked for a divorce, it was still just a minor issue in Kashton's eyes.
Yet Kashton, who never compromised, made concessions the moment he caught Coraline's pleading look. ""If you're upset about how the Wilkersons treated you at the gathering yesterday, I promise it won't happen again.""
Coraline chimed in. ""Ella, the amusement park will open soon, and Winnie is still waiting in the car.
""Could you please let Mr. Wilkerson go first?""
My hands trembled. I'd asked countless times before to take Winston to the amusement park.
But he'd always dismissed the idea. ""Mom, you're an adult. Can't you stop being so childish? Going to a place like that will just be a waste of my time.""
Now, I swallowed the rising sorrow in my chest and gestured toward the repeatedly revised divorce agreement.
""Sign it, and I'll leave immediately. I won't bother you ever again.""
Only then did Coraline clearly see the divorce papers on the table; her eyes suddenly brightened. ""Mr. Wilkerson, should I give you some privacy?""
Despite her words, she made no move to actually leave.
Kashton frowned and crushed out his cigarette.
""That won't be necessary.""
I recognized this as the expression he wore when his temper was rising.
In the past, seeing that look would have sent me immediately into apologies. But now, I felt completely numb, and I no longer cared.
""Mr. Wilkerson, could it be that Ella is asking for a divorce because of me?""
Coraline suddenly bit her lip with a wounded expression and immediately apologized, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone to Mr. Wilkerson's house last night without telling you. This is all my fault for upsetting you, Ella.""
She lowered her head as she gripped my wrist tightly, letting her supposed tears of remorse fall.
Yet the sharp pain in my wrist felt all too real.
Out of Kashton's line of sight, she mouthed taunts, ""Kashton and your son don't want you anymore. You got exactly what you deserve.""
I didn't feel the slightest anger—only absurdity.
I tried to pry her fingers from my wrist one by one, but she suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground.
Even with such obvious acting, Kashton believed her.
So did Winston, who happened to push the door open at that moment.
""Have you finished making a scene?""
""Mom, have you lost your mind? Why would you hurt Cora?!""
At that moment, both my husband and my son were defending another woman against me.
Chapter 3
""Cora, don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again.""
Winston looked at Coraline with a nervous expression, then rushed over to comfort her.
Eight years ago, I'd risked my life to bring Winston into this world.
When he was born, he was no bigger than my palm, lying in an incubator on the brink of death.
The hospital sent one critical condition notice after another.
Nearly everyone gave up on his life because the doctors said even if he survived, he wouldn't live past five years old.
I was the only one who refused to accept that. I begged the doctors and prayed to every god, pleading with anyone who might be able to save him. That was how I managed to keep him alive.
So all these years, no matter how coldly Winston treated me, I could always endure it.
To Kashton, Winston was the perfect means to control me.
Now he dropped all pretense and threatened me outright. ""Briella Gallacher, if you really want this divorce, you'll never see Winston again!""
When Winston heard the word ""divorce,"" his gaze paused. He frowned and directed his anger at me.
""Mom, are you going to get a divorce because of Cora?
""Let me make this clear—even if you two split up, I'm never going with you. Someone as foolish and clumsy as you doesn't deserve Dad anyway.
""Everyone treats you like a joke, and Grandma and the others can't stand you. Can't you reflect on yourself?""
There was no hesitation in Winston's eyes as he stared at me—only pure disgust.
But I no longer had any desire to hold onto him. I simply said calmly, ""That's fine because I don't want you either.""
Winston froze, his eyes widening as the corners of them reddened.
The truth was, Winston wasn't always like this.
Before he turned five, whenever someone mocked me, he would take my hand and say, ""Mom, you still have me.""
When I couldn't stop crying, he'd fumble to wipe my tears with his little hands and murmur, ""Mom, don't cry. I'm here.""
He used to be my only comfort in the Wilkerson family.
But now, everything had changed. I truly couldn't go on living my life drowning in sorrow anymore.
Kashton picked up his fountain pen and signed the agreement with a bold, sweeping signature.
""Don't come crying with regrets later!""
I breathed a sigh of relief. After all these years, the burden pressing down on me was finally gone.
""I'll never regret this.""
The absurd marriage between Kashton and me was finally ending right at this moment.
I grew up tagging along behind Kashton, but his eyes never once truly settled on me.
Even our marriage had been nothing but a fortunate accident.
Kashton's fiancée had fled their wedding ceremony, declaring she'd suddenly realized she valued freedom more than marriage.
Humiliated and furious, Kashton replaced his bride on the spot.
I was the lucky one in everyone's eyes.
I used to believe that too. After all, in all the places Kashton never noticed, I'd secretly loved him throughout my entire youth.
But the Wilkerson family was outraged. Being from an ordinary family, I could never be worthy of Kashton.
Of course, I understood that. So for all these years, I'd walked on eggshells, trying to please every member of the Wilkerson family.
But I'd been too naive. Some social circles aren't something you can force your way into through sheer effort.
Now, I'd completely given up.
Given up on everything here.
Chapter 4
I folded the divorce papers, tucked them into my bag, and checked my watch. ""Aren't you going to the amusement park? You can still make it if you leave now.""
I'd planned that outing so many times before that I knew the park's schedule by heart.
Then I looked at Winston and reminded him gently, ""Remember your mango allergy. Don't sneak anything with mango in it again.""
I still remembered how Winston used to cry every night, begging to see Kashton.
But Kashton would always give me the same two words. ""I'm busy.""
So Winston secretly ate some mango candy. His whole body broke out in hives, and he could barely breathe.
I was so terrified that I cried and begged Kashton to come home.
After that, the Wilkerson family members took turns blaming me, saying that my interruption had cost the Wilkerson Group a multi-million dollar contract.
They claimed it was my fault for not watching Winston closely enough and that I was to blame for the faded red marks the hives left on his back.
I was consumed with guilt at the time, but Winston seemed to have discovered a loophole. Whenever he wanted to see Kashton, he would search the entire house for anything that contained mango.
In his mind, as long as he had an allergic reaction, his father would come home to see him.
He never knew how many times his mother's heart broke because of this.
""Winston, you're eight years old now. You'll be starting second grade soon. You need to learn to look after yourself.""
I watched Winston press his lips together as he turned away and clung to Coraline.
""Once you and Dad are divorced, you won't be my mother anymore. You don't get to tell me what to do!""
Suddenly, I remembered Winston as a toddler, wobbling after me and repeating ""Mommy, Mommy"" nonstop.
My nose stung with emotion. My voice grew hoarse as I said, ""Fine, I'll stop.""
Kashton noticed my emotional shift and sneered, ""Are you satisfied with how things turned out because of the ruckus you caused?""
Coraline stepped between us, pretending to mediate. ""Mr. Wilkerson, please don't say that. I'm sure Ella is hurting too.
""Maybe this was just a burst of anger. If you two can calm down first, you can talk things through later.
""After all, how could Ella possibly bear to leave Winnie? She must have spoken in the heat of the moment.""
Winston was the first to protest, his face twisted with anger. ""She doesn't want me? Well, I don't want her either!""
Kashton said coldly, ""I've given her enough chances—she brought this on herself. People always face consequences for their impulsive decisions.""
But from the moment I mentioned divorce, I never once considered turning back.
When Coraline heard this, her eyes lit up with barely concealed delight. ""Well...
""Ella, no matter what, I still think you should reconsider this carefully. We're heading to the amusement park now. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Winnie.""
Kashton looked at me with a mocking expression. ""Everything's going exactly as you wanted, so why are you still standing here?
""Are you waiting for me to beg you to stay?""
I didn't respond and turned to leave first.
""Take care on your way out. I hope you guys will have a great time.""
Chapter 5
When I returned to the Wilkerson's residence, I began packing my things.
Surprisingly, after all these years, everything I owned only filled one suitcase.
I removed the necklace from around my neck and placed it on the coffee table. It contained the family photo I'd begged Kashton for three whole days to take—back when Winston was three years old.
Just then, a news notification appeared on my phone.
It was an entertainment headline featuring photos of Kashton and the others at the amusement park.
Looking at the three of them interacting so naturally in the pictures, they truly appeared to be a perfect family.
What was there left for me to hold onto?
Before leaving, I gave the butler all my savings from over the years and said, ""Use this for Winston's child support.""
The housekeeper hesitated to speak when Mariana suddenly pushed the door open. She spotted my suitcase and froze for a moment.
""I heard from Winnie that you're insisting on divorcing Kash?""
I remained silent for a moment, then shook my head. ""I'm not making a fuss. We're already divorced.""
Mariana was momentarily speechless. Furious, she swept everything off the table and onto the floor.
""Briella, how dare you! You bitch! What gives you the right to be the one filing for divorce against my son?!
""I'm telling you, you'll walk away with nothing! And as for Winnie—you'll never see him again!""
Even after I married Kashton, Mariana forbade me from calling her by her first name, saying I wasn't worthy.
Every time Winston got the smallest scrape or Kashton felt slightly unwell, I was always blamed for not taking proper care of them.
I could actually tolerate these constant criticisms. After all, I'd long served as Mariana's emotional punching bag.
But all my previous patience had been for Winston's sake. Now that I didn't even want him anymore, there was no reason to keep enduring this abuse.
So when Mariana tried to slap me, I caught her wrist firmly and pushed her away.
""From the moment Kashton signed those divorce papers, I've had no connection with the Wilkersons anymore.""
Caught completely off guard by my defiance, Mariana stumbled and fell to the ground.
Just then, a familiar voice called out from the doorway. ""Briella! Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay a hand on my mother!""
Coraline followed close behind him, her eyes widening in feigned shock as she rushed to help Mariana to her feet.
""Ella, no matter how upset you are, you shouldn't take it out on Mariana!""
Meanwhile, the housekeepers drawn by the commotion gathered around and began murmuring among themselves.
""I used to feel sorry for Mrs. Wilkerson, but now it seems she was just pretending all along.""
""You're right. She's nothing like the helpless victim people describe. She even dared to hit her own mother-in-law!""
Winston stood protectively in front of Mariana, glaring at me. ""You're a horrible mother! How dare you hurt Grandma! I never want to see you again! I want Cora to be my mom!""
At just eight years old, he had no idea how deeply those words could cut.
Even though my heart was already broken into countless pieces, his words still managed to make it ache anew.
""She tried to hit me first, that's why I...""
Kashton cut me off sharply, questioning me with a sneer. ""You claim my mother tried to hit you? Did anyone here witness that? We all clearly saw you push her. What excuses can you possibly make now?
""Briella, I will overlook your past outbursts. But this time you've actually harmed my mother. Apologize to her immediately.""
I refused to apologize to Mariana.
From the moment I became a part of the Wilkerson family, I'd been constantly apologizing.
When Winston refused to attend school, I had to bow and apologize to his teacher.
When Kashton didn't like how his tie was coordinated, I had to apologize to him.
Even when Mariana embarrassed herself at parties, I had to apologize to the guests on her behalf.
""Kash, forget it. It's not worth getting upset over something so trivial.""
Mariana only pretended to be magnanimous when Kashton was present. Behind his back, she treated me like a housekeeper.
I truly couldn't stand to look at this house for another moment, so I told the butler directly, ""Just throw out whatever I haven't packed. I'm leaving now.""
But Winston blocked my path. His eyes were red as he stared at me, yet the words he spoke weren't meant to persuade me to stay.
""You hurt Grandma and Cora, and you think you can just walk away!
""I'm going to punish you—just like how you used to punish me. Maybe then you'll learn what you should or shouldn't do!""
I stared at Winston in disbelief. Even if he disliked me, he shouldn't harbor this much hatred toward me.
""Kayla, lock her in the attic.""
The Wilkerson's residence's attic was a small, windowless room used for confinement according to family rules.
Winston had been locked in there once before—at a family dinner where he couldn't find any dishes he liked, he took out his frustration by throwing his fork at me.
To teach him a proper lesson, I had confined him to that attic once.
I never imagined that less than six months later, my own son would use that same place to punish me.
Kashton and the others stood by with indifferent expressions, silently allowing Winston to go through with it.
Following the order, the housekeepers forced me to the ground. I struggled desperately, watching Winston's face grow blurry through my tears.
""Winston! I'm your mother! How could you treat me this way?""
He looked at me coldly, his expression mirroring Kashton's exactly. ""You stopped being my mother the moment you divorced Dad.""
The son I'd raised with my own hands stood with them against me back then.
I'd truly, completely lost all hope.
That night, before they locked me in the attic, I took one last look at Winston's room through the window.
There was a time when he loved nothing more than playing hide-and-seek with me in that very room.
Now, he had a mother he preferred, and I'd chosen to let him be.
I made one final phone call, then set fire to the pile of clutter in the attic.
Flames quickly consumed the entire space.
I managed a bitter smile amid the blaze. ""Everything here should end now.""
Before jumping from the window, I thought I heard an anguished scream coming from the main bedroom in the main building.

1pabu5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornQuit/comments/1pabu5p/this_is_probably_why_you_keep_relapsing/,This is probably why you keep RELAPSING...,"Hello, stranger. If you have been struggling to overcome porn addiction and just find yourself relapsing week after week (or even day after day), then this is post for you. The reason why you keep relapsing probably has to do with 4 core problems. In this post, I am going to discuss the 4 most common reason why people relapse and what exactly do you need to do to overcome these problems. Because I promise you, once you have overcome these 4 core problem, you are going to find it significantly easier to overcome this addiction.

# Cause 1: You are what you eat

If you are the kind of person that eats processed food, things like burgers, fries, soda, candy. Then guess what, you are putting yourself at risk to relapsing to porn. Firstly, because what fast food does is that it stimulates the same regions of your brain that are stimulated when you watch porn and this region is your dopamine system.

Secondly, when you become the kind of person that is used to getting cheap artificial dopamine from fast food, then this tendency bleeds into other areas of your life, you just become more impulsive. You begin to seek instant pleasure from other things and if you are a recovering porn addict, this could mean that you now feel more of an urge to watch porn and your poor diet has been a major contributor to that urge.

Lastly, processed food does cause inflammation in your body and brain and inflammation is one of those things that has been linked with depression & anxiety. So naturally, when you are in a bad mood after eating lot of garbage, guess what, you are going to try and come out of the bad mood and tool are you accustomed to help you get out of depressed state? PORN.

What I want you to do is start paying attention to what enters your mouth. Any item that has a bunch of unnatural ingredients, comes in packets or has a bunch of added sugar or you got it from a restaurant or fast food place is very likely not good for you. Avoid it like the plague. What you should be looking forward to eating is whole natural food. These are food items which usually have just a single ingredient in them and they are not processed. These are things like vegetables, fruits, meat, dates, honey, fish etc. These food items are firstly healthy, so wont be hit with inflammation and dip in mood, secondly, they are not loaded with sugars and stimulants, so they are not going to release absurd amounts of dopamine into your system. So they are not going to cause that dopamine chaser effect.

However, if you are someone who has been following a pretty clean diet, yet you feel as though you still have uncontrollable sexual urges. Then I would strongly recommend that you give intermittent fasting a shot. Try fasting 16 hours a day, everyday for a week or 2 and you going to notice a massive lowering of your sexual desires and massive boost to your self control.

# Cause 2: Poor Sleep = Poor Impulse Control

If you are the kind of person that does not take his sleep seriously. You go to bed at random times when you feel like it. Meaning somedays you are hitting the bed at 2 am, other days you are going to bed at 11pm. Also, you constant wake up not getting enough hours of sleep, or have stimulants like coffee or alcohol before you sleep, then guess what you, too, are very likely to relapse.

There are countless studies that have shown the negative effects of improper sleep. The most relevant one is that poor sleep causes you to make bad decisions and lose your impulse control. And I kid you not, just missing out on 1 to 2 hour of sleep, which doesn’t even seem like all the much, has major negative outcomes on your brain. Because when you sleep, your brain does a lot important housekeeping things, one of them being detoxifying your brain. And if you have improper sleep, you are just waking up with all these toxins still present in your brain, you have brain fog, you are not able to focus and do anything productive and you pretty much end up relapsing to porn.

The solution is to now start taking your sleep extremely seriously. I know there is all this emphasis on the internet about morning routines. But what I think is significantly more important is having a night time routine. The first thing that you should do is have a fixed time when you need to go to bed. For most people, this could mean something like 10:00 pm. Now, day your goal should be to hit the bed at 10pm including the weekends.

What I would also recommend is that at least 2 hours before your selected sleep time, you stop all stressful cognitively or physically demanding work and dim the lights in your room, so that you body really starts secreting the right hormones and you can fall asleep as you hit the bed.

I know some of you probably think, I am being a bit too strict when it comes to sleep. But the thing is at this point I have worked with dozens of people overcoming porn addiction, and I kid you not, there is a such a strong correlation between poor sleep and relapses. To the point that, you can almost predict when a person is going to relapse based on the quality of sleep he has had during the last 3 days.

# Cause 3: An unstructured life

One of the most important things that you need in order to overcome this addiction is a routine. The reason why a predictable enjoyable routine is so important is because firstly, your routine becomes your alternative source of healthy dopamine. If you have finally quit porn, there is going be a dopamine void in your life. You need to fill that void with healthy alternatives, else your brain is always just going to miss porn. And this is where a routine is crucial.

I want you to list down 3 core productive activities in your day. It could be something like hitting the gym, working on your business or career development for a couple of hours a day and the last activity could be reading a book. It doesn’t really matter what exactly these core activities are for you, as long as you find them to be productive and somewhat requiring a little bit of an effort on your part. For each of these core activities, mark down the exact time that you would be doing them each day of the week, because when you note down the exact time for an activity, you are much more likely to get it done and not procrastinate it. Additionally, when you do things at the same, at same place, day in day out, they become effortless to perform and they just become part of your identity.

The second reason why a routine is so important, is because it prevents your mind from randomly wandering around and having lustful thoughts. If you are always a man on a mission, you got books to read, workouts to hit, prayers to complete, then you are constantly applying yourself to something. But the day you wake up, get out of the bed and having nothing planned for that day, now you are just at the mercy of your whims and desires.

Another important insight I have after working with dozens of men trying to quit porn is that there is a strong strong correlation between a disrupted routine and relapsing. Many of these relapses have happened because the client went on a random 3 day long road trip, during the trip he did not stick to any of the healthy habits, ate bad food, had poor nights of sleep and when he returned his routine was off, he kept procrastinating things and bam ended up in a relapse.

# Cause 4: The Social Challenge

I hope that by now you are convinced that your diet, sleep & routine are extremely important for your recovery and you can control all these variables when you are alone. You can make healthy meals and adhere to your fasting window, you can go to bed at you precise time, dim the lights, really optimize your sleep and you can also follow the rest of your routine and get the good alternative source of dopamine.

The real challenge occurs when you add socializing into the mix. Now all of a sudden, then 3 variables are not in your control. You don’t have control over the kind of food that you are having, you peers are probably going to pressure you into having that slice of pizza or drinking, the are probably also going to insist that you stay longer in the night or go for a night out and stay awake till 2am. And to them, a disruption to their diet, sleep or routine is not big deal, simply because their brain is not trying to overcome a decades long porn addiction, but you are.

If you have been relapsing for decades, then you must take these things extremely seriously if you truly want to overcome this addiction. And I am going to be real with you, this could mean missing out on many social occasions, to protect your diet, sleep and routine and yeah, that is the price to pay if you want to overcome this addiction.

Now, I am not saying you can never hang out with people. No. All I am saying is alter your social gatherings such that you diet, sleep and routine are not too badly impacted. Maybe instead of having late night dinners, consider having lunch together. Maybe instead of eating garbage at a social event, prep your meal and take your own food.

1pabtul,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/1pabtul/helped_my_friend_move_last_weekend_and_discovered/,Helped my friend move last weekend and discovered he's a low-key hoarder,"My mate asked if I could help him move to a new flat. I figured it’d take a few hours, rent a van, shift some boxes, easy weekend favor. I showed up and realized he’s been quietly hoarding for years.

We’re talking boxes of tangled cables he’ll “definitely need someday,” broken electronics he swears he’ll fix, three coffee makers, and a plastic fishing boat he bought off Facebook Marketplace two years ago. He’s never used it, doesn’t live near water, and doesn’t fish, but apparently it was “a great deal.”

Every time I asked, Are you actually bringing this?  he had some elaborate future plan. The move took all day because we had to make multiple trips. His new place is smaller, but he refused to get rid of anything. Now it’s just as cluttered, just in a different location.

My back hurts and I’m never helping him move again. Next time I’m suddenly busy.

I ended up browsing storage hacks and shelving units online later, even skimming a few listings on alibaba,  trying to figure out how to subtly send him a hint.

Anyone else helped a friend move and realized they might have a serious issue with letting go of stuff?",1,1764485888.0,hoarding,3,1.0,False

[Budget unclear],"After a few months of using preground coffee I finally bought myself a proper grinder that can make espresso. However I still use the pressurized basket that came with the machine, which of course doesn't make very good espresso and doesn't come up to the potential that my new expensive grinder can come to.

So logically I want to invest in a bottomless portafilter and an unpressurized basket. My machine has a 51mm portafilter so I am guessing anything that fits on a Dedica will likely fit in my machine.

1pabsqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pabsqv/productivity_isnt_about_doing_more_its_about/,"Productivity isn’t about doing more, it’s about doing less right (the ultimate anti-hustle guide)","Everyone’s addicted to doing more. More lists, more apps, more “life hacks.” We live in a culture that glamorizes busyness but quietly breaks people under the weight of constant output. I’ve met countless high-functioning professionals, creative freelancers, and even students who feel like they’re drowning  not because they’re lazy, but because they’re trying to do everything. Somewhere along the way, we swapped clarity for chaos and called it ambition.

And let’s be honest, a lot of the productivity advice out there is pure dopamine bait. TikTok “7am CEOs” teaches you to wake up at 4:30, chug butter coffee, and meditate while meal-prepping your keto lunch. But real productivity isn’t about doing more it’s about doing less, better. And here’s what the science actually says.

**Here’s how to stop being “busy” and start being effective.**

- **Deep work > shallow sprints**  
  Cal Newport's bestselling book *Deep Work* (NYT bestseller, MIT computer science prof) argues that focused, distraction-free work is becoming more rare and more valuable in today’s economy. Instead of answering 48 emails a day, train your brain to do one cognitively demanding thing for 90 minutes. Newport shows that top performers aren’t faster. They just protect their focus like hell.

- **The planning fallacy is REAL**  
  Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered that humans are awful at predicting how long tasks actually take. We always think we can do more than we can. To combat this, start padding your schedule by 2x the time you think you need. That solo “30-min task” is probably a 1-hour commitment with mental load included.

- **The 80/20 Rule isn’t a myth**  
  The Pareto Principle has been backed in productivity research and operational design: 80% of your results often come from 20% of your effort. Management guru Richard Koch used this idea to help corporations trim waste and improve efficiency. Identify your “vital few” tasks each week and cut the rest. You’ll actually accomplish more by doing less.

- **Your brain HATES multitasking (even if you think you’re good at it)**  
  According to a Stanford study, frequent multitaskers perform worse on memory and task-switching than people who focus on one thing at a time. You dilute your cognitive performance every time you context switch  whether it’s replying to a Slack ping mid-writing or checking messages during calls.

- **Habits beat motivation every time**  
  James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* (sold over 10 million copies, #1 NYT bestseller) breaks down a simple idea: success doesn’t come from goals, it comes from systems. The people who consistently show up aren’t more disciplined, they’ve just made their environment frictionless. Create invisible scaffolding: a calendar block for deep work, an auto-locking phone, a playlist that tells your brain it’s go time.

- **Productivity ≠ Self-worth**  
  Anne Helen Petersen, in her book *Can’t Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation*, digs into how hustle culture warped our sense of identity. “Productivity” became a virtue signal for value. You’re not broken if you don’t finish everything. You’re human. Stop treating your to-do list like a moral scoreboard.

**Smart tools that help you focus without frying your brain**

- **Insight Timer**  
  This isn’t just another meditation app. It actually has thousands of free meditations tailored for anxiety, productivity, burnout and even quick resets between meetings. I use the “focus music” tracks to set the tone during deep work blocks. There’s a Pomodoro timer and ambient soundscapes that help train your attention span back to human levels.

- **BeFreed**  
  Think of this as your personal audio coach for unlearning hustle brain. You just type in what’s been messing with your flow (like ""I can’t stop procrastinating at night"" or ""I feel guilty when I’m not working"") and boom  it gives you a personalized podcast that actually breaks it down. Built by a team from Columbia, Google, and Pinterest, it pulls from books, papers, and expert interviews. My avatar gives me a smoky, sassy breakdown before bed and somehow makes deep work theory fun. It even journals for me, tracks what I’ve learned, and makes flashcards (so I remember stuff). 30 minutes of this actually made me replace doomscrolling with tiny breakthroughs.

**Insanely good books that’ll change how you work and think**

- **_Four Thousand Weeks_ by Oliver Burkeman**  
  One of the most mind-bending books on time I’ve ever read. Burkeman, a longtime productivity columnist, flips the whole narrative: we only have around 4,000 weeks on earth. Time management isn’t about squeezing more in and it’s about choosing what matters. This bestseller hit me hard emotionally. You’ll rethink your calendar, your inbox, your entire relationship with “achievement.” This is *the* anti-productivity productivity book.

- **_Essentialism_ by Greg McKeown**  
  NYT bestselling author, former Stanford lecturer, and leadership coach. This book will make you ruthlessly strategic. His philosophy: if it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a no. It teaches you how to say no without guilt, prioritize your highest point of contribution, and escape the trap of trying to do it all. If you’re stretched thin, this is like taking a deep breath for your soul.

- **_Make Time_ by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky**  
  Written by two ex-Google designers who also helped create Gmail and YouTube. This book is super tactical. It shows how to redesign your day for focus with tricks like “highlighting one big thing” and creating distraction-free zones. It’s full of real experiments, not theory. Perfect if you’re tired of generic platitudes.

- **_Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less_ by Alex Pang**  
  This one’s criminally underrated. Pang argues, with loads of historical and neuroscientific evidence, that deliberate rest is *not* the opposite of work, it's part of it. Artists, scientists, and thinkers from Darwin to modern tech CEOs all rely on structured downtime. If you need permission to rest without guilt, this gives you a PhD-level argument for why it’s not just okay it’s the key to longevity.

Productivity is a tool, not a personality. Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is *stop* doing things that don’t matter  and get quiet enough to notice what does.

1pabrbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1pabrbo/i_28m_called_off_my_engagement_after_hidden_truths/,I (28M) called off my engagement after hidden truths.,"Hi everyone,  
I’m writing this because I genuinely don’t have the emotional strength to type everything out myself. I used GPT to help me put my thoughts into a structured post because my mind is scattered right now. I just need clarity and perspective from people outside my situation.

This is long, but I want to share everything in detail so you understand why I finally walked away.

# How the arranged setup began

The girl’s family was known to my maternal uncle.  
Our families exchanged profiles and biodata — the usual arranged marriage process.

Both of us liked each other’s profiles.  
I told my parents to move ahead.

Soon after, we had our first phone and video calls.

From the *very beginning*, I made two things absolutely clear — respectfully, carefully, without sounding judgmental:

# 1. “If this marriage is being forced on you in any way, please tell me upfront.”

She said clearly:  
**“No, not at all. I want to do this.”**

# 2. “If you have had any past relationship, please be honest. I can handle any truth if told upfront.”

I explained calmly that honesty matters more to me than someone’s past.  
She said confidently:  
**“No, I had no past relationship.”**

She said it without hesitation, and because I wanted to trust her, I believed her.

# Early conversations felt comfortable

We started speaking regularly. We discussed:

* Her HR job
* My engineering contracting family business
* Our MBA experiences
* Future expectations
* Family values
* Our daily lives
* Likes/dislikes
* Long-term goals

We laughed, shared anecdotes, and it all felt comfortable. I thought she was emotionally mature, understanding, and aligned with what I wanted.

I live in **Pune**.  
She lives in **Surat**, so distance was a factor — but I was okay with it.

Her father, brother, and brother’s father-in-law came to visit us in Pune.  
They liked us and invited our family to Surat.

Everything looked smooth on the surface.

# Before engagement: I opened up about my past

I told her honestly:

* I had only gone on **two coffee dates** with the same woman
* Nothing physical happened
* We parted ways long ago (March 2025)
* It didn’t work due to different expectations

She said she appreciated the transparency.

She still never mentioned *her* past.

# Engagement day — and immediate cracks

On **30th October**, my family and I visited Surat.  
We talked privately, families talked, and everything seemed perfect.

We exchanged rings that evening.

If someone had told me that same night that everything would fall apart so quickly, I wouldn’t have believed it.

# Red Flag 1: The ring complaint

The moment I reached Pune that night, she messaged saying she did not like her engagement ring — because it wasn't a **solitaire**.

Her tone was disappointed.  
Not “hey can we change it later?”  
More like a complaint.

I told her calmly:

**“After marriage or when I visit Surat, I’ll change it. Don’t worry.”**

She said okay, but it didn’t feel okay.

It felt like the *symbol* mattered more than the *relationship* to her.

# Red Flag 2: Marriage date arguments

Our families suggested  
**April 2026**.

She insisted on  
**November 2026**.

No concrete reason.  
Just “why so soon?”

We argued multiple times over this.  
I kept things polite and explained:

**“In arranged marriages, we must respect parents’ opinions too.”**

She eventually said okay to April, but her tone made it clear she wasn’t happy.

It felt like she was agreeing out of pressure — not willingness.

# Red Flag 3: Emotional distance & lack of effort

I started noticing that:

* I always texted first
* I always called first
* I always tried to keep the conversation going
* She rarely initiated contact
* Her messages became shorter and colder

Even during the early “good morning / good night” phase, I noticed she didn’t show much enthusiasm.

The emotional warmth started dropping *immediately* after engagement.

# The incident that revealed her attitude

One evening, she texted me:  
**“I’m missing you.”**

I was outside, so I replied:  
**“I’ll call in an hour.”**

When I called exactly an hour later, she said:

I said I’m missing you, but I didn’t tell you to call.

That tone — unnecessary attitude when I was trying my best — shocked me.

I hung up because continuing that conversation made no sense.

Later, i talked to her **mother** about this and she said:

**“Her behaviour was wrong. I’ll talk to her.”**

But instead of reflecting, the girl didn’t text me for the entire next day.  
Not even a “hi.”

That is not normal for someone who just got engaged.

That night, I softened and texted “Good night.”

She replied:  
**“Himmat khatam?”**

Not playful.  
Not romantic.  
Just rude.

# More red flags: Dry texting & cold energy

Over the next few days:

* She barely texted
* When she did, it was dry one-line replies
* No effort from her side
* Zero emotional investment
* She acted like she was doing me a favour by replying

I told her once:

**“I feel emotionally drained. It feels like our relationship is forced on you.”**

She didn’t deny it.  
She didn’t reassure me.  
She simply said “leave it.”

# I contacted her cousin brother

Out of concern and confusion, I called her cousin brother to ask if everything was fine at her home and if she normally becomes distant like this.

He told me:

**“Yes, sometimes she talks less .”**

This worried me more — because marriage isn’t built on silence and withdrawal.

When she learned I contacted her cousin, she called me at **11:30 pm** (she never calls and definitely not this late).

She sounded angry.

She asked repeatedly why I called him.

I calmly explained that I was worried due to her behaviour.

Then we talked about the future, and out of nowhere **she** asked me again if any girl had ever come into my life.

For the third time, I repeated the exact truth I had always told her.

Then I asked her again —  
**“Is there someone from your past?”**

She avoided answering.  
Changed topic.  
Got uncomfortable.

# The truth finally came out

After repeated questions and emotional pressure, she finally admitted:

* She had a **3-year relationship**
* Between 2021–2024
* With a colleague from her previous company
* She is in HR, he was in IT
* He moved to Hong Kong
* She switched companies in May 2025
* She had completely hidden this from me despite my direct question at the start
* When I asked more, she minimized it saying “just hugs and kisses”
* I do **not** believe that’s the full truth

The problem was **not** her past — I can accept pasts.  
The problem was:

# ❌ She lied

# ❌ She hid it

# ❌ She only said it when cornered

# ❌ She never trusted me with the truth

# ❌ She entered engagement without emotional closure

This broke my trust entirely.

Even the pandit had said her kundali shows emotional baggage and unavailability, and hidden relationships and issues.  
I didn’t believe it — now I understand.

# Final Blow: She wasn’t even ready for marriage

I asked her gently:

**“Are you ready to get married?”**

She said: “I don’t know.”

I asked again.

She said:“I don’t want to get married to anyone. But I have to

This crushed me.  
Deeply.

She wasn’t ready for marriage at all.  
She wasn’t ready for *me*.  
She wasn’t emotionally available.

Yet she agreed to an arranged setup, involved two families, exchanged rings, and created expectations.

# The moment I decided to end it

After hearing:

* “I don’t know”
* “I don’t want to marry anyone”
* “I have to marry but I don’t want to”

I knew this marriage would destroy me emotionally.

I told her:

**“I am not marrying you. Please inform your parents.”**

I informed my parents as well. and after that she called me 8-10 times to sort it out and all 

Yesterday, I officially called it off.

# How I feel now

I am:

* Sad
* Tired
* Betrayed
* Emotionally drained
* Still processing everything

But also:

* Relieved
* At peace with my decision
* Confident I avoided a much bigger problem
* Grateful I saw the truth before wedding

I tried everything from my side.  
I gave effort, honesty, patience, and emotional openness.

But a one-sided relationship cannot survive.

# Did I do the right thing?

I feel like I did.  
But I need objective perspectives.

* Was I right to end it?
* Was I asking for too much honesty?
* Was I wrong to call her cousin?
* Or did I dodge a major bullet?

Please tell me honestly.  
I’m not looking for validation — I’m looking for clarity.

# TL;DR

Arranged engagement. She lied about having no past relationship but later confessed to a 3-year one. Became cold, distant, rude, and emotionally unavailable right after engagement. Fought over small things like ring and wedding date. Showed no effort, no warmth, and finally said she doesn’t want to marry anyone but has to. I called off the engagement. Feeling hurt but relieved.

There’s two adjoining rooms, combined about 400 sf, with doors to a large wraparound porch.  Music will be mostly jazz, at coffee shop volume - rather low.  I figure I want multiple small speakers, mounted out of reach high on walls or on the ceiling, arranged for omni-directional sound, that sound good at lower volume.  Don’t need/want high dynamic range, great accuracy, defined soundstage, other “critical listening” attributes.  

I was thinking about getting a bunch of Bose 201s or 301s with a hidden subwoofer somewhere.   I think the reflected sound design would do a good job of sounding okay anywhere in the room, and the speakers are reasonably small, hopefully wouldn’t require much power.  

I have never had those speakers but at home I run Bose 901s from NAD 2200, with auxiliary tweeters and subwoofer, and if I could get that kind of sound in the coffee shop I’d be happy.

1pabpvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1pabpvt/i_built_studioprompt_for_1800_using_replit/,"I built StudioPrompt for ~$1,800 using Replit","So I finally shipped something. Been lurking here forever reading everyone's stories and figured it's my turn to share.

**What I built:**  
Studio Prompt - it's basically a suite of AI tools for video creators. Prompt builder for Sora 2, image generation with DALL-E 3 and Gemini, actual video generation, and an ad wizard thing. Subscription model.

**The $1,800 breakdown:**

* Replit subscription: \~$300 (been using it for a few months now, the AI agent thing is actually insane)
* Domain: $12/year
* OpenAI API costs during dev: \~$400 (I burned through a lot testing Sora 2 and GPT-4o-mini)
* Stripe fees during testing: like $50 in random test transactions
* Stock assets and that one video I bought for the landing page: $80
* My time: technically free but let's be real, probably 200+ hours over 2 months
* Coffee: don't ask

Total hard costs: roughly $850. But if you count the Replit plan I was already paying for and some misc stuff, call it $1,800 to be safe.

**Biggest mistakes:**

1. Started with a credit system (pay per video generation). Spent weeks building it out. Then realized subscription is just simpler for everyone. Had to rip it all out. Wasted like 40 hours on that.
2. Overengineered the auth system early on. Added email verification, forgot password, account lockout, geo-blocking... before I even had users. Should've shipped simpler first.
3. Kept adding features nobody asked for. ""Oh what if users want to share prompts with the community?"" Cool feature, took forever, probably 10 people will use it.

**What actually worked:**

* Replit's AI agent genuinely surprised me. I'm not a dev by trade and it handled like 80% of the coding. I just described what I wanted and iterated.
* Starting with the prompt builder as a free tool. Gets people in the door before they see the paid stuff.
* Not overthinking the design. Used a component library (shadcn) and just... made it work.

**Lessons if you're starting:**

* Ship ugly, ship fast. My first version looked terrible but people used it.
* Talk to users before building features. I built so much stuff based on what I *thought* people wanted.
* The boring stuff (auth, payments, error handling) takes 3x longer than you expect.
* AI coding tools are legit now. Not perfect, but they compress months into weeks.

Currently at \~50 signups, 3 paying subscribers. Not quitting my day job but feels good to actually finish something for once.

Might be useful if you are thinking about doing it or in the middle of a similar program in the next cohort.

**TL;DR** Worth it if you're ready. Don't expect hand-holding, get what you want yourself. Came in solo, left solo, found my idea (AI agents tooling space), working on it now.

**About the programme**

* 10 weeks, full-time, have to be present in the location (in my case it was Riyadh)
* \~80 ppl (or so) take part in the programme, with a mix of tech (engineers/builders), business (product, finance, et al) and domain experts (ppl who worked in a function for 10+ years or so)
* end goal: form a team, work on an idea, pitch for a chance to get $180k at 11% (terms are public)
* Antler positions itself as Day 0 investor, i.e. investing at a super early stage (pre-seed, or essentially idea stage)
* in the course of the programme from W1 till the end you have the typical lectures about the core of building a startup (what Antler invests in, how to find a co-founder, and so on and so forth)
* you are also doing weekly check-ins with the team + coaches, if ""tracked out"" with a cofounder and formed a team

**Key takeaways**

* I can't be certain this is representative of all the cohorts, but in our case out of all the teams that were greenlit for IC (investment committee) all but one had came into the program with a product, and / or users and / or early revenue.
   * My take: Even if Antler positions itself as Day 0 investor, it's extremely hard to sell ""just the idea"" and you shouldn't expect to be able to do that unless you are Steve Jobs
* Again this might be peculiar aspect of our cohort, but we had a very large proportion of teams come in to the cohort, which somewhat skewed the experience. Antler pushes and prioritizes teams above solos (they share it early on) so if you are not in the team you might miss out on what the program offers
   * My take: Even if you are solo, take every opportunity (literally) to share what you are working with the team each week. Book slots with multiple Antler team members even if you are solo. Otherwise you simply will have 1/10th of exposure that teams get
* Venture Partners - kind of a late unlock for me. Antler has about a dozen ppl working with them who are called Venture Partners. These are typically super experienced / ex-startup founders / VC-adjacent type of folks. Some of them take part in the IC at the end of the program. Again, **once you are ready** take every opportunity to meet with them, get some of their time and precious feedback on what you are working on. They are kind of glanced over during the programe IMO - but founders are supposed to get in touch with them on your own
   * My take: once you know what you are working on or you have a solid team - reach out to a few Venture Partners and just ask for a bit of their time to share what you are working on. I've reached out to 3 which I found the most relevant and none of them rejected or ignored me. In my case I settled on the idea pretty late in the program so I had only so much time to do that. Highly recommended as this is an asset that you have as a founder
* If you didn't find a cofounder on the programme it's not the end of the road: you can absolutely bring external people or you can stay solo (but it's highly advised not to do so). We had a few teams in the cohort that formed really late (week 6-ish) with external people. And as long as these people are actually onboard you have a good chance.
* End of the programme is arbitrary - even if you don't get into IC at the end, approx the same amount of teams that got the IC invite, also got the delayed IC invite - so continue working on your product and stay in touch with the team. That's my plan as well.
* Antler's investment terms - do your own research on typical / average pre-seed terms in your region. Take into account your VC network and opportunities to raise from other sources and take your own decision if it's worth it for you.
* it's worth your time if:
   * you're working solo and want exposure to other founders so you're not stuck in your own head all the time
   * you have at least a rough idea of what space you want to work in. Without that, you'll be under pressure to find both an idea AND a co-founder on a deadline -that's a tall order.
   * you are certain that you will find an idea fast, if you find the right person - i.e. you iterate fast and are open-minded. A few teams that matched late in the program, negated the late start by iterating on ideas super rapidly and gained enough confidence with the Antler team that they can deliver
   * you have a product with early traction and want VC exposure to scale faster
* it's not worth your time if:
   * you want guaranteed cofounder match -> I came in solo, and finished solo but I have no regrets since I didn't want to compromise on who I work with and I didn't find the right fit during the program. I've met some awesome founders nevertheless and we plan to stay in touch supporting each other
   * you expect sacred expertise and knowledge from the Antler team. Hint: there is none. The most successful founders and teams on the programme actually did the reverse - they came in with something they could share (a product with users and / or revenue, an insight why it must exist etc). This is where I believe most founder's expectations are not aligned with what this programme really is - it's an opportunity for you to pitch to a room full of VCs what are you working on. They don't know the market better then you do. They don't know the problem better then you do. It's your job to position yourself such that they have confidence you ""know your shit"" so to speak. If you ever get feedback from the team that means that they know more then you do - means you have to work a bit more.

Overall the experience was worth for me, although I came as a solo and left as a solo, I spent the programme searching for the right idea in the problem space I am interested in (AI agents), I have found it late, but I am working on it now. Riyadh was a pleasant discovery as well - such a great city and soooo different from Dubai (I was based there for the last 2 years). I'd say it's a much better location for the programme since there are very few distractions, the people are great and friendly, you get to experience the local authentic culture and saudis coffee culture is next level - probably the best v60s I've tried were in Riyadh :)

Recently my EX (M 32) broke up with me (F 25) for multiple reasons, from “being to expensive to live with” to letting myself go, to us fighting too much. The list goes on and seems to change depending on his mood.

We live together and had been together for just over 5 years.

He immediately started sleeping around and telling me how he was “taking advantage of being single for the first time in 5 years” (I did not ask for this info) and everytime I would just go about my day and not speak to him or give him one worded responses he would tell me I’m being a spoiled brat, I’m acting childish etc and that he doesn’t understand why we can’t just be friendly.

He told me I can stay until the end of January (and is expecting me to stay until then) when the lease on our house is up and then we will both move, but stay in touch and he will come visit me according to him.

He has honestly been such an awful person to me over this break up and has played with my head for so long that I’m doubting a lot, but I need out. I can’t take the mind games anymore, he’s bringing women to the house to sit in his car even though we agreed not to bring anyone near the house. He records me when I’m not doing anything or just sitting there watching a show. He sends me messages telling me how much he misses us and everything we had together and then the next day tells me he never said or did any of that.

So this brings me to the end here.

Without him knowing, I have chosen to move to another state and have secured a job and bought a house. I’m set to close on my new house in just under 2 weeks, almost everything I own has been packed.

Would I be the A-hole for up and leaving while he’s gone one day without saying anything?

I planned on taking anything that’s mine, and if I don’t take it or need it I’m giving it away or donating it. That being said I have purchased almost everything for the house we live in, so when I leave he will be left with a twin size bed, a nightstand, a vacuum, a coffee bean grinder, some ninja thing he got, his one tv and tv stand. Oh and a dresser.

I would be taking everything. Including the metal light switch covers I just got a few months ago and the curtains/curtain rods.

I just want out of this situation and for my poor animals to not be stressed out so much (my one cat shakes when he hears his car in the driveway).

He also loses his job in December (this is the 4th job he’s lost since I’ve been with him) and I don’t want to be around to deal with it more then I need to as it’s no longer my issue.

So reddit WIBTA?

For added context, I am not on the lease for the house we rent, we have been here for 3 almost 4 years and he would never let me be added to the lease. So I would not be breaking a contract. This was also his first time living on his own, he’s only ever lived with his uncle and/or grandfather and that is who he is moving back in with. He has also made no Effort to start packing. He has never helped with anything around the house (even when we were together).

I will try to answer any questions you guys have. And thank you for your time!",2,1764485139.0,WIBTA_AITA,0,1.0,False
1pablm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pablm4/did_i_have_a_moment_with_my_coworker_earlier/,"Did I have a ""moment"" with my coworker earlier?","Earlier tonight, I (24m) was at a work party with a bunch of coworkers, and there's one specific coworker (22f) that I've secretly had a crush on for the entire two years she's worked with the company (I've been there longer). I keep replaying two parts of the night with her because I can't tell if it was a ""moment"" or just friendly flirting.

For reference, we are both neurodivergent - not sure her exact diagnoses but I'm AuDHD.

Over the course of getting to know each other at work, I learned a lot of things about her that convinced me I never had a chance - she had a long term boyfriend (2 years), she identified as a lesbian in high school and didn't come out as bi or entertain dating men until she was 19, and she broke up with said long term boyfriend because she ""thinks she's just a lesbian"". I cast my feelings aside, despite all difficulty, because we actually get along incredibly well.

Fast forward to tonight, when we were at a work event and being gossips, and let a group of us know that she's been seeing a *guy* that she met at a wedding a month ago. Her words, ""yeah he was one of the groomsmen, he was really sweet and he asked me for my Instagram after. We've gone on a few dates now.""

I quipped at the Instagram part, ""It's been that easy this whole time?"" Not meaning about her necessarily but immediately realizing how it sounded. She gave me a look of shock, and I choked on my drink and clarified ""No not you haha, just in general."" - just making a joke that we'd both been single for a while now.

She retorted with ""I was gonna say, if you've been trying I haven't noticed."" I swear I was blushing *heavily* to that but another group of work friends approached right then and changed the topic of conversation.

Fast forward to another point in the night, when there was ice cream being served, and I grabbed ice cream for the both of us while she got drinks from the bar for us. She mentioned she works the opening shift at her other job (coffee shop) in 6 hours and joked about how she's gonna look like shit in the morning. Somehow the convo moved to her saying ""Honestly, I've felt a bit awkward about how people think I look in that... environment. I think I'm *too* alternative for that crowd."" For context, she has tons of face/ear piercings and tattoos. I'm a devout metalhead with tattoos and long hair so I replied ""You're asking the wrong guy"" laughing my ass off. 

I'd been a barista for a long time so I made the in-joke ""there's a spectrum of how baristas look, and one side is you, and the other is me"" - digging at the fact that I look like a 2000s hipster with a man bun and flannel most of the time. She started laughing her ass off at that joke. Eventually I let out the Freudian slip ""you gotta know you're hot as hell, right? I wouldn't worry about it"" and her reply was something like ""and if my barista looked like you?"" turning way and side-eyeing me, brushing her hair behind her ear. We then got pulled to the dance floor and danced for about a half hour until she left.

Is this is just platonic flirting on her part or is this a moment/signal? Given what I know of her dating past, and her being a friend/coworker, I wouldn't want to act unless I'm absolutely sure.

Edit: Should've included this, but the company I work for is small and very tight knit. I'm also not full time and only work with said coworker less than one shift a month. We both have day jobs outside of the company, so if anything this is both of our side gigs. I did spill to another coworker that she's exactly my type and I had the hots for her like a couple months after she started working there. As far as I know, that secret never left the car, or if it did get spilled, word never reached back around to me.",2,1764485042.0,Advice,6,0.75,False

Telling myself I had the same energy  
The same recovery  
The same brain that could run on five hours of sleep and iced coffee

So when things started slipping  
Focus  
Stamina  
Patience  
I treated it like a personal failure

I tried pushing harder  
Waking up earlier  
Forcing the old routines  
Ignoring the signals

It just made everything worse

The shift happened the day I realized I wasn’t losing my edge  
I was living like a past version of me who didn’t exist anymore

This wasn’t about decline  
It was about mismatch

So I rebuilt my days around who I am now  
Not who I used to be  
Not who I wish I still was

Here’s what that looked like:

* I cut my daily priorities to three
* I swapped intensity workouts for consistency workouts
* I built wind down rituals instead of forcing late night productivity
* I started treating sleep like a non negotiable appointment
* I picked one health metric to track instead of ten

Instead of fighting my body  
I partnered with it

And the weird thing is  
I feel younger now that I’ve stopped trying to be young in the old way

* My primary interest is being able to quickly and easily make my coffee and have it taste good (good to me = natural sweetness, smooth, aromatic, and not watery).
* I prefer light to medium roast beans. Not sure if that means more or less oily beans...
* I prefer espresso drinks with milk, but I don't care one way or the other if it includes a milk frother as I have to use non-dairy milk.
* I would love the ability to switch between caffeinated and decaf but it isn't essential.
* The machine needs to be compact as I have a teeny kitchen.
* I want something easy to clean & empty. I currently use a moka pot and I'm over cleaning it.
* I am in the US and would love to find something under $1k, but can go slightly above if it is worth it.
* I do have access to Costco.
* ETA: Should also be quiet. 

I'm fine with something simple that makes a good shot and I can add my milk to, and I'm open to something nicer if it is worth it and in my budget range. I just get completely overwhelmed with all the options and would appreciate the experience of people who have more knowledge of these machines.

I’m at the age now where everyone’s getting married, finding people to share their lives with who genuinely bring them happiness. I even paired my two friends up and now they constantly see each other (coffee dates, movie dates, dinner dates, they love each others company), but I can’t really seem to do that for myself.

Online dating SUCKS. I don’t feel any connection to people via the internet, I do so much better meeting people in person, but thanks to my shyness, I don’t approach people I find attractive. This town is also small and I don’t have the money to move. 

I don’t consider myself ugly. I have plenty of men who lust, but never want to spend time with me unless it involves getting in my pants, who don’t see me as a potential partner, when they don’t even know anything about me, nor do they want to know anything about me. If anything, I’ve been extremely traumatized by men (I have a Medusa tattoo, iykyk). It makes it difficult to see them as anything other than potential harm to myself and my body, thus making it even harder to find someone.

I also feel bad for my parents bc I know how much they enjoy children and really want grandchildren from me. My mom jabs me with hints all the time and I always tell her that I have to find a man that’s worth it first. She and my dad were high school sweethearts, so I don’t know if she entirely understands how I feel most days. 

The pressure is getting unbearable, and the loneliness really eats me alive. I cry a lot bc I feel like I have so much love to give, but no one to give it to, and I’m convinced the phrase “there’s someone for everyone” is utter bullsh*t.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boston Celtics vs. Cleveland Cavaliers: A Tale of Tired Toes and Tireless Tenacity**

The Boston Celtics, fresh off a 24-hour espresso shot of a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, stagger into Cleveland like a sleep-deprived barista—exhausted but determined not to spill the coffee. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, sit at home, sipping their pregame lattes, wondering why they’re favored by 7.5 points against a team that just watched Jaylen Brown drop 41 points in a losing effort. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a stathead and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many NBA Twitter rants.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Test for Bookmakers

The Celtics are listed at +3.45 (decimal) or roughly +275 in American odds, implying a **29% chance to win**. The Cavaliers, at -1.33 (decimal) or -315, carry a **75% implied probability**. That’s a staggering gap, especially when you consider the Celtics have outscored Cleveland in key metrics, boast a better net rating, and are just one game behind them in the standings. The 7.5-point spread feels like a math error—a bookmaker who forgot to carry the decimal after a long night of adding up dunk contest scores.

Historically, the Celtics have covered spreads against tired teams with the consistency of a metronome. Their +4.6 point differential matches Cleveland’s, and their road record is a .500 clip that’d make a coin-flip philosopher envious. The Cavs, meanwhile, are a “strong on paper” team that’s underperformed like a student who aces practice tests but freezes during the real exam.

### Digesting the News: Back Spasms, Back-to-Backs, and Backdoor Hope

The Celtics’ key injury? Jaylen Brown’s back spasms, which have him limping like a penguin in a sprint race. Without his full explosiveness, Boston’s offense might resemble a slow cooker—functional but not exactly thrilling. Yet, Brown’s sheer willpower has single-handedly outscored entire franchises, so don’t count him out.

The Cavaliers? They’re the definition of “perceived strength.” They’ve traded inconsistency for mediocriness, failing to replicate last year’s magic like a magician who forgets his rabbit is on strike. Their home-court advantage is real, but their defense is porous enough to

The crunch from the turbinado coating adds just enough textural contrast. These are S tier coffee cookies and go well with milk too.

1pabegq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pabegq/splitting_the_bill_5050/,Splitting the bill 50/50,"Currently dating a 30 year old guy and I’m 26 years old. On our first date, he paid for tickets to go to our local art museum and then afterwards we got dinner and I split the check with him 50/50. On our second date, we went to a comedy show and he paid for tickets, then we went to a cafe where he paid for my coffee, then we went bowling where I paid, and then we went to a restaurant where we split the check 50/50. 

On our second date, he asked me how I feel about splitting the bill. Personally, while I know I shouldn’t feel this, I do worry about feeling like I “owe” a guy after letting him pay for me, and I don’t like that feeling, so I prefer to pay at least on the first date. When I offer to pay, it’s not a test or an empty offer, I genuinely am fine with paying. While I’m very grateful if the guy fights me to pay for me and will let him if he says no he doesn’t want me to pay after I make the offer to also put my card down, if he takes me up on the offer, I’m also happy to do it. However, if I’m already not feeling the vibes, him taking me up on my offer to split the bill is enough of a reason to solidify that I won’t be going on a second date. It’s not really a dealbreaker though because if the vibes are good and I feel a connection, I’ll still continue to date him. The only issue is, when I order food/drinks, price plays a role in what I decide to get. I don’t normally drink alcohol so I never order a drink and he usually does. I also tend to order cheaper food because I’m a graduate student and he’s working full time. So the bill for my portion of food/drinks is usually much lower than it would be if I were to split the bill 50/50. I just feel like it’s kinda awkward to say “I’m only paying for my portion” and it makes the waiter’s life more difficult to ask them to split the bill themselves, so I feel like it’s just easier to split it 50/50 if I’m going to put my card down. While I would really love it if I could just pay for my portion or if he got the bill fully since I’m still a student and he’s working, I understand men are at a disadvantage with dating and are probably usually paying for entire bills and don’t even get a second date. Not that they’re owed a second date or anything just because they paid the bill. It’s just kind of a situation where I see both sides of “the man should pay for the bill, especially if he’s making more money than you” but also “it’s more fair to split the bill 50/50.” 

Would it be weird if prior to our third date I brought up something regarding going out to restaurants and the bill/price? How would you broach the subject? Or should I just stop putting my card down? He always puts his card down and then I just put my card on top for the waiter to take away. He also does ask me if I’m sure I want to pay and the answer is honestly yes, but I’d like to pay for just what I ordered since that’s what I can afford. I don’t think he’s really aware of the cost difference or pays too much attention to the price of things when he orders, so this isn’t with malicious intent. I like this guy and again, I’m happy to pay for what I get so he’s not paying for me, but I just can’t afford to continue to split things 50/50. Additionally, in general, I can’t really afford to be going out to nice restaurants every week where the bill comes out to a minimum of $30 even if I’m just paying for what I ordered. I also prefer to leave a 20% tip on every bill I pay for my waiters. I don’t want him to feel like I’m just using him as an ATM but also this isn’t a realistic lifestyle for me right now. 

Also, at what point is it good timing to stop paying for things 50/50 with him? We’re still just going on dates and not exclusive or official or anything, but he did imply he’s not seeing other people and I did as well. I don’t want him to be feel used for his money.

Right away, I noticed a coworker (F23) was staring at me intensely, which gave me ""gay panic."" We're not in the same team so there's a little space for us to interact. I guess it caught me off guard because I usually receive more flirtation from men.

We kept exchanging stares, but we never exchanged a word. I initially got the ick because I thought she was older, but later I decided to try starting a conversation via Teams. I did, and she answered very poorly, so I backed off.

The next week, I caught her staring at me again, and I felt kind of lost. I started thinking I was ""making movies"" (overthinking the situation), so I backed off again.
A week later, we randomly ran into each other in the same spot, completely alone. I said ""hi,"" and she blushed and started looking at the floor. (???????)

She asked me a couple of things about a new project I’m working on, and I heard her laughing nervously after I left. (???)
I then thought: ""I guess I’m going to try speaking to her on Teams again."" I was completely wrong. It was even worse than the last time.

I get it. She’s not interested. But then I see her looking for me and staring at me again. 
The deer kinda thing. That if I move or go for à Coffee i could look to  her desk and see her that she's  checking if it's me.

 Is she only looking for attention? Maybe it's the first time she's having that kind of tension with a woman and she feels flattered. But the mixed signals I simply don't get it. ",1,1764484187.0,WLW,1,1.0,False

I generally don't eat anything the first 2/3 of my day, except for occasionally coffee when I first wake up. I only eat a full meal eventually because I realize I haven't eaten anything substantive during the day so I should have a meal(typically dinner.) but what happens after that is I feel hungry 2-3 hours after, which ends up being the first time of the day I feel hungry.

Now, I know the most reasonable explanation for the lack of hunger is that I'm on Ozempic and it's supposed to do that and I didn't start experiencing the lack of hunger until I started on it. But it's strange to me that I'd feel hunger soon after eating and not at any other time. Is this expected on Ozempic or is this unusual and could be caused by something else?

1pab86n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pab86n,"Trapped Until Death from Novelmates, link please?","Chapter 1
 Everyone knew my husband, Kashton Wilkerson, brought home a different woman every night, and I had to wait on them like a maid.
 From the very first day of my marriage, my mother-in-law made it clear that I was never to say or do anything that might upset Kashton.
 Then one day, when Kashton brought home yet another woman,
 “How spineless you are,” my mother-in-law sneered at me,
 “You are so pathetic!” my own son said.
 Something inside me finally snapped. I marched right up to Kashton and demanded a divorce.
 ***
 ""What's this about?"" Kashton asked, not even looking up.
 But he seemed a bit tense; the cigarette ash gathering at the tip was proof enough.
 ""I said, I want a divorce.""
 Kashton frowned, glancing at his watch. ""Seventeen minutes until Winston gets out of school,"" he said, ignoring what I'd just said.
 I knew he was using our son to pressure me.
 What he didn't know was that I'd already given up on our eight-year-old son, Winston Wilkerson.
 At yesterday's family dinner, as I picked out the onions he hated—just like I always did—Winston suddenly looked up at me and said, ""Mom, I think you're pathetic.""
 I froze right there, my fork clattering to the floor.
 But Winston acted like he hadn't even heard the clatter. He just continued calmly. ""No wonder everyone calls you a doormat. Even Grandma looks down on you.
 ""Honestly, you're nowhere near as interesting as the women Dad brings home.""
 Every Wilkerson at the table laughed at his words while I broke down crying.
 Winston could see how humiliated I was, but he just frowned and said, ""Mom, stop it. You're acting like I'm hurting you again.
 ""You keep crying like a child over nothing. Don't you know how embarrassing that is?""
 In that stunned moment, I could almost see Kashton in the son I'd raised.
 Just then, Kashton arrived with a different woman.
 It was Coraline Salkield, a popular actress.
 Only then did my mother-in-law, Mariana Wilkerson, step in to smooth things over. ""Come now, Winnie's just a child. You're his mother. Are you really going to argue with your own son?""
 The others joined in. ""Yeah. Winston is just a kid. Don't take it to heart.""
 ""Everyone in Boston knows about your reputation. Winston's just repeating what he hears. You can't really blame him for that.""
 I said nothing, my eyes fixed on Winston.
 Moments ago, he had seemed so irritated with me, but now his face brightened, and he ran straight toward Kashton and Coraline.
 He took Coraline's hand and began shaking it, his gaze full of affection.
 Coraline chuckled and pulled a paper kite from behind her back.
 Winston grinned—he clearly already knew Coraline.
 They even had their own little secret.
 Kashton noticed me staring, looked my way briefly, and immediately ignored me.
 He probably assumed I was still crying over my earlier embarrassment.
 After all, he'd long been used to seeing me humiliated.
 But this time, the person who'd humiliated me wasn't just anyone.
 It was the son I'd carried for ten months, risked my life to deliver, and raised for eight years.
 ""Are you sure you want this divorce?""
Chapter 2
 Maybe my silence lasted too long, because before I knew it, Kashton was looking straight at me.
 I met his gaze and spoke quietly.
 ""Yes, Mr. Wilkerson.""
 When it came to family background, social standing, and appearance, Kashton and I had never been well-matched.
 The only reason he'd chosen me as his wife was that I was obedient and compliant.
 All these years, I'd been chasing his approval, living by the rule: never say or do anything that might upset him.
 ""You...""
 Before Kashton could finish, the office door suddenly swung open.
 I was surprised to see that it was Coraline.
 After all, Kashton had a habit of never bringing the women he brought home to his company.
 Coraline was clearly an exception. ""Mr. Wilkerson, am I interrupting something?""
 When Kashton saw Coraline, his expression softened slightly.
 ""It's nothing important. Give me a moment. I haven't forgotten what I promised you and Winnie.""
 Coraline smiled. ""As long as you remember, Mr. Wilkerson.""
 I found it absurd that even after I'd asked for a divorce, it was still just a minor issue in Kashton's eyes.
 Yet Kashton, who never compromised, made concessions the moment he caught Coraline's pleading look. ""If you're upset about how the Wilkersons treated you at the gathering yesterday, I promise it won't happen again.""
 Coraline chimed in. ""Ella, the amusement park will open soon, and Winnie is still waiting in the car.
 ""Could you please let Mr. Wilkerson go first?""
 My hands trembled. I'd asked countless times before to take Winston to the amusement park.
 But he'd always dismissed the idea. ""Mom, you're an adult. Can't you stop being so childish? Going to a place like that will just be a waste of my time.""
 Now, I swallowed the rising sorrow in my chest and gestured toward the repeatedly revised divorce agreement.
 ""Sign it, and I'll leave immediately. I won't bother you ever again.""
 Only then did Coraline clearly see the divorce papers on the table; her eyes suddenly brightened. ""Mr. Wilkerson, should I give you some privacy?""
 Despite her words, she made no move to actually leave.
 Kashton frowned and crushed out his cigarette.
 ""That won't be necessary.""
 I recognized this as the expression he wore when his temper was rising.
 In the past, seeing that look would have sent me immediately into apologies. But now, I felt completely numb, and I no longer cared.
 ""Mr. Wilkerson, could it be that Ella is asking for a divorce because of me?""
 Coraline suddenly bit her lip with a wounded expression and immediately apologized, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone to Mr. Wilkerson's house last night without telling you. This is all my fault for upsetting you, Ella.""
 She lowered her head as she gripped my wrist tightly, letting her supposed tears of remorse fall.
 Yet the sharp pain in my wrist felt all too real.
 Out of Kashton's line of sight, she mouthed taunts, ""Kashton and your son don't want you anymore. You got exactly what you deserve.""
 I didn't feel the slightest anger—only absurdity.
 I tried to pry her fingers from my wrist one by one, but she suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground.
 Even with such obvious acting, Kashton believed her.
 So did Winston, who happened to push the door open at that moment.
 ""Have you finished making a scene?""
 ""Mom, have you lost your mind? Why would you hurt Cora?!""
 At that moment, both my husband and my son were defending another woman against me.
Chapter 3
 ""Cora, don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you ever again.""
 Winston looked at Coraline with a nervous expression, then rushed over to comfort her.
 Eight years ago, I'd risked my life to bring Winston into this world.
 When he was born, he was no bigger than my palm, lying in an incubator on the brink of death.
 The hospital sent one critical condition notice after another.
 Nearly everyone gave up on his life because the doctors said even if he survived, he wouldn't live past five years old.
 I was the only one who refused to accept that. I begged the doctors and prayed to every god, pleading with anyone who might be able to save him. That was how I managed to keep him alive.
 So all these years, no matter how coldly Winston treated me, I could always endure it.
 To Kashton, Winston was the perfect means to control me.
 Now he dropped all pretense and threatened me outright. ""Briella Gallacher, if you really want this divorce, you'll never see Winston again!""
 When Winston heard the word ""divorce,"" his gaze paused. He frowned and directed his anger at me.
 ""Mom, are you going to get a divorce because of Cora?
 ""Let me make this clear—even if you two split up, I'm never going with you. Someone as foolish and clumsy as you doesn't deserve Dad anyway.
 ""Everyone treats you like a joke, and Grandma and the others can't stand you. Can't you reflect on yourself?""
 There was no hesitation in Winston's eyes as he stared at me—only pure disgust.
 But I no longer had any desire to hold onto him. I simply said calmly, ""That's fine because I don't want you either.""
 Winston froze, his eyes widening as the corners of them reddened.
 The truth was, Winston wasn't always like this.
 Before he turned five, whenever someone mocked me, he would take my hand and say, ""Mom, you still have me.""
 When I couldn't stop crying, he'd fumble to wipe my tears with his little hands and murmur, ""Mom, don't cry. I'm here.""
 He used to be my only comfort in the Wilkerson family.
 But now, everything had changed. I truly couldn't go on living my life drowning in sorrow anymore.
 Kashton picked up his fountain pen and signed the agreement with a bold, sweeping signature.
 ""Don't come crying with regrets later!""
 I breathed a sigh of relief. After all these years, the burden pressing down on me was finally gone.
 ""I'll never regret this.""
 The absurd marriage between Kashton and me was finally ending right at this moment.
 I grew up tagging along behind Kashton, but his eyes never once truly settled on me.
 Even our marriage had been nothing but a fortunate accident.
 Kashton's fiancée had fled their wedding ceremony, declaring she'd suddenly realized she valued freedom more than marriage.
 Humiliated and furious, Kashton replaced his bride on the spot.
 I was the lucky one in everyone's eyes.
 I used to believe that too. After all, in all the places Kashton never noticed, I'd secretly loved him throughout my entire youth.
 But the Wilkerson family was outraged. Being from an ordinary family, I could never be worthy of Kashton.
 Of course, I understood that. So for all these years, I'd walked on eggshells, trying to please every member of the Wilkerson family.
 But I'd been too naive. Some social circles aren't something you can force your way into through sheer effort.
 Now, I'd completely given up.
 Given up on everything here.
Chapter 4
 I folded the divorce papers, tucked them into my bag, and checked my watch. ""Aren't you going to the amusement park? You can still make it if you leave now.""
 I'd planned that outing so many times before that I knew the park's schedule by heart.
 Then I looked at Winston and reminded him gently, ""Remember your mango allergy. Don't sneak anything with mango in it again.""
 I still remembered how Winston used to cry every night, begging to see Kashton.
 But Kashton would always give me the same two words. ""I'm busy.""
 So Winston secretly ate some mango candy. His whole body broke out in hives, and he could barely breathe.
 I was so terrified that I cried and begged Kashton to come home.
 After that, the Wilkerson family members took turns blaming me, saying that my interruption had cost the Wilkerson Group a multi-million dollar contract.
 They claimed it was my fault for not watching Winston closely enough and that I was to blame for the faded red marks the hives left on his back.
 I was consumed with guilt at the time, but Winston seemed to have discovered a loophole. Whenever he wanted to see Kashton, he would search the entire house for anything that contained mango.
 In his mind, as long as he had an allergic reaction, his father would come home to see him.
 He never knew how many times his mother's heart broke because of this.
 ""Winston, you're eight years old now. You'll be starting second grade soon. You need to learn to look after yourself.""
 I watched Winston press his lips together as he turned away and clung to Coraline.
 ""Once you and Dad are divorced, you won't be my mother anymore. You don't get to tell me what to do!""
 Suddenly, I remembered Winston as a toddler, wobbling after me and repeating ""Mommy, Mommy"" nonstop.
 My nose stung with emotion. My voice grew hoarse as I said, ""Fine, I'll stop.""
 Kashton noticed my emotional shift and sneered, ""Are you satisfied with how things turned out because of the ruckus you caused?""
 Coraline stepped between us, pretending to mediate. ""Mr. Wilkerson, please don't say that. I'm sure Ella is hurting too.
 ""Maybe this was just a burst of anger. If you two can calm down first, you can talk things through later.
 ""After all, how could Ella possibly bear to leave Winnie? She must have spoken in the heat of the moment.""
 Winston was the first to protest, his face twisted with anger. ""She doesn't want me? Well, I don't want her either!""
 Kashton said coldly, ""I've given her enough chances—she brought this on herself. People always face consequences for their impulsive decisions.""
 But from the moment I mentioned divorce, I never once considered turning back.
 When Coraline heard this, her eyes lit up with barely concealed delight. ""Well...
 ""Ella, no matter what, I still think you should reconsider this carefully. We're heading to the amusement park now. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Winnie.""
 Kashton looked at me with a mocking expression. ""Everything's going exactly as you wanted, so why are you still standing here?
 ""Are you waiting for me to beg you to stay?""
 I didn't respond and turned to leave first.
 ""Take care on your way out. I hope you guys will have a great time.""
Chapter 5
 When I returned to the Wilkerson's residence, I began packing my things.
 Surprisingly, after all these years, everything I owned only filled one suitcase.
 I removed the necklace from around my neck and placed it on the coffee table. It contained the family photo I'd begged Kashton for three whole days to take—back when Winston was three years old.
 Just then, a news notification appeared on my phone.
 It was an entertainment headline featuring photos of Kashton and the others at the amusement park.
 Looking at the three of them interacting so naturally in the pictures, they truly appeared to be a perfect family.
 What was there left for me to hold onto?
 Before leaving, I gave the butler all my savings from over the years and said, ""Use this for Winston's child support.""
 The housekeeper hesitated to speak when Mariana suddenly pushed the door open. She spotted my suitcase and froze for a moment.
 ""I heard from Winnie that you're insisting on divorcing Kash?""
 I remained silent for a moment, then shook my head. ""I'm not making a fuss. We're already divorced.""
 Mariana was momentarily speechless. Furious, she swept everything off the table and onto the floor.
 ""Briella, how dare you! You bitch! What gives you the right to be the one filing for divorce against my son?!
 ""I'm telling you, you'll walk away with nothing! And as for Winnie—you'll never see him again!""
 Even after I married Kashton, Mariana forbade me from calling her by her first name, saying I wasn't worthy.
 Every time Winston got the smallest scrape or Kashton felt slightly unwell, I was always blamed for not taking proper care of them.
 I could actually tolerate these constant criticisms. After all, I'd long served as Mariana's emotional punching bag.
 But all my previous patience had been for Winston's sake. Now that I didn't even want him anymore, there was no reason to keep enduring this abuse.
 So when Mariana tried to slap me, I caught her wrist firmly and pushed her away.
 ""From the moment Kashton signed those divorce papers, I've had no connection with the Wilkersons anymore.""
 Caught completely off guard by my defiance, Mariana stumbled and fell to the ground.
 Just then, a familiar voice called out from the doorway. ""Briella! Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay a hand on my mother!""
 Coraline followed close behind him, her eyes widening in feigned shock as she rushed to help Mariana to her feet.
 ""Ella, no matter how upset you are, you shouldn't take it out on Mariana!""
 Meanwhile, the housekeepers drawn by the commotion gathered around and began murmuring among themselves.
 ""I used to feel sorry for Mrs. Wilkerson, but now it seems she was just pretending all along.""
 ""You're right. She's nothing like the helpless victim people describe. She even dared to hit her own mother-in-law!""
 Winston stood protectively in front of Mariana, glaring at me. ""You're a horrible mother! How dare you hurt Grandma! I never want to see you again! I want Cora to be my mom!""
 At just eight years old, he had no idea how deeply those words could cut.
 Even though my heart was already broken into countless pieces, his words still managed to make it ache anew.
 ""She tried to hit me first, that's why I...""
 Kashton cut me off sharply, questioning me with a sneer. ""You claim my mother tried to hit you? Did anyone here witness that? We all clearly saw you push her. What excuses can you possibly make now?
 ""Briella, I will overlook your past outbursts. But this time you've actually harmed my mother. Apologize to her immediately.""
 I refused to apologize to Mariana.
 From the moment I became a part of the Wilkerson family, I'd been constantly apologizing.
 When Winston refused to attend school, I had to bow and apologize to his teacher.
 When Kashton didn't like how his tie was coordinated, I had to apologize to him.
 Even when Mariana embarrassed herself at parties, I had to apologize to the guests on her behalf.
 ""Kash, forget it. It's not worth getting upset over something so trivial.""
 Mariana only pretended to be magnanimous when Kashton was present. Behind his back, she treated me like a housekeeper.
 I truly couldn't stand to look at this house for another moment, so I told the butler directly, ""Just throw out whatever I haven't packed. I'm leaving now.""
 But Winston blocked my path. His eyes were red as he stared at me, yet the words he spoke weren't meant to persuade me to stay.
 ""You hurt Grandma and Cora, and you think you can just walk away!
 ""I'm going to punish you—just like how you used to punish me. Maybe then you'll learn what you should or shouldn't do!""
 I stared at Winston in disbelief. Even if he disliked me, he shouldn't harbor this much hatred toward me.
 ""Kayla, lock her in the attic.""
 The Wilkerson's residence's attic was a small, windowless room used for confinement according to family rules.
 Winston had been locked in there once before—at a family dinner where he couldn't find any dishes he liked, he took out his frustration by throwing his fork at me.
 To teach him a proper lesson, I had confined him to that attic once.
 I never imagined that less than six months later, my own son would use that same place to punish me.
 Kashton and the others stood by with indifferent expressions, silently allowing Winston to go through with it.
 Following the order, the housekeepers forced me to the ground. I struggled desperately, watching Winston's face grow blurry through my tears.
 ""Winston! I'm your mother! How could you treat me this way?""
 He looked at me coldly, his expression mirroring Kashton's exactly. ""You stopped being my mother the moment you divorced Dad.""
 The son I'd raised with my own hands stood with them against me back then.
 I'd truly, completely lost all hope.
 That night, before they locked me in the attic, I took one last look at Winston's room through the window.
 There was a time when he loved nothing more than playing hide-and-seek with me in that very room.
 Now, he had a mother he preferred, and I'd chosen to let him be.
 I made one final phone call, then set fire to the pile of clutter in the attic.
 Flames quickly consumed the entire space.
 I managed a bitter smile amid the blaze. ""Everything here should end now.""
