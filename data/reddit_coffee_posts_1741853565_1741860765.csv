1ja8jh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1ja8jh6/microwaved_starbucks_cup_suction/,Microwaved Starbucks cup suction?,"Hi all!  I know I'm not supposed to microwave a Starbucks paper cup, but For Science™️:

1. Take a Starbucks cup with a small amount of air (10% of its volume or so, though I haven't tried to vary this) and otherwise full with coffee, milk tea, or such (I haven't tested this with plain water yet).  Make sure the plastic lid is on, and closed.

2. Microwave it until warm (I've tested this on a 750 W microwave oven, heating it for a couple minutes)

3. As soon as it's done, take out the cup and give it one vigorous vertical shake, to mix the contents.

4. Observe as the plastic cap suddenly depresses slightly and air seeps in for a second or two, seemingly meaning that there was a sudden drop in pressure on the inside.

What's going on?  Is this some superheating situation?  Or something like the air and vapor inside being hotter than parts of the liquid, so it cools and contracts when suddenly mixed, or somesuch?  Does this occur in other settings?  Is there a name for this?

1ja8eji,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ja8eji/one_of_my_assumptions_must_be_wrong_losing_weight/,One of my assumptions must be wrong losing weight,"24M, 168cm (5’6), 61.0 kg (134lbs), office worker but do strength training 3-4x a week with cardio 2x a week (averages out to about 5k steps a day in the week), started this regiment and diet beginning of February. My goal is to get down to 12% bodyfat (current estimate being 20-22%) with my secondary goal being building muscle. Usually hit around 90-100g of protein per day.

I’ve been eating an average of 1200 calories a day, I weigh almost everything I eat including the cooking oil on a scale and put it into MacroFactor. MF tells me my TDEE is 2280 calories. Some days I do go over (max by like 300) but I compensate by making up for it in the following days by increasing the deficit by 100-200 calories until it balances out. I weigh out 10g of the taco seasoning and 15g of light mayo that goes into my tuna salad, I weigh out the 10 individual peppercorns that go into my spice mixture, I weigh out the single strawberry whenever I’m feeling peckish. I only use my scale and weigh everything in grams and everything is meticulously logged into MF. The only liquid I consume is water, no soda, no milk, no almond milk, no coffee, tea, just plain water with protein powder. The only exceptions to the things I don’t weigh are diced tomatoes, and pickled red onions but if I had to estimate <10g for both. I weigh myself every morning before I’ve taken any swigs of water and after I’ve gone to pee. 

My weight on February 6th was 61.3 kg… so I’ve only lost 300 grams. This doesn’t make sense to me. Let’s just say for the sake of the argument I was miscalculating and I was eating at an average of 1700 calories instead (so 500 more than my average) then I would be on track to lose 0.45kg a week which would mean I should’ve lost about ~2kg by now. But the number on the scale has never dropped below 60 kg. 

I’m making steady improvements in the gym every week too. I’m confused on why I’m not losing weight. Obviously I must follow the laws of thermodynamics so one of my assumptions must be wrong. My TDEE, my intake (very unlikely even if you overestimate by a lot), or something else. 

Also I have zero health problems and I feel fine on this diet. I can literally stop any time I want and I don’t have an ED. I just need to cut down and then I can eat at maintenance. I don’t need anyone to be concerned for my health and as soon as I start feeling pain or adverse health effects I’ll start eating more. Frankly any advice to tell me to eat more will be ignored since if I’m not losing weight at what I think is 1200 I will _definitely_ not be losing weight at a higher calorie consumption so I need to find out why I’m not losing weight first.

1ja8ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1ja8ctp/climb_kilimanjaro_2025/,Climb Kilimanjaro 2025,"Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in 2025 is an incredible adventure! Here’s a complete guide to help you plan your trip and make the most of the local culture.

1. Best Time to Climb

The best months for climbing Kilimanjaro are:
✔ January – March (Less crowded, colder at the summit)
✔ June – October (Dry season, best weather, but more crowded)

2. Choosing the Right Route

There are several routes to climb Kilimanjaro, each with its own difficulty level and scenery:

Marangu Route (5-6 days) – Easiest, but lower success rate.

Machame Route (6-7 days) – Most popular, scenic, and great acclimatization.

Lemosho Route (7-8 days) – Beautiful, fewer crowds, and high success rate.

Rongai Route (6-7 days) – Approaches from the north, drier but less scenic.

Northern Circuit (9-10 days) – Longest and best acclimatization.

3. Costs & Budget

A Kilimanjaro trek costs between $1,500 – $5,000, depending on the route and tour operator. This includes:
✔ Park fees
✔ Guides & porters
✔ Accommodation (camping or huts)
✔ Meals & water
✔ Transportation

4. What to Pack

Warm layers (temperatures drop below freezing at the summit)

Waterproof gear (rain is common)

Hiking boots (broken in)

Headlamp, gloves, and trekking poles

Sleeping bag rated for cold temperatures

Snacks for extra energy

5. Experience Local Culture

After the climb, explore Tanzania’s rich culture:
✔ Visit Moshi or Arusha to experience Chagga and Maasai traditions
✔ Try local food like Ugali, Nyama Choma, and Pilau
✔ Visit hot springs and coffee plantations
✔ Go on a Safari in Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater

1ja878y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1ja878y/dog_in_kitchen_at_work/,Dog in kitchen at work,"I wasn't going to rant about this but it's really playing on my mind. 

For the last couple of Saturdays, I've gone into work to catch up on a project I've had planned for a long time. The first Saturday I was there, I got talking to a colleague in the corridor with a clear view to the staff room/kitchen. When suddenly I see what is obviously a dog just roaming around. 

This isn't a small dog either, think black and white Great Dane size. Also the staff room isn't that big. Anyway, I go in and get some water and sit on a chair away from the thing, and it wanders over and starts sniffing around my cup and me. The table is coffee table height so its stupid fucking big head is at the perfect height for it to get close to my cup. 

I make it really obvious that I'm not interested and hold my phone up as if to say I'm busy, go away which it does. 

I ditch the water and head out. 

Fast forward to lunch time, when the fucking thing is back in there, I decide to go out for lunch because I refuse to sit in a fucking kitchen with this thing. As I'm putting on my coat, it's looking at me and starts making small bark noises. The owner, one of the tutors, tells it to calm down, by which point I'm walking out. 

So let me get this straight, this fucking abomination got upset because I didn't pay it any attention like everyone else, even though it was in a space meant for humans. The fucking entitlement of these fucking shit machines makes me so angry. 

It doesn't even know where it is. They're so stupid and small brained it just makes me sick to my stomach. 

So now I'll be avoiding the staff room at the weekend because of that giant cockroach. And I can't even complain because they'll know it was me because everyone was apparently fine with this thing walking around where people eat. 

EDIT: Also that same evening I got jumped on by a dog at the pub, the person next to me was loving it but I just remained completely uninterested. I can't fucking stand it. ",4,1741858891.0,Dogfree,1,1.0,False

1ja85k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ja85k8/another_sleepless_story/,Another «sleepless» story,"I’m 27 years old and work as a flight attendant. My insomnia started around 10 years ago when I was in school. It was probably caused by too much anxiety and stress, but back then, I barely cared about my sleep issues because, in the end, I managed to function just fine with only 3–4 hours of sleep.

However, as the years went by, it got worse. I found a job I loved in my favorite field—modeling—but for an entire year, I consistently lacked sleep. Every single day, I slept no more than 3 hours, and maybe on Sundays, I could get 7–8 hours. As you can imagine, my schedule is now completely crazy, and my sleep problems are causing me way more discomfort than before.

At this point, I can go two full days without sleep, and when I finally manage to fall asleep, I can’t sleep for more than 5 hours.

This was my reality for another year until I discovered Unisom + melatonin (5mg).

I swear, this is the only thing that helps me survive. I fall asleep within an hour of taking the pills, and I can finally get at least 8 hours of sleep.

But I know this isn’t a healthy way to live. I’ve been taking these medications for about 10 months, and I’ve heard they can cause serious mental issues. I also assume my kidneys aren’t exactly happy with me constantly taking pills. And with this flying schedule, I need to be able to take quick naps, sleep during short breaks, and doze off on long bus rides. I’m so jealous of my colleagues who can fall asleep anywhere, anytime.

What I usually suffer from:

My brain just won’t turn off—even when my body is completely exhausted. I go to bed like a normal person, but then I just lie there all night with my eyes closed, unable to fall asleep.

I don’t use my phone, I don’t watch movies before bed.
I don’t smoke or drink alcohol.
I barely drink coffee either.
I wouldn’t even say I’m overly stressed, and I don’t feel like I’m drowning in thoughts.

But my brain is just ON.

I’ve tried every technique imaginable—breathing exercises, counting, visualizing a boat in the ocean, yoga, meditation, cold showers, hot showers, baths, aromatherapy, music, white noise, audiobooks.
I swear, after all these years, I’ve tried it all.

At this point, I’d probably just keep taking the pills and living my life until I eventually end up with dementia or Alzheimer’s, but honestly, I feel like that could happen sooner rather than later.

I’ve even started experiencing this weird state of mind, where I know I didn’t sleep because I remember all the thoughts I had throughout the night, but my brain somehow forgets the experience and convinces itself that I slept.

It’s hard to explain, but it’s such a weird feeling.
I 100% know I didn’t sleep because I remember everything I was thinking about all night long.
But because my body was in a sleeping position, with minimal movement, my brain sort of glitches out—it can’t fully register whether I slept or not.

Just for background, my girlfriend (21F) and I (21F) have been dating for almost 3 months, but have been in the same friend group for almost 2 years. Our relationship has been really healthy so far characterized by open and vulnerable conversations, emotional intimacy, and empathy/understanding. 

2 months ago my girlfriend was a part of a play (which she killed btw!!so proud) and this person came to see her performance and afterwards came up to her and asked her to be in their short film and to hangout. They scheduled to meet for coffee and she told me all about it leading up. She's always looking to take more steps to advance her career. I asked her how it went afterwards and she told me that they really connected and had good banter, but also mentioned that she was worried the interaction could've potentially been romantic because they slid into her DMs and it just felt that way, which she never mentioned before. That definitely shifted my feelings on the situation. I began to feel jealous and concerned. 

Then I don't hear about them for a while until last night when my girlfriend hosted a dinner party. She invited some friends and when I asked who she invited she did not mention them coming but as soon as I arrived they were together talking in the kitchen and it stayed like that pretty much the whole night. They were together laughing and joking around the majority of the night and it really made me upset. Her not telling me they were coming confused me a bit and the vibes between them just felt flirty. Then she invites them to come over tomorrow again for dinner and talk about other future upcoming plans, which it didn't seem I was invited to.

I'm not sure if I'm just overreacting to the situation and just have to regulate my emotions better or if there's actually a conversation to be had on how I'm feeling. I talked to one of my friends and he told me that I should trust her and our relationship but it just makes me feel really insecure. Additionally, I don't want her to feel like she can't have friends because of my insecure feelings, that's not fair.

I got serotonin syndrome from combining Elvanse (Vyvanse) with my celexa, which I have been taking for 10 years. The elvanse I took just once, before a doctor told me to discontinue as it had caused serotonin syndrome.

It’s now been 5 days since I took the elvanse, but I am still having some unpleasant symptoms. I wonder whether I could try drinking decaf coffee, as I am missing my morning coffee. Would this increase my serotonin levels in the same way as caffeine?

I also wonder whether I should avoid foods that might increase serotonin until the syndrome goes away? Or is this overthinking it?

For reference, my doctor told my not to stop taking my celexa, as it was just the combination of that with elvanse that gave me serotonin syndrome. Does this sound correct? I thought I should maybe miss a few days of celexa to lower my serotonin levels.

1ja7ptd,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1ja7ptd/musk_email_reaches_italian_workers_it_did_not_go/,Musk Email Reaches Italian Workers. It Did Not Go Well.,"> **Employees at the Aviano Air Base who serve American forces got a familiar demand to list their achievements. Unions say Italy “is not the Wild West like the U.S.”**
> 
> Italian employees at the Aviano Air Base in northern Italy paused from flipping burgers, unloading trucks and restocking shelves recently to open an email from their bosses demanding that they list five key accomplishments from last week.
> 
> The email was a by-now familiar demand from President Trump’s chief cost-cutter, Elon Musk, carrying with it the threat of termination if they did not respond. But on this occasion, it did not land with government employees in the United States, but rather in Italy, a country where workers’ rights are held sacrosanct.
> 
> The result set the stage for a puzzling clash of cultures, with the world’s richest man and his job-thrashing chain saw on one side, and one of the world’s most protective champions of the forever job on the other.
> 
> “We are in Italy here,” said Roberto Del Savio, a union representative and an employee at the base. “There are precise rules and thank God for that.”
> 
> Aviano, an Italian air base that hosts the United States 31st Fighter Wing, employs more than 700 Italian civilian personnel who on a daily basis cook and clean and generally keep the base running.
> 
> In all about 4,000 Italian civilian employees work at bases serving about 15,000 American soldiers in Italy, turning each into a sort of a miniature American town where U.S. military personnel can find American food and other familiar items from home.
> 
> Those jobs, in keeping with longstanding labor traditions in Italy, are fully unionized and protected under Italian labor laws. But at the same time, the employees work for the United States government, which pays their salaries.
> 
> Labor unions say the email was forwarded from a department head to dozens of Italian civilian employees working in the Aviano base’s Army & Air Force exchange service, which provides goods and services to the U.S. Army. 
> 
> No one seemed certain whether it was a one-off misunderstanding or if Mr. Musk was attempting to assert his demands over Italian workers as well as American ones. A Department of Defense official said that while those emails were meant for U.S. employees, local employees “could receive emails,” too.
> 
> The confusion raised questions of whether Mr. Musk could export his brand of unbridled techno-libertarianism to a country that is “founded on labor” per the first article of its Constitution, or whether his chain-saw would snag on Italy’s notoriously thick bureaucracy.
> 
> “Ours is a system built on democracy, safeguards, and protections provided by contracts that must be respected,” Pierpaolo Bombardieri, the secretary general of Italy’s Uil union said in a statement.
> 
> Mr. Bombardieri called the emails “unacceptable” and the method “aberrant.” Italy’s unions wrote to the Italian government and the U.S. embassy asking for explanations.
> 
> For now, the ground rule appears to be that Italian civilians must answer the email only if they receive it directly from the U.S. government — not if it is forwarded to them, as happened at Aviano and at least one other base in Italy, in the city of Vicenza. But it remained unclear whether the Department of Defense was going to reach out to Italian workers directly.
> 
> Some German employees of the U.S. government in Germany also received Mr. Musk’s first email asking them to explain their work output, said a senior diplomat in Berlin, who did not want to be named while talking about an ally. (Mr. Musk’s follow-up email appears to have been sent only to American employees in Germany, the diplomat said.)
> 
> In the meantime, some Italian employees had answered the email, said Mr. Del Savio. “One says I was slicing pizza, another says something else.” he said. “But we were all very puzzled,” he said. “Italy is not the Wild West like the U.S.”
> 
> Despite recent changes that attempted to make the labor market more flexible, Italy’s labor laws continue to offer broad protections to employees. Especially in the public sector, getting a permanent job is often seen as a guarantee to be unfireable for life.  
> 
> Many in Italy value this system as a backbone of the Italian welfare state and its democracy, while others point to it as a rigid and inefficient juggernaut that prevents jobs from being created for young people.
> 
> Stories of half-hour long workdays and daylong coffee breaks are something of a legend in Italy. Some have said a touch of Musk-style slash and burn approach would not hurt here.
> 
> “Italy would also need Musk’s ax,” Nicola Porro, an Italian journalist and right-wing commentator, wrote in a blog post, decrying Italy’s “useless positions.”
> 
> Italians seized upon the juxtaposition. One TikTok creator, Alberico Di Pasquale, made a video pretending to show an Italian employee on a permanent contract answering Mr. Musk’s email. “No. 1: I come to work, No. 2: I clock in, No. 3: breakfast,” he said. “No. 4: tournament with my colleagues to see who will get the coffee; No. 5: I get the coffee. Repeat five times points 4 and 5. No. 6: I go pay my bills and grocery shop; No. 7, I clock out.”
> 
> But while some had fun with the demands from Mr. Musk, for union representatives at the American base in Aviano, and other Italians, it was serious business.
> 
> As Mr. Trump questions the U.S. commitment to NATO and insists that Europe must defend itself, fears of spending cuts are spreading at U.S. bases abroad.
> 
> Amid a 30-day freeze of federal credit cards, the U.S. government last week also froze the credit cards that Italian employees at Aviano used to purchase equipment for the base, then started a hiring freeze, the unions said.
> 
> Union workers said they did not know what was going to come next. But they said they were going to fight on.
> 
> “Musk can do whatever he wants in the United States,” said Emilio Fargnoli, a union representative. “If they are happy with it, sure,” he added. “Not here.”

He was shitty to Rory and Rory did need a lil time off to figure out,"I heard stuff on social media like how Mitchum did the right thing by telling her she didn’t have it. 

Maybe Mitchum was proven right later, Rory had every right to be upset. I watched the episode for the first time. 

Why is Rory acting as his personal secretary and brining coffee orders? I mean interns generally try to fit in and Rory found this easier as she only knew Mitchum.

No one told her what her roles and duties were before joining, at-least a HR rep should’ve done that. 

He only judged her based on how much she participated and I don’t think it would be appropriate even if she spoke up in the meeting plus it was unpaid. If she was paid, then yes she would appreciate a feed back. Basically did all assistant work , got no pay and had her confidence all down. 

I don’t think Mitchum had any motive her but he was the usual “ I need more, this is not good enough “ kinda person Logan warned about. 


And I think Lorelai and her grandparents handled this situation poorly. Taking a break ain’t too bad but dropping out of a yale for a year? Not good . 

It was okay to take a break, but not too long and I seriously doubt how a 3 year old child knows she wants to be a journalist.

Journalism sounds like a career that Lorelai would pursue. Rory should have taken a break to reconsider her career instead. She “got it “ but in the wrong field. I think she would be a great engineer or doctor but not a lawyer.

My (29F) partner, Mike (29M) recently started a new college course. He has made a nice group of friends there and they all seem to get on really well. The issue is one of the girls, Megan. 

A while back, Mike and the group were on a night out and I was meeting him to pick something up. Megan said something about being confused as to why Mike brought a “random” over before he introduced me. 

Everyone in the group introduced themselves and spoke a bit to me but Megan and a friend just kept speaking to each other, said a brief hi and that was it. It was a bit rude. I spoke to the group for five minutes while Megan kept whispering and looking at me which was making me uncomfortable. She eventually spoke to us but just made a thinly disguised insult about the color of my hair. It was nothing major, a bit rude and weird though. She then spent the next 5 minutes just before I was leaving flirting with Mike right in front of me. Nothing too obvious, just playful type stuff but still, very clearly flirting. I was uncomfortable and left soon after, as I said I was just picking something up. 

I spoke to Mike about this after and he was oblivious but we relayed the story to mutual friends who all agreed that she was rude, it sounded like she was flirting and that it seems like she was into him. 

I trust Mike so apart from voicing my concerns about her a few times, I haven’t asked him not to see her. 

Mike and Megan had coffee yesterday between classes, I knew this because we spoke about his day. Again, no issue. However, we were in bed late last night and he got a voice note from Megan. Maybe not my finest moment but I asked why she was voicenoting him so late a night and he said “that’s just how she communicates” and played the voice note. It was SO flirty and inappropriate. Among other things she said she had such a nice time, she felt like the two of them could just talk for hours, please can they do that again some time. Her tone was so flirtatious, giggly, just so obviously flirting. 

This was the last straw for me. I asked Mike to please not see Megan one-on-one again. I can’t stop him seeing the group and would NEVER do that, but this girl has now, in my view, repeatedly disrespected our relationship and me as well and I do not feel comfortable with him having a friendship with her due to this. 

Mike pushed back on this and said something like “what so I can’t have any friends”. This is untrue he has plenty of friends, the majority are also women who I have no issues with him seeing. Her gender is not the issue, her attitude is as she is overstepping boundaries. Mike has said there shouldn’t be an issue if I trust him, and I do. But that doesn’t make me any less uncomfortable with this situation and I don’t understand why this is so important to him. They have only known each other a few months.

1ja7mmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ja7mmt/i_20f_cant_shake_the_feeling_that_my_relationship/,I (20F) can't shake the feeling that my relationship with my boyfriend (21M) is on an inevitable course towards failure. Is there anything I can do to save this?,"I want to apologize in advance for the long post. My boyfriend and I have been dating for just over two years. We met when we were around 14 and started dating when we were 18 and 19. This past August, I moved about 2 hours away after transferring to a university, and we're doing a semi-distance relationship. Everything was going well until winter break. I had just been hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar II disorder in the fall (not what I need advice on, but relevant to the issue). We were in the car with my best friend, and he blurts out: ""Guess what? OP has bipolar disorder!"" I told him to stop, but he continued, asking me ""and do you want to tell her where you were?!"" I felt forced to tell her about my hospitalization. I brought this up to my therapist, who was appalled. She told me that it was unacceptable, and that our relationship wouldn't work if we didn't fix some things. Something about that conversation shattered my near-perfect perception of our relationship. I had a talk with him that same day, and told him that I no longer wanted to consider him moving in with me the next academic year because we weren't ready. Admittedly, I also told him that I needed to work on myself, even if it means we end up not being compatible anymore. That definitely hurt him and I regret saying it.

Where I really messed up was when we were at a mutual friend's house a few days later. I don't remember what the context was, I think we were bickering over something, but I just remember looking my boyfriend and saying it would be a miracle if we made it to three years. He drove me back to school that same night. We talked, and he told me that he needed me to decide whether I wanted to continue the relationship by the time we got back to my apartment. I remember crying and telling him ""I never thought it would come to this."" We talked more in my apartment, and I kept trying to ask him how he felt, and whether he wants to explore other relationships (I'm his first everything). I don't know whether I was looking for a cop-out or whether I was looking for him to tell me that he wanted me. I asked him if this (our relationship/me) is what he wants, and he said he didn't know. I decided that meant it was time to end things. As I started telling him that it's been two years, and he should've known by now, he started crying and pulled me close. We both ugly cried and decided that we wanted to work things out (and this man never cries).

For the next two weeks, I couldn't stop questioning things. I spent hours a day looking up things like ""how to know when to break up."" I made a shared note where we could both write down things we wanted the other person to work on, but it felt like we were fighting every day. It was so hard having a relationship-altering moment and then having to physically be apart and work through it over the phone. I asked him if he could plan a visit and a day trip, and we spent the day in the city near my school. It was so fun. Things felt okay again. My boyfriend also told me that the arguing was starting to really wear him down, and that scared me, so I've been working on it and we've been arguing a lot less. Things feel a lot better now (two months later), but I can't shake the feeling that what happened doomed our relationhip. He brought up what I said at our friend's during a disagreement yesterday, and I can't help but feel like he's never going to stop resenting me over it. He says it was the way I said it that shattered him. He says he's mostly gotten over it, but I'm scared that it will ultimately kill our relationship, and it'll be my fault. Part of me isn't too mad at myself, though, because he had just betrayed my trust and disclosed my highly stigmatized mental illness to someone I wasn't ready to tell yet. I was really hurting when I said it.

Now that I've gotten the crappy stuff out of the way, here are some wonderful things about my boyfriend:

The night we almost broke up, he told me that no matter what I chose, he would still help me take my stuff up to my apartment and buy me dinner. That was a class act.

If I'm scared that my mental health will get bad after he falls asleep and I'll have no one to help, he falls asleep on the phone with me so I feel less alone, even when he works at 5am the next day.

He sends me money to buy coffee, food, groceries, etc. just because he wants to make sure I'm cared for.

We talk on the phone daily.

I asked him to please start texting me on one of his breaks because I miss him when he's at work, and he made it a habit to do so.

He takes me out to dinner and never expects anything in return.

When I was in the psych hospital, he came to visit me twice even though it was about an hour away for him. He brought me clothes and books and even snuck me some chocolate. He picked me up when I was discharged and drove me back to school the next day.

I feel like the doubts have subsided and I've fallen back in love with him, but I just have this looming fear that things are going to end. Those of you in long-term relationships: have you ever hurt each other emotionally? Did you recover? How? It feels silly to put in this much emotional work over a two-year relationship, but we've known each other for so long and I truly do love him.

TLDR: My boyfriend and I both badly hurt each other (emotionally), and our relationship has been rocky but is slowly getting better. However, I just feel like we doomed it. Is there any way to fix things?",3,1741856188.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1ja7fdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1ja7fdw/the_ceos_miracle_quadruplets/,The CEO’s Miracle Quadruplets,"Emmeline's first night was far from ideal. There was no sense of euphoria and joy. 

In the darkness, the man's scorching sweat dripped incessantly, almost burning her.

She could feel his strength, but he was too rough, completely disregarding her feelings.

After countless times, the man withdrew without a trace of emotion.

""Those who dare to scheme against me never meet a good end. Considering you're a woman, I'll spare your life.""

Then, a bank card was thrown onto Emmeline's face. ""Ten million, for one night with you."" His voice, hoarse and icy, could freeze the air.

With a loud bang, the door was slammed shut as the man strode away.

""D*mn!"" Emmeline couldn't help but curse.

What an inexplicable man!

He barged into my room, did such a thing to me, and then humiliated me.

What a b*stard!

Furious, Emmeline wanted to chase after the man and teach him a lesson, but she had no strength left.

When she finally recovered, it was already the next day.

Dragging her aching body to the front desk to check on the man, she was told that the hotel's surveillance records from the previous night had been erased. There was no trace of the man who had intruded into her room.

The only clue was the bank card left behind by the man—under the name Abel Ryker.

When Emmeline traced it to Ryker Group, the receptionist told her, ""Mr. Ryker has already gone abroad. No one can contact him.""

Emmeline stared blankly at the bank card.

She couldn't be sure if the man from that night was the actual cardholder. There was no information about him online.

That man had taken her first night and then vanished, as if he had never existed.

She didn't even know what he looked like.

Everything seemed like a dream, so unreal.

…

Not long after, Emmeline discovered she was pregnant.

The Louise family, a well-known wealthy family in Struyria, was thrown into chaos.

""How could I have such a shameless daughter? My reputation is tarnished now."" Emmeline's father slapped her across the face while scolding her mercilessly.

""While you're so young, you're lacking in self-respect, messing around, and ending up with a child. You don't even know who the father is. Could it be that there was more than one man that night?"" Emmeline's stepmom kept slandering her viciously.

""Get out of the Louise family. From now on, you are no longer a Louise.""

Looking at her indifferent father, Emmeline felt her heart turn cold.

After such an incident, she was clearly the victim, but her so-called family didn't show any concern, only indiscriminate beatings and scolding.

Such a family wasn't worth keeping.

Amid her stepmom's triumphant gaze, Emmeline left with her luggage.

Simultaneously, the news of Emmeline, the Louise family's eldest daughter, partying with multiple men and getting pregnant hit the trending searches.

Nine months later, Emmeline gave birth secretly in a small hospital.

""Where are you taking my child?"" Emmeline, weak from childbirth, watched her newborn being taken away. She was powerless to move.

The nurse, not looking back, replied, ""It's stillborn. I'm taking care of it.""

""Ah!""

The searing pain from her abdomen left Emmeline no room to think about anything else.

There were still more children inside her belly.

Outside the hospital, the nurse handed the newborn boy to Emmeline's stepmother.

Looking at the baby in the swaddling clothes, Emmeline's stepmom, Alondra, smiled with satisfaction. 

Excellent! With this child, my niece could marry into the Ryker family successfully.

…

Time flew by, and five years passed in the blink of an eye.

""Madam, latest news.""

While Emmeline was brewing coffee at the cafe counter, she received a message. 

""Ryker Group's chairman is on his deathbed. Abel returned to visit today.""

A candid photo was attached to the message below.

The man, in a dark suit and white tie, tall and commanding, exuded a unique air of grace and sharpness.

His features were profound, his deep eyes cold and decisive even in the blurry photo.

Emmeline took a sharp breath.

Could such a cool and handsome man be the one who took my first night five years ago?

She looked at her son's features.

There's indeed some resemblance.

Emmeline quickly untied her apron and grabbed her four-year-old son. ""Since you're not going to kindergarten, you're coming with me.""

""Where are we going, Mommy?"" Hesperus asked while putting down his Rubik's cube. His eyes sparkled like black gems.

1ja76xm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja76xm,Long post alert!,"Hello, everyone! I’d love to hear your thoughts on cinnamon rolls.

When it comes to the texture of the bread, what do you prefer: crumbly, cake-like, or soft and chewy?

Thickness: Thick or thin swirls? 

How about the filling do you like it dry or moist?

And for the flavor: Do you like it overpowering, minimal, or well-balanced?

As for toppings, I used to make a cream cheese glaze with Philadelphia cream cheese, confect sugar, butter, and vanilla syrup. But later on, I simplified it and dropped the butter and cream cheese because whipping the cream was a bit too labor intensive and added extra costs. Too much fat, really. But if anyone requests it, I always have a block of cream cheese on hand.

Here’s a bit more about the cinnamon rolls I make: I focus on fully developing the gluten, aiming for a soft, chewy, and slightly airy texture. The dough is tender enough that you can pull it apart from the end to the middle of the swirl without tearing. The rolls typically have 5-7 swirls, with a height of around 2.5 inches per roll, pre-bake approximately 140g per roll. I chill the 80% proofed dough before lamination for better control over the process.

For the filling, I use a mix of white and muscovado sugars. This combo is perfectly balanced the white sugar gives a nice caramelization, while the muscovado adds a nutty, moist texture thanks to the molasses. Dark brown sugar works well too if you’re looking for a more caramelized and moist filling.

For the fats, I use pure butter either Anchor or Queensland for both the dough and the filling. Pure butter helps create a tender crumb and adds to the bread’s softness. It’s a better choice than hydrogenated butter, which doesn’t provide the same richness.

Now, about cinnamon: I use Ceylon cinnamon, which I get from my Sri Lankan friend. He introduced me to the authentic cinnamon powder and showed me the best variety, even for cardamom seeds. He mentioned that Kayu Manis from Indonesia is also a good choice, but Ceylon is harder to find since it only grows in a few countries Malaysia being one of them. That’s why Ceylon tends to be more expensive. Like with coffee (e.g., Sagada Arabica), there’s a lot of fake Ceylon on the market, so it’s important to do your research before buying. I think one reason some people don’t like cinnamon is that they’ve tried Cassia cinnamon instead of Ceylon. Trust me, there’s a huge difference in taste!

Ceylon cinnamon has a naturally sweet, warm flavor with a subtle hint of citrus. It’s smoother and less sharp than Cassia. On the other hand, Cassia has a robust, earthy taste slightly bitter, woody, and darker in color. Sometimes may aligasgas like sabit sa lalamunan. It’s cheaper and more accessible. For my rolls, I use about 1.4% cinnamon powder based on the flour weight. For example, for 500g of flour, I use about 7grams or 2 and 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon.

Based on feedback from people who’ve tried my cinnamon rolls, most of them love the balance of bread texture and taste. A lot of them enjoy the moist, gooey filling, which I think is pretty typical of cinnamon rolls. But recently, someone mentioned that they prefer their rolls dry, with a crumbly bread texture, and they want the sugar glaze to provide moisture not the cinnamon-sugar filling. I found that a bit odd. Lowering hydration to achieve a drier crumb can lead to quicker hardness and a shorter shelf life just my two cents, since I don’t use bread improvers or extra preservatives. But my rolls usually last a max of 3 days at room temperature. With Yudane (a natural bread improver), the rolls can stay soft for 3+ days with proper gluten development and fermentation.

I know this is a long post, but if you’ve got any thoughts on what makes your ideal cinnamon roll, feel free to share in the comments! I’d love to improve mine, and others might find it helpful too. 

As always, happy baking!

1ja76sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yoode/comments/1ja76sm/how_small_businesses_are_using_custom_tshirts_for/,How Small Businesses Are Using Custom T-Shirts for Branding,"https://preview.redd.it/2dcg93aexeoe1.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c7ea2b45c4ef57df6f77f14ec18878fd599e247

It might be a great idea to get advertisements for your business through your customers having to be just walking about. This is what a custom T-shirt can do simply and cost-effectively for small businesses to effortlessly spread their brand. T-shirts of this kind can make employees, loyal customers, or giveaways—the walking billboards.

Due to the new development in custom T-shirt printing, business has gone beyond traditional marketing means. Effective T-shirt designs do not only let people take notice of your brand, but they also create an identity for customers and employees. And with ordering custom t-shirts online, it has never been easier for small businesses to order high-quality and affordable designs.

# Why Custom T-Shirts Are a Smart Branding Strategy

A marketing budget can be tight when you are a small business; investing in custom T-shirt printing is one of the efficient ways to boost your visibility without breaking the bank. Unlike digital ads, which would drain you for their ongoing commitment, or billboards, which limit you in your reach—every T-shirt still promotes your brand each time one wears it.

This is why the small businesses are increasingly engaging custom t-shirts in their branding efforts:

●     **Affordable for long-lasting marketing:** It is a value for your money as a well-designed t-shirt remains a promotional tool every time it is worn.

●     **New Brand Recognition:** A new business logo, a nice design, helps register your business to customers; thus, familiarity is created over time.

●     **Community Building:** The T-san creates a sense of identity and belongingness among customers or workers alike, which furthers brand loyalty.

●     **Infinite Customization:** Businesses have several options they can try out by combining new designs, saggy, and color of custom t-shirts, thanks to the convenient ordering of custom t-shirts online.

# How To Create Custom T-shirts That Stand Out

There are various forms of t-shirts, but branding dictates how effective they can be. The following advice should help one when designing custom t-shirts for their small business:

**1. Keep the Design Simple but Impactful**

Yes, less is more, at least in terms of branding. Stick to plain, bold designs that give off clear, readable, and surplus aesthetics. Avoid all the clutter from text run-on and drawing graphics since a simple design with a striking logo or an essential slogan is often recalled better than one that is actualized in greater complexity.

**2. The Right Choice of Colors**

Colors connote emotions that also dictate perceptions. Choose colors that convey the proper message about your brand and can scream without being too loud. Some colors command attention such as red or yellow while subdued hues set the stage for adding sophistication.

**3. Placement of Logo**

Ensure that your logo seems prominent but not overbearing as per the design. Some of the common yet effective placements include:

●     **Left chest area:** For a subtle yet professional touch.

●     **Large back print:** For maximum visibility from a distance.

●     **Sleeve or bottom corner:** This approach is modern and keeps the branding understated.

**4. Don't Compromise on Quality**

A poorly made t-shirt speaks volumes about your brand. So, if you invest in high-quality fabric and custom t-shirt printing methods, you can be assured of a long-lasting and comfortable tee—no one will be able to resist wearing it multiple times.

# Creative Ways Small Businesses Are Using Custom T-Shirts

1ja76ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ja76ir/adhd_may_be_a_connective_tissue_disorder/,ADHD may be a connective tissue disorder?!,"Anyone else listen to the ADHDchatter podcast? This week’s episode blew my mind:

https://overcast.fm/+ABAPaoQqr9w

The link between ADHD (we REALLY need to change the name 🙄) and hypermobility is increasingly clear. The idea that ADHD may be caused by a difference in connective tissue structure is very compelling.

The stuff about anxiety being caused by problems with proprioception and physical information processing is interesting too 🤔

If, like me, you can’t function without two strong cups of coffee in the morning, this paper might be of interest:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8864202/

It also made me think about all the ADHD peeps that find caffeine puts you to sleep (not me!). What if it corrects proprioception for you and as a result the anxiety that’s “driving you like a motor” subsides enough for you to sleep?

Other helpful nuggets from the podcast:
- the connective tissue hypothesis might also explain dietary issues
- we’re at 3x higher risk of long COVID, which seems to be triggered by high inflammation. If you can, maybe explore a low inflammation diet to reduce your risk (although that’s me extrapolating a lot further than the podcast based on my own experience of my inflammation improving when I realised I’m dairy intolerant and quit it)
- Hormones are involved too, although it’s not yet clear how
- the ADHDmen in your life are also likely to have hypermobile joints and the associated health impacts, but they’re more likely to get missed because their hormone profiles are more likely to mask it

And finally, if you have a bendy body, did/do you have a party trick? Mine was picking a lipstick up off the floor with my teeth without bending my knees.

1ja7684,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1ja7684/i_used_work_hard_but_im_now_realising_without_a/,"I (used) work hard,  but I’m now realising without a relationship it’s all just BS","I don’t want to pretend to be a philosopher/deep thinker. But a good relationship makes you much more happy than anything else in life. At least that’s what I feel because I lack it. 

I used to be super hard worker. Often 12-14 hrs a day. Used to make a lot of money. Was my passion and my dream. That was my early 20s, I used to think relationships are just distractions so I never dated someone other than this one girl who used to be supportive to me too. But then that didn’t work out for obvious reasons. I’m no master of anything, but I’ve a decent job. Good health and some savings to go through life. And with little effort I can at least get a job which pays my rent so I’m not worried about my employment that much. Actually I do realise that this is a dream for many. People are in the war zones fighting for their lives but I’m lucky enough to enjoy my coffee in the morning with peaceful environment. 

But human brain is a mess, my childhood has been really really lonely. I love my parents but then never understood who I am, my teachers were the same… today I don’t have any friends from school or from college. I just have few people I talk to sometimes (just on chat). When I told this to my therapist she said “I think you never have felt real connection with anyone” I think she’s right. I’m no millionaire but I’ve everything materialistically, but I’ve no relationships. With my past trauma, my PTSD episodes, my ASD and anxiety… plus my family drama… I restrict myself from entering into someone’s life. I don’t want to date anyone. Because let’s be honest, there are million better humans out there, why would anyone want to live their life in pain? I’m just too much to handle and have too much brutal past… I can make myself laugh let alone someone else. 

This is maybe depression, but I’ve seen this exact pattern in my parents. My father is also gifted autistic, I’ve seen my mother in pain for years (and eventually she cheated on him, that secret I still carry with me). I’ve seen my ex, how I made her feel. People like me don’t deserve to be in romantic relationships, and I don’t think it’s any emotional statement, it’s logical! I think I’m a bad gene, and I don’t even want to pass this gene to next gen (so no kids). 

I do want to make friends but I don’t want them to get closer to me too much. Because I’ll bring them down with my sadass philosophy. I’m no pessimistic per se but I do believe I will never achieve true happiness which I feel only can be achieved through warm relationships. The closest I can get is by my work and I’m just now trying to work as hard as possible just so that I don’t have to feel lonely.  

Thanks for reading this chaotic mind dump. I just wanted to let it out. ",7,1741853944.0,Gifted,4,1.0,False

1ja73uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1ja73uk/thoracic_endo_or_gallbladder/,Thoracic endo or gallbladder?,"I've had continuous dull, pulling, stitch-like pain in right upper stomach/under bottom right ribs since November. It came accompanied by horrible sciatica-like pain in lower back, tailbone area, left pelvis and left leg. This was diagnosed in December to be endometriosis and it was found near my left ovary in ultrasound, explaining the left sided pains. I've taken desogestrel for two months for endo, and all the sciatica like symptoms, periods and pain have disappeared. However, the right stomach/rib pain hasn't ceased. It's not ""typical"" gallbladder pain, since it's not attacks, but instead a constant dull pain and a feeling that something extra is lodged under there. For example, I can't sleep on my stomach or sides, can't properly lean forwards, sitting is uncomfortable. It worsens throughout the day, and then suddenly in the night during sleeping on my back, it disappears, until it reappears after sometime after waking up. 

I had a stomach ultrasound yesterday and they found nothing anywhere, but a tiny ""good-quality"" polyp in my gallbladder which I shouldn't feel at all? My labs are fine. Coffee affects a bit and I've laid off it. Also I'm vegan and eat low-fat home cooked food anyways. Don't drink or smoke. I've had a hard time getting help since the waits for doctors are long, my doctors keep changing constantly and no one really wants to find out what's going on, they don't even read the previous doctor's entries properly. (this is Finland btw, not the public healthcare paradise people assume it to be) I've had to go use my money to go to private doctors to get help. 

Next time I have a phone time with a doctor, I'll try to get an MRI of the area. I'm just wondering if it could be thoracic endo or gallbladder problems? Even if they don't show up in stomach ultrasound. Anyone here with similar experiences? 

  
This constant dull pain is affecting my life so much. Sending strength to all of you here </3",1,1741853624.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False
