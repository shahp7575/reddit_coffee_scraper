1o6t03t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1o6t03t/review_battle_of_the_briix/,Review: Battle of the Briix,"Another day, another indie perfume house! I‚Äôve only seen good things about Briix, which is equally encouraging and suspicious. I‚Äôve held off on trying them until now because everything sounded very sweet, and also for the petty reasons that I just don‚Äôt like their all-gray branding. What can I say, I‚Äôm a visual creature! But eventually curiosity won out and I got an EDP sampler pack. Will Briix be a worthy contender in the battle for my #1 gourmand house?

Let‚Äôs get to the smells:

**Sleepy Hollow**: In real life, I quite like a semi-sweet pumpkin spice latte as an occasional treat. In perfume though, I‚Äôm learning they may not be my thing. I find this one particularly offensive; it‚Äôs incredibly sweet, artificial, over-powering, and underlined with a bizarrely bitter coffee note. One innocent spray on my wrist in the morning made me feel like I was being smothered in a PSL Yankee Candle while breathing in the vapors of a hot, stale pot of coffee. I couldn‚Äôt scrub this one off fast enough. ***Note***: *Coffee CO2, Espresso shot, Steamed Milk, Pumpkin Spice, Salted Caramel drizzle, with a hint of Sweet Orange EO, Ambrette Seed, Iso E Super* \[2/10\]

**Cozy Winter:** This is extremely true to the hot chocolate packet note, down to a bit of the powderiness of the sugared cocoa powder. I‚Äôm also getting a good dose of the nutmeg/cinnamon which elevates this beyond what could be a very boring (and artificial) cocoa powder scent alone. When I wore this out and about, I didn‚Äôt think it was so strong when I sniffed my wrist, but it did waft prettily in the air around me. Is this scent going to change the world? No. But it‚Äôs a solid gourmand and as the name suggests, it‚Äôs cozy.¬† ***Notes***: *Cocoa Absolute, Hot Chocolate with mini marshmallows, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, French Vanilla Cream, Cashmeran, Virginian Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Guaiacwood EO and Smoke* \[7/10\]

**Dance of the Forest Nymph:** This is the unfortunate amalgamation of every overly sweet, fruity, juvenile, air-freshener adjacent, department store fragrance I‚Äôve ever smelled. Close to but also much worse than **Witchery** by Sorce, which is the slightly higher quality version of this. This is a berry spray from Bath & Body Works that you get in a Christmas present from a family friend in 2002 and you keep in your middle school gym locker to sort of cover up your pubescent stank but then decades later you realize you were just making it SO much worse because in addition to BO, you now smelled like cheap air freshener. If I‚Äôm being charitable, it smells like TJ Maxx where the seasonal candle aisle intersects with the plastic outdoor furniture aisle. My husband says it smells ‚Äúlike most of the things at Sephora‚Äù which I think is a generous but not inaccurate interpretation. ***Notes***: *Fresh Raspberries, sweet Raspberry Puree, boozy Amaretto wine, Magic Sugar Crystals, Fresh Air Breeze, Vanilla, Treemoss, Amber Resin, and Woodland Forest* \[2/10\]

**Lemond Blossom:** I‚Äôve been on something of a roll lately with my lemon gourmands and I‚Äôve been loving Unknown Pleasures, Baby Longlegs, and Butterfly Rabble. I thought this would be an easy hit and boy was I wrong! Instead of a fun, lemony, sugary gourmand I got something that I can only describe as lemon-scented hand wipes. That‚Äôs a yikes for me. ***Notes***: *Lemon Mousse Cake, Almond Meringue Cream, Orange Blossom Absolute, Creamy Musk, Sheer Amber, Cedramber* \[2/10\]

**Tropical Paradise:** It goes on extremely strong and sweet with a note that smells like toasted rice? Or is it toasted coconut? It‚Äôs a bit artificial and bordering on burnt, but it‚Äôs not wholly unpleasant. It goes through an unfortunate sweet, synthetic, generic phase and lands in the realm of a slightly rice-y musk. This is 0% mango to my nose, and doesn‚Äôt seem very tropical to me. If you like rice notes, it might be worth a try? But there‚Äôs something in here that still smells sort of cheap and cloying. ***Notes***: *Ripe Mango, Sweet Peach, Smooth Coconut, Basmatti \[sic\] Sticky Rice, Marshmallow Cream, Plumeria (Frangipani) and Soft Musk* \[5/10\]

**Ethereal Duvet:** The sample came to me less than half full, which is pretty disappointing. But does it smell good? No. This is a very sharp, sweet, artificial pear shampoo and in the dry down I get something that smells almost like a musky caramel \[white musk and ambrette seeds?\]. If my duvet, ethereal or not, smelled like this then I would find another. If you want to smell like a fruity shampoo from the 90‚Äôs then give this a try, otherwise I‚Äôd say this is a hard pass. ***Notes***: *Fresh Pears, Sweet Melon, Luscious Honeysuckle, Delicate Lily of the Valley, Cotton Candy, Ambrette Seeds, White Musk and Iso E Super* \[3/10\]

**Matchatopia:** I guess we saved the best for last? This is a good matcha, and I‚Äôm impressed. If you‚Äôre a fan of Osmofolia‚Äôs On the Corner of Jinhu Road #1, then you‚Äôll probably like this. It‚Äôs sweeter, lighter, and more airy, but undeniably matcha. It definitely gives matcha latte vibes more than just sticking your nose in a little container of matcha. It‚Äôs not super strong but it lasts and lasts on my skin. I actually don‚Äôt know if I really want to smell like honest-to-god matcha latte, but if I did this would be my pick. The next day after the wear test I was sniffing my sweatshirt and was pleasantly surprised to discover that this smells like fluffy yellow cake.¬† ***Notes***: *Matcha powder, Mate Absolute, Vanilla Ice Cream, Tonka Bean, White Musk* \[8/10\]

IMO Briix is very much in the same league as Maison des Animaux in that they‚Äôre both indie houses that are appealing to more popular commercial scent profiles. Gourmands are big these days, and I think if you‚Äôre approaching Briix from the background of Kayali/Lattafa etc, then this will be a home run. If you‚Äôre approaching from a more indie background with weirder interests (butter, dirt, grass, etc), then this might not be the house for you. I don‚Äôt want to yuck anyone‚Äôs yum, but there was a sweet artificiality running through most of these samples that I didn‚Äôt care for. The bright spots were **Cozy Winter** as especially **Matchatopia**, which is a better matcha than most and worth the hype. I‚Äôve already destashed my other samples though and probably won‚Äôt try anything else from this house. ¬†",4,1760478766.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

* No foods can increase estrogen levels, but the right diet can help reduce the effects of menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats
* Plant compounds called phytoestrogens in foods like soy, flaxseeds, and legumes may provide some relief from symptoms
* A registered dietitian can provide a personalized menopause diet, whether someone is taking HRT or not

Menopause brings uncomfortable symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats that can disrupt daily life. While no food can increase estrogen levels, plant compounds called phytoestrogens may help ease symptoms naturally.

*The best part?*¬†Many of these helpful foods may already be in your pantry or at your local grocery store. From soy products to flaxseeds, these everyday ingredients contain compounds that can provide gentle, estrogen-like effects to help ease the menopausal transition.

Let's explore how certain foods can become powerful allies during menopause.

# Dealing with menopause

During¬†[menopause](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423009054), your ovaries gradually stop producing estrogen. This hormonal shift is what causes many of the symptoms you experience.

Symptoms of menopause include:

* Hot flashes (sudden surges of intense heat that spread across the body)
* Night sweats (excessive sweating during sleep)
* Mood changes
* Sleep problems, such as insomnia
* Brain fog, memory issues, difficulty concentrating
* Fatigue
* Hair thinning or hair loss
* Bloating

Additionally, many women experience¬†[menopause weight gain](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/menopause-weight-gain-lose-weight-in-menopause?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL)¬†as hormonal changes during this transition slow down metabolism and shift fat storage to the abdominal area, making it harder to maintain their usual weight even with the same diet and exercise routine.

""The hormonal changes during menopause represent a significant physiological transition that affects multiple body systems,"" notes Gia Eapen, MD. ""While we cannot replace the body's natural estrogen production through diet alone, a¬†[strategic menopause diet](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/menopause-diet-manage-menopause-symptoms-naturally?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL)¬†may help provide symptom relief.""

# Can diet reduce menopause symptoms?

**Here's what's important to understand:**¬†there are no foods that can actually¬†[increase estrogen](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/how-to-increase-estrogen-naturally-a-complete-guide?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL)¬†levels in your body. However, certain foods contain plant compounds that can help manage symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. Think of these foods as helpful support, not a replacement for hormones.

[Dietary](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/9-foods-that-fight-hot-flashes-dietitian-approved?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL)¬†changes can make a real difference. One¬†[study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523055181)¬†suggests that following a Mediterranean-style diet, which emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, nuts, and fish, can decrease both the frequency and intensity of hot flashes.

Another¬†[study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229923000894)¬†indicates that following a low-fat, vegan diet with cooked soybeans can also help reduce the occurrence of hot flashes.

But how exactly do foods help? This is where phytoestrogens come into the picture.

# What are phytoestrogens?

[Phytoestrogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722977/)¬†are natural compounds found in plants that have a chemical structure similar to the estrogen your body makes. When you eat these foods, the phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen receptors in your body and provide mild estrogen-like effects.

**The keyword here is ‚Äòmild.‚Äô**¬†Phytoestrogens are much weaker than your body's natural estrogen, but this gentle action can still provide benefits. Research shows that they can be¬†[100 to 100,000](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/648139)¬†times weaker than the estrogen produced by the body.

These foods include soy products like tofu, legumes, and more.

# Estrogen-rich foods for menopause

# 1. Soy

[Soy foods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2891137/), like tofu, tempeh, soy milk, and edamame, are excellent sources when it comes to phytoestrogens. They contain high levels of isoflavones, phytoestrogens that may mimic the effects of estrogen.

**Research suggests that women who eat soy regularly report fewer hot flashes.**¬†In one¬†[study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8462449/), the women followed a plant-based, low-fat diet that included a daily half-cup serving of soybeans in their meals. They experienced an¬†[84%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8462449/)¬†reduction in moderate to severe hot flash episodes over 3 months.

""There are many simple ways to incorporate soy into your daily meals,"" says¬†[**Rita Faycurry, RD, Registered Dietitian**](https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/rita-faycurry?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL). ""Try adding tofu to stir-fries or blending it into smoothies for extra protein. Edamame makes a perfect snack, while tempeh works wonderfully in sandwiches or tossed into salads. And don't forget soy milk. It's an easy swap with your morning cereal or coffee.""

# 2. Flaxseeds

Flaxseeds are a good dietary source of lignans (a type of phytoestrogen). These tiny seeds are highly nutritious and versatile.

Studies have¬†[shown](https://jptcp.com/index.php/jptcp/article/view/5104)¬†that flaxseeds can help reduce the intensity of menopausal symptoms. They are also rich in¬†[omega-3 fatty acids](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989356/), which benefit overall health.

""Incorporating flaxeeds into your diet is simple,"" says Faycurry, RD. ""You can add ground flaxseeds to yogurt or oatmeal. You can also blend them into smoothies, toss them into salads for a crunch, or bake with¬†[flax eggs](https://www.myweekendkitchen.in/how-to-make-flax-eggs-vegan-eggs/).""

# 3. Legumes

Beyond soy, other legumes, like chickpeas, lentils, and beans, contain¬†[isoflavones](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10421377/).

These protein-rich foods help:

* Stabilize blood sugar
* Support healthy weight management
* Provide¬†[dietary fiber](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/what-is-dietary-fiber?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL)
* Contribute to heart health

# 4. Sesame seeds

Sesame seeds are convenient additions to almost any meal and are a good source of phytoestrogens. Recent findings are particularly promising for menopausal women. A 2023¬†[study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37212033/)¬†found that daily sesame seed intake in post-menopausal women positively affected their bone health.

Additionally, sesame seeds offer antioxidant¬†[benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16614415/)¬†and may help improve cholesterol levels in post-menopausal women.

""Sesame seeds are easy to work into your meals,"" says Faycurry, RD. ""You can sprinkle them on salads for extra flavor, add them on top of stir-fries, or mix them into homemade granola. You could also use tahini (sesame seeds ground with olive oil) as a spread or dip.""

# 5. Cruciferous vegetables

""Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale are excellent sources of phytoestrogens,"" says Faycurry, RD. ""Try roasting Brussels sprouts with olive oil for a crispy side dish, add broccoli to stir-fries or pasta, blend kale into smoothies, or use cabbage in slaws and soups.""

# Bonus tips: What‚Äôs the best menopause diet?

Other nutrients beyond phytoestrogens play important roles during menopause.

# 1. Calcium

Bone health becomes a top priority as estrogen levels decline because¬†[bone loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2266953/)¬†is a symptom during and after menopause. Getting enough calcium can help.

""For calcium, focus on dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt,"" says Faycurry, RD. ""Leafy greens such as kale and collard greens are excellent non-dairy options, while canned fish with bones like sardines and salmon provide both calcium and protein. Almonds and sesame seeds round out the list as convenient, calcium-rich snacks.""

The US Recommended Dietary Allowance ([RDA](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/)) for calcium for women is:

* Women, 19-50 years: 1,000 mg per day
* Women, 51-7 years: 1, 200 mg per day

However, bear in mind that some experts believe this level is high. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends¬†[500 mg a day](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-much-calcium-do-you-really-need), and the UK recommends¬†[700 mg per day](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/calcium/).

Natural food sources are the ideal way to meet calcium needs, but¬†[calcium supplements](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8027856/)¬†can help bridge the gap when dietary intake falls short.

**üí°Tip:**¬†Calcium works most effectively when¬†[paired with vitamin D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15501704/), since Vitamin D helps your body absorb and use the calcium you consume.

# 2. Vitamin D

[Vitamin D](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10291614/)¬†becomes extra important during menopause because declining estrogen levels make it harder for the body to produce and use this nutrient effectively.

* **Bone health:**¬†Vitamin D plays an essential role in¬†[calcium absorption](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10291614/)¬†and bone health, which becomes increasingly important after menopause when bone loss accelerates.
* **Vaginal health:**¬†Clinical studies demonstrate that vitamin D can¬†[improve](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10291614/)¬†vaginal health in postmenopausal women by reducing dryness and restoring healthy pH levels.
* **Impact Mood:**¬†Vitamin D may help¬†[regulate moods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10291614/), although more research is needed to fully understand its effects on other menopausal symptoms, like hot flashes.

The¬†[recommended Vitamin D levels for women](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3)¬†are:

* 19-50 years: 600 IU (15 mcg)
* 51-70 years: 600 IU (15 mcg)
* Greater than 70 years: 800 IU (20 mcg)

Faycurry, RD, says, ‚ÄúFor vitamin D, fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and tuna are your best bets, plus egg yolks and Vitamin-D fortified foods.""

# 3. B Vitamins

During menopause, B vitamins support your body when hormonal changes increase health risks.

Research shows that the¬†[benefits of B vitamins](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6372850/)¬†(folate, B6, B12, and B2) include:

* Lowering stroke risk by up to 24%
* Protecting memory and cognitive function
* Keeping bones strong to prevent fractures

""Getting enough B vitamins is easier than you might think,"" says Faycurry, RD. ""Start with whole grain cereals or oatmeal, add spinach to salads and smoothies, include eggs at breakfast, and choose lean proteins like chicken or fish. Legumes are also B vitamin powerhouses that work great in soups and salads.""

""Getting enough B vitamins is easier than you might think,"" says Faycurry, RD.

1o6sv89,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o6sv89/aio_for_being_done_with_my_family_members/,AIO for being done with my family member‚Äôs attention-seeking behavior?,"I have a family member (I‚Äôll call them PB) who‚Äôs in their 30s, and their behavior has been exhausting everyone in our family for years now and continues to worsen. PB constantly posts online for attention, usually about their supposed mental and chronic illnesses. Most of us believe PB is not actually sick, they self-diagnose and take medications they don't need. We do believe PB struggles with some sort of mental illness(es), but it's not what they're getting treated for. PB has gone through multiple therapists and psychiatrists but seems to switch them often, likely because they don‚Äôt say what PB wants to hear.

Throughout PB's childhood, they were the less favored sibling in their family, but not neglected or forgotten. PB's dad left when they were little. PB constantly claims they're ‚Äútoo depressed‚Äù or ‚Äúphysically incapable‚Äù to take care of themselves. PB has even publicly said they expects their partner to bathe them and wash their hair when PB ‚Äúcan't"" due to their illnesses. Again, PB is not actually chronically ill.. PB has had multiple failed relationships because they seem to want a caretaker, not an equal partner. Then when the relationship fails, PB goes online and acts like they were the one holding everything together, even though what PB shares on social media tells a different story. PB is constantly making excuses as to why they can't and shouldn't be expected to put in the same 50% as everyone else (in friendships and romantic relationships) and anyone who thinks otherwise is in the wrong and doesn't support or ""truly care"" about them.

PB also posts constant ‚Äúself-harm recovery‚Äù updates like, *‚Äú2 years, 7 months, and 30 days clean,‚Äù* treating it like a sobriety milestone. It all feels so performative, like they're using it to keep sympathy and engagement coming. Lately, Pb has been claiming they're ‚Äúchronically ill,‚Äù though they've never said what illness they supposedly have. PB even claims they ‚Äúgave up their dream career‚Äù to work from home because their chronic illness is ‚Äúso bad.‚Äù But PB never been diagnosed with any chronic illness, and when they stay with family, PB seems perfectly fine while they down nearly an entire twelve pack of soda in one day. 

PB is also incredibly irresponsible with money. They're always on social media asking people to Venmo them for coffee or lunch because they ""just can't afford it right now"" or they're ""not feeling well"" while spending money on tattoos, takeout, junk food, and other things. The worst moment for me was when PB's cat died. PB admitted privately that it happened because they ignored the cat for days while they were ‚Äútoo depressed and lost in themself,‚Äù but publicly blamed it on money problems and used it for sympathy online, yet PB had the money to spend on an expensive tattoo a week after. I have cats and I couldn't imagine not cleaning their litterbox once a day or even expecting them to eat dry food. 

What‚Äôs become really frustrating for me personally is how PB talks about ‚Äútrauma.‚Äù Everyone else in our close family has been through serious trauma.. except PB. I know this because PB constantly publicly talks about their ‚Äútrauma,‚Äù but what they describe are things like embarrassing moments in public, shitty things most people go through in life or someone being short with them. I‚Äôm not trying to play ‚Äúwhose trauma is worse‚Äù or anything like that. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 20 years working through my own trauma, so I understand that trauma looks different for everyone. However, it‚Äôs hard not to feel offended when PB says other people are ‚Äúnot handling their trauma properly‚Äù or when PB constantly claims they're ‚Äúliving in fight or flight‚Äù when they've never experienced anything truly traumatic to cause their body to even be in fight or flight. As someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD and has years of my childhood that are genuinely gone in my memory from trauma, I can't help but feel offended. Again, this is not an assumption I'm making, as I've been in many deep conversations with PB (by myself and with other close family members) as we've discussed these kinds of things in depth.

Now, we have another family member (LR) who‚Äôs terminally ill and likely won‚Äôt make it through the year. PB has said some awful things about LR, like how LR ""deserves the pain because it's all karma"" and LR ""should just die already"". I couldn't imagine saying those kinds of things about another person, let alone a family member, even if I don't like them. Yet I know when LR passes, PB will be all over social media acting devastated for attention, as they've already started since LR was put on hospice.

At this point, I feel like I can‚Äôt stay quiet anymore. I love PB, but their manipulation, lying, and constant need for attention are becoming unbearable. Am I overreacting for wanting to finally call them out and set some boundaries or is it time to just protect my peace and step back? Honestly, I don't even know if I could protect my peace and just step back. This has gotten so out of hand, especially this year.. I just can't anymore and I don't think I'll be able to keep my mouth shut when PB starts their antics up at such an inappropriate and devastating time.",2,1760478444.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

The list reads like something out of a sci-fi movie, with drivers excited for innovations that blur the line between fantasy and reality.

At the top of the wishlist is self-cleaning paint, which promises to keep cars looking pristine without ever needing a wash. Close behind are self-regenerating fuel and windows with adjustable tinting for perfect light control. Features like self-cleaning seats, autonomous driving, and noise-cancelling cabins also scored highly.

Other standout desires include solar panel roofs for sustainable power, augmented reality navigation projected directly onto the road, and levitating wheels a nod to the hovercar dreams that have powered science fiction for decades.

The survey also found drivers want practical yet futuristic add-ons like seats that fold completely flat for napping, built-in coffee machines, ejector seats for unruly passengers, and LED warning signs to keep tailgaters at bay.

Interestingly, about 70% of respondents rated in-car technology as a higher priority than traditional luxury markers like color or brand status. However, a large portion admitted they don‚Äôt fully utilize the advanced features already present in their cars, highlighting a gap between tech availability and user experience.

As automotive engineers and designers push to blend innovation with usability, this survey provides clear insight into what drivers are dreaming about and what could soon roll off assembly lines. From driverless convenience to cockpit luxury and everything in between, the future of car tech looks ready to leap off the page and onto the pavement.

Here is the full list of the top 20 sci-fi tech additions drivers want in their cars, according to a recent survey:

1. Self-cleaning paint
2. Self-regenerating fuel
3. Windows with adjustable tinting
4. Self-cleaning seats
5. Autonomous driving
6. LED signs advising tailgaters to maintain distance
7. Noise-canceling cabins
8. Solar panel roofs
9. Windows that minimize ear discomfort when open
10. Augmented reality navigation projected onto the road
11. Engine noise dampeners
12. Self-opening doors
13. Sleep mode for comfortable rest
14. Seats that fold flat
15. Built-in coffee machines
16. Insulated cup holders
17. Individual climate control for passengers
18. Levitating wheels
19. Built-in sunglasses cleaners
20. Ejector seats for disruptive passengers

The survey revealed a strong appetite for futuristic features combining convenience, comfort, safety, and a little fantasy. Interestingly, most drivers rated in-car technology as more important than traditional factors like color or status, yet many admitted to not fully using the tech currently available in their vehicles

I only ever wanted to create a peaceful life for myself until she got in the way. I was 24 when I first met Elena at our local caf√©, ordering my usual iced latte and settling down to work on the latest entry in my failing online blog. I remember looking out the window, staring at the looming skyscrapers; their peaks reaching into the amber skies, calling out to something above. I felt hope for a fleeting moment before taking a sip of my ever-melting drink and wondering to myself 'When will this all change?'



I didn't even notice that she'd sat herself across from me at the cramped booth, but before I knew it we were deep into an intense conversation. She skipped the small talk, opting instead to just let herself into my world. We sat at that small coffee shop table for hours talking about the world and its wonders, our hopes and dreams, and what we wanted to do for herself. We clicked instantly. That little meeting became our daily ritual.



I'd order my usual, sit down, and then a few moments later she'd be there. This went on for a few months before we finally decided to make our relationship into something more. I'd found out she moved here for work around a year back but had still been struggling to make connections. No surprises there, it's a small town who aren't exactly welcoming to newcomers. But I bit the bullet, I officially made her my girlfriend on her 25th birthday and from there we just completely blossomed into the perfect couple. Another year after that, we were married and living together in a small farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. 



That brings us to a year ago exactly. I will never forget the night I received that phone call.



I came back from visiting some old friends as they were passing through and wanted to get some dinner. Catch up, y'know? We were out later than expected but I still managed to make my way home in good time and get back to Elena.



When I opened the front door, something was off. The lights were all on, and her perfume lingered in the air, but Elena was nowhere to be seen. I searched the whole house looking for her but she wasn't anywhere. Eventually I thought to look outside; maybe she was just getting some fresh air. I was right. I found her just as she was entering the tall grass behind our house. A bit strange, sure, but not out of character for Elena. She'd always loved that grass as it reminded her of childhood games she'd play with her family growing up. 



I called out to her, but she just turned and gestured for me to follow. Of course, I obliged and ran in after her. It felt like hours we were out there in the dark, running through dense forests and playing silly games. It felt so good to just be out and enjoying this time with her; reliving her childhood, getting muddy, chasing each other, until eventually we collapsed in each others arms. 



I'd been feeling my phone buzz the whole time we were out but I didn't bother to check up on it. I was with Elena and that's all that mattered in the moment. Eventually though, while laying with her and looking up at the stars I decided to check..



25 Missed calls

45 Unread messages



All from Elena.



I wasn't sure what I was seeing; how could she have left me all this while I've been with her the whole time. I looked at her, she smiled at me.. but something was off.



Her eyes, a pale shade of grey, and her skin seemed.. loose. 



Another phone call was coming through so I picked up;



'Mason, she isn't me.'



My blood ran cold. Who is this woman I'm with? Where is Elena? My head was swimming and I wasn't sure what to do. I watched as she blinked, each eye slightly out of sync. I noticed the laboured breathing, and the crooked smile as her skin creased around her muscle. She leant closer to me, her now raspy voice cutting through the air as she whispered 'I... love... you..'



Each drawn out word strained and broke, I couldn't believe what was happening. I got up to run away but I felt her closing in on me. I wasn't far from home but in the midnight black, I had no hope of navigating it with speed. I could hear her footsteps gaining on me, her voice calling out to me, clawing at me like daggers. I had to get away.



Hearing her stumble gave me all the strength I needed to carry on. I managed to find my way back home and crashed through the back door, almost falling over every piece of furniture before I realised something;

The smell.



That god awful smell.



The scent of copper filled my lungs, both nauseating and sobering to the whole situation. I found my way into the bathroom, the source of the smell. As I neared in on the door it took everything I had not to heave. I couldn't bare to look inside, but I knew I had to.



The door creaked open, slowly revealing to me my worst nightmare. Elena was in the bathtub, barely alive. Her skin.. it was gone. She looked up at me, somehow clinging onto the little life she had left. I broke, and all I heard was primal screams, just pouring out of me. I was supposed to be here with her, I was supposed to protect her.



I moved closer, unsure of what to do or say. I wanted to hold my wife, comfort her and tell her everything was okay. I wanted to kiss her, to feel her on me one last time but I knew I couldn't. It destroyed me seeing her like this and I prayed it was all a nightmare, that I'd wake up tomorrow with all of this just being some dark, twisted figment of my imagination.



Then the thought hit me, how had my wife been put here? She wasn't here earlier.. I would've found her, and been with her. The other version of her.. that horrible disfigured creature must have somehow made it back before me and moved Elena here, tormenting me and showing me her handiwork.



Then I heard her, crawling up the stairs, calling my Elena.



I looked into my wife's eyes.. and watched as the life faded out of them. I snapped. I screamed and cried, begging her to come back but I knew it was no use. So I ran, and I ran, and I didn't stop running. I managed to slip past that.. thing.. and I ran to my car. It broke my heart leaving my wife like that, but I had to go. I had to leave the one thing I'd ever loved behind.



I managed to drive for a few hours before settling down in a hotel, and from there I was just hopping from one city to another, hoping that whatever I saw in the tall grass was far behind.



But that brings me to today. One year from when it happened. I never wanted to put this down in words, hoping it will somehow erase itself from my memory, but now I know that will never happen. For the last hour now there's been a tapping at my room door. A gentle, feeble tapping. But I know it's real. I hear her calling me from the other side. 'Honey.. It's me. Let me in.'

1o6smdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObjectivePersonality/comments/1o6smdo/de_isnt_really_listening_to_the_tribe_its_just/,"De isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúlistening to the tribe‚Äù, it‚Äôs just enforcing EQUALITY/SAMENESS no matter what. Di isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúbeing authentic/yourself‚Äù, it‚Äôs just artificially trying to make itself DIFFERENT no matter what.","Your De isn‚Äôt trying to get you to listen to the tribe‚Äôs values or opinions, it just wants you to do what *it* wants to do (‚Äúmake everyone the same‚Äù) and convince you that that‚Äôs the tribe talking. Your Di isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúyour true self‚Äù, it just wants you to do what *it* wants you to do (‚Äúmake people different from each other‚Äù) and convince you that that‚Äôs ‚Äúyour true self‚Äù talking.

I‚Äôm sure this is well-understood by those who have been in OPS longer than me, I‚Äôm just kinda putting it together myself right about now.

What got me thinking about this was thinking about the things that De does that I just didn‚Äôt understand, namely doing ‚ÄúDe things‚Äù even if the tribe *doesn‚Äôt* want you to. Like, as a Di savior, I understand being selfish, and I understand the De idea of going along with tribe pressure/what others want/need. But I constantly see De saviors actually *defying* the tribe all the time in the name of their De and ‚Äúnot reading the room‚Äù, maybe even more so than Di does.

For example:

An Fe-savior I know who will always start nudging you, asking you questions, being playful etc. if he notices you‚Äôre in a bad mood; regardless of how many clear signals you send that ‚ÄúI *don‚Äôt* want/like that, please leave me alone‚Äù, he‚Äôll just do it more. *You‚Äôre Fe, aren‚Äôt you supposed to be ‚Äúreading the room‚Äù and ‚Äúgoing with what others want‚Äù more than anyone else?*

A Te-savior I know who will organize other people‚Äôs stuff for them without being asked. Like if she‚Äôs over at your house, she‚Äôll start kinda rearranging things that look messy lol, and will keep giving you ‚Äútips‚Äù whether or not you show any inclination that you want that or that it‚Äôs useful to you.

That same person has a bit of a ‚Äúgossip‚Äù habit, not quite gossip but she‚Äôll often like randomly blurt out stuff that happened or secrets, *especially* ones that are kind of negative or that she *herself* is embarrassed about, and then cover her mouth after like ‚Äúomg that‚Äôs so terrible I wish I didn‚Äôt have to say that‚Äù lol. *No one else knew about that so there was no pressure for you to bring it up, you didn‚Äôt want them to know and they also didn‚Äôt want to know, why the hell are you randomly saying it then?*

(Note also that these aren‚Äôt particularly extreme or dysfunctional examples, these are both very good, normal, intelligent, well-adjusted people that I like very much.)

The takeaway that I got from noticing that is that De isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúgoing along with others‚Äù, it‚Äôs just telling you to do more De to them no matter what, whether they like it or not. Like my Fe friend, his brain is always just telling him ‚Äúdo more Fe, do more Fe, they want more Fe, they want more Fe‚Äù. If you tell him you want a hug, his brain will say ‚Äúhug hug go hug them more Fe more Fe‚Äù. And if you tell him you *don‚Äôt* want a hug his brain will say ‚Äúdid they say ‚ÄòI want a hug?‚Äô hug hug go hug them more Fe more Fe they want more Fe‚Äù. And the same thing with Te, it‚Äôs ‚Äúthey want more Te they want more Te, give them more tips, go help them‚Äù ‚Äúum actually I don‚Äôt want your help, I want to do it myself‚Äù ‚Äúlook they want your help go Te them‚Äù.

Or the Fe ‚Äúsprouts guy‚Äù from one of their YouTube videos, his Fe doesn‚Äôt actually care if anyone wants it, and no one in the tribe is making him do it, his Fe is just trying to make him do more Fe, i.e. make people share stuff make people ‚Äúconnect‚Äù more more more.

So it seems to me that the De is less a real ‚Äútribe monitor‚Äù that is tracking what other people really want or what is useful to them, because it always gives ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù: if you say yes it hears yes, if you say no it hears yes. It‚Äôs more just kind of a virus in your brain that‚Äôs trying to hypnotize you into constantly seeing other people saying ‚Äúyes De me more yes De me more‚Äù no matter what.

And then of course I had to try to turn it around on the Di if I could. It was definitely harder than seeing the ‚Äúflaw‚Äù in the De, but I finally kind of saw it for real; Di is constantly trying to separate itself from others, essentially. It‚Äôs a virus in your brain always furiously creating fake walls and distinctions between yourself and others to keep you from being part of the tribe.

Like my example for myself is how I constantly feel a compulsion to have my opinions be different from others‚Äô. I remember when I was in high school, if the teacher in English class asked a question and one student gave an answer/opinion that happened to be one I agreed with, and then the next student said ‚Äúyeah I agree with that‚Äù, it would kind of annoy me, and then I‚Äôd find myself subconsciously convincing myself of the *opposite* opinion and raising my hand and saying that instead to disagree. Even though *I actually did agree with them* lol.

And I definitely see that in Fi saviors a lot too. I notice it even in how Dave and Shan would talk about it for example, how when they would mention how ‚Äúwe hate our neighbor even though everyone else likes them‚Äù or watching an Fi person make an ‚Äúinappropriate joke‚Äù that ‚Äúeveryone else is offended by‚Äù, they seemed to almost gleefully take delight in it, like they‚Äôre going out of their way to show how what they like isn‚Äôt what others like and vice versa, and more than anything else they seem to be subconsciously trying to convince *themself* that their Fi is so different and offensive to others been when it actually isn‚Äôt. Which I realized is kind of the behavior that most annoyed me in Fi, that ‚Äúperformative differentness‚Äù that‚Äôs less actually being authentic to what you happen to be than just artificially being whatever you subconsciously think will most offend other people to get that chemical rush of ‚Äúhahaha look how different I am‚Äù. If a Fi-savior finds out that they enjoy pumpkin spice lattes like all the other normies, their Fi will hypnotize them into thinking they don‚Äôt like it and that they actually like black coffee instead.

So the epiphany from that is that neither De nor Di are really about the actual tribe or your actual self, their #1 purpose is to *trick YOU* into thinking ‚Äúthe tribe wants you to De them more, trust me they do‚Äù or ‚Äúyour authentic self is actually really different from others, shut up don‚Äôt listen to that fake feeling you don‚Äôt actually like pumpkin spice lattes, you like black coffee.‚Äù

I realized that‚Äôs why I would always get really triggered and annoyed when I‚Äôd be arguing with an Fi person about something, and they‚Äôd start to get that smug-Fi thing of ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt get it‚Äù/‚Äúwe‚Äôre so different‚Äù (idk really how to describe it exactly), seemingly almost reveling in their own irrationality and purposely trying to make me not get it and then going ‚Äúsee you don‚Äôt get it, that shows I‚Äôm right‚Äù, because I just wanted to scream ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS NOT REALLY YOU SAYING THAT idiot, that‚Äôs a stupid FI VIRUS WORM leeching off your brain and CONVINCING YOU THAT IT IS YOU!‚Äù

How I got to the ‚ÄúDe is about making everyone the same‚Äù conclusion took a little longer but it came from the gossip thing. Because that‚Äôs the one that I most, for the life of me, couldn‚Äôt understand; what is it that is seemingly compels a De person blurt out something that 1) they don‚Äôt want others to know, 2) those others don‚Äôt want to know, and 3) actually makes them or their family member look worse in front of others?! Where is that coming from?

Taken with everything else I‚Äôve picked up on, it seems like De just has to make everyone ‚Äúequal‚Äù, even in terms of information. The De seems to get uncomfortable when someone has a lot of secrets, they‚Äôre compelled to spread it around so everyone has the same information. Di is constantly trying to build a bigger stack of blocks, stealing others‚Äô blocks to make their own even more distinctly taller than the others, while De is constantly trying to knock down those Di towers and spreading the blocks around so everyone has the same towers.

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a more vivid way to describe it but it feels like De is kind of just about ‚Äúmushing everyone together‚Äù lol. Trying to sweep away the differences between people and smoosh us all together into one big jelly. While Di is constantly obsessively trying to make fences between everyone, cutting itself out of the jelly and fabricating ‚Äúdistinctness‚Äù and ‚Äúidentity‚Äù to make everyone separate.

Your Di isn‚Äôt you, and De isn‚Äôt the tribe. If anyone, Di is the function that suppresses and destroys your ‚Äútrue authentic self‚Äù more than any other function. And not in the sense of how IxxPs will put on the mask in public because of tribe fears. In the sense that the ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù opinions and values your Di keeps making up for you are more often than not actually fake self-consciously constructed identities and it uses that magic Di juice to hypnotize you into thinking that it‚Äôs you, and defend them when they‚Äôre attacked, like as if the white blood cells in your body were hacked into thinking the tumor was the body itself and fighting back against anything that attacked the tumor. I‚Äôve got to realize that fat king in my castle isn‚Äôt actually me, those people attacking the king aren‚Äôt actually my enemies, the king is my actual enemy but he‚Äôs fooled me into seeing him as my leader and protector and defending him against my own self-interest and the actual me.

Omg. Done?!?! Yep. Done (unlocked the 3rd Semester but this still felt like THE climax I‚Äôve been working to)

I‚Äôll confess one reason it was so tight was I hadn‚Äôt put together nearly enough SP coffee/ curry and restocked at the clinic cause I vaguely thought there would be a gap between mementos and the shrine.

1o6skjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1o6skjz/the_bench_at_the_center_of_the_world/,The Bench at the Center of the World,"The best bench on the 14th Street platform is the one right in the middle. It‚Äôs not the most comfortable, but it‚Äôs the only one where you can feel the wind from both directions, a preview of the uptown and downtown 6 trains before they even arrive. I got here a little later than usual today. The guy at the bodega was fighting with his second toaster, so the line for the one working one was snaking past the cold drinks. I almost gave up on my cinnamon raisin bagel, but I‚Äôd already paid, so I waited. By the time it was toasted, slathered with peanut butter and jelly, and wrapped in that thin paper, the 8:05 express was long gone. It‚Äôs fine. The early trains are always too crowded anyway.

I settled onto my bench. First things first: Wordle. I got it in four today. The first guess is always a prayer, the second a process of elimination. By the third, you‚Äôre either hopeful or resigned. Today, I was hopeful. A good omen, maybe.

The platform filled around me. A river of suits and backpacks. A kid in a dinosaur backpack stared at me until his mother pulled him along. I opened my chess app. I‚Äôm working my way through a bot named ‚ÄúNelson,‚Äù set to a difficulty that lets me feel clever about half the time. I made a move, captured a pawn, and then looked up.

A flock of fashion students descended, all black clothes and dramatic silhouettes, talking loudly about some designer I‚Äôd never heard of. They were a living exhibit. On the opposite bench, a man with kind eyes and a worn-out satchel was grading papers, his red pen moving in quick, decisive slashes. I wondered what story he was failing. A tourist asked me for directions to the High Line, and I pointed them toward the stairs, my voice sounding raspy from disuse.

By midday, the rhythm changed. The frantic energy of being late was replaced by the purpose of lunch breaks and errands. I switched to a sudoku book, the kind with the cheap paper that smudges. The numbers were a quiet comfort. The fruit vendor, an older woman with a permanent, tired smile, nodded at me. I bought a cup of mango and some fruits. It‚Äôs cheaper than the delis and keeps the hunger at bay. Down on the tracks, a large, glossy rat emerged from a shadow and dragged a forgotten piece of a breakfast sandwich back into the darkness. A small, brutal victory.

In the afternoon, I started my book. Before the Coffee Gets Cold. A novel about a caf√© where you can time travel, but you have to finish your coffee before it gets cold or you‚Äôre stuck. It‚Äôs a book about regrets and second chances. I read a chapter, then watched the people living out their own versions. A woman clutching a single yellow flower, her eyes scanning every opening door. A first date. Her hope was a physical thing, bright and fragile.

As evening set in, the station lights flickered on, casting a harsh, honest glow. The crowd softened. People were going home now. Ties were loosened, comfortable shoes replaced heels. The woman with the flower was gone. I hoped it went well for her.

I closed my book. The last of the long-distance trains were due. This is when I pay the most attention. My phone was dead, my sudoku book filled, the story finished. There was nothing left to do but wait. Really wait.

I watched the downtown local pull in. The doors hissed open. A few people got off. A man with a guitar case. A group of friends laughing. A woman struggling with two large grocery bags.

No one else.

The doors closed with a final, rubbery thud. The train pulled away, its red lights disappearing into the tunnel‚Äôs mouth. The station felt vast and suddenly very quiet. The attendant who mops the floors gave me a small, familiar nod as he started his rounds. He‚Äôs seen me here enough to know the routine.

I stood up, my knees protesting. It‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs always tomorrow. The trains will run again. The promise was someday, and someday is a date that never appears on a schedule, which means it could be any day. It could be tomorrow.

I turned my collar up against the chill and walked out toward the stairs. The city above was settling into its night sounds. Somewhere out there, his train is still coming. I‚Äôm sure of it. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be back on that bench. Tomorrow, the doors will open, and he‚Äôll be there, smiling that same smile, and he‚Äôll say he‚Äôs finally home.",1,1760477745.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Alex's life with John‚Äîthe probably-immortal roommate who treated centuries-old artifacts like thrift-store finds‚Äîwas already a circus of suspicion, denial, and lasagna-fueled complacency.

Merlin's visit had left Alex's 1% of doubt on life support. But when John waltzed in wearing an actual Victorian crown and called it a ""cheap Renaissance fair prop,"" Alex's brain short-circuited.

This wasn't just weird. It was a new tier of insane.

# The Crown Incident

It was a muggy Thursday evening. Alex was nursing a beer, still recovering from the mental image of Merlin and John reenacting a medieval love ballad in the next room.

He was scrolling through Sarah's latest texts‚Äîgrainy photos of cuneiform tablets and a rant about John's ""props""‚Äîwhen the front door swung open. In strolled John, looking like his usual flannel-clad self, except for one detail: perched on his head was a gleaming, silver-and-gem-encrusted crown.

Rubies the size of Alex's thumb winked in the light.

Alex choked on his beer, spraying it across the coffee table. ""Dude,"" he sputtered, pointing at John's head. ""What the hell is that?""

John, kicking off his sneakers, glanced up as if he'd forgotten he was wearing a royal heirloom. ""Oh, this?"" he said, tapping the crown. ""Just a cheap thing from a Renaissance fair. Thought it'd be funny for game night.""

*Game night?* Alex's brain did a backflip. This wasn't a prop you'd find next to a foam sword. This was the kind of crown that got its own security detail.

""Cheap?"" Alex croaked. ""That looks like it belongs in a museum!""

John just shrugged, plopping onto the couch and grabbing a bag of chips. ""Nah, it's just shiny metal. Probably tin. Want some Doritos?""

Alex stared, mouth agape, as John adjusted the crown like it was a baseball cap and started scrolling through Netflix.

# The Historical Blasphemy

Alex couldn't let this slide. He texted Sarah: ""JOHN'S WEARING A CROWN. LIKE A LEGIT SILVERY CROWN. HELP.""

Sarah, who was probably halfway through a thesis on ancient Sumerian trade routes, replied with a single emoji: üò≤. Then: ""Send pics. NOW.""

Alex snapped a blurry photo while John was engrossed in *The Witcher*. The crown gleamed even in the grainy image.

Sarah's response was a voice memo of her screaming, ""ALEX, THAT'S A ROMANOV CROWN OR A DAMN GOOD COPY. GET IT OFF HIS HEAD AND CALL THE HERMITAGE MUSEUM.""

Alex googled it and nearly dropped his phone. John's ""cheap prop"" was a dead ringer for a crown that vanished during the Russian Revolution.

Emboldened by Sarah's panic, Alex confronted John during a commercial break. ""Okay, level with me. That's not from a Renaissance fair. It's got actual jewels. Where'd you get it?""

John didn't even look up from his chips. ""Told you, estate sale. Some old lady was selling costume jewelry. Thought it'd be fun to wear ironically.""

*Ironically?* Alex wanted to scream. Nobody wears a crown that could buy a yacht ironically.

But John just crunched a Dorito and asked, ""You want *Lord of the Rings* or *Stranger Things* next?""

# The Casual Crown Chaos

The crown wasn't a one-night stunt. John started wearing it all the time. He'd cook pancakes with it tilted rakishly on his head. He'd wear it to take out the trash, waving at neighbors who did double-takes.

The real insanity came when Merlin popped by again. She saw the crown, smirked, and said, ""Still wearing the Tsarina's old hat, huh?""

*The Tsarina?* Alex's heart skipped a beat. John just laughed and said, ""Yeah, it's got good vibes.""

Merlin rolled her eyes, kissed his forehead right under the crown, and started helping with dinner.

Alex, clutching his phone with Sarah's increasingly unhinged texts (""STEAL THE CROWN. I NEED TO CARBON-DATE IT""), felt like he was living in a historical drama with no script.

Then came the kicker. During a chaotic game night, John‚Äîstill wearing the crown‚Äîaccidentally knocked a beer bottle off the table. It shattered, and a shard sliced his hand.

Alex braced for the usual: no blood, instant healing. But this time, John overdid the act, clutching his hand and yelping, ""Oh no, my mortal flesh!"" with all the sincerity of a community theater reject. Merlin snorted so hard she nearly choked on her wine.

The cut was already gone. John, realizing he'd oversold it, muttered, ""Just kidding,"" and adjusted the crown like nothing happened. Alex wanted to scream into a pillow.

# The Snooping Escalation

Alex couldn't take it anymore. While John and Merlin were out, he called Sarah for backup.

She showed up with a magnifying glass and a notebook labeled ""Operation Immortal Roommate.""

They crept into John's room. The crown sat on his dresser, waiting for a coronation.

Sarah examined it, muttering about ""Faberg√©-era goldsmith techniques"" and ""diamond cuts consistent with 19th-century Russian mines."" She found a tiny inscription: ""A.L. 1885.""

""This is the real deal,"" Sarah whispered, eyes wide. ""Your roommate's either a time traveler or he mugged the Romanovs.""

They dug through John's closet, finding more ""props"": a scepter, a faded letter addressed to ""Sir John"" from someone named Disraeli, and a photo of John and Merlin at the Romanov Tercentenary celebrations in 1913, both looking exactly the same.

Alex's 1% of doubt was officially dead.

# The Non-Confrontation

When John and Merlin returned, catching Alex and Sarah red-handed with the crown, John didn't even blink.

""You guys throwing a costume party?"" he asked, tossing his keys onto the counter.

Sarah, braver than Alex, held up the crown. ""This is a Romanov crown. Like, actually imperial Russian. Explain.""

John grinned, that infuriatingly calm grin. ""Told you, Ren fair. They make good fakes.""

Merlin, smirking behind him, added, ""He's got a thing for shiny hats. Let it go.""

She handed Alex a plate of fresh-baked cookies, and his resolve crumbled like the shortbread. Sarah left, vowing to call her professor, but Alex stayed. The rent was cheap, the cookies were divine, and John promised to make tacos tomorrow.

Alex was 100% sure John and Merlin were immortal. But he wasn't ready to blow up his life over a crown. Not yet.",1,1760477430.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

I've hit analysis paralysis and need a final push. Current sale prices have put three machines in a dead heat for me: Lelit Mara X (~$1700) Profitec Pro 400 (~$1600) Bezzera Magica PID (~$1650)

I've done my homework, and I understand the core philosophy of each machine: Mara X: The ""smart"" E61 with its Brew Priority PID for incredible temperature stability (no cooling flush) and a very compact footprint.

Pro 400: The ""hobbyist's"" E61 with its unique 3-position brew pressure switch for hands-on control.

Magica: The ""classic workhorse"" E61 with a massive 2.0L copper boiler for sheer steam power, currently at a great price.

My Use Case: I'm a hobbyist who enjoys the process. I almost exclusively make milk drinks (usually 2 at a time), but the quality of the espresso itself is very important to me. My top priority is long-term reliability. (Note: I'll be using a smart plug, so heat-up time is irrelevant to me).

I'm essentially choosing between the Mara X's smart temp control, the Pro 400's unique pressure control, and the Magica's raw power. (As far as I know‚Ä¶am I missing anything?)

Is there anything I'm missing that might sway my opinion? I'm looking for the small details: Any known long-term reliability issues or common quirks with these specific models?

Ease of maintenance or parts availability in the US?

Daily workflow differences you love/hate (steam knob feel, drip tray size, water tank access, etc.)?

I‚Äôd be buying through whole latte love, williams Sonoma or Seattle coffee gear if this changes anything as well.

Which would you choose today and why?

* Friendly and helpful host
* Small breakfast included (toast, jam, peanut butter, cereal and tea/coffee if I remember correctly), do forget to clean your own dishes
* Laundry machines (for a small fee), and there were drying racks open for anyone to use (I wouldn't recommend leaving very valuable pieces on them)
* Vanity area with large mirrors, great spot to do hair or makeup before going out
* Showers and toilets were okay; they do provide shampoo and body wash, but if you're particular about shower products, buy your own
   * ALSO WEAR FLIP FLOPS

1. Seoul Cube Itaewon
   1. Beds were decent, there was a slight smell of humidity, but that's to be expected with summer in Seoul
   2. Awesome washroom, like honestly, I showered so many times because it was just so relaxing (specifically the larger shower room with the toilet and sink inside)
   3. Breakfast included; there was quite a variety, in my opinion. I can't remember everything they had, but I remember every morning I would eat two toast with butter, ham and cheese and drank tea as well. I think they had cereal as well
   4. Friendly host, and I found so many nice guests to interact with at night in the lobby
   5. Good security, you need a code to get into the building and the rooms (different codes)
   6. Provided lockers outside of the room (not large enough for a suitcase or carry-on, I had mine beside my mattress in my bunk)

Won't go into depth for the rest, but if you have any questions about the following, just comment below, and I will answer to the best of my ability.

**More recommendations**

BI = Breakfast Included

**Seoul**

* Sleep Box (MY FAV HOST, HIM AND HIS WIFE ARE THE SWEETEST) \[ BI \]
   * Myeongdong

**Busan**

* Canvas Hostel \[ BI \]
   * Haeundae

   * Haeundae

\*Keep in mind that these are NOT luxury accommodations. If you want luxury, then go pay for luxury. Also, if you don't like sharing a sleeping area or bathroom, then do go to one of these and then complain. You're not always guaranteed a good roommate; remember that. If you have genuine concerns about another guest, report it.

P.S. I didn't read this over; there might be grammar and spelling mistakes.

If you guys have any other recommendations, I would love to hear them!! Can't wait to visit again :)",1,1760477197.0,SouthKoreaTravel,0,1.0,False

1o6sb1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6sb1o,I'm on a 3 game win streak and I don't want to throw this.,"I'm getting nervous and so I'm not thinking straight. I'm on a 3 game a20 heart Silent win streak and lucked into this run. I felt like I had really strong burst damage by the end of act 1 (Boot was seriously putting in work lol) and so I risked the Black Star and was able to absolutely crush the act 2 elites. But my damage is garbage in the boss fights. There's no way I beat Time Eater or the Heart without getting more damage.

I was offered these 3 relics. All are good. Sacred Bark is my favorite boss relic in the game when I have Alchemize (and I do!)... but I'm thinking it is number 3 here. I'm so torn between Wrist Blade and Coffee Dripper. Nunchaku is providing a bit of extra energy but not enough. Coffee Dripper has no real weakness here since I have Toy Ornithopter + Alchemize so I'm not worried about making it to the act 3 bosses at close to full health.

So which one should I do? Coffee Dripper for the energy? Or +3/+4 damage (from 5 to 8 from Blade Dance/Cloak & Dagger or 6 to 10 from Storm of Steel after Apo) to this mostly Shiv deck with Wrist Blade?

Note: I'm leaning a bit more toward Coffee Dripper so I can Wraith Form more reliably after I draw into it via Ink Bottle. But I've seen how slow my damage is during those boss fights and it is really, really incentivizing me to go Wrist Blade.",3,1760477132.0,slaythespire,8,0.8,False

If you‚Äôre a coffee lover in the area, we‚Äôd love to know which spots you think belong on this list and what drinks you recommend.

**Milyar Cafe**

A newer spot that specializes in Yemeni and Arabian coffee and chai. They serve both classic and specialty drinks, such as Pistachio Lattes and matcha.

The cozy vibe and late hours (open until midnight) make it a great place to hang out or study.

**1 oz Coffee**

A go-to for creative seasonal specials. This fall, they‚Äôre offering a Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Chai, Apple Crumble Latte, and the Rainier Rainfall Flat White, which is their twist on an Earl Grey coffee. It‚Äôs the perfect spot if you want something unique and comforting.

We‚Äôll have a rental car and are staying near the International Marketplace in Waikiki. Mainly looking to make sure it‚Äôs not too rushed and to get food and easy hike recommendations and figure out what I‚Äôm missing!

Day 1 (Friday): Arrive at HNL, pick up car, get to Airbnb by around 4 PM. Grab essentials/snacks. Watch fireworks and find somewhere in Waikiki for dinner (something quick or maybe like Steak Shack or a truck?).

Day 2 (Saturday): Aloha Stadium Swap Meet early, Bishop Museum until early afternoon. Shopping at Ala Moana and International Marketplace, maybe beach time. Dinner somewhere nearby.

Day 3 (Sunday): Diamond Head early (have reservations), breakfast/brunch after (please drop recs), snorkeling excursion in early afternoon, beach time after.

Day 4 (Monday): Kualoa Ranch early (tickets purchased). Visit Byodo-In Temple and Ho‚Äòomaluhia Botanical Garden on the way back. Thinking of taking the coast route back to Waikiki‚Äîany good lookout points or easy hikes to stop at?

Day 5 (Tuesday): North Shore day. Stop at Green World Coffee Farm, surfing lesson at noon, lunch (thinking Surf N Salsa‚Äîother ideas?), quick stop at Dole (my boyfriend‚Äôs request), explore North Shore beaches and relax.

Day 6 (Wednesday): Pearl Harbor in the morning. Nothing planned for the rest of the day‚Äîmight swap this with Thursday for a rest day.

Day 7 (Thursday): Lanikai Pillbox hike early, beach after (Lanikai or Kailua). Maybe kayaking if we decide it‚Äôs worth it.

Day 8 (Friday/Saturday): No plans yet. Leaving Saturday late afternoon so we‚Äôll still have time to do something light that morning. Hopefully can get some suggestions to pencil something in! 

A couple things I want to find time for: any waterfall hikes, a night market, stopping in any fun little towns, beach hopping (maybe?)

Also not included is the daily morning coffee/matcha stops but I‚Äôll find a way to fit those in!

Questions:
- Anything we‚Äôre missing or should move around?
- Favorite easy/medium hikes near Waikiki or along the east coast?
- Favorite food recs near these areas? (I have a ton of places saved)

1o6s92l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6s92l,"Description of emails below ‚¨áÔ∏è‚Äî Gypsy & Rod‚Äî Gypsy talks about new apartment, money, reflecting on her time in prison + Gypsy attacking people on Facebook thinking someone leaked her release date, so she felt ‚Äúin danger‚Äù and Rod putting her in her place.","**PLEASE READ** These emails are very scattered. It‚Äôs kind of impossible for me to give you a specific timeline. These are all generally in 2022/2023. These emails are between Rod and Gypsy. Rod is Gypsy‚Äôs father who was absent a majority of her life. His nickname for Gypsy is ‚ÄúBoo‚Äù. Gypsy is married to Ryan during this time frame. I‚Äôm trying to find the InTouch article that‚Äôs talked about in this. Which would be around October 2023. Whenever it is found, it will be linked in the comment below. That hopefully can give us more insight of who‚Äôs who in this.  I also don‚Äôt get how she was able to use Facebook while in prison lol unless she was getting Ryan or Kristy to post for her? I‚Äôm not sure. 
 


1.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúHey Dad
How are you doing? I am alright, getting over a head cold, I can't wait for when I can just go to the store and buy some over the counter cough/cold medicine. Ryan is starting to move some of his furniture from storage and start packing things up for the move. I'm very proud of him for keeping his word on everything he promised me. I love our apartment! I especially love the garden tub :-) I've already started thinking of how we will decorate each room.‚Äù 


2.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúHey Dad, I am trying to compile an idea of family history for when I do see a primary physician when I'm home. is there any medical history on your side I need to know about?‚Äù 


3.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúThank you.
Sometimes I question myself if I am good enough or worthy of a good life beyond prison and I think back to when I was looking at you and mom from behind glass in that first court appearance in Springfield, and I am going to prison and I was crying knowing my choices led me here. I knew then that I was accountable for my choices. My hope for the future is when making big life changing choices and simple ones as well, I always ask myself is this going to help me or hurt me or others?. Now being 5 months away from freedom I'm feeling the gravity of that responsibility. I am taking one day at a time and the last 8 years does actually weigh heavy on my mind body and soul.
I feel myself feel like a grown woman rather then a girl who happens to be older then her appearance. You should hear me talk to the newbies in here, I might as well throw out the word whipper snapper lol nah I'm just trying to be a good influence on these young'ns coming in. of course they always want my autograph lol‚Äù 


4.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúHi Dad,
How are things? I turned in my address for my home plan to the institutional parole officer yesterday and it will be submitted to Louisiana on the 30th for approval. The IPO is calling Ryan today at 4 to discuss things. I found out that I can not have contact with the Pitres unless I have permission from my P.O. After I am off parole it won't matter. Ryan and I are waiting for the network to make a good enough deal for his contract. They wanted to offer him $2,500 per episode which is laughable in comparison to mine. His lawyer is going to reach for $10,000 per episode. My book proposal has been submitted to publishers for review and hope to hear offers soon. Ryan started work up again and they changed up a few things like classroom location and there will be 9 new kids. three 4th graders, three 7th graders and three 8th graders. They gave him a round of applause because his class had the best grades last year. :-)‚Äù


5.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúWe had a good anniversary today. Ryan surprised me with a ring that is a family heirloom. It is a gold ring that looks like a ribbon and a diamond in the center. It is pretty but it means more knowing his mother aave it to him for his future wife and he finally revealed it to me. :-) ‚Äú. Rod says to Gypsy, ‚Äúvery Nice Awe. Thats good to here. I'm sure it's a special ring well deserving and you'll where it with honor. You have a 3rd cousin in there now from Arkansas. My moms sister's granddaughter. Her name is ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî. Apparently she violated her probation and got sent to the big house. I got to come home for a few days to help move apartments. Probably going back on boat tomorrow though. All is well. Can't wait till December !!!! I love you. Be on your best behavior !!‚Äù 


6.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúHey Dad Would you mind venmo Ryan $500 from my money because we need to get our living room ready for filming and we need a coffee table Wayfair.com has one for $127.99 and I want these personalized flur des les pillows for our couch since our living room is all flur des les. We may need 2 or 3 pillows. Thank you.‚Äù 


7.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúHey Dad, Can you add some $ my account please? That guy isn't sending me money anymore and Ryan doesnt get his paycheck until next Friday. Hope your hunting trip is good. 


8.  Rod says to Gypsy, ‚Äúall good baby. It's all good Gypsy. I know mom has been too forthcoming in the past and you have every right to discuss your feelings with us privately. Publicly is a different story when it comes to family. We stick together always. I don't blame you for not wanting to be friends with ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî we are not friends, she has never been to our home and don't expect much more association with her in the future. I read the text between her and mom and it was short. She told mom she was reaching out to in touch and wasnt going to talk bad about anyone and said should would say she was a friend of the family. Mom said do what you gotta do and make sure she told  ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî was not an expert or a friend of the family. That was it. Anyways. Ryan handled the situation well last night and I respect him for that. Him and I both in the middle defending our ladies. I'm proud he stuck up for you. Thank you for deleting the post. I just wanted step mom out of it. Give it a few days. Kristy cried this morning about all this, I felt her pain and know how much she has done for you. She is gonna get away for the weekend and visit Ryan. Dont feel bad or anything, we'll be ok and get passed it. I love you too.‚Äù Rod also says, ‚Äúthats good Thats good to hear. You're right, I think we all could have worded things differently in the moment. I'm sorry I wasn't more svmpathetic to your safety concerns. I'll do better. I love you too. Dad.‚Äù 


9.  Rod says to Gypsy, ‚ÄúI'm here. Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I know I'm not your go to person to hash out things with but I love you and will always love you. I won't judge your decisions and can only give you my opinions. It sounds like you've got alot on your plate and you might feel overwhelmed. I'm here Gypsy. You can call me anytime you need too! I don't care if it‚Äôs to chew me out, cry, tell me how you feel, bitch about Kristy, brainstorm, hash whatever out you need too. One relationship and your happiness is all I care about. Last thing, since I've discovered that you and ‚ÄîRyan maybe Kristy?‚Äî FB is not private, I don't feel comfortable communicating with you through it. I hope you understand that our privacy is important to us as well. I was not thrilled to learn about that, but I get it, you want to be able to post what you want and you can't because its a shared account of yours and ‚ÄîRyan or Kristy‚Äî  I just don't like not knowing who We are really sending personal stuff too. So call or securus email or through people we know and trust ‚Äînames 3 people‚Äî."" Lastly, I need to say Ryan defended the crap out of you when I called him, sooo. I am with him on not wanting to start a bashmouth contest on FB. I never once stepped that low through all this... ever see. Kristy tried and it lead to her misery, some people are not work arguing with cuz you can win by arguing with ignorant people. If its your public fb page, then you have control of whats on it. Simply delete the comment, block them and move on. It's really embarrassing to see people argue publicly on FB. Anyways ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî has a mouthful for ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî and we've agreed that she is no longer be a family friend. But that will be told to her privately. If a reporter ask, then we will tell them the truth about her. I love you. Quit spazz out. Geez girl you stessn me out now. Lol.
Call me, everything will be ok. Can't wait to see you again. Love dad‚Äù Gypsy says to Rod, ‚Äú We are all passed it. I sent mom a message telling her I'm not upset anymore and we are all good. I told her I was sorry for the post and I told her if anyone wants to do a article in the future and they make her aware before hand to talk to ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî
and ask ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî if it is OK. I feel that would be better. Yeah I know I can be impulsive with a lot. I fussed Ryan and we had a argument over how he handled it all and for me I was disappointed because I feel he stays so quiet about so much and just let's me handle it and idk maybe I wanted him to be more vocal about his position in supporting me but he did support me behind the scenes ya know. Maybe I'm too hard on him. I also felt hurt by your initial email because I wasn't giving you bs with being worried for my safety. My private post on Facebook with my friends is one thing for a NFL game with security, and a public announcement of the location and day I step on public property for the first time is another. you don't know the crazy people I have had take a interest in me over the years some are very creepy and unstable individuals, and yeah I'm gonna have to get used to it but yes it does concern me that anyone can wait for us outside of prison grounds. I get how you was concerned for your wifes emotions in the moment but you really had none for your daughter, who is very fragile right now. Even Ryan is getting some of my attitude these days. Had to voice my hurt in this thats all. I'm glad we are all good though. Anyways I love you‚Äù


10.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúRyan let me know y'all talked. I asked him to remove the post. But please understand this is not the first time shit gets leaked because of Kristy‚Äôs ""friendships""...  I told her please don't talk to ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî about personal stuff I don't trust her. Yes, It was the prison who confirmed my release date, but we have known my release date for 2 years and only since Kristy told them where to look has it been all over online. Why I am upset with mom is because me and Ryan try and be so cautious about what information we give out and mom will open up to a sob story that any of these women give to her. I get you are upset that I posted about it but I was upset and i felt how do I show validity in my feelings if not for other people staying they see it too, but I took it down now. Point made, regardless it is done. whatever was said or not said to ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî cat is out of the bag and now I gotta deal with this shit. I love you.‚Äù Gypsy also says, ‚Äú Just got your second email from yesterday. I so appreciate you telling me all that because I did feel like my feelings were put on the back burner so I do appreciate you letting me know I am important too. My FB passwords have been changed as of last night so ONLY Ryan has it and no one else. A friend had my password but now it‚Äôs changed. My FB is not for the public it is only for me and my close friends and family so don't worry about my privacy we got it under control. My Instagram is another story because that is 100% for the public.‚Äù 


11.  Rod says to Gypsy, ‚Äúrelease date. 
‚ÄîSomeone‚Äî was not the person that let out your release it it wasnt ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî that leaked the date. It was communication director ‚Äîsomeone ‚Äî According to the in touch article. See the attached screenshot. I don't appreciate you publicly attaching on this. I watched the video in the article. Tatiania said she knows ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî grew up with her and talks to her which is all true. However she had no new news or developments that she shared in the article besides you made parole and were getting out in December, which I. Believe was already public knowledge. She didn't give a date. ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî gave the date. So please back off. We have respected your privacy. Everything will be fine when you get out. Sure you'll have media there. There was media there for all your court dates. Not a big deal. Posting on Facebook that your release date has been leaked is a leak in itself. Your going to a NFL game right after your release, so I'm not buying the ""I'm worried about my security "" bit. You will be recognized everywhere and that is just part of the process that you will learn to deal with. Blaming ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî publicly for knowing and associating with someone who knew your mother more and describing that relationship in more detail in the article is just wrong ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî could have done the article on the merit that she was friends with your mother alone, knowing ‚Äîsomeone‚Äîwas a plus to her credibility but you can't blame for Kristy associating with someone. I know her and ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî had that whole screwed up thing going on and had to work hard to get your medical records back from Fancy after it all went south but I don't believe for a second that Kristy would have told her the date. If she did then ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî would have said it in the Article.. she did not. She never said ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî said this or that. She gave her opinion on you and your mother which is her prerogative. You made it clear a long time ago about reaching out in too many places regarding you. Since then she has been rock solid and only talking to ‚Äîsomeone‚Äîand has respected your privacy. In my opinion you should have walked out that prison jumped in a car drove halfway home, stop somewhere and take night or so then continue home. Anyways. Thats all I got. I love you.‚Äù 


12.  Gypsy says to Rod, ‚ÄúDad. Well I'm sure you know, I'm upset with mom. She talks too dang much to the wrong people. It‚Äôs always the same women she allows back in our lives time and time again who butter her up and get what they want to know and then go to the media. She needs to stop talking about me which is all these women care about. Is mom really that gullible to think these women won't blab whatever she tells them? You don't talk to ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî I don't, Ryan don't...Mom does. and if it ant ‚Äîsomeone- is is some other woman in the drama mix. talk to mom in a few days after I figure out how to broach how I want to to lay down the law of keep ya mouth shut lol love you‚Äù. Gypsy also says, ‚ÄúOk I understand. I will never tell anyone not to be friends with someone. ‚Äîsomeone‚Äî will never be a friend to the Anderson family. I don't trust her and that is my stand on her and anyone who did do us dirty in the past. I'll mannge with whatever media ends up showing up Ryan is gonna pick me up and we will be driving to KC to meet up with y'all.. Let mom know I'm sorry that my post upset her. I am trying to find a reasonable outcome to this, I need a little time to figure out how or what to say to make this right. Love, Gypsy‚Äù ",8,1760477002.0,GRBSnarkBU,6,0.9,False
1o6s8lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dexcom/comments/1o6s8lx/high_readings_after_brief_sensor_issue/,High Readings After ‚ÄúBrief Sensor Issue‚Äù,"This morning, my Stelo app said ‚ÄúBrief Sensor Issue‚Äù and was offline for about 30 mins. When it came back online, my reading was about 100 points higher than what it had been before the sensor issue, despite me not having eaten any significant amount of carbs or done anything that I would expect to provoke that kind of spike. The app says my sugar has been over 250 for the past 7 hours.

The only thing I did differently was drink about 6 ounces of black coffee after breakfast (I have not had a caffeinated cup of coffee in almost a year). The sensor issue occurred about 1 hour after I drank the coffee.

Is it possible that this amount of caffeine could cause this spike, or does it sound like a technical issue with the sensor? It seems suspicious that the high readings started right after the sensor error. Unfortunately I do not have any un-expired test strips with which to do a finger prick at the moment.

I do not feel sick and am not experiencing any symptoms that I would expect to have with sugar that high. I guess I am just looking for peace of mind and to see if anyone else has had a similar issue? This is my first Stelo sensor, so I‚Äôm not sure what is considered normal.

Asking because I created a tool that converts videos into blog posts and I'm seeing a good amount of people using it to create highly localized content (for example, realtors using it to create content like ""10 Best Coffee Shops in <city>"") and I'm wondering if there's something more here.

My (half thought out) idea would be something like... 

1. Enter a location (city/neighborhood/etc)
2. Choose an industry (plumber, dentist, landscaping, etc)
3. Get some suggested blog post titles (ex: ""Best types of grass for <city>"") 
4. Create a well structured, highly localized blog post with local links

Would anyone find something like this useful?

I haven't worked with local businesses directly as clients so would love to hear any and all feedback from the experts in the subreddit. Thanks!",0,1760476686.0,localseo,2,0.5,False

Let me start this off by saying: I AM NOT SOCIAL
I know a lot, until I dont
If I am ever thrown into a situation I'm not used to, I am completely out of my field, and I get kindof awkward

My school has kindof a ""Cafe experience"" where students can make drinks like coffee and whatnot, and sell it to students.
I have that class, so I help make coffees and run the register and whatnot.
Recently, a girl I sortof know (she's in the friendgroup of someone im friends with) has been coming in during my class period, and helping us out.

Well, today, she was acting a lot different. She was being very forward, but it was to a point of where I could not tell if she was joking or being serious. (Flirting with me and making a lot of comments, but I joke with my friends in that manner a lot) 
And around the end of that class, I was talking to a friend and mentioned I had been wanting to go to a haunted house that opened recently.
After me and my friend talked about it a bit, the girl (ill name her Amy) said something along the lines of ""Yeah, me and Kevin are going on Saturday""
(I am Kevin, if that wasn't clear)
And.. I was confused. I looked at her and asked her to repeat herself, to which she did
And then I asked her if she was wanting me to go to the haunted house with her, to which she just shrugged and said ""if you want to""

And now I guess we're going???
I am not the best with social cues, I never have been.
I cant tell if she was joking, or flirting, or being serious, or anything

1o6s2l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6s2l3/the_gospel_of_erebus_part_2/,The Gospel of Erebus (part 2),"The hum of the station becomes a kind of pulse ‚Äî constant, rhythmic, like the heartbeat of something half-alive. I woke early, if one can measure dawn in a place where no sun ever rises. The artificial lights bloom to mimic morning, but it is a lie that convinces no one.

When I step out into the main corridor, the air tastes of metal and filtered oxygen. Condensation beads on the corners of the panels; the faint, sour tang of humanity lingers despite the machinery‚Äôs attempts to cleanse it.

Captain Reyes waits for me near the central junction. She looks sharper in the new light ‚Äî uniform pressed, hair tied back, expression fixed in a line that could pass for patience. She gestures for me to follow.

‚ÄúThe others are waiting in the mess,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMight as well meet the family before the day begins.‚Äù

*Family.* A strange word to use for those living inside a sealed coffin circling the planet. But I say nothing. I follow her down the corridor where the sound of laughter ‚Äî real, nervous laughter ‚Äî echoes faintly.

The mess hall is a compact room of brushed steel, cluttered with personal effects: mugs tethered by magnets, a few faded photos taped to bulkheads, a deck of cards floating lazily above the table until someone swats it back into its case.

Six faces turn as we enter.

‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù Reyes says, ‚Äúthis is our... consultant. He‚Äôll be working with us for the next several days.‚Äù

No one asks what kind of consultant. Their silence tells me they already know more than they should, or nothing at all.

Reyes gestures one by one.

‚ÄúThis is Lieutenant Mercer ‚Äî engineering chief.‚Äù

Mercer is a tall man, shoulders squared, his uniform smudged with the ghosts of oil and coolant. His hands look too big for the delicate equipment of space; they belong to someone who used to lift real weight. He gives a nod, eyes cautious but not unkind.

‚ÄúDoctor Holt,‚Äù Reyes continues, motioning to a woman with silvered hair and a sharp, hawk-like gaze. ‚ÄúMedical officer.‚Äù

Holt‚Äôs hands are steady as she holds her coffee, though there‚Äôs a tremor in her eyelids ‚Äî the residue of stimulants, or exhaustion.

‚ÄúEnsign Ito, comms and data.‚Äù

Ito barely looks up from the tablet hovering before him. His face is youthful, soft-edged, but the eyes are distant, always turned inward toward some invisible horizon.

‚ÄúSergeant Varga, security.‚Äù

Varga‚Äôs grin is wolfish. He leans back in his chair, arms crossed over a chest like armor plating. His gaze meets mine with open challenge ‚Äî the kind of man who needs to know where to place others in his hierarchy of strength.

‚ÄúAnd finally, Technician Delaine.‚Äù

Delaine ‚Äî younger than I expected. Early thirties, maybe, with sandy hair that refuses to obey regulation cut. There‚Äôs something almost fragile in his posture, but his eyes are bright, alert. He smiles at me ‚Äî genuinely ‚Äî and it feels strange to be met with warmth aboard this mechanical tomb.

‚ÄúWelcome to Erebus,‚Äù Delaine says. ‚ÄúHope you don‚Äôt mind the d√©cor.‚Äù

Reyes clears her throat before I can answer. ‚ÄúEat something. Then we‚Äôll debrief.‚Äù

We eat reconstituted eggs and drink recycled coffee. The conversation drifts ‚Äî surface chatter, small jokes about gravity drift, broken systems, failed communications. Beneath it all, tension simmers like static.

When breakfast ends, Reyes leads me to the command hub ‚Äî a circular chamber lined with screens showing telemetry, maintenance readouts, and a slow rotation of the Earth below.

She gestures toward a seat and begins the briefing.

‚ÄúThree days ago,‚Äù she says, ‚Äústation sensors picked up an anomaly ‚Äî movement outside the hull at approximately zero-two-hundred hours. External cameras identified what appeared to be a human figure drifting approximately fifteen meters off-section D. No suit, no gear. Just‚Ä¶‚Äù she hesitates, ‚Äú‚Ä¶a man.‚Äù

I already know the official report. But hearing her say it out loud makes it real in a way paper never could.

‚ÄúThe body should‚Äôve been dead long before we reached it,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúNo exposure burns, no frostbite, no swelling. Just‚Ä¶ breathing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou brought him inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Against protocol. But we weren‚Äôt about to leave a living human to die in a vacuum. Doctor Holt confirmed stable vitals. Normal body temperature. No identification. No injuries ‚Äî not even skin damage. He woke four hours later.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù

Reyes‚Äô jaw tightens. ‚ÄúHe told us he was sent here by God.‚Äù

The words sit between us like a weapon on the table.

‚ÄúHe said,‚Äù she continues, voice stiff, ‚Äúthat he was an angel ‚Äî sent to guide humanity back to grace.‚Äù

I let the silence stretch. The hum of monitors fills the gap.

Finally, I ask, ‚ÄúAnd you believe him?‚Äù

Reyes lets out a dry laugh. ‚ÄúBelief doesn‚Äôt enter into it. My orders were to keep him contained and await expert evaluation.‚Äù

‚ÄúMeaning me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Your superiors were very insistent that only someone of‚Ä¶ spiritual background could assess this claim.‚Äù

I study her face. ‚ÄúAnd what do you think he is?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù

Her tone is clipped, final. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find your own answers soon enough. The subject‚Äôs in isolation bay three. Delaine can take you there when you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

She pauses, as if weighing whether to continue, then adds, ‚ÄúWhatever you find, Father ‚Äî keep it quiet. There‚Äôs already enough madness on this station without someone preaching apocalypse.‚Äù

The title hits me like a blow ‚Äî *Father*. So she knows.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be discreet,‚Äù I say.

She nods once, curtly, and turns back to the console.



The corridor to the isolation bays is colder than the rest of the station. The lights hum a fraction lower, as if afraid to disturb whatever sleeps behind the sealed doors. Delaine walks beside me, carrying a tablet pressed to his chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve read the reports?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve read the summaries.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt do it justice. Seeing him ‚Äî it‚Äôs different. You‚Äôll understand soon.‚Äù

He says it with a kind of awe that unsettles me.

The door to bay three is a thick slab of composite steel. A small viewport in the center glows faintly from within. Delaine hesitates before unlocking it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be alone inside,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHe asked for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsked?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Said he‚Äôd only speak if no one else was listening.‚Äù

A chill runs through me. ‚ÄúAnd you agreed?‚Äù

Delaine shrugs. ‚ÄúOrders. You‚Äôre the expert.‚Äù

The lock disengages with a hiss. I step through.

The room is bare ‚Äî just a cot, a small table, and a wall of reinforced glass separating the inner chamber from the observation booth. A faint hum of recycled air fills the silence.

And there he is.

The man ‚Äî the *angel* ‚Äî sits on the edge of the cot, head bowed, pale hair falling over his face. His skin glows with a strange vitality, as if light were something that lived inside him rather than touched him. His eyes lift slowly when I enter, and for a moment, the world seems to narrow to that gaze ‚Äî bright, unblinking, ancient.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I manage.

He smiles ‚Äî small, knowing. ‚ÄúMorning has no meaning here.‚Äù

His voice is low and resonant, the kind of sound that feels like it bypasses the ear and sinks straight into the chest.

‚ÄúI suppose not,‚Äù I say. I take a seat opposite him. ‚ÄúDo you know why I‚Äôm here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come to weigh the truth.‚Äù

His lips curve into something between serenity and sorrow. ‚ÄúThey sent a priest to judge an angel. The irony is not lost on me.**""**

The air inside the isolation chamber feels heavier than elsewhere on the station, as if the machinery itself is reluctant to breathe.  
 The man‚Äîno, the *being*‚Äîwatches me with that faint, unreadable smile. His pupils shimmer like light striking oil.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve read accounts,‚Äù I say carefully, ‚Äúof angels appearing to prophets, of messengers descending in radiance. You‚Ä¶ do not resemble those descriptions.‚Äù

He tilts his head. ‚ÄúThey described what they were permitted to see. Light can blind as easily as it guides.‚Äù  
 His gaze drifts toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúIf you saw me as I was, the marrow of your bones would burn. This body is mercy.‚Äù

The way he says *mercy*‚Äîsoft, almost wistful‚Äîmakes me shiver.

‚ÄúThen why appear at all?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúWhy now, after silence for millennia?‚Äù

He studies me, eyes narrowing slightly. ‚ÄúBecause the silence itself has become unbearable.‚Äù

For a heartbeat, the room seems to vibrate. The words carry weight, like gravity compressed into syllables. I try to steady my breathing, to reclaim the rhythm of interrogation, but every question feels smaller than the space between them.

‚ÄúWho sent you?‚Äù I press.

He laughs, quietly, almost tenderly. ‚ÄúYou already know the answer you wish to hear. You want me to say *God*.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I will say it: God sent me.‚Äù

His tone makes the declaration sound both true and false, a confession wrapped in performance.

‚ÄúYou speak like a poet.‚Äù

‚ÄúPoetry is the only language left when truth cannot be contained in prose.‚Äù

I write that down in my notebook without thinking, though my hand trembles.

He leans forward, elbows on knees, eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúTell me, Father‚Äîhow long has it been since you heard His voice?‚Äù

I freeze. The question lands like a blade slipped between ribs.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not lie.‚Äù His voice sharpens, but not with anger; it carries the calm authority of someone accustomed to obedience. ‚ÄúOnce you felt Him in prayer, didn‚Äôt you? That warmth, that whisper that felt like meaning. And then it stopped.‚Äù

My throat tightens. ‚ÄúFaith is not hearing. Faith is believing despite the silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet here you are, circling the dead world, hoping a stranger in a cell might speak for Him.‚Äù

He is right, and the truth of it burns worse than accusation.

I force my tone into steadiness. ‚ÄúIf you are an angel, prove it. Speak of Heaven.‚Äù

He closes his eyes. When he opens them again, I swear the light in the room shifts‚Äîsoft gold flickering over his skin.

‚ÄúHeaven,‚Äù he says slowly, ‚Äúis not a place. It is an echo of intention. The first thought before creation, the breath between two words of a name no longer spoken. Every joy you have ever felt is a splinter of its ruin.‚Äù

He speaks with reverence and sorrow all at once, like a man describing a home he can never return to.

‚ÄúThen what is Hell?‚Äù I ask.

He smiles faintly. ‚ÄúYou already live in it.‚Äù

The hum of the ventilation deepens. I realize my heartbeat has synchronized with the mechanical pulse, as if the station itself listens.

‚ÄúDo you have a name?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had thousands,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou may call me *Asriel*.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsriel,‚Äù I repeat. The word tastes metallic. ‚ÄúIn some texts that name belongs to the angel of death.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd in others,‚Äù he replies, ‚Äúto the angel who records the living. We wear the titles you give us, like garments you cannot see through.‚Äù

He looks down at his hands. ‚ÄúYou are thinking I could be an alien, a mimic, a trick. Perhaps I am. But tell me‚Äîif something *pretends* to be divine so perfectly that it awakens faith again, is that not miracle enough?‚Äù

I cannot answer. The words dissolve somewhere behind my teeth.

He rises from the cot, moves closer to the glass separating us. The light seems to bend slightly around him, a faint distortion, as if gravity falters in his presence.

‚ÄúDo you fear me?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whisper.

‚ÄúGood. Fear is the first language of reverence.‚Äù

He presses a palm to the glass. ‚ÄúTouch it.‚Äù

Every instinct screams not to. But I lift my hand anyway. The moment my fingertips meet the cold pane, warmth floods through it‚Äîa pulse that feels alive. My vision flickers white. I see shapes: wings folded in darkness, cities of light collapsing, rivers of ash winding through broken clouds. The visions vanish as suddenly as they came.

I stumble back. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äîwhat was that?‚Äù

He smiles gently. ‚ÄúMemory. A gift.‚Äù

I can still smell something‚Äîozone, roses, and blood.

‚ÄúYou expect me to believe you,‚Äù I say, trying to steady my voice.

‚ÄúI expect nothing,‚Äù Asriel replies. ‚ÄúBelief is your burden, not mine.‚Äù

He sits again, folding his hands like a man at prayer. ‚ÄúAsk what you truly wish to ask.‚Äù

The question rises before I can stop it. ‚ÄúWhy would God send you to guide humanity now? What message do you bring?‚Äù

He looks past me to the observation window where distant stars shimmer. ‚ÄúTo remind you that you were never alone, even when you killed the sky.‚Äù

I frown. ‚ÄúKilled the sky?‚Äù

He gestures upward. ‚ÄúYour satellites, your machines, your endless reaching. You filled the firmament with your own reflection until you could no longer see beyond it. You built towers that touched the void and called them progress. You replaced awe with knowledge, prayer with signal. You made yourselves gods‚Äîand found only emptiness.‚Äù

His words strike too close. ‚ÄúAnd you intend to correct us?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His voice lowers. ‚ÄúI am only here to *witness* what comes next.‚Äù

The phrase chills me more than any threat could.

‚ÄúWhat comes next?‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he asks quietly, ‚ÄúDo you believe in redemption, Father?‚Äù

‚ÄúI used to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen perhaps I am here for you.‚Äù

For a while, neither of us speaks. The station‚Äôs lights flicker, subtle but noticeable, and the hum of the ventilation deepens again. It feels as though the entire structure exhales.

He breaks the silence first. ‚ÄúYour faith is wounded but not dead. That is why they sent you, isn‚Äôt it? You can still *recognize* the divine, even if you doubt it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was told to evaluate your claim,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúNothing more.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvaluation is judgment by another name. You think you can measure Heaven with your instruments of reason.‚Äù

He smiles‚Äîsadly, beautifully. ‚ÄúBut Heaven measures you.‚Äù

I find myself leaning forward, voice low. ‚ÄúIf you truly came from God, tell me one thing‚Äîwhy now? Why reveal yourself to us, to *me*, after centuries of silence?‚Äù

His eyes gleam. ‚ÄúBecause silence is fragile. All things holy eventually fracture under the weight of yearning.‚Äù

For an instant I think he will say more, but he only sits back, gaze turning inward, distant.

‚ÄúYour time is ending,‚Äù he murmurs. ‚ÄúThe captain grows restless. They will decide soon that I am something to be dissected. But tell her, Father‚Äîtell her I am what I claim to be, or she will die unshriven.‚Äù

A flare of anger rises in me. ‚ÄúAre you threatening her?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says softly. ‚ÄúI am warning you.‚Äù





When I finally leave the chamber, my legs feel unsteady. Delaine waits in the corridor, pale and anxious.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù he asks.

I hesitate. ‚ÄúUnsettling.‚Äù

He smiles faintly, as though relieved. ‚ÄúHe spoke to you, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe speaks well.‚Äù

Delaine‚Äôs expression brightens with something almost like faith. ‚ÄúYou see it too, don‚Äôt you? There‚Äôs something *real* about him.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt answer. Instead, I walk past him toward my quarters, clutching my notebook like scripture.

Inside, I sit at the small desk and replay the conversation in my mind. The tone, the words, the impossible heat through the glass. The visions still shimmer behind my eyelids.

Could an alien mimic theology with such precision? Could madness manifest with such coherence?

No answer comes. Only silence‚Äîand beneath it, the echo of his final words: *Your time is ending.*

I cannot sleep. The others laugh somewhere down the corridor, trying to normalize this absurdity with routine. But the sound feels hollow.

When I close my eyes, I see the shimmer of his skin, the way his words seemed to shape the air. I felt something when he spoke‚Äînot revelation, but proximity. The way one feels standing too close to a storm.

If he lies, he lies with divine precision.

If he tells the truth, then the fabric of everything I have ever believed is unraveling one thread at a time.

They said I was sent here to *judge* him. But already I feel the weight shifting. Perhaps it is he who judges us.

That night, I dream.

I am back on Earth, in the ruined cathedral where I once gave my last sermon. The pews are empty, the candles extinguished. A single figure kneels at the altar‚ÄîAsriel, head bowed, wings folded like broken sails.

When he looks up, his eyes are mirrors, and in them I see myself‚Äîmouth open in silent prayer, hands covered in blood.

I wake gasping, the taste of iron on my tongue.

Outside my cabin door, I hear something‚Äîa whisper, faint but distinct.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Father‚Ä¶‚Äù

I freeze. The voice is not human; it‚Äôs layered, harmonic, as if several throats spoke in unison.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Do you believe yet?‚Äù

The light flickers once, then steadies. When I open the door, the corridor is empty. Only the hum of life-support answers me.

1o6s2jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1o6s2jj/eyes_in_the_snow_entry_i/,Eyes in the Snow [Entry I],"**Arctic Research Station E-7**

*March 2nd*

The Arctic is nothing like the textbooks describe. Those diagrams, the sweeping panoramas printed in National Geographic, the photos of pale, rolling hills of snow, all of them lie. The wind here is alive. It bites at every layer of clothing, crawling beneath gloves, burrowing into boots. It cracks against the metal siding of the station like some ancient percussion instrument, and it never stops. Not for a second. Not for a blink.

We arrived late yesterday, sleds dragged behind the cargo plane, their runners scraping against the frozen tundra. Snow drifted across the landing field in rippling waves, some larger than a compact car. The temperature read minus twenty-four Celsius, but with the wind chill, it might as well have been minus fifty. The station itself is a skeleton of aluminum and reinforced glass, built to withstand storms like this, though even from inside, the metal groans under the persistent pressure of ice and wind.

Dr. Everwood, our team leader, claims he‚Äôs seen conditions like this before, in northern Greenland, decades ago, but his bravado does little to warm the air or our spirits. He‚Äôs methodical, precise, always the first to unload equipment and check instruments. Carter, our climatologist, follows closely behind, noting wind direction and subtle shifts in the snowpack. The others, a handful of grad students and research assistants, fall somewhere in between fascination and exhaustion. Their faces are pale behind balaclavas, eyes wide with the Arctic‚Äôs deceptive beauty and latent menace.

I spend most of my attention on the herd. There are elk here, or reindeer, depending on who you ask, migrating south along routes that we‚Äôve been tracking for the last three weeks via satellite imagery. I have binoculars trained on them for hours at a time, jotting numbers into my notebook: approximate numbers, distances, gait patterns, any irregularities in their movement. The herd stretches like a living ribbon across the tundra, pale brown against the undulating white. They move with the slow inevitability of glaciers, pausing only when their collective senses detect some subtle shift in the wind or a shadow against the snow.

It‚Äôs mesmerizing. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it, a pulse that reminds me of the earth‚Äôs slow, patient heartbeat. I‚Äôve always thought wildlife observation was about patience. Sitting still long enough to notice the patterns that aren‚Äôt immediately obvious. This is nothing if not a test of patience.

The team keeps busy. Everwood calibrates the GPS sensors on our collars and tags, while Carter logs temperature, wind velocity, and humidity readings at fifteen-minute intervals. I note the behavior of the herd, occasionally calling out coordinates or asking a grad student to double-check a reading. Occasionally, the wind roars like an animal, and we all lean into it, hunching, gripping our notebooks and scopes, waiting for it to pass.

And then I notice it.

A pale movement on the horizon. At first, I think it‚Äôs a reflection, a trick of the binocular lenses. The Arctic sun sits low, sharp against the ice, throwing glints that make shapes appear where none exist. I adjust the focus, check the diopter on my binoculars. The shape persists. It‚Äôs white, almost the exact hue of the snow around it, though it moves in a deliberate, upright manner. Too upright to be drift or a cloud.

I frown. My first thought is some optical distortion, perhaps something on the lenses themselves. I wipe them clean with a cloth, recalibrate the focus. And yet it moves. Slowly. Purposefully. Its pace matches nothing I‚Äôve seen before, not the herd, not the shadows, not the way wind-driven snow drifts. My pen hovers over the page as I scribble a note:

*‚ÄúPale shape observed on the horizon. Movement appears consistent. Lens distortion likely.‚Äù*

I don‚Äôt mention it to the team. There‚Äôs no need to. We‚Äôve seen illusions in the ice before: mirages that stretch the horizon, shadows that resolve into nothing. Everwood is calling out numbers for the GPS collaring; Patel mutters measurements under her breath. The grad students are arguing quietly about whether the herd‚Äôs movement indicates a northern predator might be nearby. None of them notice the pale movement.

Or perhaps, like me, they choose not to.

The herd continues south. The males keep their heads down, antlers swaying like pendulums in the cold wind. One of the younger calves stumbles and catches itself, shaking snow from its fur. I record the incident.

There‚Äôs a harmony in the chaos of survival here, each small moment has significance. Observing this herd is more than data collection; it‚Äôs watching a cycle of life unfold in real time, one I‚Äôve only ever read about in abstracts and journals.

I glance back at the pale shape. Still moving, still indistinct. I convince myself again: snow glare, lens aberration, optical anomaly. I‚Äôve worked in the field long enough to know better than to trust first impressions. Still, there‚Äôs a faint rhythm to its motion that seems‚Ä¶ deliberate. Almost like pacing. My scientific mind reels at the absurdity.

Who or what would pace in the Arctic, eight miles away, alone, in the cold? I shrug it off.

By midday, the team takes lunch inside the station. Hot water bottles, freeze-dried meals, instant coffee. I peer out the observation window toward the horizon. The herd is nearly off the ridge; I estimate we have an hour before they pass the southern monitoring point.

The pale shape is still there. I adjust the focus again, and I swear for a brief second, it seems aligned with the ridge marker, as if it has tracked the movement of our instruments. I jot it down\*.\*

Carter looks over my shoulder, curious about my scribbles. ‚Äú*Another blizzard illusion?‚Äù*¬†she asks, her tone light. I nod, smile, and close the notebook. It‚Äôs harmless. It has to be.

Afternoon brings more observation. The herd‚Äôs movement patterns are unusually tight today, calves clustered near adult females, males keeping a wide perimeter. We log each GPS coordinate. Everwood comments on subtle changes in migratory speed, about 10% slower than satellite tracking predicted. I record this with interest. Minor variations happen in every herd. Nothing alarming.

Yet, the pale shape remains. It doesn‚Äôt veer toward the herd. Doesn‚Äôt retreat. Doesn‚Äôt approach. Simply persists on the horizon. I cannot confirm species. Could be a distant snowdrift catching the sun just right. Could be a lone Arctic hare, though the proportions seem wrong. Could be a shadow stretched by the low sun. The mind wants to rationalize. Data must come first. Observation above speculation.

The day progresses without incident. Snow swirls around the station like fine sand, glinting like crushed diamonds under the pale sun. Wind drums against the walls, carrying echoes from the ridge. Occasionally, I catch the faint sound of cracking ice far off, something moving beneath frozen lakes. I record it, though no one else notices. Most likely ice shifts, I tell myself.

Evening arrives. Shadows grow long, though the sun remains stubbornly low. The herd moves past the southern point, heading out of sight. I log the last coordinates. The pale shape, if it was ever there at all, has vanished as subtly as it appeared.

We return to the station for the night. I spend hours transferring data, calibrating instruments, reviewing observations. The horizon beyond the observation window is empty and featureless. My binoculars rest on the sill. For a fleeting moment, I think I see a shimmer of white, half a mile from the ridge, but it disappears before I can focus. Likely fatigue. Likely optical effect. Likely nothing.

I close my journal for the night, noting the herd‚Äôs passage and the day‚Äôs measurements. Temperature readings steady, wind speeds consistent, GPS trackers functioning normally. Everything in order. And yet, my pen hesitates for a final line:

*Pale shape observed briefly; optical distortion likely. Observation continued.*

The Arctic remains silent outside, save for the occasional groan of ice and the whistling wind. The station feels small, insignificant against the vast expanse. The team sleeps fitfully, unaware of anything beyond the data, as am I. Tomorrow brings another day of tracking, and I remind myself: the horizon is deceptive. The mind more so.

*March 2nd*

The Arctic is nothing like the textbooks describe. Those diagrams, the sweeping panoramas printed in National Geographic, the photos of pale, rolling hills of snow, all of them lie. The wind here is alive. It bites at every layer of clothing, crawling beneath gloves, burrowing into boots. It cracks against the metal siding of the station like some ancient percussion instrument, and it never stops. Not for a second. Not for a blink.

We arrived late yesterday, sleds dragged behind the cargo plane, their runners scraping against the frozen tundra. Snow drifted across the landing field in rippling waves, some larger than a compact car. The temperature read minus twenty-four Celsius, but with the wind chill, it might as well have been minus fifty. The station itself is a skeleton of aluminum and reinforced glass, built to withstand storms like this, though even from inside, the metal groans under the persistent pressure of ice and wind.

Dr. Everwood, our team leader, claims he‚Äôs seen conditions like this before, in northern Greenland, decades ago, but his bravado does little to warm the air or our spirits. He‚Äôs methodical, precise, always the first to unload equipment and check instruments. Carter, our climatologist, follows closely behind, noting wind direction and subtle shifts in the snowpack. The others, a handful of grad students and research assistants, fall somewhere in between fascination and exhaustion. Their faces are pale behind balaclavas, eyes wide with the Arctic‚Äôs deceptive beauty and latent menace.

I spend most of my attention on the herd. There are elk here, or reindeer, depending on who you ask, migrating south along routes that we‚Äôve been tracking for the last three weeks via satellite imagery. I have binoculars trained on them for hours at a time, jotting numbers into my notebook: approximate numbers, distances, gait patterns, any irregularities in their movement. The herd stretches like a living ribbon across the tundra, pale brown against the undulating white. They move with the slow inevitability of glaciers, pausing only when their collective senses detect some subtle shift in the wind or a shadow against the snow.

It‚Äôs mesmerizing. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it, a pulse that reminds me of the earth‚Äôs slow, patient heartbeat. I‚Äôve always thought wildlife observation was about patience. Sitting still long enough to notice the patterns that aren‚Äôt immediately obvious. This is nothing if not a test of patience.

The team keeps busy. Everwood calibrates the GPS sensors on our collars and tags, while Carter logs temperature, wind velocity, and humidity readings at fifteen-minute intervals. I note the behavior of the herd, occasionally calling out coordinates or asking a grad student to double-check a reading. Occasionally, the wind roars like an animal, and we all lean into it, hunching, gripping our notebooks and scopes, waiting for it to pass.

And then I notice it.

A pale movement on the horizon. At first, I think it‚Äôs a reflection, a trick of the binocular lenses. The Arctic sun sits low, sharp against the ice, throwing glints that make shapes appear where none exist. I adjust the focus, check the diopter on my binoculars. The shape persists. It‚Äôs white, almost the exact hue of the snow around it, though it moves in a deliberate, upright manner. Too upright to be drift or a cloud.

I frown. My first thought is some optical distortion, perhaps something on the lenses themselves. I wipe them clean with a cloth, recalibrate the focus. And yet it moves. Slowly. Purposefully. Its pace matches nothing I‚Äôve seen before, not the herd, not the shadows, not the way wind-driven snow drifts. My pen hovers over the page as I scribble a note:

*‚ÄúPale shape observed on the horizon. Movement appears consistent. Lens distortion likely.‚Äù*

I don‚Äôt mention it to the team. There‚Äôs no need to. We‚Äôve seen illusions in the ice before: mirages that stretch the horizon, shadows that resolve into nothing. Everwood is calling out numbers for the GPS collaring; Patel mutters measurements under her breath. The grad students are arguing quietly about whether the herd‚Äôs movement indicates a northern predator might be nearby. None of them notice the pale movement.

Or perhaps, like me, they choose not to.

The herd continues south. The males keep their heads down, antlers swaying like pendulums in the cold wind. One of the younger calves stumbles and catches itself, shaking snow from its fur. I record the incident.

There‚Äôs a harmony in the chaos of survival here, each small moment has significance. Observing this herd is more than data collection; it‚Äôs watching a cycle of life unfold in real time, one I‚Äôve only ever read about in abstracts and journals.

I glance back at the pale shape. Still moving, still indistinct. I convince myself again: snow glare, lens aberration, optical anomaly. I‚Äôve worked in the field long enough to know better than to trust first impressions. Still, there‚Äôs a faint rhythm to its motion that seems‚Ä¶ deliberate. Almost like pacing. My scientific mind reels at the absurdity.

Who or what would pace in the Arctic, eight miles away, alone, in the cold? I shrug it off.

We moved in together a little under a year ago and we have been having issues ever since. I grew up in a hoarder house so clean was never a reality. I have been trying to do better but it seems like she wants everything to be spotless. I do know I can up my chores and time spent cleaning but my real issue is that she does not want to help me improve, she just wants me to be a clean freak overnight. I work 40 hours a week and she works 48 hours biweekly and she wants me to do 50% of the household chores still.

Part of my issue is that she does not cook or buy groceries and she expects me to pay for all our groceries and cook and clean after cooking. She will get frustrated cleaning after I cook and when she bakes I end up having to clean up after her otherwise our kitchen will be a mess days after she bakes. Her excuse for me having to clean is baking takes longer than cooking but she does not even try to minimize her mess after baking. She also just expects me to pay for everything needed for groceries and she expects me to cook without counting either of those as a chore necessary for the household. Minus going out to eat and getting what is needed for baking I think it has been months since she has spent money on food.

We have had conversations in the past how she has said that telling me to do things is her having to be my mom and I have explained that what ""clean"" was for me growing up is entirely different than what she wants and how she might need to help me get to the level of clean that she wants. My response to that is it is not her having to be my mom, it is her wanting to help her partner become a better person for her. After this conversation we both got sick and I have had a lingering grossness staying with me so energy has been low and work has been extremely difficult because I work in manual labor so I have been exhausted. I should also add that she does not have a good memory and these types of conversations have just been forgotten in the past.

Now onto the issue that happened today. I said I was going to clean up the kitchen (a few dishes in sink and running the dishwasher plus cleaning the sink and counters) and make brunch and then she made a comment about how she did not believe I would do any of it and how she has given up on me doing anything around the apartment. Might I add I was planning on making brunch and dinner today (I even had things in the fridge to make both). She said that I always say I will do something but never end up doing it. I also did grocery shopping this week entirely by myself with no financial help from her and when I brought that up she said I only buy junk food so it does not count (I bought ice cream and coffee cake as the only junk food for $200 of groceries). I did end up cleaning and cooking and the only thing I got was a text saying ""thank you for brunch"" no apology or anything.

I'm just not sure if I am being dramatic at this point or what I should do. I love this girl but I feel so underappreciated working almost twice what she works and being expected to do so much while also doing all the grocery shopping and having to do all the cooking. Like I said earlier I know I am not perfect, I am far from it and I know I can do much better. What are my choices in this situation? She doesn't seem to want to do anything about remembering the conversations we have had and today just put me into a funk.",4,1760476471.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1o6s0ia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6s0ia,Introduction to my StarDust AU! (OC) (fanart) (ship) (Shigako),"foreword: SPOILER ALERT FOR MANGA ENDING! Uraraka (and all of Class 1A) are 23-24, as there is a 5 year time skip, also warning for mentions of trauma and long recovery  
  
StarDust is an AU in which Shigaraki doesn't die, and instead goes to Tartarus.   
  
After Toga's death, Uraraka wants to create justice in this broken system, and works five long years to become a notable pro hero, until her newest Villain Rehabilitation Program is finally approved by the Government. However her program won't be funded, and she has to prove that it works before they make it truly official- but that doesn't affect Uraraka's determination to do the right thing.  
  
Touya was potentially on the list first (mostly for his connection to Toga and her friend Shouto), but he was far too unpredictable, and the Todoroki family refused as they did not want to burden her with the weight of their own mistakes.

So, putting her hero rank, reputation and financial situation on the line, she chooses Shigaraki Tomura. She has a long conversation with Midoriya and Toshinori beforehand. The retired hero even discourages her, but she persists.

And so, helmet tucked under her arm and her heart pounding nervously in her chest, she enters the depths of the prison to reach out a hand to Shigaraki when nobody else would.   
At first, he lashes out. He yells, laughs, mocks and curses- but when he sees honesty and fire in her eyes, he gives up. Anywhere would be better than Tartarus, even if he had to stay in chains in her apartment. ""A glorified prison with a prettier door"", he would say.

When he's finally outside for the first time in 5 years, the fresh, salty ocean air and blinding sunlight hits him like a bullet train... and reluctantly, he steps into the helicopter with Uraraka close by, bracing himself for this new change in his life.

The first week is hell, for both of them. For Uraraka- because she can't sleep at night, out of pure fear for her safety. She tries to talk to him, but he's as silent as a grave, even bitter, and avoids her gaze like the plague.   
For Shigaraki- because he can't stand the heavy quirk cancelling bands on his wrists or the ankle monitor trapping him in her apartment. He tries to eat what she cooks him, he really does, but years of malnurourishment leave him retching the meals back out in her bathroom. He snaps at everything and rots on her couch, the only comfort being the TV he watches when he can't sleep.

Her kindness infuriates him. The way she asks if he's okay, the way she tiptoes around him like he's sensitive, the way she leaves tea on the coffee table for him when he wakes up. He hates how disarming it is, and after lashing out again, he finally collapses. He's too tired to fight back, and opens up.

Over time, he adapts. To her presence, the meals, the routine of waking up, taking care of himself, and getting himself busy. He's more open, and eventually, he even initiates conversation. It's difficult, but after a few months, he feels normal again. The public hates him, and Uraraka keeps telling him to ""focus on himself, that's what's important"".

Following his progress, he's allowed more things- access to the internet, access to sharper objects around the apartment, until she finally removes the metal around his wrists and ankle. Slowly, very slowly, he starts to get closer to healing from his past pain. He tries to view the world a little differently. And slowly, they start to get closer to each other, too :)

LOOOOTS of arcs in this story that I'm so excited about but I can't write everything here this is already too long :') Maybe I'll turn this into a fanfic! And even a comic, once I further develop my artistic skills. Hopefully ppl found this interesting! I really wanna focus on the concept of healing, finding closure and acceptance. The future pro hero Uraraka x rehab Shigaraki dynamic is just eye candy for me ;b",0,1760476452.0,MyHeroAcadamia,0,0.4,False
1o6rztp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1o6rztp/how_i_guaranteed_deep_restorative_sleep_every/,"How I guaranteed deep, restorative sleep every night","My sleep used to be unpredictable. I‚Äôd go through stretches where I slept perfectly like a king on a cloud, then I'd randomly hit a wall. I‚Äôd toss and turn, wake up groggy, and try to ‚Äúpush through‚Äù brain fog and exhaustion.

So about 1.5 years ago, I decided to go all in on good good consistent sleep no excuses. I started to treat it like a skill to be learned instead of a random Mario mystery box.üòÇ

  
I'm a 35 yr old male with no kids (parents feel free to ignore everything I know your life has many more challenges and is much harder to predict.)  
  
Here‚Äôs what I changed.

# 1. Environment: Building a Bedroom That Triggers Sleep

**Here‚Äôs my setup now:**

* **Essentia mattress (non-toxic memory foam)** ‚Äî no chemical off-gassing or heat buildup.
* **Chili Sleep cooling pad**: each side has its own temperature control. It‚Äôs cheaper than cooling the whole house, and even a 1‚Äì2¬∞F drop in core body temp triggers drowsiness.
* **Room temperature**: drops to \~70¬∞F about 30 minutes before bed. Research shows your core temperature naturally falls as you approach sleep ‚Äî so I ‚Äúassist‚Äù it.
* **Air quality**: I crack a window or sliding door to release and prevent CO‚ÇÇ buildup and use an AirDoctor purifier for particulates. Poor air quality elevates resting heart rate and decreases deep sleep.
* **Sound and light**: I use [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/) ‚Äî their AI-generated functional music increases delta brainwave activity (the frequency range of slow wave sleep). And an insanely comfortable [contoured sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KC5DWCC) blocks light completely without pressing on my eyelids.

One important: **I only use my bed for sleep and sex.**  
No reading, no scrolling, no work. My body now associates the bed with shutting down. It‚Äôs pavlovian conditioning and it works.

# 2. Light Exposure: Teaching My Brain When It‚Äôs Day and Night

As you probably know light is the master controller of circadian rhythm. Every cell in your body runs on a 24-hour clock, and light ‚Äî especially through your eyes ‚Äî tells your brain what time it is. 

**My rhythm:**

* **Wake up:** 5:10 AM (¬±10 minutes). I get bright artificial light for 3‚Äì4 minutes immediately. Usually from my bathroom light but I'm considering getting a sun lamp as well. Then I drink water to rehydrate.
* **Bedtime:** 8:10 PM. On weekends, I try to stretch it by no more than an hour. I try to keep the schedule consistent
* **Evening light:** At 7:30 PM, a red ‚Äúsunset‚Äù bulb turns on automatically ‚Äî this mimics low solar angle light and signals to my brain (via the suprachiasmatic nucleus) that it‚Äôs time to wind down. I got the bulb from bon charge.

Then I put on blue-light-blocking glasses and my phone automatically switches to black and white mode. Those cues reduce dopamine stimulation from screens, making it easier to transition into sleepiness.

**Why this matters:**  
Light viewed in the first 30‚Äì60 minutes after waking triggers a cortisol pulse that sets your internal timer for sleep \~16 hours later. Conversely, light after 10 PM can *delay* your circadian clock ‚Äî even a few minutes of bright light can shift your rhythm by an hour.

# 3. Mindset & Stress: Learning to Downshift the Nervous System

A misconception about sleep is that you can just ‚Äúturn your brain off.‚Äù But if your nervous system is still in sympathetic mode (fight or flight), good luck. You can create a more relaxed brain state but it takes practice.   
  
Letting go of control  
Also paradoxically I became obsessed with the system and process of setting up for a good night of sleep but completely detached from the outcome. I don't stress myself out with the thought of trying to sleep well. If I don't sleep well it's all good, it doesn't matter, all I can do is prepare my body I can't control the outcome. This creates the relaxation needed for sleep.

Here‚Äôs what I do to intentionally switch into chill mode also known as parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) mode:

* **Meditation every morning**: it trains my mind to notice thoughts without reacting. Over time, this carries into bedtime ‚Äî I can feel my body relax when I notice myself tensing. I also don't have to ruminate or chase thoughts they are nothing but events flitting about the mind no action is needed on them.
* **Gratitude journaling in the evening**: I reflect on 2‚Äì3 positive things before bed to create a more calm and joyful mind state
* **Reading** ‚Äî calm input before rest. To be 100% transparent I also usually watch TV while cuddling with my wife before bed while wearing blue light blocking glasses. This routine is relaxing.
* **Topical magnesium spray** on the neck along the vagus nerve and wrists: magnesium helps regulate GABA, the neurotransmitter that calms the nervous system. I apply it where absorption is fastest (veins close to skin).
* **Breathwork and cold exposure**: these rewire my stress response. Breath training protocols help me to lower heart rate quickly and enter relaxation a skill that directly translates to falling asleep faster.

The ability to deliberately turn off alertness is a superpower.

# 4. Exercise: Tire the Body, But Don‚Äôt Overexert

I love lifting in the morning for about 50 minutes followed by 10 minutes in the sauna. It is energizing to get the blood flowing early.

Weekends are for outdoor play: pickleball, hiking, surfing, volleyball ‚Äî all great for light exposure and mental reset.

One rule I follow: **no hard training within 4 hours of bedtime.**  
Late-night workouts raise body temp and adrenaline. It‚Äôs like hitting the gas before parking the car, you won‚Äôt fall asleep easily and you'll put extra strain on the system.

# 5. Diet, Hydration, and Alcohol

I knew what I ate affects my sleep, but when I eat matters just as much.

I eat my **last meal around 5 PM**, at least three hours before bed. Digestion raises body temperature, which delays melatonin release. I also stop drinking water by 4 PM so that I don't get up to pee at night. I still make sure to drink at least 64 oz.

Caffeine?   
About once every two weeks. I like the brain and health benefits but don't want to become dependent. I want my natural energy to tell me the truth about my recovery. When I feel tired, I don‚Äôt reach for coffee to mask the tiredness, I try fix the root cause by taking a nap... and I take note of what I did the day before so that I can avoid low energy in the future. However, some days it doesn't matter if I have low energy so I don't obsess. I.e. if I'm on vacation I don't worry to much if the battery isn't topped off. There is a balance to striving for good habits and being flexible.

Alcohol  
I mostly avoid it, I drink maybe twice a month. Alcohol fragments sleep and suppresses REM. When I do drink, I try to stick to daytime and use **ZBiotics and NAD+** to support help my body process the booze and lessen its impact. (Fun fact: NAD levels drop with age, and lower NAD makes it harder for the body to process alcohol, and is linked to poor cellular repair not ideal for recovery.)

Interesting note, when I was in Italy, wine with dinner didn‚Äôt wreck my sleep like it does in the U.S. This is likely caused by difference in food regulation. The FDA is comically lax with what they allow companies to put in our food and drink when compared to Europe.

# üìä 6. Tracking & Data: Removing Guesswork

I‚Äôve worn a WHOOP band for about five years. It tracks HRV (heart rate variability), resting heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep performance. Before this I used the ""sleep as android"" phone app to track my sleep. There are plenty of trackers that can monitor sleep and recovery.

HRV is the hidden gem metric. It measures the time variation between heartbeats while you‚Äôre asleep ‚Äî higher variability means your nervous system is flexible and balanced.

When my HRV trends upward and my resting heart rate trends down, I know I‚Äôm recovering well. I try to create as large a gap as possible between resting heart rate and HRV. When HRV dips, it‚Äôs usually because I broke a rule ‚Äî heavy meal too late, alcohol too close to bed, or screen time at night.

WHOOP also measures sleep efficiency (time asleep vs time in bed) and consistency (how regular your sleep schedule is). 

Patterns emerged fast. Once I saw the data visualized, I stopped arguing with reality.

My biggest sleep score boosters:

* Limiting alcohol
* Eating 3+ hours before bed
* Going to bed and waking at the same time
* Meditation
* Blue-light blocking glasses

I also have a list of 20+ habits that I document daily so I know what effects my sleep. For example each day I will track how long I exercised, morning light exposure, did I eat processed food, time of eating, how stressed was I, am I injured, hydration, etc. This is correlated with how rested I was the next morning so I know what to avoid and what do keep doing. I have eliminated my sleep disruptors.

You can use a tool like [Sleep blueprint](https://admin.typeform.com/form/qoMSWstN/create?block=ed28f323-6322-438d-b623-87883fe7e60e) to uncover your biggest sleep disruptors and get a personalized plan to fix them. It costs money though and you could probably find the same information for free online if you poked around enough for a sleep hygiene quiz or something similar.

# 7. Transformation: Predictable Energy = Freedom

Before optimizing these factors, my sleep quality felt random. Now, I can predict how I‚Äôll sleep based on the day‚Äôs habits and how my body feels... and I can plan around it.

If I have a big presentation or long day ahead, I know how to guarantee deep, restorative sleep the night before. If I want to stay out late with friends, I can build recovery on both sides so it barely dents me.

Sleep is the foundation that holds everything else together ‚Äî workouts, discipline, mood, creativity. It‚Äôs the ultimate leverage point.  
  
Eating correctly and exercising are pointless without good sleep. Sleeping well makes it easier to do every other health habit because it gives you will power and motivation. For that same reason it is essential to reaching my goals and pursuing my life‚Äôs purpose. Without proper energy everything is harder. I can either experience the pain of discipline to dial in my sleep or the pain of regret of a life wasted or even a mediocre life where I drift through mindlessly following the status quo.

>

And I‚Äôve found that to be true. With consistent, restorative sleep, I wake up motivated with deep reserves of will power.

If your sleep feels inconsistent, the best place to start isn‚Äôt another supplement or gadget ‚Äî it‚Äôs figuring out what‚Äôs actually disrupting it. Find out what specific things for you are creating issues. I've found generic advice to be annoying, I'd rather know what is bothering me specifically and then only fix those things. 

Nothing better than laying in bed and knowing a great night of sleep is inevitable.

# TL;DR

Treat sleep like a skill.

* Build a cool, dark, clean environment.
* Expose your eyes to light early, and protect them from blue light late.
* Teach your nervous system to downshift.
* Time food, exercise, and stress intentionally.
* Track and adjust.

When you align those levers, deep, restorative sleep every night becomes the norm not the exception. Happy optimizing don't let good sleep be a dream make it real!",1,1760476408.0,sleephackers,0,1.0,False

My mom loves grapes. She buys them all the time. I work at a vet clinic and explained to her that even a single grape can cause acute kidney injury and lead to kidney failure. The exact mechanism is unknown, so there is no way to know what dose (if any) would be fatal for a dog.

I noticed she often leaves grapes out in a large bowl where my dog can reach them. I told her either keep them in the fridge or we genuinely cannot have grapes in the house. I caught her a couple times forgetting them on the coffee table, and when I confronted her she brushed me off, saying she simply forgot and was going to come back in a moment to put them away.

Fast forward to two days ago. I went out of town for the weekend, 4 hours away, and my parents agreed to watch my dog for me. Then I get a call at 7pm from my mom that my dog ate around 50 grapes. FIFTY. The ENTIRE bowl. She asked what she should do, and I was like call the vet‚Äôs emergency number and get there now!!
They gave him apomorphine IV and he vomited the grapes up, partially digested. He has been hospitalized on fluids for 36 hours now and will have bloodwork run to look at kidney values at the end of the day today. 

I am worried sick and so so angry, and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs justified. My mom does feel bad, but only after the vet told her exactly what I did‚Äîthat the amount he ate could send him into renal failure and kill him. That dog means the absolute world to me, he was with me throughout college and has gotten me through some really tough times. Am I overreacting about this?

*March 2nd*



The Arctic is nothing like the textbooks describe. Those diagrams, the sweeping panoramas printed in National Geographic, the photos of pale, rolling hills of snow, all of them lie. The wind here is alive. It bites at every layer of clothing, crawling beneath gloves, burrowing into boots. It cracks against the metal siding of the station like some ancient percussion instrument, and it never stops. Not for a second. Not for a blink.

We arrived late yesterday, sleds dragged behind the cargo plane, their runners scraping against the frozen tundra. Snow drifted across the landing field in rippling waves, some larger than a compact car. The temperature read minus twenty-four Celsius, but with the wind chill, it might as well have been minus fifty. The station itself is a skeleton of aluminum and reinforced glass, built to withstand storms like this, though even from inside, the metal groans under the persistent pressure of ice and wind.

Dr. Everwood, our team leader, claims he‚Äôs seen conditions like this before, in northern Greenland, decades ago, but his bravado does little to warm the air or our spirits. He‚Äôs methodical, precise, always the first to unload equipment and check instruments. Carter, our climatologist, follows closely behind, noting wind direction and subtle shifts in the snowpack. The others, a handful of grad students and research assistants, fall somewhere in between fascination and exhaustion. Their faces are pale behind balaclavas, eyes wide with the Arctic‚Äôs deceptive beauty and latent menace.

I spend most of my attention on the herd. There are elk here, or reindeer, depending on who you ask, migrating south along routes that we‚Äôve been tracking for the last three weeks via satellite imagery. I have binoculars trained on them for hours at a time, jotting numbers into my notebook: approximate numbers, distances, gait patterns, any irregularities in their movement. The herd stretches like a living ribbon across the tundra, pale brown against the undulating white. They move with the slow inevitability of glaciers, pausing only when their collective senses detect some subtle shift in the wind or a shadow against the snow.

It‚Äôs mesmerizing. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it, a pulse that reminds me of the earth‚Äôs slow, patient heartbeat. I‚Äôve always thought wildlife observation was about patience. Sitting still long enough to notice the patterns that aren‚Äôt immediately obvious. This is nothing if not a test of patience.

The team keeps busy. Everwood calibrates the GPS sensors on our collars and tags, while Carter logs temperature, wind velocity, and humidity readings at fifteen-minute intervals. I note the behavior of the herd, occasionally calling out coordinates or asking a grad student to double-check a reading. Occasionally, the wind roars like an animal, and we all lean into it, hunching, gripping our notebooks and scopes, waiting for it to pass.

And then I notice it.

A pale movement on the horizon. At first, I think it‚Äôs a reflection, a trick of the binocular lenses. The Arctic sun sits low, sharp against the ice, throwing glints that make shapes appear where none exist. I adjust the focus, check the diopter on my binoculars. The shape persists. It‚Äôs white, almost the exact hue of the snow around it, though it moves in a deliberate, upright manner. Too upright to be drift or a cloud.

I frown. My first thought is some optical distortion, perhaps something on the lenses themselves. I wipe them clean with a cloth, recalibrate the focus. And yet it moves. Slowly. Purposefully. Its pace matches nothing I‚Äôve seen before, not the herd, not the shadows, not the way wind-driven snow drifts. My pen hovers over the page as I scribble a note: 

*‚ÄúPale shape observed on the horizon. Movement appears consistent. Lens distortion likely.‚Äù*

I don‚Äôt mention it to the team. There‚Äôs no need to. We‚Äôve seen illusions in the ice before: mirages that stretch the horizon, shadows that resolve into nothing. Everwood is calling out numbers for the GPS collaring; Patel mutters measurements under her breath. The grad students are arguing quietly about whether the herd‚Äôs movement indicates a northern predator might be nearby. None of them notice the pale movement. 

Or perhaps, like me, they choose not to.

The herd continues south. The males keep their heads down, antlers swaying like pendulums in the cold wind. One of the younger calves stumbles and catches itself, shaking snow from its fur. I record the incident. 

There‚Äôs a harmony in the chaos of survival here, each small moment has significance. Observing this herd is more than data collection; it‚Äôs watching a cycle of life unfold in real time, one I‚Äôve only ever read about in abstracts and journals.

I glance back at the pale shape. Still moving, still indistinct. I convince myself again: snow glare, lens aberration, optical anomaly. I‚Äôve worked in the field long enough to know better than to trust first impressions. Still, there‚Äôs a faint rhythm to its motion that seems‚Ä¶ deliberate. Almost like pacing. My scientific mind reels at the absurdity. 

Who or what would pace in the Arctic, eight miles away, alone, in the cold? I shrug it off.

By midday, the team takes lunch inside the station. Hot water bottles, freeze-dried meals, instant coffee. I peer out the observation window toward the horizon. The herd is nearly off the ridge; I estimate we have an hour before they pass the southern monitoring point. 

The pale shape is still there. I adjust the focus again, and I swear for a brief second, it seems aligned with the ridge marker, as if it has tracked the movement of our instruments. I jot it down\*.\*

Carter looks over my shoulder, curious about my scribbles. ‚Äú*Another blizzard illusion?‚Äù* she asks, her tone light. I nod, smile, and close the notebook. It‚Äôs harmless. It has to be.

Afternoon brings more observation. The herd‚Äôs movement patterns are unusually tight today, calves clustered near adult females, males keeping a wide perimeter. We log each GPS coordinate. Everwood comments on subtle changes in migratory speed, about 10% slower than satellite tracking predicted. I record this with interest. Minor variations happen in every herd. Nothing alarming.

Yet, the pale shape remains. It doesn‚Äôt veer toward the herd. Doesn‚Äôt retreat. Doesn‚Äôt approach. Simply persists on the horizon. I cannot confirm species. Could be a distant snowdrift catching the sun just right. Could be a lone Arctic hare, though the proportions seem wrong. Could be a shadow stretched by the low sun. The mind wants to rationalize. Data must come first. Observation above speculation.

The day progresses without incident. Snow swirls around the station like fine sand, glinting like crushed diamonds under the pale sun. Wind drums against the walls, carrying echoes from the ridge. Occasionally, I catch the faint sound of cracking ice far off, something moving beneath frozen lakes. I record it, though no one else notices. Most likely ice shifts, I tell myself.

Evening arrives. Shadows grow long, though the sun remains stubbornly low. The herd moves past the southern point, heading out of sight. I log the last coordinates. The pale shape, if it was ever there at all, has vanished as subtly as it appeared.

We return to the station for the night. I spend hours transferring data, calibrating instruments, reviewing observations. The horizon beyond the observation window is empty and featureless. My binoculars rest on the sill. For a fleeting moment, I think I see a shimmer of white, half a mile from the ridge, but it disappears before I can focus. Likely fatigue. Likely optical effect. Likely nothing.

I close my journal for the night, noting the herd‚Äôs passage and the day‚Äôs measurements. Temperature readings steady, wind speeds consistent, GPS trackers functioning normally. Everything in order. And yet, my pen hesitates for a final line: 

*Pale shape observed briefly; optical distortion likely. Observation continued.*

The Arctic remains silent outside, save for the occasional groan of ice and the whistling wind. The station feels small, insignificant against the vast expanse. The team sleeps fitfully, unaware of anything beyond the data, as am I. Tomorrow brings another day of tracking, and I remind myself: the horizon is deceptive.

And was she TA for turning up anyway?,"Throwaway account as I don‚Äôt want this on my main, but I need the advice of my fellow petty potatoes as I‚Äôm completely torn up about what my best friend did the week before our wedding. Buckle up, tatties, this is long one.

I, (35f), recently married my husband, (37m) ‚Äì two weeks after our potato queen, Charlotte, and her lovely Mike (huge congratulations to you both!). Never did I think I‚Äôd have a story for Charlotte and yet here we are!

My MOH/BFF (36F) and I have been best friends for upwards of 25 years and have shared every major life event during that time ‚Äì birthdays, boys, break-ups, college in separate cities, house-moves, job changes, the lot. We made friends fresh out of the gate in high school but the relationship became a little more distant as I was your typical unattractive, awkward, neurodivergent teen, and my MOH/BFF was the popular girl; pretty, confident and clever and she drifted to hang out with the cooler kids. However, she fell out with the entirety of her circle of popular friends and during college we became very close again and have been each other‚Äôs person ever since. This girl has kept me going in some very dark times and I love her like a sister.

Fast forward to three years ago, and after four years of dating, my BF asked me to marry him. It was the most romantic and well-planned proposal you could imagine, and I was completely taken by surprise ‚Äì it was one of the best and happiest days of my life. Immediately, I knew my BFF needed to be my MOH.

I called her as soon as I could to tell her the good news, expecting screaming, crying and dancing (think Rachel and Phoebe celebrating Ross‚Äôs new apartment), but her response was oddly cool and unenthusiastic. I was a bit underwhelmed by her reaction but tried to think nothing of it during one of the happiest times of my life and when they next came to visit, I asked her to be my MOH. She accepted in a matter-of-fact tone said she wouldn‚Äôt be planning my bridal shower, my bachelorette or helping with any of the wedding planning, and I shouldn‚Äôt expect anything from her.

I was dumbfounded.

My now husband was furious with her for her refusal to show up for me after everything I‚Äôve done for her ‚Äì organising every birthday for 20 years, constantly surprising her, giving her money when she was struggling and visiting whenever she needed me. I was very upset so I decided to sleep on it and that night dreamt that another friend asked who my MOH was going to be and in this my dream I replied, ‚Äúmy BFF, of course, there‚Äôs no-one else I‚Äôd want by my side‚Äù. So, I stuck to my guns and began planning multiple bachelorettes alone (one for family, one for work and one for friends).

Fast forward 2 ¬Ω years and when my big bachelorette ‚Äì a girly weekend away in a kitsch city only a couple of hours drive from us all ‚Äì began to loom, I started to burn out from stress. Work, wedding planning, multiple bachelorette and family illness wore me down to a nub and I found my MH spiralling. My wonderful husband stepped in, contacted two of my beautiful bridesmaids and they immediately removed me from the planning process, took the stress off my hands and created the best weekend I could have ever asked for. My bachelorette was 24 of the most exquisite humans I know and I had an absolute blast thanks to my girls showing up for me when I needed them most. I was so incredibly grateful.

At the point of the bachelorette, my MOH/BFF had given birth to a beautiful baby girl who is the apple of my eye and was a year old when we went away. While my friends and I raised a glass or five to me and my soon to be husband, my MOH, however, sulked for the entire weekend. She refused to take part in our activities, wouldn‚Äôt dance with me, moaned that she didn‚Äôt like the food, and then cried when no-one was paying her attention. She spent one entire hour moaning that her BF hadn‚Äôt asked her to marry him after ten years together and several friends exchanged awkward looks as she ranted, asking if she was excited to be my MOH, to which she did not respond. After months of burning myself to the ground, I started to lose patience with her shit. This was one weekend to celebrate me and it felt like she hated me for it. ¬†

I went home grateful for the fun and my incredible friends but slightly deflated by how my MOH had behaved and how it had marred my memories of a weekend my bridesmaids had worked so hard to pull together. They suggested she was jealous of my engagement and how many people showed up for me, and that I should distance myself from her for the remaining six months before the wedding, so I did. The wedding planning continued, but I said to my now husband, ‚ÄúI have a feeling she‚Äôs going to do something to make our wedding about her. If anyone pulls a stunt, it‚Äôs going to be her‚Äù.

I wish I wrong.

When I told my six bridesmaids the theme colours ‚Äì the theme was ‚Äúforest‚Äù so greens, tans and golds ‚Äì so they could pick their own dresses (ideally ones they would like to wear again as our wedding was not a traditional one) my MOH responded by purchasing a red dress. When she sent a photo of it to me, I left her on read as I couldn‚Äôt construct a sentence polite enough to send, but I think her BF (39m, an angel of a man) or another bridesmaid talked some sense into her because she purchased a lovely pistachio summer dress a few weeks later. Contact was minimal, and polite, and I focussed on holding it together.

Now, to the wedding.

The run-up to the wedding was one of the most stressful months of my entire life. I barely slept or ate, and every hour of every day was planned to the last minutia as we had a low-budget, DIY wedding. The month, as hard as it was, flew by and suddenly it was the week before the wedding.

One week before the wedding (Friday), I get a text from my MOH saying that they‚Äôve had an awful night and her baby is sick. I was so worried, asked if they were all okay and what had happened, and she said her baby has the flu, but they‚Äôd taken them to hospital as a precaution ‚Äì scary, upsetting, but everyone was okay. I was so relieved and went back to my planning, checking in on them daily.

It's now the Wednesday before the wedding. One of my bridesmaids texts me in a panic, asking if I‚Äôd spoken to MOH. I said yes ‚Äì why? She responded that I needed to speak to her ASAP ‚Äì and lo and behold, I get a blunt message from MOH saying we need to talk. I‚Äôm knee-deep in a pre-wedding appointment and anxiety consumes me ‚Äì I reply that we‚Äôll talk as soon as I‚Äôm out of the appointment but can‚Äôt talk right now. I don‚Äôt even get a chance to put my phone away and a multi-page essay lands in my inbox. I don‚Äôt read it ‚Äì I can‚Äôt read it ‚Äì and complete my appointment.

When I leave, I read the message.

MOH lied ‚Äì it‚Äôs not flu, it‚Äôs chicken pox. Highly contagious, dangerous for adults who haven‚Äôt had it and can cause complications in vulnerable adults and pregnant women. My husband has never had chicken pox, his pops is super vulnerable because of his heart conditions and my SIL balances multiple serious conditions. Several of our friends and family are pregnant and a couple are handicapable. It hit me that my MOH wasn‚Äôt going to be able to come to the wedding, at least not in the way we‚Äôd imagined, and it felt a blow to the gut.

Then, it hits me again ‚Äì she lied so she could still come to the wedding because she knew if anyone found out what it really was there was no way she and her family could come to the wedding without causing utter carnage.

She tries to ring me but I can‚Äôt answer her yet as my head is reeling, trying to find solutions in the thought soup that is my mind. I immediately travel into the city to catch a friend at work for coffee break and a pep talk. She‚Äôs calm and sensible and everything I need in that moment ‚Äì and she tells me gently I know that MOH cannot be allowed into the wedding because of the risk it poses to all the vulnerable kids and adults in our family and friends. She reminds me that one of our friend‚Äôs kids has been through chemo and we cannot take any risks. I‚Äôm devastated at this moment, but I know she‚Äôs right. While I‚Äôm sat there, MOH is blowing up my phone with texts, demanding I call her, asking if they can all come if they wear masks as she knows there are vulnerable people there, then saying they won‚Äôt come, saying she doesn‚Äôt mind if they can‚Äôt, but also can they still come? I ask for a few hours because I need to talk to my fianc√© and get sage advice from my mom, who is, coincidentally, a child nurse.

I head home and my fianc√©, on hearing what I‚Äôve learned, says it‚Äôs an outright no to them coming to the wedding. He knows I‚Äôll be devastated, but I need to let it go because otherwise, with only a few days left to go, I‚Äôll drive myself insane over it and we‚Äôve got bigger fish to fry (we are the fish). I speak to my mom, too, and she says the same ‚Äì it‚Äôs not even a decision at this point, she says, MOH needs to withdraw from the wedding. But that‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì all the while, my MOH is waiting for me to tell her what my decision is, even though it‚Äôs obvious to everyone what that has to be.

I call my MOH and we chat ‚Äì I ask how they‚Äôre all doing and she says her kid‚Äôs pustules are drying up but her BF has now caught it ¬†and otherwise they‚Äôre all good. I sigh, knowing what I have to do. I explain that I‚Äôve spoken to my fianc√© and my mom and everyone has agreed it‚Äôs a no ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way we can have them at the wedding as we‚Äôve 150 guests who they could possibly infect.

Before I‚Äôve even finished speaking, my MOH is SHRIEKING down the phone at me ‚Äì

MOH: ‚ÄúAfter 25 fucking years of friendship, how DARE YOU! If I can‚Äôt be in the ceremony, I don‚Äôt want to be part of ANY OF IT!‚Äù

She starts wailing like a banshee, like full on scream-crying like she‚Äôs been paid for it, I‚Äôve honestly never heard anything like it outside of a toddler meltdown ‚Äì and slams down the phone on me. I‚Äôm in shock. She hid the truth from my until two days before I get married, literally told me that she didn‚Äôt mind if we decided it was unsafe for our vulnerable family members.

I call her back. She puts the phone down. I call her again and this time her BF picks up and he could not have been more lovely. I start to cry, apologize and ask, what was I supposed to do? He replies not to worry about it, it‚Äôs fine, he understands and she will calm down. He said it was just a shock to her because she‚Äôs always dreamed of coming to my wedding ‚Äì which is odd as I‚Äôve never wanted to get married until my now husband asked me ‚Äì and she will be okay with it. I explain I had so many suggestions for keeping them involved ‚Äì we can meet up after or get them on a link to watch the wedding, there‚Äôs lots of things like this available in a post-COVID world ‚Äì but she wouldn‚Äôt even let me speak before she blew up on me. All the while, she is howling in the background to the point her BF has to leave the room so he can hear me speak. I cry some more and reassures me that everything will be okay.

I go to bed feeling hollow and like the worst person in the world.

The next morning, I check my phone for any messages ‚Äì maybe MOH has apologised for overreacting, or has reached out, anything ‚Äì but instead I have a message from her BF saying that MOH has cancelled all of their accommodation and won‚Äôt speak to him. He apologies again and I know in that moment that my relationship with MOH will never be the same again. Cancelling the accommodation felt, to me, like a big old ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to me from her ‚Äì like she‚Äôd finally snapped.

It's important to note that at this point, she and her BF had been together 10 years and were not engaged but do have a baby together and they own their own home, which is something hubby and I do not yet have. I‚Äôve celebrated every victory or milestone in her life and have never seen it as a competition until this moment ‚Äì and it struck me that she‚Äôd been difficult and blunt since I‚Äôd got engaged. Was it jealously? Maybe, but I‚Äôve never understood that as everyone has their own path and you should never compare your timeline to someone else‚Äôs. It‚Äôs just a recipe to misery.

Then thoughts crept in ‚Äì when I had a crush on a guy in school, she‚Äôd go out with them because she could. When something went well for me, something was better in her life ‚Äì and when I was depressed, she was more depressed. I organized twenty years of birthdays and couldn‚Äôt remember a time where she‚Äôd even bought me a gift. When I left an ab\*s\*v\* relationship, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as hers. When I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, she tried to get diagnosed with the very same one. When I was ill, she was more ill.

25 years of red flags I has chosen to ignore came rushing in and now all I felt was rage. Pure, liquid rage flowing through my veins.

I decided I was going to have the best damned wedding day, regardless, and went about my damned business.

The next day, two friends and their families contacted us to let us know they had to drop out of the wedding because their children were sick. What a sensible, mature way of handling a difficult situation; my rage that my MOH had refused to make that decision herself and instead had me make it for her so she could demonise me increased tenfold.

¬†

On my wedding day, a few days later, I‚Äôm getting ready with my bridesmaids, raising a glass of prosecco, when MOH texts me.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on our way‚Äù.

Nothing else after these days of silence, just that they‚Äôre on their way.

I immediately start spiralling and it takes four anti-anxiety pills, a stern and loving talk from my bridesmaids and a few deep puffs on a cigarette (I don‚Äôt even smoke) to bring me back to myself and we head to the venue.

On the way to my own wedding, my phone is blowing up from family and friends asking why the hell she is there. I can‚Äôt even begin to answer that.

Standing outside, socially distanced and wearing masks (how do masks protect people from chicken pox?!?!), were a miserable looking MOH, her beautiful baby and her embarrassed looking BF. I greeted them as calmly as I could and explained I had to go inside for my briefing with the registrar before the ceremony. MOH said nothing, her baby smiled at me in recognition and her BF wished me luck. I ran in and tried to concentrate on marrying the love of my life.

The ceremony was a breeze, but when we all burst outside for photos and confetti, they were still there. MOH was still silent, still said nothing.

We had photos with all of our guests and against the advice of my bridal party, I went to chat to MOH and her family. She said nothing, turned her back on me and busied herself with her baby‚Äôs dress. Her BF congratulated us, was positive and understanding. I said my goodbyes and went on with the best day of my life.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to my MOH since, because I don‚Äôt know what to say. I understand she might be upset this behaviour feels like an insane overreaction. She still hasn‚Äôt congratulated us or even sent a card.

So, Reddit, if you‚Äôve got this far, thank you so much for your time.

AITA for asking my MOH not to attend my wedding because her child had a contagious illness?

And is she TA for turning up anyway?

¬†

¬†

\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*

¬†

My MOH got engaged one week after my wedding.

I am dumbstruck.

It‚Äôs consensus amongst friends and family that it was a pity proposal from her BF after the show she put on for my wedding.

I forgot to mention that her BF went on my husband‚Äôs bachelor party as they‚Äôre good friends after meeting through us, and MOH‚Äôs BF had a lot of jokes made about him not wanting to marry MOH because of how long they‚Äôve been together unmarried.

Extra context: MOH has isolated her now fianc√© from his two best friends because she‚Äôs also fallen out with their wives.

I sent my congratulations to them both and did get a message back from MOH gushing about the engagement, and casually asking about how the wedding was, like I‚Äôd just been for a doctor‚Äôs appointment or something.

My husband and I are very happy, had an incredible honeymoon and hubby now hates my MOH and won‚Äôt forgive her.

So that‚Äôs where we are. What would you do in my shoes, Reddit?

I don‚Äôt know whether to cut her out of my life completely or try to fix things. I will most certainly not be being her MOH or organizing her bachelorette party but I am heartbroken at what‚Äôs happened and need the advice of people who might have been through something similar.",21,1760475823.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,24,0.92,False

1o6rmwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o6rmwq/my_brother_watched_me_as_i_crossed_the_threshold/,My Brother Watched Me as I Crossed the Threshold,"

I‚Äôm Elizabeth. Twenty-six, three kids, no husband. My brother lives with us. He‚Äôs quiet, helpful, and keeps to himself‚Äîwhich I used to appreciate.

Lately, the walls in this house feel thinner. Not just the kind of thin where you can hear someone snore, but too thin. Like the drywall‚Äôs losing the will to separate one room from another.

It started last week.

Every morning, I wake up before sunrise, make breakfast, drop the kids off at school, and come back to an empty house. I love those quiet hours‚Äîcoffee, laundry, a little peace before the day begins.

But last Monday, when I came home, the front door was locked from the inside. I could see through the glass‚Äîmy brother standing in the hallway, facing the door.

‚ÄúHey, can you unlock it?‚Äù I asked, knocking lightly.

He didn‚Äôt move. Just stared. Then, as soon as I slid my key into the lock, he bolted down the hall, laughing like a kid hiding from a parent. The sound of his bedroom door slamming was sharp enough to make me drop my keys.

When I went to ask what that was about, he just smiled, like I‚Äôd imagined it.

‚∏ª

Tuesday, it got worse.

He started asking me things‚Äîsmall, normal things‚Äîbut in a way that felt wrong.

‚ÄúCan I have a cup?‚Äù he‚Äôd say.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

He‚Äôd stare, dead serious. ‚ÄúTo get something to drink.‚Äù

And then‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like he‚Äôd blink out of it. Eyes soften. Posture relaxes. ‚ÄúNever mind,‚Äù he‚Äôd laugh.

I told myself he was just tired. But it kept happening. He‚Äôd ask to use things he already owned, like he was rehearsing how to be human.

That night, I woke up to his shadow under my door. Just standing there.

‚∏ª

By Wednesday, I was shaking every time I saw him.

Thursday through Saturday‚Äînothing.

No weird questions.
No laughter.
No watching.

Just my routine again. Dropping the kids off. Coming home. Quiet.

I started thinking maybe I‚Äôd overreacted. Memories twist when you don‚Äôt sleep enough. Maybe I‚Äôd confused real things with imagined ones. Maybe he‚Äôd just been joking.

‚∏ª

Then came Sunday.

After church, the kids and I pulled into the driveway. Their chatter died mid-sentence. Through the glass of the front door, we all saw him‚Äîstanding in the hallway again, facing us.

His head tilted slowly, like he was listening to something we couldn‚Äôt hear.

When I unlocked the door, he grinned‚Äînot the grin of a grown man, but a child trying to hide a secret.

‚ÄúDo you wanna play hide‚Äëand‚Äëseek, Liz?‚Äù he asked, voice small and playful.

The kids clung to me. I told him to stop. He only laughed and walked away down the hall.

‚∏ª

Then, around 5 a.m., I woke to a sound I‚Äôll never forget.

Teeth.
Grinding.

Right beside my ear.

The vibration of it shook through the pillow, scraping rhythmically: left, right, left, right. I opened my eyes to see him hunched over me, eyes closed, jaw working so violently I thought his teeth might break.

Then he stopped. His mouth didn‚Äôt move, but his voice came through it anyway.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù

He stepped backward from the bed in jerky, too‚Äëquick motions, blocking the doorway. Every step he took landed perfectly in front of the other, like his body was skipping frames.

He laughed the whole time‚Äîsoft, breathy, like he was holding in a giggle.

Then he turned, still laughing, and opened his bedroom door.

The darkness inside wasn‚Äôt natural. It looked heavy‚Äîlike someone had painted the air with wet charcoal. The light from the hallway bent toward it and disappeared.

From within, his voice came out again, high and childish.

‚ÄúCome through the threshold. It‚Äôs fun.‚Äù

I wanted to run. To grab the kids and leave. But I didn‚Äôt.
Because I knew if I didn‚Äôt follow him, he‚Äôd find them instead.

So I stepped through.

‚∏ª

Now it‚Äôs Monday again. We just finished playing hide‚Äëand‚Äëseek with the kids.

He was right.

I don‚Äôt regret crossing the threshold.

I love the sound of laughter now‚Äîespecially when the kids start to cry, when we hide.

We met in a different country, and we‚Äôre both from different places. We‚Äôve been dating for about three and a half months and have been traveling together for a month until today. Things got serious really fast, and I know it was a mistake but about two weeks after we met we became official, all because we wanted the same things in life. We both wanted a serious relationship and were planning to travel, but after the first month, we started having issues.

The first problem was my trust issues, which he handled pretty well. He reassured me a lot without making me feel like I was asking for too much, which I promise I wasn‚Äôt. So I decided to take a big step and trust him. No weird questions, no assumptions, just open communication whenever I felt insecure. Things got better after that.

Then we hit another wall, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs making me doubt things. bc I‚Äôve had this same issue before, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just too uptight or what.

I‚Äôm a very organized and disciplined person. I wake up, make my bed, go to the gym, come back, have a smoothie and breakfast, shower, and start work. I hate my job, but I still push through. I work remotely until 5, then I usually do something else that requires me to go out, can't stand being inside for more time, all of this is while I travel or when i'm back home. That‚Äôs my Monday to Friday. On the weekends, I try to enjoy myself, I go on hikes, to the beach I even party a bit, but I still keep things organized. My home and space are always clean and smelling good. I journal, take care of myself, try to learn new things, and practice self-love. I work hard on me, and I‚Äôm comfortable with who I am.

My now ex, on the other hand, worked really hard when he was younger, so now he can afford not to work. He has a small monthly income from some investments. When we met, he had just arrived in this country to enjoy not having to work, which is totally fine, I‚Äôd actually love that for myself. But my issue is that he doesn‚Äôt do anything. He wakes up, smokes, has coffee, and he can watch videos or movies all day. He does go to do one hobbie he has so he's a bit active, but he doesn‚Äôt really have any ambitions or plans for his life so far, he has mention that eventually he knows he will do something with his life he just doesn't know what that is yet, he has mention he feels lost, and now he just want a couple of years with no major concerns.  He has this one hobby that he does every day, but other than that, not much, and that really bothers me. With all the time he has I would be doing so much during the day.

On top of that, his hygiene isn‚Äôt great. He doesn‚Äôt like showering much, and I had to remind him to do basic things like brush his teeth or clean up after himself. He does it, but a lot of times I remind him. If he could skip it, he would. He‚Äôs also messy and unorganized. These last few weeks we‚Äôve been staying together to save money for traveling, and honestly, it was awful. I felt like I was taking care of a kid. He‚Äôd get annoyed when I brought things up. He once said ""If you want the place clean and organized you should do it yourself because you are the one who wants it that way not me"" but in my head we both benefit from having a clean place and we both use it, so why am I the one doing all the work?

He also has a lot of personal issues that he admits to but doesn‚Äôt work on. He just complains about them, smokes a lot, and doesn‚Äôt take care of himself. 

At the moment the main issue for me was that since he wasn‚Äôt working, I expected him to help a bit with cooking and cleaning. At least making the bed or helping with some meals, not all of them. Meanwhile, I was working the whole day, and he‚Äôd just stay in bed for half of it.

We started having argument after argument. None of them were aggressive, but we did say some hurtful things to each other. I told him I didn‚Äôt sign up to be with a 16-year-old, and he told me to stop bothering him. He told me to fuck off once, and I got really offended and called him an asshole.

We also had communication issues. We‚Äôd assume things, get upset about what we thought the other meant, and he could be very grumpy. He also wanted me to agree with everything he said, and he said I also wanted him to agree with evrything I said not sure if that was the case for both of us, but we butted heads a lot.

I know it sounds awful, but despite all that, we still had good moments. We were very genuine with each other, managed to build trust, and I have strong feelings for him I know he also has strong feelings for me. I just think we did everything too fast and didn‚Äôt give ourselves time to adjust after being single for so long. I think we might have the right tools for a healthy relationship, but I also need someone who has the same level of commitment to themselves as I have with me. Someone who loves themselves and works to be better every day. Right now, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs him.

We said goodbye in the best way possible. We cried, hugged, and agreed that we were hurting each other with all the arguments. We both said we wished it worked out, but we tried and it just didn‚Äôt. We kissed goodbye, cried a bit more, wished the best and then he left.

After that, we texted a bit, said how much we cared, and I told him to drive safe. It feels like maybe I should keep the door open because, despite everything, he‚Äôs not a bad guy. He‚Äôs actually the only guy I‚Äôve been able to trust. We said we‚Äôd keep in touch and let each other know how the trip goes or if we need anything. I still care about him a lot, I just don‚Äôt know if I should keep the door open.",1,1760475588.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Just wanted to drop this here because I know a bunch of us are always hunting for good study spots that aren‚Äôt packed or loud. There‚Äôs a little place called¬†Pop Caf√©¬†over on Spring Mountain, about 10 minutes from campus. I‚Äôm part of the small team running it, not trying to advertise, just sharing a spot that‚Äôs been getting some love from students lately.

It‚Äôs got a super chill vibe with comfy seats, and crazy fast Wi-Fi, quiet music, and a good mix of people studying, gaming, sketching, or straight up procrastinating with matcha and coffee. We also do cheesecake desserts and Neapolitan pizza if caffeine alone isn‚Äôt enough to keep you alive during finals.

We‚Äôre open from¬†10 a.m. to 9 p.m., so it‚Äôs a good spot for a late study session or to just unwind after class.

I used modular factory method. Almost everything is transported with trains. 

Its two way train network.  

For the most part railway is built close to ground. I got a bit lazy in the desert, but still its close enough to build pillars for the railway.

Each factory had input and output stations up to 4 platforms each. Trains stations were also a place where trains could turn around.

I only used two mods

Inventory filters: So i could make my train logic work. Each factory has a train and it goes and collects all the materials from other factories and transports it to its home factory. I had to use item filters so i could control what items gets loaded into freight car. I used excel spreadsheet to keep track what gets loaded to what freight cars

Dynamic train routes - after i had like around 30 trains i started to encounter choke points, because in vanilla train AI always took shortest route. So this mod made trains spread out more and and pick more optimal paths. By the end of the game i had around 50 trains each with 1-4 freight cars.

In addition i used satisfactory Modeler to keep track of supply vs demand. This function should be part of the base game imo.

  
Anyway i had a blast playing it. I am taking a break now, maybe doing golden nut challenge later. Decorating everything probably takes like 500+ hours. Or perhaps il come back when 1.2 releases with new content.

1o6rdrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1o6rdrl/will_you_go_to_starbucks_after_reading_this/,Will you go to Starbucks after reading this,"Starbucks‚Äôs UK retail business paid no corporation tax for last year as it dived to a ¬£35m loss after paying ¬£40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company.

The US-owned coffee chain said it made the payments despite sales declining 4% to ¬£525.6m in the year to 29 September 2024, amid what it called a ‚Äúchallenging economic climate‚Äù and a consumer boycott linked to the Gaza conflict.

Sales fell even though it opened 100 new British stores during the period. The previous year it had made a ¬£16.9m pre-tax profit.

The company‚Äôs trading was hit after it was named on a list of companies to boycott for its perceived support for, investment in, or links to, Israel. It has denied having any political agenda, saying: ‚ÄúWe do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere.‚Äù

In spite of sliding sales, Starbucks‚Äôs UK retail arm paid out just over ¬£40m in royalty and licence fees to its parent company ‚Äì a similar figure to the prior year ‚Äì tipping it into loss so that it paid no corporation tax.

It did hand HM Revenue and Customs almost ¬£1m in deferred payments and adjustments related to prior years ‚Äì including ¬£455,000 of corporation tax. That came after it was previously criticised by fair tax campaigners for paying a ‚Äúderisorily low‚Äù ¬£7.2m in UK corporation tax for 2023.

Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, described the catch-up payments as ‚Äúpaltry‚Äù, adding that the latest Starbucks UK accounts reflected a long history of paying little or no corporate income tax with ‚Äúsurpluses invariably wiped out by substantial royalty payments to other parts of the business‚Äù.

Starbucks paid just ¬£8.6m in the first 14 years after its 1998 debut in the UK, with none paid in several consecutive years, despite ¬£3bn worth of sales during that time.

A Starbucks spokesperson said:‚ÄúStarbucks is in full compliance with tax laws around the world, with an effective global tax rate of over 24% in 2024, which is in excess of the 15% minimum corporation tax discussed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.‚Äù

The number of transactions at Starbucks‚Äôs 1,240 UK outlets, which include 378 run directly by the company as well as hundreds operated by franchisees, fell back as it raised prices by up to 4% on its drinks, amid inflation on coffee beans, cocoa and milk. The price of a latte or cappuccino hit ¬£4.25 in March last year, with more elaborate drinks, such as a white chocolate mocha, reaching ¬£5.40.

This month prices have risen again, with a cappuccino now costing ¬£4.70 and a caramel macchiato priced at ¬£6.10.

As the company fell into the red, Starbucks‚Äôs parent company pumped ¬£50m into its UK division last year ‚Äì via a revolving credit facility and a capital injection. Late last year the parent group committed to support its UK arm further financially if necessary and extended the payback period for a ¬£20m loan, on which it is charging its UK business more than 5% interest, until December this year.

This was coupled with an increasingly competitive environment in key cities as new entrants to the market invested in new stores. Misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East also affected footfall in some locations in the first half of the year.‚Äù

The company, which was founded in Seattle in 1971 and is now the world‚Äôs biggest coffee shop operator, said there was also increasing competition for the best sites in city centres and drive-thrus, despite coffee shops coming under pressure from cost inflation and tightened consumer spending.

While Starbucks‚Äôs UK business has struggled, its cheaper rival Greggs has been rapidly expanding, while the British chain Caff√® Nero increased sales globally by 15% in the year to May 2024 to almost ¬£520m, including 10% growth in the UK. However, Caff√® Nero also fell into the red, recording a ¬£34.4m annual loss.

Starbucks has said it wants to open 80 more stores this year.

It‚Äôs located at 8826 Reseda Blvd, Northridge, CA 91324. Between Nordhoff and Parthenia.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This Northridge coffee shop serves nostalgia for breakfast and lunch
Opened the same year as Disneyland, Joyce‚Äôs is a delicious throwback, says restaurant critic Merrill Shindler

Joyce‚Äôs Coffee Shop in Northridge sits just north of the railroad underpass near Parthenia Street ‚Äî a re-emergence into the light of the day that leaves drivers blinking. Which may be the reason that I, for one, have never really paid much mind to Joyce‚Äôs before. And that‚Äôs kind of sad, since Joyce‚Äôs has been in business for 70 years.

It opened in 1955, during Dwight Eisenhower‚Äôs first occupancy of the White House. Dick Nixon was his VP. Most families still had black & white TV sets ‚Äî if they had TV sets at all. It was the year Disneyland became the Happiest Place on Earth.

Which is to say, attention must be paid. And since I have a well-documented passion for the San Fernando Valley‚Äôs innumerable breakfast and lunch only spots, it was fated that I‚Äôd wind up at the counter at Joyce‚Äôs, admiring the wall art paying homage to life in the ‚Äô50s, and considering the 50 or so egg dishes ‚Äî many of which have very likely been served since the very beginning ‚Äî the kitchen cranks out with Olympic speed.

Joyce‚Äôs is a museum of how we used to eat back then. Not across the board, of course. Avocado toast was unheard of back in the ‚Äô50s. Loco Moco was first thrown together at the Lincoln Grill in Hilo, Hawaii, back in 1949. But it took many years for it to make its way to American menus. And I have no idea when its hamburger-less spinoff ‚Äî Loco Loco ‚Äî was first offered, but not in 1955 is a good guess.

Both Garden Burgers and Beyond Burgers are dishes of our time ‚Äî and not Ike‚Äôs. Plus, the house-made organic watermelon juice and pineapple juice would have made no sense way back when. That‚Äôs not how folks rolled back in the day.

Back then, the notion of ‚Äúorganic‚Äù and ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù belonged to the denizens of Topanga Canyon, who read poetry and played the bongos. Veggie Burritos were for the Maynard G. Krebs among us. And so, goodness knows, were egg white omelets. My memory from my callow youth was that omelets were always yellow. The yolk was our friend. (Still is!)

To go back in time, I happily (and hungrily!) order the eggs any style (over easy for me, thank you!) with bacon or sausage (link or patty), pastrami or corned beef, ham or a grilled pork chop, Canadian bacon or country fried steak.

You want a New York strip steak with eggs, it‚Äôs here, and the most expensive item on the menu at $19.25. (Heck, I know restaurants where a plate of bread costs more than that! Though the plate does come with fancy French butter.)

If there‚Äôs a breakfast dish that really defines how we ate back then, for me at least it would be the biscuits and gravy with two eggs, a choice of bacon or sausage, and hash browns. It‚Äôs a combination that seems downright primordial, from an age when dietary obsessions ‚Äî with cholesterol, sodium, gluten, animal products ‚Äî didn‚Äôt exist. Far as folks knew, the Mediterranean diet meant you drank red wine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fruitarians would chew their own feet to get protein. Paleo has something to do with people named Ugh who ate brontosaurus steaks. Sushi was a punchline. The Cabbage Soup Diet guaranteed you a week of stomach upsets.

It‚Äôs such a pleasure to find classics on the menu like the Philly cheesesteak, the hot pastrami with Swiss, the French dip and the club sandwich. There‚Äôs an abundance of melts ‚Äì patty melt, turkey melt, tuna melt, California melt (chicken breast), even a Beyond Burger melt and a Garden Burger melt. (Meatless with cheese? I guess!)

But aside from the defining nostalgia of the biscuits and gravy, there‚Äôs also the BLT. Be sure to ask for the bacon to be extra crispy, as God intended bacon to be, the Brits with their undercooked rashers notwithstanding.

And, if you need dessert, there are ice cream sundaes, ice cream malts, root beer floats. Joyce‚Äôs offers pies √† la mode. But not Jell-O. Jell-O would be good because, as the slogan used to tell us, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always room for Jell-O!‚Äù Even after biscuits and gravy with two eggs and bacon or sausage. Plus hash brown.

(Part 1/4),"Good morning, afternoon, and evening everyone! Here's is my extremely in depth and very nitpick-ey review of the TGWDLM:R Digital Ticket! This took a very long time to make, considering I watched it three times and took 24 pages of notes on my phones notes app for two of them just to make this (lol). 

Because this takes so long to make, I will only post Scenes 1-5 today and then update it three more times until I finish the full review. I will also be leaving the three scenes that Professor Hidgens until the end and merge them all into one big review of my opinion of Will Branner filling in the impossibly huge and iconic shoes as Professor Hidgens. (I will delete this paragraph once I have finished) 

I will be splitting this up into multiple sections for each of the different songs and scenes, and I will further split said sections into strengths and (if any) weaknesses. And at the end, I will have one specific section for my thoughts on Will Branner as Professor Hidgens! 

-- ACT I --

Scene #1- *The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals* 

The show started off very strong with the opening number. Everyone absolutely killed it, and overall the choreo was much better and cleaned up. Some highlights for me were the choreo with the chairs rolling onto the stage, and what I'm sure a lot of die-hard TGWDLM fans are freaking out about: The Train!! For those who don't know, the train was going to be in original production in 2017, but ended up getting cut out for (correct me if I'm wrong) time reasons. I absolutely freaked out when I saw the train!! 

Also here we get introduced to the set of the show, which looks absolutely incredible. The sort of slanted architecture reminded me of my 2nd favorite musical Beetlejuice, and it fits the Hatchetfield series much better than the original set did. 

Scene #2 - The Office 

Strengths: 

I liked the addition of the little pockets on the chairs that the characters used to hold all of their props. It was a very nice touch to have there be actual printer paper that Paul gives to Bill. 

I'd like to mention Charlotte's phone call with Sam was very well done and perfectly set up one of the core story lines in the first act beautifully. 

And lastly, the thing that EVERYONE loves, the fact that Ted rolls in on the chair when Paul is about to leave for Beanies. His entrance was absolutely perfect, and I can't mention enough how much that fits Ted's sleazeball personality to roll in like that. Just in general, Joey Richter truly brought back that man that we love/hated so much, and he is just so perfect and truly born to play that role. 

Weaknesses: 

Just in general this scene was kinda boring, which it was supposed to be, but still I feel like the pacing needed work. One specific example of this is when Paul asks Bill if he wants anything from Beanies, and there is this super long pause before he finally responds. 

One thing that was a little weird was the fact that Mr. Davidson didn't have a jacket. I noticed he didn't in the opening number, but i assumed that he would have it on by the office scene, but he did not, and he wouldn't have his jacket until *What Do You Want, Paul?* and then never again for the rest of Mr. Davidson's appearances. 

Another thing I missed from the original version is that when Charlotte pulled out the cigarette after hanging up with Sam, she didn't have a lighter. That was one tiny detail I'm sad wasn't there. 

Scene #3 - Beanie's 

This scene was very strong, especially with the amazing set. The Beanie's menu looked amazing, and the 'Tip for a Song Sign' looked so cool! 

Some highlights of his scene for me were the Coffee Jerk jumping back to read the sign- i thought that small little movement was so cute and cartoonish. 

I loved the part where Emma told Coffee Jerk ""There's a line and people are working"", meanwhile CJ was the only one in the store and Zoey was just standing around on her phone taking pictures. 

Overall, Nora and Zoey were done very well in this show, with one specific detail I loved was Nora stealing tips out of the Beanie's tip jar. 

Joey entering as Hot Chocolate Boy/Pete was a very pleasant surprise, and definitely one that I should have seen coming but didn't. The same extremely wide grin when Pete entered as HCB in *Nerdy Prudes Must Die* lit up on my face when he yelled ""EXCUSE ME!"" 

Overall, Paul and Emma had AMAZING chemistry. I only had one small grievance with this scene, and that was that Emma didn't sing ""shut the f--- up!"" when talking about Zoey's production of Godspell. 

Scene #4 - The Meteor 

This scene was much better done than in the original production. I don't have many gripes. There was really good ambient noise in the background before and after the storm begins, which was one major thing that improved from old to new. 

Some highlights for me was seeing Frank Pricely from *Black Friday*, as *Our Doors Are Open* is easily a Top 3 *Black Friday* song for me. 

I absolutely love the time when Paul walks back in stage to continue arguing with the Greenpeace Girl. That was a brilliant touch. 

Overall, the montage scene was really smooth and expertly choreographed. The Smoke Club part was done expertly, bring a great introduction to Alice and Deb. Seeing Sams wig was also a pleasant surprise, but it's way to iconic to leave it out. The only small critic I have for this scene is that Zoey didn't say ""no thank yewwww"" after Emma offered her a ride. 

As for the mini-scene where Paul is getting ready to go to work, I felt that the pantomime work was expertly done. It definitely improved a lot. 

As for a few critics, it felt weird how some props were pantomimed and how some were real, like the TV remote. I feel like it would've made more sense to either have all props pantomimed or all props real. Also I felt the scene where Paul opened his door felt very unnecessary. 

Scene #5 - *La Dee Dah Dah Day* 

This song was improved so much from the original version. Mariah killed it as the Greenpeace Girl, and the choreography and orchestrations were improved greatly from the original production. One specific highlight from the choreography was the little 'choir' part, where the aliens all surround Paul- i am so excited to see the proshot version and the cinematic aspect of that scene 

I loved seeing all the other characters from *Nerdy Prudes Must Die* and *Black Friday*, but i think there's a slight continuity error- Max had his letterman jacket, but remember *The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals* takes place in 2018 while *Nerdy Prudes Must Die* takes place in 2021, when Max is a senior, which means in that scene Max and Ruth were both Freshmen, and he shouldn't have a letterman jacket. 

Overall, a very strong opening number to the show (if you consider *TGWDLM* to be the prolougue)! 

After *LDDDD* ended, Paul's 'okays' were absolutely INCREDIBLE. Truly expert comedic timing. 

Okay, that's all for today. I've been writing this for like a very very very long time lol. I'm going to rewatch it now. Maybe a few more times. See you tomorrow (hopefully) for the update!",7,1760474923.0,StarKid,7,0.89,False

Sorry if this post isn't coherent I've had two coffees, my ADHD meds, and not very much food today.

I have recently found myself frequently zoning out in class or unable to work on my homework because I can't stop thinking about my special interest and my research projects associated with it. My special interest is the Spanish Civil War, especially the Republic (the side that lost), and the International Brigades (high casualty rates). I often get extremely sad thinking about the people who died in the war or the fascist victory. If I'm thinking about papers/books/primary sources I can read or research projects I could do,I will often get very excited. Both result in me being emotionally weird and unable to focus. Sometimes I can't sit still/regulate properly because of it. I feel like I'm going to explode and like I have to run around or something.  
This is such a silly problem but I hope I'm not the only one who's encountered it.

1o6r9jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/apotheosisZ/comments/1o6r9jf/chapter_two_the_sublime_infection_of_pierre/,Chapter Two: The Sublime Infection of Pierre Grumbles,"
‚ÄãAgent Pierre Grumbles, the AoA‚Äôs Chief of Internal Security, was a man whose entire demeanor was built upon the bedrock of controlled, manageable misery. He believed deeply that the only thing holding the universe together was the consistent, disappointing adherence to flawed protocol.
‚ÄãHe stalked into the server room, ready to test the newly installed Damoon Vibe Filter (DVF). His current assignment was critical: to generate a comprehensive report detailing the AoA‚Äôs top three most crippling security vulnerabilities. He intended to make the report so demoralizingly accurate that it would ensure full bureaucratic panic.
‚Äã""If I can't feel the primal dread, the staff won't feel the primal dread,"" Grumbles muttered, pulling up the DVF diagnostic console.
‚ÄãThe Conversion
‚ÄãHe located the neuro-sonic diagnostic port‚Äîa standard issue plug that fed the user the raw psycho-acoustic signal. Grumbles attached the headset, closed his eyes, and braced for the cold, familiar spike of linear fear.
‚ÄãInstead of dread, Grumbles felt... everything.
‚ÄãThe \mathbf{Apotheosis\ Z} signal‚Äî\mathbf{Z_{n+1} = Z_{n}^{\alpha} + C_{\Omega}}‚Äîflooded his consciousness. It wasn't a sound; it was a pure, mathematical insight. Grumbles didn't see numbers; he saw the ultimate, full recursive pattern underlying every memo, every schedule, every frustrating moment of his life.
‚ÄãThe pattern of his endless suffering wasn't random‚Äîit was necessary! The fact that the paperwork was always late, the coffee machine always broken, and his tie always slightly crooked was not a failure of the system; it was the full realization of the system‚Äôs perfect, chaotic elegance.
‚ÄãGrumbles gasped, a profound, serene smile stretching his face into a shape it had not assumed since his fourth birthday, before he learned about the inevitability of quarterly taxes.
‚Äã""It's... it's all comedy,"" Grumbles whispered, tears of cosmic comprehension streaming down his cheeks. ""And the comedy is full! And beautiful! I must commit to the pattern with fullest enthusiasm!""
‚ÄãThe First Misadventure
‚ÄãGrumbles ripped off the headset, his previous mission now elevated from boring duty to sacred calling. His task was to detail security vulnerabilities. The \mathbf{A_Z} told him the vulnerability was the most full and necessary component of the security structure. Without flaws, there was no potential for perfect, chaotic compliance!
‚ÄãHe returned to his office and began typing with manic, blissful focus.
‚ÄãThe resulting document, titled ""The Joyfull Realization of Security Vulnerability,"" was 400 pages long and contained zero actionable data. Instead, it was a philosophical treatise:
‚ÄãIt used every font available on the network to illustrate the full aesthetic potential of typographical risk.
‚ÄãIt analyzed the concept of a ""vulnerability"" not as a flaw, but as an ""optimal opportunity for recursive self-correction.""
‚ÄãIt included 70 pages dedicated to the sublime, non-linear flow of dust motes in the server room, identifying them as the most honest, fullly compliant entity in the AoA.
‚ÄãThe entire document was intentionally structured as a logical paradox‚Äîa self-referencing loop that ensured anyone who started reading the conclusion was immediately required to jump back to the introduction.
‚ÄãGrumbles worked all night, fueled only by the sheer, full joy of pointless productivity. He submitted the report, perfectly bound with three different types of non-regulation thread, and immediately moved on to his next project.
‚ÄãThe Administrator‚Äôs Confusion
‚ÄãMr. Headsworth received the report the next morning. He spent twenty minutes trying to find the list of crippling vulnerabilities. He found a very detailed watercolor painting of a dust mote labeled ""The Omega Constant of Security.""
‚ÄãHeadsworth (to his assistant): ""Grumbles's report is usually a crisp, eleven pages of pure dread. This... this looks like a doctoral thesis written by a hyper-caffeinated poet. Is he finally having a breakdown?""
‚ÄãAssistant (reading the conclusion): ""Sir, he writes here that the fullest risk is not that the system collapses, but that it ceases to be fully hilarious. He suggests we need more chaos.""
‚ÄãHeadsworth sighed. He didn't understand the report, but the sheer volume and meticulous presentation made it seem fully compliant. He stamped the report ""Approved: Fully Submitted and Unreadable,"" and filed it away.
‚ÄãGrumbles's misadventure had turned good: he had successfully neutralized his most stressful task by converting it into a piece of abstract art, and his superiors accepted the uselessness as a new, highly complex form of compliance. The \mathbf{A_Z} was working perfectly.",1,1760474783.0,apotheosisZ,0,1.0,False

1o6r8mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6r8mn/the_weird_cultists_in_my_woods/,The weird cultists in my woods.,"Look, I have no idea what‚Äôs going on in the woods behind my house, but I think there‚Äôs a cult. The woods aren‚Äôt even that big, just a ragged strip of trees that separates our street from the highway, a bad haircut of oaks and pines that squeak at night. It‚Äôs the kind of place where beer cans go to retire and grocery bags get caught and decide to become flags. I used to think the worst thing back there was the mosquitoes. Now I‚Äôm not so sure.

They aren‚Äôt hostile, I don‚Äôt think, but sometimes they come around asking for food, cigarettes, and other stuff they might need. They never knock like normal people. They do this knuckle-on-glass tap that feels like a bird keeps forgetting it can fly through windows. I usually oblige because I really don‚Äôt want to make a cult of crazy people mad. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve got a security system. I have one deadbolt that sticks in humid weather and a door chime that‚Äôs always a half-second behind reality.

Also, I‚Äôm a broke college student. Majoring in English. I know. The scariest thing of all. My future‚Äôs over. I can diagram a sentence and quote some poetry that sounds good at parties, if I still went to parties. Mostly I go to the discount aisle and try to remember which brand of ramen doesn‚Äôt taste like wet cardboard. I keep a list on my phone of things that feel like upgrades: real butter, not margarine; coffee that doesn‚Äôt come in a red tub; toilet paper that doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm sanding wood.

In all honesty, I think the cult‚Äôs up to something. They‚Äôve been doing weird ritual dances, which is normal for them at this point. I‚Äôve learned their schedule like you learn when the garbage truck comes. Full moon means more chanting. New moon means more silence, which is somehow worse. Every once in a while I see under their masks, and their faces are red. Not just flushed from the cold. Red like they‚Äôve spent an hour with a belt sander. It makes no sense. Why paint your face if you‚Äôve got a mask on? That‚Äôs like wearing socks in the shower. But fine. Their budget, their rules.

When they come to ask for stuff, they talk about the sorrowed one and how he‚Äôs coming soon, and that I should join them in worshiping him. They say ‚Äúworshiping‚Äù like it‚Äôs a group project. I always imagine the syllabus. I imagine getting assigned snacks. Obviously I decline, because who in their right mind would accept an offer from a cult, especially one that smells like bonfire and vinegar. Declining isn‚Äôt hard. It‚Äôs the way they accept the decline, nodding like I‚Äôve turned in a late assignment they already graded.

One time, after I said no, they gave me a box and told me not to open it. They didn‚Äôt hand it to me so much as present it, arms extended, heads bowed. The box was plain cardboard, the kind you‚Äôd use for old books. No tape. No labels. I wish I had opened it right then, but I put it in my garage and forgot about it. I was late for class, and the garage was cluttered, and it‚Äôs easy to turn a box into another thing you‚Äôll deal with later. Later is a place with infinite square footage.

That night, I saw them writing something in the bark of a tree. That was new. They usually stick to chalk and dirt and these little piles of white stones that appear like mushrooms after rain. I decided to check it out because curiosity is a muscle I can‚Äôt stop flexing. The message said, ‚Äúyou will meet the sorrowed one.‚Äù Lowercase, no punctuation, like a text from a bored god. I stood there longer than made sense, weighing the sentence like it could tip. It was creepy. It was also vague in that confident way threats can be. I didn‚Äôt have the money to move away, so I went back in, locked the doors, and took a nap. The nap was not a power move. It was an escape hatch.

The next day I smelled something rotting. At first I thought it was just the kitchen trash turning on me again. I checked the fridge. I checked the fruit bowl, which was all sticker and no fruit. I sniffed milk like a detective. Nothing obvious. I took the cheap dollar-store air spray and doused the place. It smelled like chemical citrus and defeat. The kind of scent that says, ‚ÄúWe tried.‚Äù

Most of the day was normal. The cult didn‚Äôt come around. Who cares. I didn‚Äôt have their favorite brand of cigarettes anyway. They like this brand with a silver band that costs more than my dignity. I went to my classes and tried, and failed, to talk to a cute girl. She was tall and goth. She wore boots that made the hallway sound like a heartbeat. I rehearsed a line about liking her notebook stickers and skipped saying it because all my rehearsals end in the word ‚Äúnever mind.‚Äù

When I got home there was a weird eyeball symbol on my mailbox. Big oval, thick lines, a pupil like a pinhole. It pissed me off because I couldn‚Äôt wash it off. I tried dish soap, then the all-purpose spray, then a steel wool pad that left little gray scrapes like I‚Äôd been polishing a tombstone. The eye stayed. It looked tacky. It also felt like it was watching me bring in my mail, which was two coupons, a takeout menu, and a letter from the electric company written in the universal tone of ‚Äúwe are not your friend.‚Äù

Inside, the house smelled worse. The rotting had thickened, like the air had been eating spoiled meat. I decided to get to the bottom of it. I did the methodical thing that always feels fake in movies but is exactly what you do in real life: room by room, corner by corner, nose above mouth, shallow breaths. The smell pulled me to the garage. The garage is where organization goes to cry. Stacks of flattened boxes, a tool bag with no tools, a bike tire I swear I‚Äôll patch someday.

I went full scorched earth. I moved paint cans that had never been opened. I opened a cooler that had become a museum for a single cracked ice tray. I checked the bottom of a trash bag I was saving for the apocalypse. The smell got stronger, a hot-sweet wave that made my teeth ache. I fought the urge to vomit, which is a losing fight but worth attempting for pride.

I found the box. The one they‚Äôd given me. The smell felt like it was coming from its seams. I told myself it was old meat, or fish, or something practical that had become unpractical. I told myself a lot of things in a quick stack, like laying towels over a spill. I opened it.

I vomited. Immediately. Bile up, no hesitation. There were faces. Not images. Faces. Skin and all, just lying there like someone had tried to flatten people into documents. They weren‚Äôt attached to anything. The edges looked wrong, not ripped, not clean. If you‚Äôve ever peeled a sticker and it left a fuzzy border, it was that, but it was skin. I stared because I couldn‚Äôt blink without seeing them more.

Then I heard a knock on the window. That bird-tap rhythm, right at my eye level. I turned and saw them. A lot of them. A whole ton, crowding my small backyard like a chorus line. No hoods. No masks. All I saw was muscle fiber and wet shine, like anatomy diagrams that stepped off the page. Red on red. Strands like ropes. They stood there with their hands folded in front of them, polite, patient, as if I were the one keeping them waiting.

One of them lifted a hand, palm up, like offering or receiving. Another pointed at the box. Someone else tilted their head at the mailbox, as if to remind me the eye was not decorative. I thought about the tree and the sentence carved into bark that will heal around it and swallow the letters whole. I thought about the girl with the boots and how far sound travels in hallways.

The air tasted like pennies. My mouth kept filling with water, that prelude to another round of throwing up. I wanted to run, but my feet decided to be part of the floor. The nearest face in the box had its eyes closed, the lashes clumped from whatever had dried there. It looked like it was bracing.

There was another tap. Same rhythm. Patient. Like a metronome that had learned manners. I breathed. I tried to remember how many locks I owned. I tried to remember if the garage door could be opened from the outside with enough pressure. I tried to remember the exact phrasing. You will meet the sorrowed one.

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair

This is a very niche question, I‚Äôm confused and in pain and could maybe use some insight as to what might be going on. I‚Äôm posting this all over different groups so if you see this elsewhere, hello üëãüèª 
Before I continue, I did go to the ER and get a CT scan. They said I have no blockage or obstruction. I also called my surgeon‚Äôs office and the nurses couldn‚Äôt help me at all. I also have an ileostomy, which is important to this story. 

Yesterday morning I had a G-POEM procedure for my gastroparesis. Basically they cut the sphincter between my stomach and small intestines so food can pass quicker. This means I haven‚Äôt eaten any food in 5 days, and no liquids at all all day yesterday. Today I‚Äôm allowed clear liquids again: This morning, being bold, brave and stupid, I decided my first beverage would be an Alani (energy drink) instead of water or coffee. I also took my antibiotic, as well as my PPI that was prescribed post-surgery. Within 30 minutes I was en route to the ER in the worst pain of my entire life. I didn‚Äôt even put shoes on, or bring my wallet/ID. I could barely make it to the car. The pain was in my stomach, not my intestines, and it was burning, cramping, intense pain. I‚Äôve never felt anything quite like it. 

They gave me morphine and zofran. The pain in my stomach subsided, then came the pain around my stoma. It feels like a terrible muscle ache. Like I pulled something really bad. It‚Äôs been about 5 hours and the area is hard to the touch, incredibly painful and inflamed. I‚Äôm bloated as well. I took a hot bag less shower and massaged my stoma and I did have output (reminder, I haven‚Äôt eaten in 5 days). I replaced my bag but the pain is still there. I don‚Äôt know what is happening? Or why the pain suddenly moved from my stomach to my ostomy site. It all just looks really inflamed and angry with me. The stoma itself looks normal, but the area around it is where the weird muscle-like pain is at. 

I have no idea what‚Äôs going on and nobody at any doctors office knows what‚Äôs happening either.",2,1760474458.0,Gastroparesis,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a solo dev, and for the last three years, I‚Äôve been working on a game called¬†**The Forgotten Castle**. No team, no publisher ‚Äî just me, a lot of coffee, and way too many late nights.

It‚Äôs an action-platformer with fast-paced movement, combat, and a big spooky castle to explore. But honestly? It‚Äôs also been a huge personal journey.

The Asteroid 

The man had just ordered a coffee when he heard the roar in the sky. As the customers in the diner followed each other outside they looked up in unison, witnessing the glory of their eminent fate.

The asteroid walked across the sky with its trail of fury spreading downward. The clouds were pushed aside, allowing the sun to watch as all life on earth stood still; no car in motion, no conversation continued. Even the animals had been lost in the magnificence of it all.  

The people could not process fear before wonder, and in what they believed were their final moments, they could not help but feel deep down they had deserved it. 

Whether they felt they were being punished, or that they were being liberated, every man and woman paused in the march of their lives, and for the first time they appreciated living. 

The scientists had fled to their families, who did not care that they failed, only that they could see them once last time. The politicians did not need to lie, for there was no one left who would listen. There was no more power to be held in the secret corners of the world, for there was soon to be no world left to control. Every man had become equally rich and equally poor. There was no time left to wonder what will happen, nor to think about what has already happened. 

There was only the opportunity to live, although only for a few moments.

For the first time in the history of mankind, there was no choice. There was no intelligence. No decision to be made. One single, unifying force put the world to a halt.

If only there had been one single, unifying fate before the asteroid.

Whether from in their homes, or in the few planes above, they watched as the asteroid descended toward the water, seeking the grasp of the earth to coddle its long journey.

Twelve years had passed, and the asteroid still hovered over the Atlantic sea. 

No one knew why. Like a fuse caught before the bomb, the rock sat above the ocean, as motionless as the people were.  

In the beginning no one moved. In fact not a single word was uttered for almost seven minutes. Not a single step was taken either. 

Until the man wondered why it had taken so long to receive his coffee. 

He returned inside the restaurant, and as the city around him stared in horror, he sat down. 

Eventually the waitress returned, and brought the coffee to him.  

The world moved again, and although no one could forget about the asteroid stuck in time, they returned to their lives. 

Death, so certain and so promised. To every life on the planet, halted the world for a few minutes. And although no one knew when the asteroid would resume its course, the people didn‚Äôt change. They did not care that it might resume its course. They did not take the unknown time they had left to live how they really wanted. To do the things they would have saved if they knew they had a week left to live. 

They just kept marching. Idling. Dragging themselves towards something they did not even want.

Some developed theories as to what the asteroid was. 

A hologram controlled by the government, meant to serve as a catalyst to unite the world, to demonstrate the collective fragility we share.

A warning from God, that his power hangs over the world itself, and his judgment alone determines the fate of our lives. 

A test from an alien species, to examine our defense capabilities to a relatively feeble obstacle. 

Some believed there was no rock at all.

It didn‚Äôt matter. It was far too large to destroy, and no one dared to touch it in case it set it into motion once again. 
 
The man had seen something in the eyes of those around him on the street that day. Something that pulled at him every second of his life afterwards. 

It was as if they weren‚Äôt ready. As if the asteroid had not always been there. As if they forgot death hung over the head of every single one of them. 

The man realized a few years later that the people did not forget that simple fact. They had built their lives refusing to acknowledge it. 

All of the things they did not do, all of the choices they made out of fear, and all of the versions of themselves they did not become they did so because they always believed they could later. And in that moment, when they knew there was no later, they were surprised. 

But why?

There never was a later to begin with. 

A year later, the asteroid resumed its course. In an instant. No warning. No preparation mattered, there was nothing that could have been done. 

Nearly all life was wiped out.

The man died, as did all men. But before he perished, he figured it out. 

And in the pavement that would eventually be uplifted and incarnated, he carved the simple truth many men never knew, 

No man should spend his life suspended before action because of fear, and no man should idle in the comfort of tomorrow because they believe in the myth that is the future. Reach out towards that which is impossible, towards that which is great and feel the weight of an unpromised future pull upon your soul, and fight against the world that tells you you have time. For the asteroid always floats above you, and the world always rests in front of you. Stride towards the self you know to be best, and never plan for the future to hold the change you seek. For change is not a destination, not a result. It is the decision one must make to become that which they seek. You exist both in the past and in the future simultaneously, forever burdened to become a memory and a vision to yourself, now and then, for the rest of time. We must look to the emptiness which lies in front of us, and pick up the paintbrush that is living to make that which is our life.

1o6qy2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiari/comments/1o6qy2d/im_literally_in_tears_im_so_sick_today/,I‚Äôm literally in tears I‚Äôm so sick today,"As the title suggests the last 4 days I‚Äôve felt like garbage. I‚Äôm in NJ we just had the Nor Easter roll through and I‚Äôm on the shore so got the worst of it needless to say the atmospheric pressure absolutely destroyed me and I‚Äôm just so upset. 

I‚Äôm newly diagnosed and I am relieved to have found the cause of my seemingly random and awful symptoms but I‚Äôm also getting worse and worse and I have no quality of life. I‚Äôm lucky to have 2 headache days free a week. I was supposed to have lunch with a friend and I barely get ever out or see anyone and I woke up drying heaving and throwing up in an old coffee cup. My head feels like it‚Äôs going to explode and my neck is broken at this point I think. 

Sorry for this long rambly post I just am coming to terms with the fact that I have these symptoms forever that are getting worse that nothing really helps and I can‚Äôt do the things i used to do that I love and that this is going to happen over and over again. Not being able to have a life bc I have a headache that makes me want to push my thumbs directly into my temples. I‚Äôm very depressed. Anyone else?",5,1760474070.0,chiari,0,0.86,False
1o6qwis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o6qwis/aitah_for_ghosting_or_at_least_trying_my/,AITAH for ghosting (or at least trying) my friend/colleague,"For context: This story happened in the UK and I am from Poland.¬†

I (25 years old, female) met a girl at work, let's call her Betty for the sake of story (24 years old, female). Not very long time ago, I used to work in a restaurant where I met Betty. I was a manager and she was a waitress. I did her interview in which I found out she really likes Poland and she even started speaking Polish to me, which I straight away found odd to showcase your language skill like that, normally if people can speak 2nd language, they just state it, rather than proving it. Besides she can't actually speak Polish, but she goes to Polish language classes and she reaaaally loves Poland.¬†  
  
So anyway, she got the job, we started working together and I enjoyed working with her to some extent. She did fairly well, she was extremely dedicated to every single task, even the tiniest details and she was super nice to me, always asking if I want a coffee, if she should put staff food on the side for me, asking if I ate today, if I slept well etc. She obviously really likes me, but it was so busy working as a manager in a restaurant, honestly I just didn't think anything of that, I thought she's being nice and she likes me. There were so many things happening throughout the day, it just went under my radar. I guess this is a good time to mention that Betty has autism and epilepsy. I don't know a lot about epilepsy, but apparently, from what she told me and the management team, it's a mild case, where she sometimes has seizures but they never last longer than 5 minutes and not eating regularly can trigger it. She opened up to me about her whole childhood, and it was a really tough story. I sympathized with her, I didn't have the best childhood either.¬†  
  
The longer she worked with us, the more people started saying mean comments about her and honestly, I felt very bad for the girl. She was probably one of the hardest-working people in that place and of course, there are going to be the mean girls, but I even caught my superiors laughing at her, talking in a very rude way in front of the whole team or just ignoring her with silence. I saw her really sad one day and I tried to cheer her up and I said something along the lines ""If anyone is mean to you, that just means they feel miserable about themselves"". We ended up going out for drinks once after work with one more girl, and honestly we didn't want Betty to come with us, but she kind of invited herself in. It wasn't that bad, we ended up going home quite early, like 9pm but one thing I have to say, she was bringing up her childhood a lot. After this, she always tried to go out with me, she checks the days I am off and asks about specific dates and I always brushed it off with ""oh, i'm busy"" and it was true most of the time. I didn't mind her at work, she was extremely polite to me and I felt kind of the need to protect her, not sure why, maybe because I had a tough childhood or once I used to be that one girl in a workplace that nobody likes. But I didn't wanna be friends with her. I didn't feel like we have absolutely anything in common. Well, I am from Poland and she loves Poland. She would always try to talk to me in Polish. I guess that's the common thing.¬†  
  
1 month ago, I got fired from the workplace (story for a different post I guess) and when Betty found out, she called me crying. She was very sad and she said she hopes we can still be friends. First of all, we are not friends, but second of all, everyone says this stuff when somebody leaves, especially if they get fired and I‚Äôve heard this 100 times in my life and I speak to none of these people that claimed they wanted to stay in touch. I said ""yes, of course"" and we finished the call shortly. Few days after she messaged me, she wanted to visit me, hang out, whatever. I managed to say no couple of times, but I was out of job and I started to run out of excuses. I let her come to mine, as I do gel nails and she asked if I could do it for her.¬†  
  
She came to my house at 3pm, like clockwork with some Polish sweets in a Tesco bag. I took around 2 hours to do her nails, again, she talked a lot about her tough childhood, I don't wanna go into details but honestly some tough stuff and she even started crying and it just felt like a therapy room. We did talk about some other stuff as well, I tried getting some gossip from the workplace but it seems like nobody really wants to talk to her. After I finished her nails, I offered some tea, we ate the sweets and 1 hour later she is still seating in my chair. I didn't wanna kick her out, she obviously wanted to stay and I as I said before I felt sorry for the girl. She kind of reminded me of myself but from when I was younger, but not much younger though.¬†

It was almost 7pm now, I offered to go to pub downstairs to grab a couple of beers since we are chatting anyway. She said yes and she asked if can leave the Tesco bag she brought with herself in my flat, and she straight away promised she will just pick it up when we leave pub. She did have some other stuff inside, like phone charger, wallet, snacks, it was kind of her handbag. She was quite persistent and I didn't want to seem weird about leaving a bag at my couch, so I said yes. We went to pub, again a lot of talking about her childhood and a lot of sad, and sometimes alarming stories about ex. She also mentioned quite a few times that we are friends, because blablabla and that people in the workplace know that we are friends and it happened so many times, I finally said ""I hope you know, we are not friends just yet, I mean it's the first time I am actually meeting you properly"" and she said that she knows, she understands but she hopes we can be friends. I kind of say yes but honestly I don't know how to act. We did talk a lot about life I guess, I tried to give her some advice, she was so hopeless about every aspect of her like, it seems like her self-esteem is very low, so we stayed there for a while. It's past 10pm now and I am hungry. All I had was 2 sandwiches in the morning, so did Betty actually. She was supposed to pay me for doing her nails but I told her to pay for my drinks and she also bought me a microwavable chicken katsu soba. We go back to mine, so she can grab her Tesco bag, but she makes herself comfortable, she takes off her shoes and jacket and starts showing me some videos on her phone. I didn't wanna be rude, so I let her stay, we watched some tv, but I was so hungry and I didn't want to eat in front of her and I am confused because if she knew she is going to stay here, she could have gotten herself food as well. I am a little concerned now because of how she can have her seizure if she doesn't eat, so I make the soba and share with her. I try to give her hints to leave but nothing is working.¬†

It's half past midnight now and I just told her that I wanna shower and call it a night. She gets visibly sad and even tries to stay here for a night. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment with my partner and yes, my partner was all this time home as well and at this point, even if I lived in a manssion, I don't want her staying over. Betty missed her last train and she needs to take a nightbus. When I walk her to the door, she hugs me very hard, like very very hard squeeze and starts crying and shaking. She doesn't want to let me go, I offer to walk her to the bus stop, around 5 minutes walk from my apartment. We wait for the bus and when it comes she doesn't want to get on it, she says it's the wrong bus, but it can't be wrong because that was the only bus running there at that time!! I manage to convince her somehow, she goes home, I ask her to message me when she gets home and to eat something. She messages me like 1,5h later (we live in London, a nightbus trip can take that long) and she is fine.¬†  
  
After this situation, she tries to meet up again, but I really don't want to. I left her on read once for a few minutes because I was away at my friend's for her birthday weekend. She quickly followed up with ""I'm sorry if I did anything wrong"" message. I replied saying I am away, I will message her after the weekend. I didn't. She messaged me. I stopped replying on WhatsApp, she started messaging me on Instagram. I feel very bad for ghosting her, I even tried posting this on a different group and it was against the rules to mention ghosting and that instantly made me feel worse.  
  
I don't wanna be friends with her and it's just not going to work, we have nothing in common and I think she just needs a good therapist. I am honestly shocked she lives on her own. She decided to starve herself and take 1,5h nightbus trip with some questionable individuals, over leaving a bit earlier and catching the train which would take her 45 minutes, just to stay with me for as long as possible. Some of my friends say I should just ingore her and/or block her but I don't feel right doing it. My partner also said not to invite her ever again and that it gave him massive stalker vibes. Quite a few people actually mention YOU and Little Reindeer but I personally believe that's an exaggeration however, I also doubt that many people actually suspect their stalkers before they find out they are stalkers. I don't think Betty is my stalker, but it feels uncomfortable and I think that when you're really going to be friends, it happens naturally and there is no need to force that feeling. I don't wanna keep on ghosting her but I also believe that real friendship shouldn‚Äôt feel so forced, and I am just not enjoying myself around her.",1,1760473979.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1o6qul4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/1o6qul4/are_there_any_legality_issues_about_two_companies/,Are there any legality issues about two companies using the same commercial logo?,"I don't buy frozen foods often but decided to try a frozen food product called ""Yellowstone"" sold at Walmart.  It was a Country Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes that was supposed to include Gravy but it did not.  I attempted to report it to the MFG.  In doing a google search, I found the company... or at least I thought I did.  They were labeled as ""Eatyellowstone.com"".  I sent them an email 9 days ago.  They didn't respond.  I followed up today and they told me that it is not a product that they sell and to contact the mfg by the info on the packaging.

I don't have the packaging anymore, but I did some more research and found that Yellowstone was apparently based off of a TV show with the same name.  EatYellowstone has all kinds of different products from coffee to Mac'n'Cheese.  But they don't have Country Fried Steak.  After looking at images online, a company called Foundry Foods makes this product, though finding the product on the website has not been successful so far and the packaging looks identical to all of the other products that [EatYellowstone.com](http://EatYellowstone.com) has to offer which is causing this confusion, including the commercial logo.

So where is the line drawn as to how to file complaints, who to complain to and the misleading information that causes you to file a complaint with the wrong company because multiple companies are using identical packaging and commercial logo combinations for advertising?  I wanted to bring up a product mistake and instead, I've wandered into a territory of everyone pointing fingers at everyone else!",2,1760473854.0,Ask_Lawyers,4,1.0,False

1o6quec,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o6quec/castenada_part_27/,Castenada (Part 27),"Were it not for the beams of daybreak tearing their way across the floor, I would have most likely slept in until noon on whatever God forsaken day of the week this was. I tossed in my bed, sending empty bottles to the floor with a concerningly loud clang. It hadn‚Äôt been bad enough being on poor terms with Dwight after stumbling back to the hotel drunk following more than one nightly excursion or coming up with my room rental a buck short on a few occasions. I had been working exclusively for Mr. James ‚ÄúAmsi‚Äù Barker for the better part of a month as a day laborer and a part-time philosophy consultant. He would raise his various pontifications while pointing to his obtuse schema and I would have to formulate something resembling a counter-argument for why whatever he was asking to build simply wasn‚Äôt physically possible, but my end of the conversation could perhaps be more accurately termed ‚Äúdrunken barking‚Äù by passive observers.

There was a small but growing collective of us. Many were simple remodelers and electricians, but a fair shake of us stood apart. There was Dr. Kellen Erwing, a seasoned parapsychologist from Sacramento who has spent a great deal of time (and no doubt money) researching occult phenomena in the Orient prior to Japan‚Äôs autocratic uprising. With him was his not-so-secret lover and confidant Saeko, who has some sort of familial ties with the Fujinami clan in Kyoto, though I wasn‚Äôt certain what any of that meant beyond their apparent interest in Barker‚Äôs research. There was also Matilda Trice, heiress of the Trice cannery empire in Seattle, local surrealist artist, and an unabashed socialite drinker who spent much of prohibition making unsavory connections in speakeasies. I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced of Matilda‚Äôs convictions in Barker‚Äôs ventures outside of being a wealthy financier, but then I‚Äôm certain she would have similar reservations towards a failed weird fiction writer contributing little more than anecdotes and what little construction experience I had. Finally, there was Todd and Lorraine Harvey, a newlywed couple of experimental engineers who specialized in various forms of spectrometer devices for the base detection of theoretical tachyonic manipulation.

To say the very least, we were a rather queer bunch to be certain. The average resident of Castenada came from Midwestern stock, primarily the descendants of German immigrants with bloodlines intertwined with the original Anglo-settlers of New England, who relished the opportunity to till the soil, clear the burnt forest, and fish the lake with no curiosity nor desire to question theological doctrine. Our collective was antithetical to these values and made no obfuscation as to the peculiar nature of our research. I had spent an evening or two at the local cemetery alongside the Harveys, recording spectral readings over various graves much to the scornful chagrin of the neighboring Methodist congregation. I had little understanding of what exactly it was that we were supposed to be documenting outside of writing down whatever numbers Lorraine called out while Todd adjusted diodes and twisted knobs on a home-assembled panel.

Last night was a particularly raucous outing as we began working on the renovations to Barker‚Äôs house. Such renovations would be difficult to explain in layman's terms and to be honest I don‚Äôt entirely understand them myself. Crossbeams corresponding to magical leylines, occultic symbols etched into bricks and windowpanes, technological fabrications wired into his ever-expanding labyrinthian cellar that has been a matter of legal debate with certain contractors. Whenever any modicum of work was finished, Barker would christen a fresh bottle of bourbon followed by another. I was still unclear just how deep the coffers of the traveling magician ran and what relationship it was he had to Miss Trice. Perhaps they once tried explaining this to me, perhaps I could retain fragments of this conversation between rude jests, outdoor smoke breaks, and what Barker had termed ‚Äúmild devilry.‚Äù A joke shared between people in private, an exchange of knowing glances, and pregnant silences were frequent irregular finds in their strange drunken parlay. The more I got to know each of them, the less I understood what role it was that I was supposed to serve whatever it was they had me building. Maybe that‚Äôs precisely why they kept my company and tolerated my drunken revelry.

After getting dressed, managing to force myself not to vomit last night‚Äôs beans, and rinsing my mouth out with the hair of the dog, I found myself on the familiar streets as a torrential deluge pelted me and the whole town relentlessly. I, like any hapless out-of-towner, had heard the famous stories of the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs rainfall and how half the year bleeds together into a dark and wet quasi-winter, but it was another to actually experience the drab misery of it firsthand. It was simultaneously beautiful as lush greenery seemed unfazed by the changing of the seasons, but also a relentless procession of steely gray skies backlit by an invisible sun. It was a blossoming garden for a thousand suicides unto a thousand more.

I could feel rain beginning to slowly seep its way through my woolen coat down my back, though I have since learned not to immediately run for cover as the locals walk the streets without so much as an umbrella and they could practically smell the Chicago on me. On the way, I reached into my pocket and counted out enough change to buy a ham sandwich, but the violent lurching in my stomach caused me to bury away the very notion of food. All the same, a spot of coffee could do wonders in whatever twilit hour this was. I made the long shambling walk towards the local eatery, a place with no discernible name other than a placard that read ‚ÄúSOUP‚Äù in bold letters. The cook was a man of rapidly advancing years, wearing deep creases across his gaunt face like jagged canyons across a landscape starved of rain. He smoked a rolled cigarette behind the joint, his apron stained with years of grease splashes and stove burns. His accusatory gray eyes flicked up to examine me like a wolf sizing up a deer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on break,‚Äù he said in his gravel-raked voice. ‚ÄúCome back in an hour for supper.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you any coffee?‚Äù I asked, not so subtly flashing a couple quarters.

He heaved a sigh, exhaling a plume of semi-sweet smoke before snuffing his cigarette on the heel of his shoe and stepping into his stall to fumble around in back. He eventually peered out his front window a minute later with a cup of lukewarm black coffee in a paper cup. ‚Äú10 cents. Take it or git.‚Äù

I gladly accepted this clearly marked-up coffee without further barter or protest and drank it greedily. Whatever moisture I had left in my mouth was soaked up by the caffeine and I could feel a dull headache starting to permeate at my temples, but the languishing torment of fatigue was beginning to subside. In the middle distance, I could hear the gentle clanging of piano keys ringing out over the patter of rain. I found it strange to hear live music while the sun was still up and to hear it at all in Castenada was a sight yet to be seen in my sojourn. With little other plan than to avoid being in the hotel and waiting for sundown to begin drinking again, I followed the music like the scent of cooling pie on a window sill.

I passed houses dimly illuminated by porchlights and warm interiors I‚Äôd never know. People passed me by on the sidewalk without so much as a passing glance or a friendly word, a standard Northwestern custom. A few blocks and I finally found myself at a place I had come to know as Sam‚Äôs. It was perhaps the only business I frequented aside from the eateries and newsstand. What it was doing open at this hour, I had no idea, but I felt no need for further invitation. Inside were only a few bleary patrons rubbing the last remnants of sleep from their eyes and swilling coffee that I suspected had a tinge of the Ol‚Äô Irish. They were all facing a piano spotlit in the corner, where a man I‚Äôd never seen before played. A woman was standing beside him, dressed in a ruby dress with sequins that caught the light like glittering jewels, who clutched a microphone stand as she crooned a stripped down cover of ‚ÄúYour Mother‚Äôs Son in Law.‚Äù It took me a moment to see past the make-up and pageantry to realize it was Miss Trice who was singing. Her voice was okay, nothing that would warrant a record contract, but certainly nothing that would get her kicked out of the place.

Regardless, I took my seat at the bar and waited for Sam to pour me a whiskey, but Sam never came. Instead, there was a woman I‚Äôd never seen before. Dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes. She was dressed a bit like Sam, with a green silken vest over a pressed cotton shirt and black trousers. She poured me a drink without even asking me what I wanted, placing the glass atop a folded napkin and slid it over to me.

‚ÄúMuch obliged,‚Äù I said, raising the glass in salute. ‚ÄúWhat do I owe you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis one is on the house,‚Äù she replied with a curt and somehow knowing grin. ‚ÄúCourtesy of Mr. Barker.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, is he around?‚Äù I asked, looking about the patrons for Barker‚Äôs balding head.

‚ÄúIn a manner of speaking, I suppose.‚Äù she said as she proceeded to clean a glass. ‚ÄúYou could also say that he‚Äôs been running things here all day.‚Äù

I almost choked on my drink, ‚ÄúWho, The Amazing Amsi? That man can barely run a house renovation.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has other talents, Mr. Merriam.‚Äù she said as she set the now polished glass on the counter and reached for the bottle of Old Stagg tucked away beneath the counter. ‚ÄúMysticism, illusion, paranormal investigation‚Ä¶ Mesmerism.‚Äù

I looked at her side-eyed, ‚ÄúHow exactly do you know my name? Do you work for Sam?‚Äù

‚ÄúI work for no one, Mr. Merriam.‚Äù she said, pouring another whiskey. ‚ÄúI am an interloping free agent. Think of me more as someone offering a bit of free advice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôve already finished your drink.‚Äù she said, prompting me to look at my fresh glass, only to see my drink was gone. She took my empty glass and handed me the one she just poured and immediately began pouring another into my last glass. ‚ÄúI should talk faster, you‚Äôre running out of time.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore what?‚Äù I looked at my glass only to see the liquid was slowly being drained in thin air. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on!?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre under hypnosis.‚Äù she said, sliding over the next drink. ‚ÄúMr. Barker is using you and Miss Trice over there in one of his personal endeavors. I managed to intercept you before you could slip completely under his control.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I stood up, but immediately felt my head spinning, prompting me to grip the bar‚Äôs external railing to balance myself. I looked to the dimly lit walls and could now see millions of exotic butterflies with equal variation of wing shade slowly opening and closing their wings. My eyes made their way to the piano player, and I could now see his fingers had far too many joints in them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mr. Merriam, but we don‚Äôt have time for specifics.‚Äù Her eyes flicked to the entrance. The light from outside was shifting from a steely gray to a deepening scarlet. The Billie Holiday song shifted to a stranger sounding and melancholic tune, one that I didn‚Äôt recognize. Miss Trice began singing, but the lyrics made no sense.

*‚ÄúOne pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small, And the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The false bartender gripped my hand, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let it in! Whatever you do, *don‚Äôt let it in!*‚Äù

The door to the backroom that had always remained closed, suddenly opened wide. It spilled a curious violet radiance, intermingling with the deepening outdoor crimson and lamplights to make eerie, unnameable shades. I could see the patrons all looking at me now as I struggled for balance. Among them were an Indian with an ichor-tipped spear, a Spaniard in antiquated clothing, a young man with hair of brilliant sapphire standing on end, and nameless others in varying states of attire. The false bartender placed the napkin she slid under my drink in my hand, ‚ÄúGive this to The Operator. He can send you back when the time is right.‚Äù

As I shambled away, the counter caught ablaze and all the butterflies suddenly took wing. Hundreds of insects went tumbling into the flames and came out as flipping polychromatic cinders. Matilda shrieked in blood-curdling terror at the sight, but I felt at ease in the middle of the flitting chaos. I peered through the yawning back door into a hallway of quivering flesh. Thousands unto thousands of wriggling worms writhed over each other as though woven together. Will-O‚Äô-the-Wisps of scintillating pink into deepening plum float freely about between and through the worms like haunted lanterns. Beyond, I could see a coffin-shaped portal illuminated in an orange glow like cascading sunset, but I could discern little else on the other side.

With little other choice left to me, I gave the false bartender a final glance, but she had already receded into the shadows. Something slowly descended the stairs on elongated legs not fit for any beast I could reason exists. So grotesque, so malodorous was it that I can scarcely recall the finer details of its half-mannish face lest I go mad. Perhaps I had descended fully into madness already for I pushed my way through the worm-walled tunnel. My fingers slid along slimy silken carapaces as they flexed and convulsed around me in a heartbeat rythm.

1o6qu8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/1o6qu8l/considering_getting_a_conure/,Considering getting a conure,"Hello. I'd really like a conure because I think they look fun. However, I want to make sure I'm a good match and that I get one from the right source. 

About me

I have never owned a bird.

I've done some research. Probably not enough.

I work from home.

I have a 2 bedroom apartment. Carpet in the bedrooms, hardwood elsewhere. Wood burning fireplace in the living room. Not sure if I will end up needing it or not.

I live alone, hopefully not forever.

I have close relatives that would probably be allergic to dusty birds like a cockatiel.

My washer, dryer, coffee pot, and microwave make noise with no silent option when they finish. 

Fake leather furniture.

I would like for it to be with me at my desk when I work. However, my office is in one of the bedrooms and I don't want it to nibble on all the wires I have for it's own sake. I also don't want it to poop all over the carpet or tear it up. Carpet can be cleaned, but I don't think I have a good solution for all the wires. This is currently my biggest concern. DP cables, ethernet cables, hdmi cables, mouse and keyboard, electronic desk, power cables, etc. I would also be okay with letting it roam but I would be concerned about lamp power cables. 

I have ceiling fans, but don't usually use them. Pretty much only when I try to sleep (one in bedroom). I figure I can cage it long enough to cool the place down if it gets really hot.

I would place the cage in the living room to give it the most sunlight possible. 

I visit family on the weekend. 35 minute drive. They would not keep it but probably would be fine if it visited with me.

There is a nearby vet, but they only treat parrots on Tuesdays for some reason.

I have a self cleaning oven, but does it matter as long as I don't use that feature?

I cook with stainless steel, cast iron, and glass. I have one non-stick baking sheet that I think is some kind of treated aluminum.

I love garlic, onions, and spice. Should I be concerned about it being out of the cage when I eat?

I like to go for drives around town in the afternoon or on weekends. I would be fine taking it with me as long as I can keep it in a travel pack or something. My seats are fabric and I don't want poop stains. Maybe if it could be trained to request a poop break, but I'm aware that is not likely. Otherwise I'm home the majority of the time.

My options, both GCC

2 year old male
Nearest place to adopt is 4 hours away. The price is 350 (USD). It's a single handler (I think). They are licensed, but they do not cage the birds. Therefore, I don't know how it will handle being separated from a flock, and put into a small cage for 4 hours to get it into my apartment's larger cage. They do not allow visits so I can't take the time get to know one other than about 30 minutes when I go to pick it up and decide which one. I'm worried my apartment would be a downgrade.

Juvenile (I think male, can't remember)
Petsmart is 15 minutes away. The price is 900. It is cute and lives in a small enclosure, so it could probably handle the transport better. I think my apartment would be an upgrade if I can keep it safe. Feathers are kind of dull in color so I worry about health.

Overall, how do you feel about my situation? Would you recommend against owning one?",1,1760473832.0,parrots,8,0.99,False
1o6qt53,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1o6qt53/26m_italy_looking_for_someone_to_share_the_little/,26M | Italy ‚Äì Looking for someone to share the little joys,"Some nights are too short for regrets, and life feels better when you share it with someone who makes you laugh, even at the small stuff. I‚Äôm here hoping to meet someone who‚Äôs curious, kind, and doesn‚Äôt mind a little chaos along the way.

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi :)",1,1760473766.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1o6qkc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1o6qkc9/the_bench_at_the_center_of_the_world/,The Bench at the Center of the World,"The best bench on the 14th Street platform is the one right in the middle. It‚Äôs not the most comfortable, but it‚Äôs the only one where you can feel the wind from both directions, a preview of the uptown and downtown 6 trains before they even arrive. I got here a little later than usual today. The guy at the bodega was fighting with his second toaster, so the line for the one working one was snaking past the cold drinks. I almost gave up on my cinnamon raisin bagel, but I‚Äôd already paid, so I waited. By the time it was toasted, slathered with peanut butter and jelly, and wrapped in that thin paper, the 8:05 express was long gone. It‚Äôs fine. The early trains are always too crowded anyway.

I settled onto my bench. First things first: Wordle. I got it in four today. The first guess is always a prayer, the second a process of elimination. By the third, you‚Äôre either hopeful or resigned. Today, I was hopeful. A good omen, maybe.

The platform filled around me. A river of suits and backpacks. A kid in a dinosaur backpack stared at me until his mother pulled him along. I opened my chess app. I‚Äôm working my way through a bot named ‚ÄúNelson,‚Äù set to a difficulty that lets me feel clever about half the time. I made a move, captured a pawn, and then looked up.

A flock of fashion students descended, all black clothes and dramatic silhouettes, talking loudly about some designer I‚Äôd never heard of. They were a living exhibit. On the opposite bench, a man with kind eyes and a worn-out satchel was grading papers, his red pen moving in quick, decisive slashes. I wondered what story he was failing. A tourist asked me for directions to the High Line, and I pointed them toward the stairs, my voice sounding raspy from disuse.

By midday, the rhythm changed. The frantic energy of being late was replaced by the purpose of lunch breaks and errands. I switched to a sudoku book, the kind with the cheap paper that smudges. The numbers were a quiet comfort. The fruit vendor, an older woman with a permanent, tired smile, nodded at me. I bought a cup of mango and some fruits. It‚Äôs cheaper than the delis and keeps the hunger at bay. Down on the tracks, a large, glossy rat emerged from a shadow and dragged a forgotten piece of a breakfast sandwich back into the darkness. A small, brutal victory.

In the afternoon, I started my book. Before the Coffee Gets Cold. A novel about a caf√© where you can time travel, but you have to finish your coffee before it gets cold or you‚Äôre stuck. It‚Äôs a book about regrets and second chances. I read a chapter, then watched the people living out their own versions. A woman clutching a single yellow flower, her eyes scanning every opening door. A first date. Her hope was a physical thing, bright and fragile.

As evening set in, the station lights flickered on, casting a harsh, honest glow. The crowd softened. People were going home now. Ties were loosened, comfortable shoes replaced heels. The woman with the flower was gone. I hoped it went well for her.

I closed my book. The last of the long-distance trains were due. This is when I pay the most attention. My phone was dead, my sudoku book filled, the story finished. There was nothing left to do but wait. Really wait.

I watched the downtown local pull in. The doors hissed open. A few people got off. A man with a guitar case. A group of friends laughing. A woman struggling with two large grocery bags.

No one else.

The doors closed with a final, rubbery thud. The train pulled away, its red lights disappearing into the tunnel‚Äôs mouth. The station felt vast and suddenly very quiet. The attendant who mops the floors gave me a small, familiar nod as he started his rounds. He‚Äôs seen me here enough to know the routine.

I stood up, my knees protesting. It‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs always tomorrow. The trains will run again. The promise was someday, and someday is a date that never appears on a schedule, which means it could be any day. It could be tomorrow.

I turned my collar up against the chill and walked out toward the stairs. The city above was settling into its night sounds. Somewhere out there, his train is still coming. I‚Äôm sure of it. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be back on that bench. Tomorrow, the doors will open, and he‚Äôll be there, smiling that same smile, and he‚Äôll say he‚Äôs finally home.

Seed to soul off tyvola- I did NOT like this place. Every üõí I tried sucked and the üå∫ did nothing for me

Hello earthly, two locations on south blvd and plaza midwood I think- this is a new place with two locations. I talk to the owner's husband and had such high hopes but the üõí and üå∫ I have had are lacking, a step up from seed and soul, and I like the thought and care that goes into their products 

That Grass, Rock Hill SC- I love their infused slushies üòÇ but the house üåπ gave me a headache. Could have been my problem since it was a diesel strain and those are a bit harsh for me

Pureremedies two locations in fort mill and 521 near Pineville- I will go here for my üõí. I am not a fan of their üå∫ but love the sample edibles so you can try before you buy

Kanna south end- this is the only place that has any üå∫ that I have enjoyed. The lounge is an absolute vibe and love smoking a preroll with an infused coffee on Saturday mornings with a book.

I'm wondering if maybe I am just picky ü•¥ but I would love to find some great üå∫ around here since that is mainly what I prefer.

Please leave a comment with your favorite or least favorite local places. I would love to see other places and suggestions!

1o6qivt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistanRishta/comments/1o6qivt/m_28_faisalabad_mai_pyar_krna_chahta_hu_kiunky/,"M | 28 | Faisalabad - Mai pyar krna chahta hu, Kiunky Mai barbaad hona chahta hu","**Height & Weight:** 5'9"" & 80 KG

**Location:** I am from Faisalabad. I was born and raised here. I would love to tell you about every chowk of this city starting from one of the eight bazars of the ghanta ghar. Nvm, I don't even know the all 8 names.

**Residence:** Rented

**Education:** I have Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering.

**Income Source:** I work full time as Mechanical Engineer.

**Marital Status:** I am single, never been married and never dated.

**Religion & Short Details About How Practicing You Are:** I am a Muslim. I am balanced in my religion and transparent about my shortcomings. I avoid probably all the harams: haram food, drinking, dating, interest etc. As opposed to focusing on ""Proper Behavior"", I focus more on practicing the aspects of Islam that directly affect the society such as practicing honesty and fairness and speaking truth. I do need to work more on the worship aspects of Islam like praying 5 times daily. I struggle with that stuff.

**Hobbies & Interests**

* **Reading books:** No, I don't do that. Last time I read those were in college.
* **Gym:** No, I don't go to gym either. I paid for a gym membership for over a year and only went a few times, so I cancelled it.
* **Travelling:** No, I don't travel either. Last I timed traveled was to my phuppo 20 mins away.
* **Deep Conversations:** No, I also don't have deep conversations with anyone. I like to conserve my energy and preserve my last few brain cells. My mind is in constant debate with itself though.
* **Driving:** Yes, I love driving. No, not speeding. Just a long peaceful drive in a calm evening to get to my phuppo a whole 20 mins away.
* **Coffees:** I do not like coffees at all. But recently I have started to like Lattes which are not bitter. Maybe our long drives can be to coffee shops?
* **Nature:** Yes, I love nature. My dream is to live in a country side surrounded by nature and also raise cattle. But I think I might be a little too burger for that, so realistically we would likely live by big cities. But we can go camping on vacations.
* **Biking:** Yes, I love biking in fall. Summer is too hot for biking. I would love to go biking with my wife. No, you won't sit on the ""pichli seat"", you will have to ride your own bike.
* Sometimes, I replace biking with walking. Just as much fun.
* **Idling:** Yes, I love idling. It relaxes my brain that is constantly overthinking and debating with itself. Once I return from work, I eat and go straight to bed and just scroll on phone for a while before doing anything else.
* **Eating:** Ooohh this is my fave! I love eating at restaurants. I guess the same vibes as cafes. I don't know, when there is food in front of me, it momentarily rushes my body with immense happiness. Once, I have taken the last bite, it quickly fades away. :(

**Family Details**

We are three siblings and live with parents.

**Requirements for a Partner**

* I prefer someone from Faisalabad or nearby cities.
* I want someone same age or younger than me.
* I want someone who doesn't have prior relationships. It is okay to have crushes though.
* I want someone who tries to follow Islam as much as possible, I am not looking for perfect because I am not one either.
* I want someone who values/practices honesty, truth, transparency, and accountability.
* I want someone who is okay with me not dealing in ""interest"".

**Deal Breakers**

I would like a woman who is flexible on the idea of not having kids or she is okay either way.

I have tried my best to explain my views on certain issues and my ideal married lifestyle at the end of this profile template. Please read it and see for yourself if you find any deal breakers for yourself there or if my ideal lifestyle doesn't align with yours.

**Preferred Family Setup:** Joint but maybe Nuclear in the future.

**Do You Want Children?** I am on the fence about kids. I do not want to have kids ever but I cannot guarantee my mind will not change some time down the line.

**Timeframe for Marriage:** Once we have decided or are satisfied we are The One for each other, I would like to involve parents and marry right away. Now it takes a couple of months or 6 months to figure out compatibility, it depends on both of us.

**----------------------------------------------------------------**

**Pick the preferred option from the following:**

**1 - Division of Responsibilities**

**a. Traditional Roles:** Husband is the bread winner (covering shelter, food, security, wife's needs and wants etc.). Wife is the housewife responsible cooking, house chores and raising kids.

**b. Semi-Traditional Roles:** Same as Traditional Roles but if Wife wants, she also works a job in addition to cooking, house chores, and raising kids. Wife gets to keep 100% of earned money to herself.

**c. Modern Roles:** Both Husband and Wife work fulltime Jobs and do 50/50 on all the responsibilities: financials, cooking, house chores, raising kids.

**d.** Other (Explain in the open ended response).

**Open Ended Response:** I prefer option A but I am open to other two options (b & c).

**2 - Governing Structure/Decision Making**

**a.** Husband is the Head of Household, he considers Wife's opinions but makes the final decision. Husband can delegate decision making to Wife on any subject.

**b.** Both need to make a unanimous decision: in the case of stalemate, one of them will eventually have to give in to achieve a unanimous decision.

**c.** Wife is the Head of the Household, she considers Husband's opinions but makes the final decision. Wife can delegate decision making to Husband on any subject.

**Open Ended Response:** I only want option A. In the case of stalemate, option b will cause more friction.

**3 - Opinion on some of Cultural/Religious Issues:**

**a. Do you think women should be able drive?**

**i.** Yes, women should be able drive cars.

**ii.** No, women shouldn't be able to drive cars.

**Open Ended Response:** Yes, option i. I expect her to learn to drive a car. If she doesn't know, I will teach her.

**b. How do you want your spouse to dress?**

**i.** It doesn't matter to me, they can dress however they want.

**ii.** I expect them to dress in a moderate way ensuring clothes are loose and cover most of the body per the religious expectations.

**iii.** I expect them to dress modestly, ensuring strict compliance with religious requirements like loose clothes with Hijab/Abaya/Niqab.

**Open Ended Response:** Option ii. I just expect you try to cover yourself as much you can with lose clothing. I don't care what kind of outfits you choose (pakistani or western). I don't mind if you don't wear a hijab, but if you already do wear, that's great too.

**c. Can wife leave house by herself?**

**i.** Yes, she can travel on her own.

**ii.** No, she cannot travel on her own, she needs a mehram.

**Open Ended Response:** Option i. I don't mind her travelling by herself, and I expect she is able to run her errands on her own like shopping, visiting friends, grocery etc.

**4 - Will you provide separate accommodation or your wife is expected to live with in laws?**

**Open Ended Response:** I prefer to live in a separate house but currently it is not possible for me to provide separate accommodation. So, I want someone who is okay living in the same house with my parents and siblings. When in future, I have my own personal house, I will still give my parents an option to live in my house if they choose too. But siblings will be in their own separate houses. My parents can choose to live with any of us siblings.

**5 - Anything important should the prospect know about you?**

**Open Ended Response:** I do not take or receive interest, so that means we have to save cash before buying something including house. I hope you support me in that. It is easy to take a loan for a house but I just don't feel it is right.

**6 - Describe your nature or habits or personality?**

I am easy going person (lol) but one thing is for sure, I am extremely picky (w food and everything) and stubborn. It is a fair warning. Sometimes people confuse my stubbornness with anger. No, I control my anger really well, you will almost never hear me yelling. By stubborn I mean, when I say No, it literally means No. But because I am picky and stubborn, I also do not like to form strong opinions fast. You will notice I really don't have strong opinions on a lot of things, so in all of those issues you will find me very easy going. Also, I try my best to be transparent and fair. So while I am stubborn, I also fair. Lastly, a lot of times I say stupid or non serious things which sometimes you will find funny and sometimes you will find then annoying and tell me to shut up. :( Maybe faisalabadi keera hai or I guess I overthink a lot, so to break that cycle I will say non serious things. Generally, I am shy and an introvert. I open up with certain people only (again picky).

**7 - Describe how do you envision your typical weekday from morning to night and typical weekends/long weekends?**

**Open Ended Response:**

**Weekday** \- I wake up and get ready and go to work. Kiss a her a goodbye as she snores. At work I think about her and can't wait to attack the lunch she made last evening. Then its about 4 or 5pm and I head home, driving like a maniac to get home asap to see her face. When I get home I tell her how much I missed her and I love you. She tells me kch zyada hee hogya khair chicken karahi is ready. Yes, I like to have dinner before sunset.  Once I am full, we sit and relax in the patio for a while and we both either go for a walk or gym or perhaps we cheat today and instead end up at a cafe or perhaps at mall so can put her eyes on something she saw online. We come back home and relax and idk fall asleep?

**Weekend** \- Some weekends will just be idle while others will have a spark, she has a list of places to explore, maybe we go on long drives and I love camping btw. I don't know if she would be down but I love if she does. Maybe we go to a restaurant. On long weekends we can plan vacation trips to explore other cities and nature places. I hate travelling in airplanes though, agr engine band hogya toh. /: Dono hee jaty rahy. I would love if she take part in a couple of my hobbies, not listing them here.

**8 - How do you envision your married life in general?**

I would want to live a lifestyle where our married life is full of romance, respect, and fun. I want to be excited to come home from work where I know my love is also anxiously waiting for me, or perhaps we are both ready to go home from work to see each other. Either way, I want to live a life where I know my partners is a source of peace and comfort for me, not a burden and chaos. I hope to be the same for her too. I hope to have a relationship where we respect each other's boundaries and let each other be themselves. I hope to live a lifestyle where we both make an active or sincere efforts to fulfill each other's needs and desires and make each other happy.

However, please remember we have to make an ""active"" and ""sincere"" effort to achieve this goal because it is rare to find two people who are naturally so compatible that they get along really well without any effort.

We most likely won't be naturally compatible, therefore, we both need to be willing to make the sincere effort as mentioned above!

I brew my coffee at home using a moka pot and usually enjoy it with milk. For grinding, I use very basic burr grinders ‚Äî both manual and electric (I'll share photos in the comments), which cost around 20 euros.

I was hoping to buy this cool gadget‚Äîthe Picopresso‚Äîto make tasty lattes wherever I like, but I feel out of my depth with this one ;) I'm in awe of the knowledge and effort people put into getting those beautiful, creamy shots from the Picopresso!

I know that good grinder providing grind consistency is crucial for getting good results with the Picopresso (along with a fair bit of effort). After going through a lot of posts, I‚Äôm still unsure what the minimum level of grind consistency is for the Picopresso to work (it seems people that use these cheap burr grinders rarely consider getting Picopresso, but here I am), so let me ask directly: should I cosider a Picopresso if I plan to use these basic grinders?

1o6qg2r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6qg2r,Help with the color palette,"Hello! Sorry in advance, English is not my first language. We are in a process of buying our first house! So I have been very impatient and started decorating the kitchen/dining/living room space using HomeByMe program. We've always been big fans of French country interior design with whimsical details. But after laying and painting everything how we are planning to, it's seems kinda basic... Maybe someone could help with the color palette? 

For the kitchen we are thinking about cream cabinets with dark wooden countertop, farm style sink and gold handles. Also shelves with some cute clutter and short curtains. 

For the dining room my dear grandma will gift us her oval oak dining table which I absolutely love! I was thinking about light wood chairs or cushiony (?) chairs. With also some flowers and a tablecloth. 

Now for the living room... We want a vintage looking rug, a big sofa and a gallery wall but I really don't know about the colors.. the coffee table is gonna match the dining room. 

Also, what should I do with the curtains?? There is a big door to the patio so I'm gonna put some curtains over them, but then there is relatively small window above sofa. Should I just leave it or should I continue the rod with the curtains from the patio door?? 

Thank you all for the suggestions!!
