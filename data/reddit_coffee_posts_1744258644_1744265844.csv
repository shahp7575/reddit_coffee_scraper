BUT he‚Äôs also sleeping in until 7.30 which is the latest he‚Äôs ever let us sleep in his entire life. Because I go to bed around 10-10.30pm there‚Äôs not much time to decompress and unwind in the evening anymore. So today I decided to get up earlier, after all I now have almost 3 years of experience getting up between 5-6am, so when I first stirred with the sunrise at 6.20am I got up. I‚Äôm deep into a book at the moment and now nearing the end when it‚Äôs getting really gripping and only having time to read 1-2 chapters at night is just NOT ENOUGH. So I made my coffee and breakfast, grabbed my book and as soon as I sat down I heard rustling from the bedroom. Then a quiet ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs mum?‚Äù shortly followed by a thunk and little footsteps coming towards the lounge. I was counting on having at least half an hour on my own, but nope! ü•≤

Oh well. Maybe tonight he‚Äôll go to bed closer to 8 than 9. One can only hope!",1,1744265816.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm a local from Osaka working for Expo 2025.

I‚Äôd love to meet people from other pavilions and go out for drinks or throw some fun parties together :)

DM me if you wanna join the mixer or join  Expo hangout group (which I'm planning to make).
Also down for smaller hangouts ‚Äî coffee, lunch, dinner, whatever sounds chill!

I‚Äôm also planning a Japanese lesson session for pavilion workers, so if that sounds interesting please hit me up üåû

Realizing friends don‚Äôt just come naturally like in school, I‚Äôm trying my luck here and hopefully find some new friends! I don‚Äôt play sports and I don‚Äôt enjoy going to bars or parties so it‚Äôs really hard to meet new people outside of work.

I don‚Äôt mind your gender or location, everywhere in the world is welcomed, but I‚Äôd like to find people close to my age (+-5). I am happily in a relationship, and looking for platonic friends only. Long calls on discord, sharing youtube videos, gaming together or ranting about the current strange world we live in, all that good stuff.

I‚Äôm 30F currently living in the US west coast. I like science, art, and a nice long walk on a good day. Despite where I live I‚Äôm far from outdoorsy or sporty, more of a cafe, restaurant and friday night on my big couch with blanket kind of person. I‚Äôve lived in several different countries and always curious to learn about other people‚Äôs stories.

I‚Äôm generally a chill and friendly person. I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as super introvert but I do enjoy alone time at home a bit too much and dislike loud party or huge crowds. I like a little bit of nature, nice beaches or short hikes, but for most of my free time I‚Äôm at home watching shows, gaming or occasionally doing something like painting or baking. 

Common hobbies I enjoy as well as many other people (I‚Äôll leave the specifics to private conversations): 
- Movies, tv shows, comedies
- Music, both listening and playing
- Food, coffee, and a nice cup of tea
- Video games, but not competitively
- Books and podcasts 
- Crafty things

Some less common things about me: 
- I travel quite a lot, and I‚Äôve lived in a couple different places across North America, Europe and Asia. I like different cultures and learning new things.
- Bo Burnham is one of my favorite comedians 
- Daniel Sloss is another one
- I don‚Äôt really watch anime except attack on titan is one of the best story I‚Äôve ever seen
- I just finished severance and it‚Äôs a good show
- Also just finished Project Hail Mary and I really like it
- I don‚Äôt follow any sports. Either you are the same or you have to accept I have very little interest and know nothing about it

Potentially controversial:
Here‚Äôs things that I really don‚Äôt vibe with and I want to put it out there first. You can disagree and that‚Äôs okay, it just means I‚Äôm not the friend you‚Äôre looking for.
- Smoking, vaping, and recreational drugs
- People with messy life or go for excessive drinking when bored
- People who believe in tarot cards, astrology or psychic stuff
- Deeply religious 
Other than the above I generally cool with anything, we can hard disagree on whether it‚Äôs legal to put pineapple on a pizza and still be best friends.

If that interests you send me a message! I don‚Äôt expect a whole article about you but please at least tell me a little bit about you. Hope to hear from you!",1,1744265732.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Two questions for y‚Äôall: 

1) The Tannery Road exit onto SPFR going towards Delta. Do we HAVE to move into the left most lane when it forms? My coworker says we do  but I tend to stay in the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù lane (middle lane) all the way till the turn. 

On that note, what‚Äôs with people getting aggressively upset about not being let over (around the teal mark) from Timberland Road during rush hour (purple lane)?  The signage is clear as day, there was ample opportunity to get over earlier  and/or they are clearly lane jumping from further back. Why on earth would I let you in!? ü´†üòÇ

1jvr08b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Key_Intelligence_/comments/1jvr08b/what_motivates_china_security_partnerships/,What Motivates China Security Partnerships,"The core of China‚Äôs security cooperation is technology in exchange for infrastructure access, such as signing a BeiDou navigation agreement with 35 countries in 2023, allowing port access in exchange for the deployment of AI monitoring systems, and achieving 83% of data local storage through the SM4 encryption protocol (Mandiant report #CTI-2305), and locking control of strategic waterways with an accuracy of less than 0.5¬∞C deviation from satellite infrared thermal maps.

# Resource Corridor Defense

Last July‚Äôs satellite image misjudgment of oil tanker trajectories in the Malacca Strait caused Bellingcat‚Äôs verification matrix confidence to suddenly drop by 23%. When I was tracking encrypted AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, I found a Panama-flagged cargo ship‚Äôs actual draft depth exceeded public records by 1.7 meters ‚Äì such anomalies stand out to OSINT analysts like finding military-grade safes at supermarket checkouts. With 35% of global crude oil shipments passing through the South China Sea-Malacca artery today,¬†**every ship here carries encrypted survival codes**. My self-built Docker image scraping system compared vessel thermal signatures from 2020-2023, revealing 83% of ships with nighttime infrared intensity increases exceeding 17% were later confirmed to carry undeclared cargo. This isn‚Äôt conspiracy theory ‚Äì Mandiant‚Äôs 2022 MX-3075 incident report already exposed similar methods.

|Monitoring Dimension|Traditional Method|Dynamic Verification|Risk Threshold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AIS Signal Delay|24-hour verification|Real-time blockchain notarization|\>15min triggers Level 3 alert|
|Satellite Cloud Interference|Visible light analysis|Multispectral overlay|Error spikes when cloud cover >40%|

Last month‚Äôs classic case: A Telegram channel suddenly discussed ‚ÄúSouth China Sea meteorological equipment maintenance‚Äù using Russian-Chinese mixed content with 92ppl (perplexity). Tracking revealed three UTC+8 accounts uploading port photos with scrubbed EXIF metadata at 3AM. Sentinel-2‚Äôs cloud detection algorithm proved the photos were taken during rain ‚Äì original weather data had been altered using MITRE ATT&CK T1599.003 techniques.

* Vessel Shadow Verification: Triggers manual review when satellite azimuth angle error exceeds 3 degrees
* Tanker Draft Depth Model: Establishes fluctuation baselines using tide tables and ballast data
* Encrypted Comms Metadata: Initiates deep packet inspection when Tor exit node fingerprint collision rate >19%

An industry veteran told me¬†**modern intelligence verification is like counting the trajectory of every raindrop during a typhoon**. They recently caught an ‚Äúiron ore carrier‚Äù showing 41% higher thermal radiation in Palantir Metropolis system than same-tonnage ships. The hidden Precision Machine Tools found in hull layers matched warnings from Mandiant‚Äôs MX-2145 report. The timestamp war is now critical. Last quarter, 37% of satellite verification failures stemmed from ¬±5-second time differences between imaging and ground monitoring ‚Äì like timing sprinters with marathon clocks. Our lab‚Äôs LSTM model predicts when data delays exceed 8 minutes, channel risk confidence plummets from 94% to 67%. A GitHub project applying Benford‚Äôs Law to ship fuel data shows interest. Normally following first-digit distribution, 38 tankers from a shipping giant deviated by 12 points ‚Äì probability equivalent to 10 consecutive coin heads. Combined with MITRE ATT&CK v13‚Äôs supply chain pollution techniques, responsibility becomes clear.

# Breaking the Containment

>

When encrypted Russian traffic emerged on dark web forums at 2:30AM, Bellingcat‚Äôs matrix confidence instantly dropped 12 percentage points.¬†**This midnight operation mirrors last year‚Äôs Philippine radar misidentifying fishing boats as warships**. OSINT analysts found old Docker image fingerprints in packets, with timestamps showing five-year-old black market origins.

|Monitoring Dimension|Traditional Method|Dynamic Verification|Risk Threshold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Data Latency|4 hours|23 seconds|Ôºû15min triggers red alert|
|IP Geolocation Error|¬±300km|¬±80m|Requires recheck if cell tower deviation >5km|

Modern intelligence warfare resembles StarCraft:¬†**Palantir processes satellite images 11x faster than humans**, but fails against Benford‚Äôs Law scripts. Last year‚Äôs South China Sea reef expansion data violated natural number distribution patterns. GitHub open-source tools exposed this, with 2200 forks in three days.

* Dark web scraping exceeding 2.1TB causes Tor exit node collision rate to spike at 19% (normal ‚â§7%)
* Telegram channels created ¬±3 hours around Moscow internet controls always show >90ppl
* Satellite-ground timestamp errors >¬±2.7 seconds disable building shadow verification

Remember the fishing boat misidentified as destroyer?¬†**Sentinel-2‚Äôs multispectral overlay now detects 86-93% of disguises**. It‚Äôs like supermarket barcode scanning, but for warship radar signatures. MITRE ATT&CK documents such OSINT vulnerabilities under T1595.003. The latest trick uses Bitcoin mixer records to track C2 servers ‚Äì¬†**effectiveness rivals using Meituan delivery data to catch spies**. When mixing exceeds 37 BTC, IP spatiotemporal patterns show breaks ‚Äì detailed in Mandiant‚Äôs MFE2173 report, best viewed with Google Earth 3D terrain.

# RMB Settlement Expansion

Satellite images show Qingdao port container code remapping, while dark web leaks 278 cross-border contract hashes. Bellingcat‚Äôs Metropolis script saw RMB settlement confidence plunge from 58% to 41%, triggering geopolitical alerts. As OSINT analyst tracking 19 SWIFT alternatives, I extracted digital wallet traffic patterns from Bank of China test Docker images. CIPS upgraded message formats three times last year. Latest test packets reveal¬†**‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù GPS coordinate hashes in headers**¬†‚Äì fusing logistics and currency flows. Compared to SWIFT MT103 messages, CIPS field expansion reached 37% (per Mandiant #FIT-2219 analysis). Argentina Central Bank‚Äôs textbook operation: Used $290M swap quota to settle corn payment at 01:23 UTC+8 ‚Äì avoiding NY/London windows. But Telegram agriculture group‚Äôs semantic analysis showed¬†**actual transaction occurred 17 minutes earlier**¬†than timestamp (92ppl). Oil-RMB settlements got wilder. When scraping Saudi Aramco June loading data, VLCC tankers‚Äô AIS signals disappeared for 23 minutes at Hormuz, while Shanghai crude futures surged 83%. Thermal satellite data¬†**matched RMB-priced oil density parameters**¬†(89% confidence, per MITRE ATT&CK T1599.002).

* SM2 signature reuse found in Kazakhstan border POS logs
* Moscow Exchange RMB/RUB trades show dual peaks in Beijing/Moscow time overlap
* China-Laos railway waybills use dual pricing ‚Äì USD in plain text, RMB hidden in QR error layers

Brazilian soybean traders embedded RMB instructions in crop sensor IoT data, generating blockchain hashes from LC Traceability code. Mandiant #CTI-7783 shows this caused SWIFT validator errors to hit 29% ‚Äì like drugging legacy banking systems. Most alarming is the mBridge digital currency project. Shenzhen tests showed¬†**liquidity pool volatility exceeding BIS redlines when >5 participants**¬†(per CP190 standards). Thailand Bank‚Äôs 30M RMB digital certificate settled Malaysia-Indonesia Triangle payments at 10:00 UTC Wednesday ‚Äì traditional systems can‚Äôt handle such high pressure water cannon transactions.

# Critical Infrastructure Control

A 03:17 satellite Misjudgment mistook South China Sea substation cooling towers for¬†**missile launchers**, causing Bellingcat‚Äôs matrix to drop 12%. As certified OSINT analyst, I traced Docker fingerprints to attackers lurking in ICS upgrade packages for 9+ months. Today‚Äôs power plant warfare rule:¬†**Whoever cracks SCADA-satellite time gaps controls operations**. Mandiant #MFTA-2023-1881‚Äôs tampered voltage data struck at 02:00 UTC Thursday ‚Äì exactly during local shift changes. <td>8min delay invalidates temp data

|Dimension|Solution A|Solution B|Risk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Satellite Refresh Rate|6-hour|Real-time+15s buffer|
|Sensor Disguise|Visible light|Multispectral|37-42% night error reduction|

Real danger lies in normal-looking logs. Last month‚Äôs gas pipeline valve stuck at¬†**47% opening**¬†revealed attackers using MITRE ATT&CK T1595.001 to mask pressure sensor Millimeter level fluctuations as aging signals. Maintenance emails came from IPs Bound three countries‚Äô cloud servers.

* Shift-change commands require timezone hash verification (UTC¬±3s)
* 26hrs of ¬±2% vibration stability triggers red alert
* Auto-lock valves when satellite-ground temp gap >8‚ÑÉ

That ‚ÄúPower ICS Group‚Äù on Telegram had 89.7ppl ‚Äì 23 points above normal tech chats. One user‚Äôs hydropower coordinates showed¬†**15m Sentinel-2 Offset**¬†‚Äì perfect for hiding relay devices. Lab tests showed: >35‚ÑÉ ambient temps¬†**boost encryption cracking 4-6x**. Explains last summer‚Äôs port crane paralysis during historic heatwave at 14:47. Industry rule: 3-5% ‚Äúnormal‚Äù parameter fluctuations beat direct data tampering. Like discerning if coffee cup fog is AC condensation or breath on lens.

# Tech-for-Military Deals

Last September‚Äôs¬†**satellite Misjudgment of port containers as missile launchers**¬†exposed tech-military exchange models ‚Äì commercial satellites‚Äô AI mistook crane shadows for military hardware, showing 23% higher error rates than normal (Mandiant #MF-2023-0921). Real case: Southeast Asian country received¬†**Chinese AI surveillance**¬†in 2022 for port Base Station access. Core system uses MITRE ATT&CK T1592 to intercept cell data. But¬†**face recognition plummets from 91% to 67% when antennas tilt >5¬∞**¬†‚Äì exactly where tropical climate warps equipment. Dark web operations got creative: Telegram channels generated¬†**87ppl military schedules**¬†mixed with real geofence data via UTC+8 servers. 17% Tor exits overlapped drone maker IP ranges ‚Äì clear tech reuse chains.

* Military facial recognition Backport to residential access systems
* Weather satellite code appears in e-commerce logistics
* Border drones Modified seafood transporters (thermal sensors monitor Cold Chain)

Ultimate irony: Naval quantum key devices¬†**clashed with cable repair ship protocols**¬†‚Äì both used same lab‚Äôs patent (ZL20221058432.7), invalidating MITRE ATT&CK T1574 indicators. Tech-military deals see civilian markets¬†**fueling military R&D 3x faster than budgets**. Like surveillance camera firms accumulating Theater level computing power. But when fishing apps start¬†**collecting seabed maps**¬†(triggering Mandiant #MF-2024-0315), tech boundaries blur completely. Lab data: >38‚ÑÉ (common in tropical bases) makes radar chip errors jump from 0.3% to 12%. These chips are made using port surveillance profits. Tech cooperation builds nuclear reactors with Lego blocks ‚Äì never know which civilian piece triggers military risks.

1jvqzov,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jvqzov/cant_stop_sleeping/,Can't stop sleeping,"For a while now I have been struggling with my sleep schedule. I pretty much have the same routine everyday- I wake up around 8am, go to class, the gym, etc. I am pretty productive during my day. However, when I don't have any obligations in the evening, as soon as I come home I fall asleep, and I can't control it. I literally can't stay awake. I will go to bed as early as 5pm and then wake up around 1:30/2am and either stay up or go to sleep again. I sometimes even avoid sitting on my bed altogether but it's so bad that I will fall asleep anywhere, even on the floor. I don't know what to do, it's like I  don't want to fall asleep but it just happens, and I've been in this endless cycle.  
Every other day I have obligations from 6pm-10pm, so my sleep schedule is pretty normal on those days, which is why I'm able to wake up at 8am feeling well-rested. But the following day, every time, it's the same phenomenon- I fall asleep at 5 or 6pm and wake up at 1/2am.  
I don't think I have sleep apnea or narcoclepsy or anything like that, although I do get sleep paralysis from time to time. I drink coffee every day, and have even started drinking Celsius and taking Vitamin B12 to stay awake, but nothing seems to work. My diet is well-balanced- protein, energy foods, etc., and I'm very active too.   
I don't know if this is just the life of a busy college student, but I need to fix my sleep schedule asap because I feel nocturnal every other day.

Do I need some like therapy? How do we even fix this**

I‚Äôve been with my man for almost 6 years now. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs. In 2022, we broke up because I found Tinder on his phone. He hadn‚Äôt even fully set up his account yet but it was enough for us to break up

Eventually we got back together and rebuilt everything. We have been really good since then. We got married last year. 

So, we have an open-phone policy. It was one of the things to help build back that trust. 

Tonight I saw a notification from a girl‚Äôs name I didn‚Äôt recognize and I looked at their texts. She‚Äôs his coworker and they‚Äôve been texting a lot. They have a mutual interest in cars and they were talking about meeting up for like a car event and him helping her with her car. His last text to her was just asking if she‚Äôd ever been to (local coffee shop) and she just replied ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù

Looking at it objectively none of those are THAT crazy or suggestive, but I feel sick

I realized that I don‚Äôt actually trust him and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to cheat on me 

I should talk to him but I don‚Äôt know what I would even say. ‚ÄúHey babe I looked at your texts and they‚Äôre not that bad but I don‚Äôt trust you so stop texting her‚Äù ??? That‚Äôs crazy 

I really thought everything was going fine until now. I thought I trusted him more than this 

I know trust is a huge part of relationships and if I haven‚Äôt healed from the past then I fear I never will. I don‚Äôt know if I want to be in a relationship where I‚Äôm scared of being cheated on 

But is it more of a me problem?? Am I just insecure and I need to work on it? Or is he acting suspicious?? I can‚Äôt even tell. I feel crazy.

She used to make it whenever bananas went brown, and as a kid, I‚Äôd always hope for that moment‚Äîbecause I knew it meant warm banana bread was coming soon. These days, I make it for myself, for neighbors, sometimes just because I need a break from the world and something soft with coffee.

**Mom‚Äôs Banana Bread**

**Ingredients:**

* 3 ripe bananas (the browner, the better)
* 1/3 cup melted butter
* 3/4 cup sugar (can use less if you like it less sweet)
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp baking soda
* Pinch of salt
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

**Optional add-ins:**

* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* Handful of chocolate chips (not traditional, but I won‚Äôt judge)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. In a mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir in the melted butter.
3. Add sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla. Mix well.
4. Sprinkle in baking soda and salt. Stir to combine.
5. Add the flour and mix until just incorporated (don‚Äôt overmix!).
6. Fold in any extras if using.
7. Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 50‚Äì60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
8. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack. Try not to eat it all in one go.

I still make this banana bread every few weeks, especially in fall and winter. Something about it just feels grounding. If you give it a try, let me know‚Äîalways curious to hear if anyone else gets the same ‚Äúhome‚Äù feeling from it.

I finally reached the basecamp on the third morning and seriously considered continuing up to the summit of Annapurna I in my tennis shoes. The scenery inside and around the sanctuary was stunning and I loved the Chomrong village as well.

[Pictures here.](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18sFi9PL6o/?mibextid=wwXIfr)

The total cost of the trek including permit was¬†**11,950 Nepalese Rupees**¬†or about¬†**$88**. Normally I see tours advertised in Pokhara for 6-day treks for $350 per person, so the savings were significant.   
  
Below is the cost breakdown, itinerary, and some additional thoughts and notes.

# Annapurna Basecamp Itinerary + Expenses

**Saturday**  
*Costs:*  
`3,000 (permit) + 20 (bus to zero KM) + 150 (bus to Kande) + 100 (crackers) + 1,000 (room) + 650 + 50 (dal baht and water)`

**Route:**  
*Pokhara to Kande ending in Jhinu Danda ‚Äì \~30 km, plus 90min bus ride from lakeside*  
(via Australian Camp and Forest Camp, then on through Landruk. You descend to New Bridge and cross the Modi Khola before a steep climb to Jhinu)

**Sunday**  
*Costs:*  
`300 (bread) + 50 (water) + 170 (cookie and water) + 600 (thukpa) + 60 (crackers) + 650 (pasta) + 460 (pancake) + 800 (room)`

**Route:**  
*Jhinu to Deurali ‚Äì \~27 km*  
(Uphill most of the day. Lots of vertical gain and stairs. Jhinu ‚Üí Chomrong ‚Üí Sinuwa ‚Üí Bamboo ‚Üí Dovan ‚Üí Himalaya ‚Üí Deurali)

**Monday**  
*Costs:*  
`300 (shower) + 100 (hot water) + 650 (thukpa) + 760 (dahl bat) + 800 (room) + 80 (hot water)`

**Route:**  
*Deurali up to ABC then back to Bamboo ‚Äì \~30 km*  
Big altitude gain to ABC (4,130m), then long descent back to Bamboo. Left Deurali at usual starting time (7am) and then arrived at the top about 11:00am, took a short nap and headed back down.  
The scenery changes from Deurali onwards with huge, steep cliffs and snow-capped peaks, but the path is also rugged, broken, and more difficult. This was probably the longest day of the trek.

**Tuesday**  
*Costs:*  
`120 (filtered water) + 30 (hot water) + 450 (thukpa) + 400 (bread) + 200 (hot spring ticket)`

**Route:**  
*Bamboo ‚Üí Nayapul - \~25 km*  
Lots of up/down stairs early (Bamboo ‚Üí Chomrong), then long ascent to Landruk.  
From there it was suggested I head to Hundu / Siwai and grab transportation back to Pokhara.  
Also stopped by the hot springs near Jhinu which was really refreshing and met a French woman who I trekked back to Pokhara with.

# Some Tips and Notes

* You can bring two bottles but only keep one full and leave the other empty -- less weight to carry. I use one of the bottles for mixing things like electrolytes, oatmeal, and satu powder (important source of vitamin B3).
* It's best to bring your own water purification tablets that you can purchase cheaply from any pharmacy in Pokhara. During the trek, you have to pay for everything including filter tapwater which could run 150‚Äì250 rupees per liter. But with purification tablets you can drink from any tap after 30 minutes for free.
* I bring my own bag of filtered coffee and a Vietnamese coffee filter (called a coffee phin) to easily make coffee on the go - you can buy these on Alibaba for a few dollars.
* I skip breakfast and usually break my fast during afternoon with a bottle of oatmeal and occasional snacks like Tibetan bread, crackers or Thukpa (noodle soup). At some of the lower villages (like Pothana) you can also find bananas.
* I bring only one set of clothes and wash undergarments and socks each day - not necessary for outer layers.
* If you have a jacket, you can take off weight from your back and shoulders by tying it around your waist.
* Walking sticks or poles are your friend -- they support your weight when ascending, making it easier to go up, and they help you balance when going down, helping prevent falls or injuries descending on the broken paths.
* The return trip is significantly quicker because you're going mostly downhill and you aren't stopping to take pictures of things that you have seen already.

Note that I went at a rather quick pace and the trek often takes 6‚Äì7 days. I start early and fast until afternoon, drinking only coffee I make myself.

So, I‚Äôve been going to this coffee shop for a while now, pretty often. There‚Äôs a guy that works there. I actually met him one time at an event prior to going to this coffee shop and knowing he worked there and we had incredible conversation. And yes, I thought he was cute.

That is, until 8 months later, which was a month ago. I was getting coffee with a friend and he waved at me. It was friendly I think. But then that whole couple hours, I kept catching him staring or glancing at me. It piqued my interest again, and my curiosity for sure. It just seemed different than before. 

Every week I‚Äôve gone in since then, same thing. I swear he notices me walk in everytime and every chance he gets he‚Äôs catching a glance at me. 

We‚Äôve said hi a couple more times too, usually quick when he‚Äôs in passing in work mode, but also once when he was leaving work too and I happened to be walking past his car. He practically flagged me down and I was so nervous it was mostly small talk (Of course, I was with a guy friend and now I‚Äôm terrified that he thinks I‚Äôm dating someone‚Äî definitely want to clarify that next time I get a chance to chat to him)‚Ä¶ but! It was different. Suddenly we are just orbiting each other so much more. And tbh, I get the sense we are both more nervous? Or maybe that‚Äôs just me LOL.

I keep thinking I‚Äôm making this up, but then I‚Äôll go in to the coffee shop and same thing. 

So TL;DR‚Ä¶ is this eye contact thing something that could actually mean he‚Äôs interested? Should I make an effort to try and catch him on a break and chat? I had an opportunity the other day but got nervous and kept walking. Lol.",2,1744262909.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

Pero eto yung turning point‚Äîone time, naubusan ako ng food and wala akong makain. Lahat sarado. I forced myself to cook kahit hindi ko kabisado yung luto. It turned out edible (barely), but that night, I cried... not out of sadness, pero dahil I was proud of myself.

Now, slowly, I‚Äôm learning. I keep a notebook to track my spending. I light candles pag gabi para hindi ganun kalungkot. I even started talking to my neighbors‚Äîsmall chats lang, pero malaking bagay.

Struggle ko? Adjusting emotionally, working while unstable pa ang setup, and managing loneliness.  
Lesson? You won‚Äôt grow until you're uncomfortable. And growth? It‚Äôs painful but beautiful.

I have what seems like a plumbing question, but it might be something else.

I'm in a new apartment building, and the water pressure is terrible in all taps - bathtub, bathroom sink, kitchen sink.  

Usually, getting hot water in the kitchen tap means I have to let it run at least 2 litres of water.  I collect it, and use it for my humidifier, coffee, etc so I don't waste it all.  

I have noticed if I start my dishwasher, which is right next to the kitchen sink, the hot water in the tap is almost instant.  There's a ""pulse"" when it first starts up, with no change to pressure, and it's hot.

I looked under the counter, and I don't see anything that would indicate that the dishwasher has a different hot water feed.  

I have asked my building manager, but they didn't understand my question - they told me that there's an element in the dishwasher to get the water hot.

[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jrvu8x/my_boyfriend_decided_to_walk_my_friends_cousin_to/)¬†**- April 5th 2025**

Me, my boyfriend, and my friend were supposed to go to a standup comedy show tonight. My friend also invited her cousin, who's new to the city and whom we met for the first time. After the show we went to a bar, got a bit drunk and walked back to my building (my friend and I live in the same building). While we were walking back, the plan had been that she would crash at my friend's, but when we reached our building, she said she had some stuff to do early tomorrow, and decided she was going to walk to her place which according to Google Maps is a half hour minute walk. Unprompted my boyfriend offered to walk her, I wanted to walk with him too, but I was tired and tipsy and my friend also convinced me to go her place and finish the episode we were on.

My boyfriend was supposed to come back to my place after, but he texted me that he was just going to go to his place since it's a 10 minute walk from hers. I was holding it together knowing that he was going to come back but now I have a terrible feeling for no good reason. Like maybe it's stupid but I don't like that his last thing of the day was a half hour walk with her rather than being with me. My mind also keeps going back to any jokes that only the two of them laughed at hard during the show, how much they talked, what she wore, how she looked. Can someone calm me down?

**Relevant Comments:**

**Comment 1:**  
The foundation of any strong relationship is trust, in fact it is the most important thing in my view.

Without trust the relationship is doomed, for example if my partner wanted to use my cell phone I‚Äôd hand it to her, I‚Äôve got nothing to hide.

Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it, you trust your boyfriend, it‚Äôs a good thing.

**Comment 2:**  
You didn‚Äôt join your bf on your walk because you trust him :) don‚Äôt be insecure about that. 30 mins is a long walk and he‚Äôs probably tired. You‚Äôre tired now too! Would be bold af for him to betray you so brazenly

Hope it all works out for you in the end

**OP:**  
Thank you, I've been beating myself up for not joining him, and internally angry at my friend for wanting me to finish the stupid episode. But you're right, I trust him.

**Comment 3:**  
Sounds like he walked her home, realised he was also tired and drunk and it'd take him longer to walk back to you than to just go home.

**Comment 4:**  
He sounds like a nice guy for making sure she got home safely, and unless he‚Äôs given you reason to not, you should trust him and relax.

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1js89mg/update_my_boyfriend_decided_to_walk_my_friends/)¬†**- April 5th 2025**

Thank you so much for the reassuring comments in the first post. I dozed off after the first few comments while waiting for him to reach his place and let me know. I woke up to a lot of reassuring comments, and the main thing everyone stressed was trust, and I do fully trust him, so that made me feel better.

I just wanted to talk to him about how the walk went just for myself, and so I could give an update here too. He wasn't able to answer my calls in the morning, and ngl despite all the positive comments I'd just read and the lessons about trust I was again about to start to get worried (honestly a comment had said this might be a me problem and maybe they're right lol).He just woke up half an hour ago because he'd gone to sleep late since he'd had coffee when dropping her at her place, so he couldn't sleep until late, and figured I'd gotten knocked out (true lol) so he didn't call me either in the night, just texted me. He has to go to meet some friends for brunch so we couldn't talk for too long, I just asked him how the walk was and he said it was uneventful but he was glad he did because it was quite late. When I meet him tonight I will let him know that it was really sweet that he walked her to her place (a lot of the comments said how great it was of her to do that and it made me a bit proud too). Thank you for helping me out when I was spiraling last night and I do promise to work on myself too.

I appreciate all the responses I've gotten on this post, but I can feel myself falling into a spiral again and I don't think this update post was a good idea, I thought it would help me but it's doing the opposite. I appreciate it, and I'm secure in where I stand with my boyfriend but I appreciate the concern. I don't think I'll be responding to this post any longer.

**Relevant Comments**

**Comment 1:**  
He went inside her place for coffee? Or he got coffee after dropping her off. If Luke Cage taught me anything, it‚Äôs that coffee means sex.

**OP:**  
He said he had coffee at her place for 5 minutes to sober him up.

**Comment 2:**  
Dude. I understand commenters told you not to worry after your last post. But now we‚Äôre telling you to worry. He went into her apartment to have coffee late at night? Does he usually drink coffee late at night? Honey, that detail alone is sus af and you need to have a conversation with him. Because why would he go into a drunk girl's place to have coffee. It sounds like he cheated.

**OP:**  
I've seen him drink coffee at odd times for sure, I've seen him do that when he has to do some work late into the night. He said she offered coffee to sober up, and he thought it'd be a good idea. I mean I was iffy about him even walking with her, but I realized later it was normal, he's at my place just now and his behavior isn't different, and like a lot of the comments said, I do trust him, so I don't know if I should be bringing it up again and again really.

**Comment 3:**¬†  
He went inside her house late at night and had coffee? And stayed up late because of it? But when he texted you he said he was just going right home to sleep because he was tired. So which was it? Did he stay and have coffee or did he go right home to sleep?

Hopefully your trust isn't being taken advantage of.

**Comment 4:**  
i didn't want to look crazy for saying his actions were weird in the last post but it's undeniable now. I was suspicious the moment he chose not to come home to you or at least call.

**Comment 5:**  
Girl.

Don‚Äôt fawn all over him later like what he did was soooo sweet and he‚Äôs soooo amazing and just the most amazing. Just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt.

This is sus

**OP:**  
No, I didn't fawn over him. I just told him it was nice of him to do what he did. When I was spiraling out last night, the commenters pointed that walking her to her place was just the decent thing to do, and they're right. I appreciated that.

**Comment 6:**  
Um miss ma‚Äôam‚Ä¶.I thought he said the walk was only 10min from that girls house to his place‚Ä¶hb the time it takes to go into a shop, order coffee, wait and walk back go? This is me assuming he was too ‚Äútired‚Äù ti make coffee at home and not stupid enough to go into this girls house to get coffee from her‚Ä¶.

**OP:**  
You're right he could've made it at his place. He has a Keurig machine at his place too. I can feel myself about to spiral out again, and I don't think this is helping, again it would be wildly out of character for him, I will keep an open eye but for now I'm not going to let this get to me.

I'm trying to remember the name of a book I read a while back and it's been driving me crazy. I don‚Äôt remember the title or the author, but here‚Äôs what I do remember:

The female main character inherits a flower shop (I think from her family).

The male main character works at his mom‚Äôs company.

They meet or have a meaningful connection in a coffee shop.

A big part of the story involves the girl dealing with the loss of her parents.

It had a cozy, emotional vibe‚Äîpossibly romance or women‚Äôs fiction.

Me and my wife are planning a trip in August to Munich visiting from USA. We‚Äôre there for 8 nights. So far I was thinking of having 3-4 days in Munich and maybe spending the rest of the days outside of Munich. Maybe the country side. Would love some suggestions on some cities or town to stay in. Ideally I feel like we would love to be somewhere in the mountain areas. Unfortunately we are spoiled and we like staying at nice hotels. Preferably 5 star. I know that limits the options of where we can stay. But we will also be transporting by public transport. So somewhere it‚Äôs easy to get to by train and taxi would be great. We love outdoors. I believe the weather will be nice. But sometimes we don‚Äôt mind just lounging at our hotel. We‚Äôre not too heavily activity focused. 2 or so activities during our total stay would be more than enough. We love coffee shops, good food (we are vegetarian and that concerns me if we stay somewhere countryside and the options are limited). 

We did think about just sending it to Zurich for a few days. I know that might not be the best idea but would be nice to visit two countries at once. Also Austria was on our list as well. Any feedback and advice is welcome. Thank you!",0,1744261117.0,Munich,9,0.4,False

1jvpwx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jvpwx4/i_miss_him_please_read/,I Miss Him.... (please read),"Me and my Boyfriend (then 20F and 21M) broke up in February 2023 after dating for 3 months. He broke up with me because I said that I didn't know if I wanted children. Hiss rationale was he'd rather break up with me before our relationship got deeper and in the case I didn't want kids. We remained as friends for sometime. He ended up trying to get back with me in July of 2023 but I said no because I wanted to work on myself. I was struggling with mental health issues and my grades in college were not the best, so I wanted to put more focus on that. I was depressed ASF and hated myself. 

So, I didn't want to burden him with that. I felt that my trauma already been a lot in the relationship. For instance, I was uncomfortable with some forma of intimacy, closeness, and my sexuality in general. I have an avoidant approach to it. I desire closeness and intimacy, but it makes me afraid an uncomfortable (avoidant attachment style). He felt rejected because of it, so I started to give in to it at times because I didn't want to make him feel any kind of way. We didn't have full blown sex or anything, but just touchy feely stuff. I liked it for the most part and I initiated it at times, but I would still have moments where I was weirded out by it or uncomfortable when we reached a certain points. I also had self esteem issues and major mental health problems. I didn't treat him bad or anything, but we would often have conversations about how my refusal to be vulnerable and to keep things to myself, bothered him.

So, I was at a point where I didn't want to share that with anyone. I just wanted to focus on myself and at most be friends. He didn't want to be friends. He felt like I didn't like him the way I said I did because I didn't want to get back with him right away, and that upset me when he said that. Befoee our last conversation in July of 2023, he called me while he was inebriated and was trying to persuade me into taking him back. I didn't give in and he chose to ignore my calls and texts for like 3 days. I was worried because he sounded like he was in distress when he hung up, so when he explained why he didn't talk to me, I was pissed (It was because he didn't want to hear anything negative, which he asked me about something I went through and I told him, and not to tell him about anyone I was interested in, which I never did).

After that last conversation, I didn't talk to him for a very long time. After a while, I unfollowed him from social media and deleted his number from my phone. 

A few days ago, I got a text from him and I didn't even know it was him because I hadn't heard from him since July of 2023. He was asking how I was doing and I was seeing how he was doing too. Then, he asked if I could meet up with him for lunch or coffee. 

I was upset after that conversation. Because part of me wants to be his friend again but another part of me is saying to leave him alone completely because he is going to have a problem with me not wanting a relationship at the moment.

I just don't want to be with anyone right now. The last time I dated was in October and I haven't poke to anyone or been anywhere since then, because I don't care to be bothered. I have a few experiences that rubbed me the wrong way, and it made me want to be by myself. Plus, I just want to focus on myself. 

It's hard because part of me misses him and still loves him and I can almost say I hate myself for even dating him. I mourn our friendship and I know it's against my better judgement to even deal with him in that way again, that's what sucks. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. I fucking miss him. I miss him. I miss him. I miss him. ",6,1744260792.0,dating,6,0.88,False

We need to rebrand Orlando because as we all know it is NOT the city beautiful but we can work towards making it so maybe something like "" Orlando:made by us"" since we are growing it up or maybe something else idk open to ideas in our future Orlando 
We could offer tax cuts to businesses wanting to set headquarters in Orlando and try and target green technology media production and really support healthcare innovation like with advent health which is currently headquartered in Altamonte Springs. 



1. Education/ art 
Valencia and UCF and Full Sail should make Campuss in downtown with dorms and dining to promote more student life there. Have them spread out a bit.  
We also should make a cool new museum somewhere close to church street and downtown area something modern and interesting like the mopop in Seattle. 
Make an ""arts district"" around where we put the cool new museum and maybe have an area where it has a normal use during the year but then has a film festival annually and there can be grants for making films in Orlando with it or something along those lines. 


2. Traffic/public transportation 
Automate more of the lights and in turn the crosswalks. It wouldn't take much but it would make it a lot safer for those walking and crossing the streets 
Make a light rail system with stations near the dr Phillips center, the Amway, near Arnold palmer and near the theaters/ science center/ art museum. And to UCF it could also have a connection to the bright line at the mco ? 
Better buss stops and park and rides in outlying suburbs for those who will work in the new corporate areas we hope to bring to Orlando. 
We should also make the bike lanes we have safer for riders and have more dedicated rental bike stations throughout the city. 

3. Housing/businesses 

In the rectangle from 408, orange blossom trl, 50 and i4 we should build stores on bottom apartments/condos on top. Allowing for the mixed use buildings will allow for a better growth. Each block will fairly naturally get a coffee shop/cafe/bakery and a restaurant or two and a small grocery store. Of course there will be more that goes in there but that allows for businesses to thrive and the people in the community that work there can have a chance at living right above where they work. Keeping in mind building restrictions due to the executive airport we could have buildings with up to about 30 stories tall. Incorporating other businesses like movie theaters (say something with 4 or 5 screens) indoor play spaces, daycares and more would also allow for be better city growth for families to want to stay in Orlando proper rather than move to the suburbs. 

With buildings of 30 stories we are able to have about 750 units per maxed out height buildings and that's with 2 stories being dedicated to either dining or commercial use on the base. 


We can incorporate food truck park things which is something they have over in Tampa and that would provide a cool green space that isnt super common. 

On church street we can keep a lot of the clubs and bars but we should add other late night things to do like a bookstore/cafe/ lounge and have one of the arcade monsters set up in downtown. We could also try and do a few more comedy clubs or improv shows. 
Once a month church street could also host a night market sorta event where there is music and art and different like craft shops or demonstrations and a theme for each month like afro influenced art or fiber crafts or other categories to draw people in for not just clubbing.

#Care

Unlike many commonly cultivated orchids, most jewel orchids are terrestrial. However, rather than rooting in dense soil, they creep along the forest floor, nestled in leaf litter. This growth habit often  perplexes first-time growers, as these orchids tend to spread outward rather than necessarily growing upright.

In their native habitats, jewel orchids typically thrive under a unique set of conditions: high humidity, moderate airflow, humus-rich substrate, and low light. Many species experience active growth in spring, summer, and autumn, then bloom in winter.

##Growing Media

Since jewel orchids grow along the forest floor in loose, organic material rather than dense soil, their potting mix should reflect these natural conditions. The ideal medium strikes a balance between providing good airflow and retaining moisture, depending on the humidity levels of your growing environment. When selecting a mix for your jewel orchids, consider the conditions of your space and adjust accordingly.

Made for situations with good airflow. For cloches, closed terrariums, or other humid and still environments, use less bark

###COC‚Äôs three suggested mixes

**Ingredients**

* Loose tree fern fiber
* Peat moss (fine or chunky)
* Perlite
* Sphagnum moss
* Horticultural charcoal

**Mix 1:** loose tree fern fiber (60%), perlite (20%) and horticultural charcoal (20%)

This mix works well in high ambient humidity environments (60%+ RH in a terrarium, vivarium, cup method, etc.).

**Mix 2:** peat moss (40%), perlite (40%) and horticultural charcoal (20%)

This mix works well for low ambient humidity environments from 40%‚Äì50% RH, such as in the home, but is also an option for high ambient humidity environments.

**Mix 3:** sphagnum moss (60%), perlite (20%), and horticultural charcoal (20%)

The key with this mix is to ensure the pot size is small, so that the jewel does not stay wet for a long period of time.

##Light
Jewel orchids thrive in the low-light conditions of the forest floor. For most home growers, this translates to bright shade, such as placement near a north-facing window. Some species, like Ludisia discolor, can tolerate limited direct sunlight.

##Temperature
Jewel orchids grow in a wide range of environments, from tropical jungles to high-elevation forests‚Äîeven near the Arctic Circle. Because of this, it‚Äôs important to check the natural habitat of your specific species or its hybrid parentage. Most jewel orchids prefer intermediate to warm temperatures, typically 15‚Äì25¬∞C (59‚Äì77¬∞F), making them well-suited to typical home conditions.

##Humidity and Watering
In the wild, jewel orchids experience varied rainfall and humidity levels. Many grow in rainforests or montane forests shrouded in mist, thriving in humidity levels of 70‚Äì80%. However, they can adapt to lower humidity in most homes with regular watering. Their preference for high humidity makes them excellent candidates for terrariums or cloches. Some species, particularly those from temperate or arid regions, tolerate drier conditions.

Watering jewel orchids requires balance‚Äîtoo much, and you risk stem rot; too little, and they may struggle. Ideally, allow the media to dry slightly between waterings, especially in high humidity. Temperate-growing species may prefer more pronounced drying periods. Many jewel orchids are sensitive to hard water, so consider using rainwater, distilled, or reverse osmosis water, similar to the care given to carnivorous plants.

##Feeding
Jewel orchids are generally slow to moderate growers, but given ideal conditions, many can be quite vigorous. Patience is key!

Feeding is often unnecessary, and jewel orchids can be sensitive to mineral buildup. If fertilizing, opt for organic methods, applying nutrients directly to the root zone rather than the leaves. Earthworm castings, cricket frass, and rice hulls make excellent additions to the growing medium. Liquid fertilizers like kelp or fish emulsion should be used sparingly‚Äîat no more than ‚Öõ strength.

##Potting

###The Parfait Method

Looking for a way to repurpose single-use plastic? Many disposable containers make excellent makeshift terrariums, perfect for miniature jewel orchids or newly propagated cuttings.

A clear plastic parfait or ice cream cup from a fast-food restaurant works well, but any plastic container‚Äîcoffee cups, large drink cups, or takeout containers‚Äîcan be adapted. To set one up:

Add a drainage layer at the bottom, such as LECA (lightweight expanded clay aggregate), to promote airflow.
1. Fill with an appropriate orchid medium.
2. Plant your jewel orchid.
3. Cover with the lid, sealing any holes with tape if necessary to maintain humidity.

###Houseplant Method

Many jewel orchids can be grown like common houseplants, with a few extra considerations. Ludisia discolor is an excellent beginner-friendly species, as established plants tolerate typical indoor conditions well (low light, occasional watering, and household humidity).

Since jewel orchids spread outward rather than growing upright, wide, shallow pots work best. Choose your container based on your watering habits:

* Plastic pots with drainage holes retain more moisture, which is ideal for growers who need to keep conditions consistently damp.

* Clay pots allow for better airflow and help prevent overwatering if rot is a concern.

* Baskets can also be used for improved drainage.

###Terrariums

Jewel orchids make stunning terrarium plants, and their love of humidity makes enclosed environments especially appealing. However, balancing air circulation and moisture is key.

**Open terrariums** Bowl-shaped containers work well, as they maintain some humidity while allowing for airflow. However, regular watering is necessary.

**Closed terrariums** While they seem ideal, first-time growers often struggle with excessive moisture, leading to rot. A good alternative is scaling up the parfait method using a larger plastic container. When planting in a terrarium, avoid standard substrates used for other plants. Instead, place jewel orchids in a leaf litter layer or a high-humidity, well-draining mix.

Companion plants that thrive alongside jewel orchids include *Begonia*, bromeliads, *Fittonia*, mosses, *Peperomia*, and *Selaginella*. If creating a bioactive terrarium, springtails help control mold and decay, but isopods are not recommended.",5,1744259859.0,Jewelorchids,1,1.0,False
1jvpnzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/grief/comments/1jvpnzz/what_just_happened/,What just happened...,"Hi, I don't really know where to start, so let's just start by saying who I am. I am a 22-year-old young man who was living with his little brother and mother, trying to start his life. Things were not easy all the time, but it was fine since we were close with my brother and shared a passion for motorcycles and mechanics in general. Life was going, and I was about to start a good job position.

**20th February 2025:** Life was good. My little brother was halfway through school vacation. He had spent the week between writing cover letters for future schools he wanted to join, which wasn't a problem for him since he had good grades, going to fast food with friends/girlfriend, and going for rides on a 50cc motorcycle with friends and doing mechanics. We didn't spend much time with him this week, my mom and I, because he was only there at midnight to sleep or be in the garage working on his bike. That night, when I heard him at 1 AM, I saw him sleeping on the couch. He was on his phone and fell asleep while watching some shorts about motorcycles. I tried to wake him up to make him go upstairs to sleep in his bed. He barely woke up, looked at me lost, then fell back asleep. I said, ""Well, I'm going to sleep. I'm not leaving the light on for the night,"" and turned it off.

**21st February 2025:** Woke up at 6 AM to his gym phone alarm downstairs that he forgot to turn off. It always woke him up last because he's a heavy sleeper. I heard my mom waking him up to make him go to his bed before she went to work. He woke up at 10 AM to the noise of his mechanical keyboard and phone calls to his friends. He was whistling happily. I woke up, took a shower, then wanted to get some motorcycle gear. I told him I didn't want to eat too late to go to the shop. He told me the same, saying he needed to go for a ride that afternoon with friends. So, we took some leftovers from yesterday, put them in the microwave. While I was making myself a coffee, he was eating and probably organizing the ride on his phone. I talked to him about the color of my motorcycle shoes, which I needed to change, and he said, ""You don't have any problems in life?"" Then he said he would have done the same thing if he were me.

Later, around 1 PM, I was listening to some music a bit loud when I heard the door slam and him say something like ""later"" or ""bye."" I took the car, went to a motorcycle shop, bought and changed some gear, and went back home around 4:30 PM. The house felt empty‚Äîstrange feeling. I went upstairs, no one was there. I went downstairs and made a coffee. I took the coffee to the computer, put the phone back to normal mode, and saw a bunch of missed calls and messages from my grandma and mom from the past two minutes. My grandma said, ""Call your mom, it's urgent!"" I called my mom, and she was crying, saying, ""It's your brother. The mom of a friend who was riding with him called and said it was really bad, and the emergency services are there."" I kept saying, ""It's okay, it's gonna be okay. He probably fell, that's it..."" I called my dad. He was a bit shocked. I asked, ""Do you know anything?"" He said, ""No, I‚Äôm going to the accident to see what's going on. I'll call you back when I have news."" I called my mom, asked where she was. She was at the train station coming back from work. I took the car and went to the train station to get her. I asked her where the accident was, but she didn't know, so I started saying we should go to the closest hospital because he was probably there if he was injured. My mom was in the passenger seat when my dad called her, crying, saying, ""He's on the side of the road, lying there, and the emergency services are around him..."" The call dropped. I continued to drive to get out of the city. Then my dad called back, and I think I‚Äôve never heard him cry like that. He said, ""He's dead..."" ""No... Why... Oh no... No..."" My mom started to cry too. I pulled the car to the side of the road in shock, turned off the ignition, got out, and took my mom in my arms for a really long time. At that moment, your whole world just falls. Nothing makes sense anymore. You don't believe it. You don't accept it. It can't be... What just happened?

My little brother was 17 years old, had lots of friends, and a girlfriend he was deeply in love with for almost 4 years. He always had good grades. He never wished anything bad on anyone and always apologized when he had an altercation, which was very rare.

My little brother was the closest person I had to me, someone I could tell everything to, someone I could talk to about anything. We had the same interests. I‚Äôm the one who taught him how to shift gears on the motorcycle. We were supposed to ride together and go to the gym when I got back to work. We were planning to go around the whole country to buy a motorcycle together. He was saying, ""What are you going to buy? Would you let me test it in a parking lot? Please!""

Back to **21st February 2025:** After some time, we were able to go home. I went up to my room. His bedroom door was open, the computer was still on, and a website I had never seen before was open, with two pictures of his motorcycle, the one he crashed with, which I saw totally destroyed in a photo taken by people at the crash site. The website was dated in the files from the morning, just before 11:30 AM, the same day. Behind it were the two pictures of his motorcycle, the same ones on the website, taken just before 11 AM. One of them was at the nearest gas station, and his helmet from the crash was on top of the seat. Behind those open tabs on the computer was a cover letter he had written halfway through the morning. It was really hard at that moment...

So, what happened? He was a bit sleepy and happy to ride with his friends. There were three of them riding, including him. In front of him, one of his best friends was in intercom with him, and behind him was a good friend he rode with from time to time. They were going around 80 km/h downhill when they came to a right turn with no visibility, still going downhill. He wasn‚Äôt paying attention for a second and missed the turn, ending up in the opposite lane, where he collided head-on with a car going at the same speed. They both tried to avoid each other by going to the outer side of the road.

The last words his friend heard from him over the intercom were, 'Yeahhhhhh!!!'

At least he died doing what he loved, and he wasn‚Äôt alone.

The crash was so sudden, he probably didn‚Äôt even realize it was happening.

He probably head first to the windshield of the car and died on the spot.

He never wakes up after the crash. The people immediatly gave him CPR then the Emergency shortly arrived and continue CPR for around 30minutes more with no normal vital signs at all.

We believed he died at impact shortly after passing away because of the sudden deceleration.

I've been telling myself for more than a month that, at first, it didn‚Äôt happen, then that what just happened, that it's unfair, that I don‚Äôt accept it. But that doesn't bring him back...

I am not able to go to the cemetery. It's way too hard to face reality. I don‚Äôt know if I would be able to one day, or even if I want to...

Two weeks after the accident, I went to the crash site. There were pieces of the car he crashed into, a tree on the side of the road with flowers, and the headlight of his 50cc, along with some plastics.

Today, it's 6 AM. I did this because I couldn't sleep and needed to put the story somewhere, to at least leave a message here. First, even though it didn‚Äôt help this time, always wear good gear, especially while riding a motorcycle or doing dangerous sports in general. Second, just fuck it ! Enjoy your life and be happy for what you have, because good things do not last forever, and sometimes good things can be taken away really fast...

It's hard for us, but it's even harder to think that he wanted to do so much in life and didn't have the chance to. I keep thinking about it. At some point, I was even having suicidal thoughts because I couldn't see the point in living a life without my brother. The one I always protected...

It's been almost 2 mounth and from 3 weeks after the accident to today i am not able to look back at pictures of him and i still say to myself **What just happened...**

I will keep yall in touch !

For now, I need to focus on taking care of myself and my parents and try to get back to some semblance of normal life.",5,1744259838.0,grief,3,1.0,False

**Here‚Äôs what the MVP does:** You log your *diet and symptoms* using voice.  
Example:  
‚ÄúHey Nora, I just had a coffee and a bagel with tea. My scalp is scaling a lot today.‚Äù

The AI then runs weekly analysis to find patterns between your food and flare-ups, and offers tailored dietary advice.

**The vision goes beyond tracking.** I‚Äôm building *Nora*, an AI voice assistant that acts like a personal psoriasis coach‚Äîsomeone who listens, learns, and actively helps.

**Full roadmap includes:**

* **Tracking:** Sleep, stress, steps, weather (via API/smartwatch)
* **Medical:** Meds, ointments, bowel habits
* **Diet:** Calories, macros/micros, even recipe suggestions
* **Exercise:** Integrated with wearable data
* **Uploads:** Blood test results and more

**Smart support features:**

* Weekly insights
* Reminders: Get sun, take Vitamin D, moisturize on dry days
* Coaching: Stress management, therapy-style interactions
* Lifestyle suggestions: Based on your unique patterns
* Supplement guidance: Informed by labs and symptoms

It‚Äôs not just a tracker. Nora will be a proactive, voice-first health companion‚Äîlogging, analyzing, and coaching you through it.

I know lifestyle and dietary changes aren‚Äôt magic bullets for everyone. But they‚Äôve helped me. If Nora can help even 10 more people the way it helped me, that‚Äôs a win.
