me n’ my buddy are long‑haulers. 15 years on the road, mostly Canada and the Rockies. know each other inside out. 
road gets boring, so we screw with each other a lot. once he tossed a dead snake in my cab. I damn near shit myself all over the seat. we laughed our asses off later.
so three days ago we pull into this Petro‑Can out in the Rockies. I’m outside having a smoke. Fred’s doing the classic “been holding it 200km” power‑waddle to the washroom. couple guys hanging in the doorway with coffee. some beat-to-hell Toyota Corolla squatting right next to us.
the idea hits me.
i text my kid a pic of the truck. tell him to mash it up in that AI app so it looks like a meteor blasted our front.
kid sends it back. I’m fucking losing it.
Fred’s still not back.
honestly: I had that moment of “yeah this is a bad idea.” if his heart quits, I’m the one paying for his wife and kid.
but then I remembered that dead fucking snake and I hit send anyway.
next thing I know: the washroom door damn near flies off the hinges.
Fred bolts for the truck. tearing across the lot. poor guy didn’t even buttoned his pants. 
bout six people watched him run to the truck, spraying shit everywhere.
no clue when he realised it was fake. I damn near died laughing by then.

it’s been 3 days. he doesn’t talk to me. 
I still find it funny as hell to this day.

One of the things I struggle with as someone who absolutely loves (specialty) coffee, is to find cafes that actually allow you to work an hour or 2 from. That's why I'm building [koffiework](https://koffie.work) together with a friend.

I usually end up in a cafe that has great coffee but doesn't allow any laptops at all; or I'd end up in a cafe that allows laptops but the coffee is burned.

Because of that we built a platform that is tackling this; finding specialty coffee spots that allow you to work from. And no, I don't mean the kind of places where you order 1 coffee and stay for 3 hours.

1pd53w3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pd53w3,XPS15 9520 silent mod,"Everyone who owns an XPS knows the pain: beautiful laptop, terrible thermals. The thing ramps its fans even when you’re barely doing anything. And in my case it was even worse — I live in the tropics with ambient temps just under 30°C (≈86°F) + using CAD software all day. 

I almost switched to a Mac just to get rid of the noise, but the software I use is Windows-only. So I was stuck. Either live with the constant fan whining… or fix it myself.

I picked the second option.

What I did, as shown in the photos:

- Bought a second OEM heatsink

- Removed the black powder coating so the bare copper is exposed

- Glued solid copper blocks onto it using a thermal adhesive

- Drilled and tapped M6 threads into the copper blocks and laptop stand

- Cut matching slots into the XPS bottom cover

- Mounted everything by bolting it directly to my aluminum laptop stand (which I travel with anyway)

- Added an Arctic 120 mm slim PWM fan, powered through a DC-DC converter plugged into the laptops USB 

- Running the fan at 7–8 volts, which makes it basically silent

- unplugged CPU and GPU fans from the Mainboard (this causes a slight delay when starting the laptop as it runs a hardware check - currently working on a solution to power up the built in fans just a few seconds for smooth booting) 

Result:
CPU and GPU temps sit around 40–60°C, even under sustained load.
I no longer need ThrottleStop for power limiting. I can run the laptop in the highest performance mode and there’s zero thermal throttling.

And even better — the looks you get when you set this thing up in a coffee shop! 
Worth every minute of the mod.

1pd52el,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/1pd52el/im_tired_i_give_up/,"I’m tired, I give up","My boyfriend (24M) told me a month ago that he wants to transition to a woman, and for me (25M) it was a very heavy blow because I didn’t see it coming.

(From here on, I’ll refer to my partner using she/her.)

We’ve been together for 4 years, the last one long-distance. The relationship was eroding because she had very poor communication skills. For 10 months I asked, cried, begged her to talk to me more; I set up virtual date nights, tried apps, reminders, everything—you can trust me when I say I tried everything.

But she simply didn’t communicate enough. Apparently it’s a personality trait, because when I spoke with her family, they told me she also ignores their messages for days.

Back to the present: we decided to take a month to think things through. Now I’m noticing clear signs of her dysphoria in the past. I even remember asking her several times if she wanted to transition, but she always denied it, so in my innocence and naivety I didn’t look deeper. But now that the truth is out, and with this month of no contact to reflect, I did everything I could. I went to a psychologist specialized in trans topics, researched, asked questions, found this subreddit, met with trans people, and watched many interviews on the topic. I also cried a lot because for almost 15 years of my life I lived as a gay man and had imagined that future, but for my partner I was even willing to rethink my own sexual identity.

I went through all the stages of grief—obsession, crying, anger, detachment, bargaining—while at the same time trying to see how much I could like women. It made me extremely uncomfortable to see a woman sexually, but I tried. That led me to make mistakes because I was forcing myself to change too quickly, which overwhelmed me, made me cry, get angry, frustrated, and constantly give up.

After two weeks I approached everything more calmly, but it was still mentally exhausting. After three weeks, I finally reached a middle ground: I want to try. Not from obligation, but from curiosity and understanding that I am free to leave if I don’t feel comfortable. But this also meant that the challenge of the transition no longer outweighed the communication problems, and that ended up draining me completely.

Because of her terrible communication, you can imagine that the only way to sustain our relationship was to hold on to the beautiful memories of our past and the idea of a wonderful future. When I cried at night feeling alone due to her lack of communication, I reminded myself that this was temporary. Eventually we’d reunite, get married, and live happily together. She is a kind and beautiful person, she just isn’t suited for a long-distance relationship.

But now, with her transition, the whole landscape has changed. I can’t place my hopes on an uncertain future anymore. Wanting to try doesn’t mean it will work out, and being long-distance for another year is too much for me. I can’t keep carrying the weight of a long-distance relationship for another year while at the same time dealing with anxiety and uncertainty about the future.

That’s why I gave up. Today I decided we need to break up. I’m too tired. I wanted to be her boyfriend for life; I wanted to be the first to buy her a dress, brush her hair when it grew longer, braid it, and get married if things worked out. But those are just idealized futures of a relationship that no longer exists.

I wanted to support her transition, defend her from anyone who mistreats her, remind her she’s not doing anything wrong, that she’s a beautiful woman, and that I’m proud of her for being so brave. But I’m too exhausted to handle everything. I can’t deal with bad communication, her transition, and my own identity all clashing constantly.

I could have handled one problem at a time, but all at once, for an entire year, is simply overwhelming. I love her, but I also have to love myself. Maybe, in another future, we could reconnect. But that would only create false hope, so I’ll just tell her that we’re ending things for good, and maybe in a few years we can meet again as two new people—maybe as friends, or just for a coffee before continuing with our lives.",1,1764770764.0,mypartneristrans,0,1.0,False

I have always been a creative and really looking to amp things up. I came across candle making and decided to get things moving with another brand that I will create. 

I made a few shimmer gel ice cubes to add to this old fashioned candle I wanted to test and create. Of course the scents were heavy on the smoke scent side -- the bourbon scent, amber, cedar, some vanilla etc. 

For my own self, when I buy candles they are usually sweeter, baked goods things like that. I didn't really think about the fact that last year a pine candle flared up some wheezing and that I have been sensitive to scents. 

Needless to say. I didn't realize once I added scents it would be THAT strong in the house (will do this outdoors maybe) and of course I had an issue and started with the wheeze. The candle looks decent for my first one (even added a dehydrated orange peel)... but ugh. 

Does anyone else have that issue and have to stay working with more sweet / baked scents instead of things like cedar, amber, heavy smoke smells? 

I don't seem to react to coffee scents, chocolate or anything citrus or warm. I was super bummed out but just started and don't want my ADHD to literally make me throw in the towel. I have so many fun ideas and was so excited but this bummed me out.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

To make things worse, the bus was running more than 30 minutes late.



When it finally arrived, I hopped in, exhausted, only to find a girl lying next to my sleeper seat. I kept checking my ticket again and again, making sure I wasn’t staring at the wrong berth. She lay there, beautifully asleep in her own world. I didn’t want to wake her, but her bags were on my berth — and I couldn’t risk her suddenly waking up to find a stranger lying just centimeters away. That would be creepy, even terrifying.



So, as gently as I could, I said, “Excuse me, I think this is my seat… could you please move your belongings?”



She stirred in mild shock, taking a few seconds to catch reality. I sat down next to her, immediately glued my eyes to my phone, and gave her time to settle in with her things. I didn’t want to disturb her again. But then she softly asked, “Where are we? I need to use the washroom.”



I pointed toward the door, telling her we were still at Thrissur — the driver was checking passengers in. She got down, but as she reached the door, the bus suddenly started moving.

My God. I had just woken someone whose bladder was bursting, only to make her miss the stop. The guilt hit me hard.

To my surprise, a few minutes later, the bus stopped right in front of my house — at a petrol station with a decent washroom. What were the odds?

When she returned, I smiled and said, “That’s actually right in front of my house! I could’ve just walked to the bus if I’d known it stopped here.” She gently smiled. Only then did I realize the driver had halted just for her.

As she settled back, she asked if I’d watched Lokah, the recent blockbuster. I said no, and she grinned, saying, “You look like Venu from the Lokah universe.” I burst out laughing inside — maybe she was still half in her dreams, but I took it as a compliment anyway.



Soon, I tried to sleep — my usual routine: Netflix until my eyes give up. But no position felt right. My back hurt, the screen light stung my eyes, and my mind just refused to shut off. Eventually, I gave up, put my phone aside, and tried to meditate on my breathing. No luck. I sat upright, half closed the curtain for some privacy, and could hear her breathing softly beside me — which slowly turned into a light snore.



Damn. I was jealous. How did she fall asleep so easily, like a baby? 😭



By the time we neared Coimbatore, I gave up entirely and got down for some fresh air. I didn’t want to wake her, but when I returned, she was gone — though her bags were still there. Moments later, she crouched and climbed back into her tiny berth, smiling faintly.



I tried to sleep again, but it was useless. My mind was too awake — perhaps because, deep down, I wasn’t meant to sleep that night. We somehow started talking. I don’t even remember how. But once it began, the conversation never stopped.



I spoke about my recent struggles, and she shared her college trip stories in return. That brought back memories of my own college days — the long nights, the group study sessions, and the proud moment I cleared six or seven backlogs along with my final semester exams. I told her about Joseph, my best friend and motivator who somehow managed to clear every paper with superhuman consistency.



She shared her own struggles with studies — stories from high school and college, of failure, resilience, and small victories. Our laughter slowly filled the bus. Somewhere in the middle of it all, I realized — we hadn’t even introduced ourselves.



“Hi, I’m Harry,” I said.

“Ananya,” she smiled, shaking my hand.



Soon we exchanged Instagram handles, shared family pictures, and talked about our siblings. She told me she was doing her Master’s in Psychology at University. Wow, I thought, she must really love what she does.



The bus stopped again for coffee. My brother Henry — who’d been sleeping, joined us this time. I told him about my sleepless night and introduced him to her. The three of us chatted for a while, enjoying the fresh air before heading back in.



Back on the bus, our conversation picked up right where it left off. That was when I realized — I was feeling lighter. The heaviness I’d carried for days had started to fade. Her presence, her smile, and her passion for psychology brought some quiet strength back into me.



She was different. There was something about her energy — calm, warm, and kind.

I thought to myself, Man, she’s a wizard. 🪄



Then she said it — “You know, I can kind of read people’s minds.”

And she wasn’t joking. She guessed small things about me with uncanny accuracy. I was stunned. Then, without judgment, she offered to listen if I ever needed someone to talk to.



That meant more than she could have known. I’d been silently battling anxiety and mild depression for days. But that night, through her words and her empathy, she somehow helped me tame those thoughts if only for a while.



When dawn broke, we looked out the window, remembering that a meteor shower had been predicted for the same night. The sky was cloudy, the peak time long gone. Still, we stared up, hoping.



By the time we reached Hosur, my bladder gave up. I chatted briefly with the bus driver — a proud man in his early thirties, boasting of his ten-year heavy vehicle license. He drove with precision, avoiding reckless truckers on the highway.



When I got back, she reminded me that our destination was only 45 minutes away.

“Wow, that was quick,” I said, smiling.



Before we parted, she looked at me kindly and said, “If you ever feel low again, reach out. I’ll be there.”



I could’ve cried right there. We barely knew each other, yet she showed such compassion. Maybe the universe really does send us the right people when we need them most.



That night, I didn’t regret a single sleepless minute. She wasn’t just a stranger, she was a spark of light when I needed it most.



As we reached Bangalore, she wished me luck for my interview, and I told her, “Our paths will cross again, I’m sure of it.”



And deep down, I truly believe they will.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

Brief timeline 
Married in 2015, i became dad’s carer. 
2017 I was aunt and mums carer after dad died. Aunt died in 2018 and mum died in 2020. After that I retired after inheriting the estates. 
Fell ill late 2022 and now disabled with a  neuro issue causing distress around loud noises and also balance issues. 
So I’ve been disabled for 3 years now - I still find it hard because I used to care for my mum dad and aunt, when I see an older person my first instinct is to see if I can help and it’s really difficult to accept they’re probably more mobile than I am.
Married for ten years, prior to late 2022 when I fell ill, husband didn’t work (I was working til i became dads carer). Husband was living off the money from a college course, then he sold a small property and lived off of the sale. I was pretty poor receiving around £260 a month in carers allowance. Because he wouldn’t claim anything (cos HE had enough to live on) I had to get money from my parents for car repairs etc. when I inherited the estates I paid for almost everything.

I’m not Einstein material but I’m clever and sensible and can run my accounts, he’s very forgetful and doesn’t pay attention unless it’s in HIS pet projects ie film. Learning languages etc.

In the last few years I’ve realised he’s autistic - very few friendships and no prior relationships, he likely masked it. 

So when I got ill and got out of hospital he was temping in a warehouse. That ended and he unofficially looked after me (hospital got it wrong and said I’d get back to normal before long). 
Finally saw a couple of neuros who said actually you’ll be disabled as you have brain damage (balance issues). They said he could be my carer so we went with that. 
Now he was a bit controlling (hadn’t shown this before) so for 2 years I didn’t get to go out unless it was to doctors etc. he said it would be too much for me but actually in hindsight it was too much work for him.
For the first couple of years when I was v bad I was a little bit spaced, he encouraged me not to push myself so I didn’t improve. 
Start of this year his dad SA’d me and I really pushed myself to get better - went from having to get pushed everywhere to now I can drive, been marked as mentally cognisant (I’d activated a PoA because I was anxious about not being sensible enough), can walk with just a stick most days and don’t use any aids in the house. I do need pushed in a chair in an airport.
June I insisted he stop being my carer, I said he had to go back to work (mainly because I felt he needed the social interaction but also he had no money). He did so and I’ve been trying to get back to my new normal. It’s hard but I’m pushing really hard too.

So end of last month we were on holiday, on way home we’d checked in and he said he’d push the chair. I said loudly ‘after security I’ll go to the bathroom’. We were nearly at security, I hate security so always try to get through straight away. 
He swerved the chair to the bathroom I said no after security and basically insisted I go when he said.
After security I was upset and said please realise I have capacity if I don’t want to go to the bathroom straight away I don’t have to, please don’t treat me like a little child and also please don’t talk to me as if I have learning difficulties because other people see that and talk to me the same way. I’m an adult and I’d like to be treated as one. He got all angry and roared at me ‘well you can just go on holiday yourself’ like a punishment.

Straight after that he was fine - I still felt on edge so cried all the way home.

Had marriage counselling yesterday (lots more issues) and I mentioned this - the counsellor was horrified and said did he realise that I can choose when to go
He seemed shamefaced

After that we went for a coffee and i ordered a latte. He leans across and said ‘is that wise’ because once in ten years the coffee irritated my bowels.

So I said to him I’m allowed to choose what drink I want…..he makes excuses but I’m steadfast and say if I poop myself it’s my fault 🤷‍♀️

So he’s not getting what I was upset the whole day 

Part of me (the generous part) thinks maybe he’s finding it hard to get back to being just a husband but part of me is furious because he’s telling me the day the counsellor spoke to him that I’d be best not having a coffee again like I’m a child

So my mum had bad MH difficulties and she was a bit childlike but I encouraged her and she bloomed under that. Whereas now I feel as though I’m being infantilised

For a long time, “The Hermit” meant the one who disappeared within their dwelling; the one who kept their wisdom hidden; the one who stayed in the cave, in the forest, hidden deep within the veil.

However, there's been a collective shift, and that’s not who the hermits are anymore. In fact, those with the label of ""hermit"" are no longer meant to vanish from the world. Time to spring from your shell, my tortoises 🐢🐢 

Y'all are being pushed, called, or quietly nudged into something new; some sort of integration. In other words, it's time to venture out into society.

You can still meet the witch who lives deep in the forest... but now she’s online sharing her craft with people who genuinely need it.

You can still have those watercooler-level conversations with the Oracle... because even the cave was starting to feel too small for them.

You can literally grab coffee with the tarot reader who used to keep to themselves... and maybe catch them giving a spontaneous reading to someone who didn’t even know they needed one.

🌙 **There's no more hiding

Hermits are to be woven into the world now.**

The modern mystic isn’t separate, unreachable, or sealed off. We’re out here learning, teaching, offering light when things get heavy, and letting ourselves be seen just enough to help. If you’re still learning, still evolving, still figuring out your path, well... think of it this way: you’re exactly where you’re meant to be.

We out here (and there’s room for you too). ✨

Last week, when I was getting coffee, he sat with me and we ended up talking for about 45 minutes. Whenever I went quiet, he’d glance at me and then quickly look away when I noticed. The next day, he did the same, and even when someone else joined to talk about their project, he still included me.

When our office seating changed, he chose to sit beside me, even though we’re on the broader team and don’t work on the same projects. he told me I could attend a meeting he was having with his intern so he could explain something to me. Then he went to my manager and joked that he could “replace” him now. During lunch, he sat very close to me (even though there were many people at the table), and whenever someone made a joke or he makes a joke, i find him looking at me and if he's beside me, he'd lean towards me (too close than necessary but still respectful) and laugh.

After passing FRCR part 2A in late November, it is time to share some of my thoughts on the exam. As a brief disclaimer, I have taken the exam only once (luckily), and my experience is unlikely to be representative of all the exams. So please take it with a grain of salt, especially when it comes to question style. I will also not be discussing specific questions, as it is explicitly prohibited by RCR. This article is mainly on my method for preparing, and some of the things I wish I had or had not done. Hopefully with this, some of you might be able to secure a pass with less time and effort invested.

Below I will go through:

1. Outline of the exam
2. What to expect
3. A brief review of the resources
4. How to study
5. Final optimisations

# 1. Outline of the exam

This is no secret and I think RCR has done their best to ensure the format of the exam is well known by candidates. Please go through the official website on part 2a: [https://www.rcr.ac.uk/exams-training/rcr-exams/clinical-radiology-exams/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a/](https://www.rcr.ac.uk/exams-training/rcr-exams/clinical-radiology-exams/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a/). There are even a few sample questions, which I will go through a bit later.

To summarise:

* 2 papers, each 120 questions each
* MCQ format, with 5 options for each question
* 6 main topics, with 40 questions each: cardiothoracic and vascular, MSK, GI, Paeds, CNS and H&N, GU/adrenal/O&G/breast (there are some IR or NM questions mixed in, but they are not common)

Historical pass mark (from the various sources and reddit posts): 145-155/240

# 2. What to expect

I have read a lot of comments on reddit and also asked most of the seniors in my training centre who have taken the exam in the past 5 years, the universal opinion is this: exam questions are very different from any question bank/ book available on the market currently. And I do agree with the assessment. The main difference is that it is more of an exam on clinical knowledge rather than just imaging features. Just as in real life, the clinical context is much more important than the image itself in certain scenarios, since pathologies show significant overlap in terms of imaging features (e.g. deep brain MRI signal abnormalities, enhancing brain mass etc.).

Let's look at a real example (provided by RCR on their site - [https://www.rcr.ac.uk/exams-training/rcr-exams/clinical-radiology-exams/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a-understanding-the-starsba-formatstar/](https://www.rcr.ac.uk/exams-training/rcr-exams/clinical-radiology-exams/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a/frcr-part-2a-radiology-cr2a-understanding-the-starsba-formatstar/), saying this just so I won't be hounded by them):

*A 27 year old man presents with a one month history of headache, nausea and vomiting. He is referred to a neurologist who finds a raised haematocrit and requests an MR scan. The MR scan shows a peripheral left cerebellar hemisphere part cystic and part solid lesion with an enhancing mural nodule, in contact with the pial surface.*

*What is the most likely diagnosis?*

*A. gangliocytoma*

*B. haemangioblastoma*

*C. metastasis*

*D. pilocytic astrocytoma*

*E. pleomorphic xanthoastrocytom*

The correct answer is B. Without any prior knowledge (which I hope you have stumbled upon what I have written before having studied much), you might think that the discriminating factor is the mixed cystic-solid nature and enhancing mural nodule in the cerebellum that indicates the diagnosis of haemangioblastoma. However, actually options B to D can manifest as such. The key differentiating factor here is the age of the patient - a young adult. Haemangioblastoma is the most common in the age group, and hence is the most likely option out of the 3. Notice that if the patient is an elderly, even with all else kept the same, the most likely option would be changed to metastasis (RCC, also associated with polycythaemia and prone to haematogenous spread). You might think this is quite unfair, but if anyone of you has written MRI with seniors before, you will know that the differential diagnoses given and the ordering is more influenced by the population, presentation and location of the lesion, rather than the signal characteristics of the lesion itself.

Some of my seniors describe the exam as a 'keyword' game, as in identifying the keywords associated with each disease will give you the answer (i.e. oesophageal calcified mass = leiomyoma; lytic lesion in distal radius extending to articular surface = giant cell tumour etc.). I think this partly describes the exam. While it is about keywords, 'slamdunk' questions that hinges on 1 keyword/ imaging feature are uncommon. Instead, there will usually be 2-3 pathologies with highly similar imaging features, and you will have to use other keywords/ features (usually not imaging features) to eliminate the less likely options.

My metaphor and personal strategy is to imagine myself as a detective/ Sherlock Holmes. As our most famous detective once said, 'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth'. Try to gather all the keywords first that might be useful in the question before choosing an answer, otherwise you might be trapped by the question setter.

And remember, not all keywords/ features are created equal. Some are more important than others. My personal ***'evidence hierarchy'*** is as follows: ***age, gender, presentation/ Ix results > location > significant negatives > morphology > signal***. Let me further illustrate:

* Age, gender, presentation: Highly highly important and very useful in excluding options. E.g. in a 2-week-old newborn with new onset cyanosis, I don't care if the blood oxygen saturation is <10%, the answer will not be transposition of great arteries. They should be blue from birth.
* Significant negatives: I always remind myself that the question setters are busy attendings/ professors with highly lucrative private practices. If they spend the time and effort to talk about something that is not present in the patient, you bet it will help you eliminate at least 1 of the options.
* Morphology/ signal: Least important in the hierarchy. Not a lot of questions (and diagnosis in real life) will depend on this, other than the occasional T1 bright/ T2 dark lesion. The flip side is, if your answer is consistent with all the other features but seems not to correspond with the signal characteristics, you are still more likely to be correct. First of all, nobody can study and retain every single detail of every pathology in the world before the exam. Just because the lesion has some calcification doesn't mean you are wrong. Nearly everything can have calcifications if you look at Statdx/ pubmed. Chances are you just haven't studied it. Secondly, signal characteristics are highly variable. My favourite example is a cystic lesion. While you might think it has to be CT hypodense, MRI T1 hypo- and T2 hyperintense because of its water content, cyst can be proteinaceous/ haemorrhagic, making it hyperdense and T1 hyperintense. It can even have some thin rim calcifications.

Just so you won't go and spend 12hrs a day to study everything in Dahnert Radiology Review Manual (3000+ pages holy mother of god), there are few questions that are on super rare diseases. Just as Lionhart said, if it comes down to these questions, you have already failed. You will have heard of all the options and have studied most of them (if you go through the resources I have mentioned in the following section). The difficulty is from incomplete/ hidden/ disguised information. Don't panic even if none of the options seems right on the first glance. Use the 'evidence hierarchy' and choose the most likely option.

# 3. Resources

**Question books:** As I have mentioned above, and echoed by my seniors and many disappointed/ exasperated part 2a takers on reddit, these do not mimic the real exam. You should still try to do them to gain a knowledge base, but nothing more than that. Don't fixate too much on the non-scenario based questions, as these again are not common in the exam.

**Textbooks/databases:** the main ones I have used

Crack the Core series by Prometheus Lionhart

\> Pros:

* The book includes a lot of the useful features that distinguish between similar diseases.
* Also contains highly testable trivia. Answer to most of the questions I have encountered could be found here.
* Funny, depends on who you ask.

\> Cons:

* Some portions of it are organised in a system based approach rather than a ddx approach.
* Some of the diseases included could probably not be examined in a text based approach, usually because the imaging features are too specific (e.g. lipoid pneumonia), and hence would not appear in part 2a.
* Offensive, depends on who you ask.

Statdx:

\> Pros:

* Comprehensive, include content on common age and clinical presentation.
* A specific section on 'best diagnostic clue' and differential diagnosis, highly useful for 2a.
* Very organised and with imaging features grouped by imaging modality.

\> Cons:

* It is a search engine, you have to know what you are searching for and hence not usable when you are a blank page.

Chapman & Nakielny's Aids to Radiological Differential Diagnosis:

\> Pros:

* Organised by ddx according to imaging features. Some sections (arthritis, bone lesion etc.) have very detailed description on differentiating between diseases, and very useful in the exam.
* Classic textbook written by full-blooded British, hence is more likely read by your full-blooded British question setter.
* Part 2 is dedicated to common syndromes, listing some of the less common manifestations and highly testable.

\> Cons:

* Quite dry and only in point form, probably doesn't aid in understanding/ memorising.
* A lot of the sections are quite short and not exam-oriented, meaning you need to spend a lot of time to dig for usable info.

Other online resources worth a mention: RadiologyCafe

# 4. Study plan

The main goal when studying is to try to organise the diseases in a ddx manner (for example cystic lung diseases, fibrotic lung diseases, neonatal cardiomegaly with plethora/oligaemia, metaphyseal lytic lesions etc.) and note down their key differentiating features (age, gender, clinical presentation, imaging features etc.). Try to summarise them into table/ single sentences. Think about how these diseases relate to each other, how they are similar and how they are different. This way you'll remember both of them better.

When making tables, limit yourself to 2 or 3 differential diagnoses. Most of the time when answering questions you are only struggling between 2-3 highly similar options. Making tables with 10+ diseases might be comprehensive, but do not help you in answering questions.

How to use the resources:

* Crack the Core is a must. If you like the humour, great. If you don't, I guess you can burn it after the exam. Read it cover to cover, there is no way around it.
* Statdx: I wish I have used it more extensively earlier. This way I would not have spent as much time on summarising features of different diseases from different sources. I would also have read all the key differentiating features in their ddx section, to save time trying to come up with my own framework.
* Chapman is not really a necessary read and to be honest probably not a good investment of your time reading cover-to-cover. I'll try to list the sections that are useful in the end. I would reference it when I come across a disease and am not sure where it fits in the big picture.

I personally think 6 months of study is way more than enough for the exam. In terms of importance, in descending order:

* Must do: Crack the Core, making tables
* Good to do: Statdx, question books/banks
* If you have time: Chapman

# 5. Final optimisations

Assuming you have done all the prep work mentioned above, you should be able to pass the exam. Some of the non-study optimisations that could be done:

1. Depending on your exam site, you might be taking the exam at a weird time (i.e. late afternoon, early evening). Adjust your sleep schedule accordingly at least a week before so you will be most alert during the exam. Time your meals and caffeine intake as well, so you won't be too full and sleepy, or holding in your Venti Starbucks coffee.
2. Don't study on the day of the exam! You need to preserve the brain power for the exam. Thinking about 120 questions and eliminating 480 distractors is tiring.

This is all I can think of when it comes to studying for part 2a, without going into specific questions of course. If you still have any questions about the exam, feel free to post it below. I promise to read them and reply as soon as possible (though I really need a rest after the exam). Wish you all the best of luck with the exam!!! As a side note, I have started an Instagram account to talk about FRCR exam related info, and am planning to go through some mock part 2a style questions in the future. Feel free to follow me at [RadiologyNote](https://www.instagram.com/radiologynote/?hl=en). I really appreciate the support from all of you guys!

# Appendix: Useful sections in Chapman

For the longest time I was chasing the “perfect” morning routine, the “perfect” productivity system, the “perfect” version of myself. I’d beat myself up on the days I slept in, didn’t journal, skipped the gym, or doom-scrolled instead of reading that book on my nightstand. I genuinely thought I was failing at life because I wasn’t consistent 100% of the time.

Then this morning I woke up late (again), spilled coffee on my white shirt, and still somehow managed to have a really good day. I got my work done, laughed with my coworkers, cooked a decent dinner, and called my mom. Nothing “perfect.” Nothing went according to the plan in my head.
And I felt… happy. Truly happy.

It finally clicked: I’ve been treating self-improvement like a performance review instead of a lifelong relationship with myself. Relationships have messy days. They have seasons. Sometimes you show up 110%, sometimes you’re running on fumes and still doing your best with what you have that day.

The real win isn’t being perfect every single day. The real win is refusing to abandon yourself when you’re not.
So if you’re reading this and you’ve been harsh on yourself lately because you “fell off the wagon”, please be gentle. You’re still in the game. You woke up today. You’re here trying. That counts for way more than we give it credit for.

1pd4kov,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1pd4kov/best_vpn_for_popcorn_time/,Best VPN for Popcorn Time,"Popcorn Time has become synonymous with easy streaming, but using it without proper protection exposes you to significant privacy and legal risks. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can monitor your activity, copyright holders can track your IP address, and you could face throttling, warning letters, or worse—legal action.

The solution? A reliable VPN designed specifically for torrenting and P2P streaming. But not just any VPN will work—you need one with verified no-logs policies, automatic kill switches, fast P2P servers, and strong encryption.

In this guide, I'll break down the **best VPNs for Popcorn Time in 2025**, what features matter most, and how to use them effectively to protect your privacy while streaming.

# Why You Need a VPN for Popcorn Time

Before diving into VPN recommendations, let's address why using Popcorn Time without a VPN is dangerous.

# The Legal Gray Area

Popcorn Time itself is legal software—it's simply a BitTorrent client with an integrated media player. However, streaming copyrighted content without authorization violates copyright laws in most countries. While the app doesn't host content, it connects you to torrents that often contain copyrighted material.

**Important:** This guide focuses on protecting your privacy and security while using Popcorn Time. We do not condone copyright infringement. Always ensure you have legal rights to access the content you stream.

# Your ISP is Watching

When you use Popcorn Time, your ISP can see:

* That you're using BitTorrent protocol
* Your IP address connected to torrent swarms
* The files you're downloading and sharing

Many ISPs actively monitor P2P traffic and may:

* **Throttle your internet speed** during torrenting
* **Send DMCA notices** on behalf of copyright holders
* **Terminate your service** for repeated violations
* **Share your information** with legal authorities

# Copyright Trolls Track Your IP

Copyright enforcement firms monitor popular torrents and log every IP address in the swarm. Without a VPN, your real IP address is visible to everyone in the torrent network, making you an easy target for:

* Legal threats and settlement demands
* Fines ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars
* Court summons in extreme cases

# Privacy and Security Risks

Beyond legal concerns, using Popcorn Time without protection exposes you to:

* **Malware risks** from infected torrent files
* **Hacker surveillance** of your online activity
* **Data leaks** exposing your location and identity
* **Man-in-the-middle attacks** on unsecured connections

A quality VPN encrypts all your traffic, masks your IP address, and ensures that even if your connection drops, your real identity stays hidden.

# What Makes a Good VPN for Popcorn Time?

Not all VPNs are created equal when it comes to Popcorn Time. Here are the essential features you need:

# 1. Verified No-Logs Policy

Your VPN should have a **strict, independently audited no-logs policy**. This means the provider doesn't track, store, or record your IP address, browsing history, connection times, or downloaded files.

Look for VPNs that have been audited by reputable firms like:

* Deloitte
* PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers)
* Cure53

If your VPN keeps logs, they could be forced to hand over your data to authorities—defeating the entire purpose of using a VPN.

# 2. Automatic Kill Switch

This is **non-negotiable** for Popcorn Time users. A kill switch automatically blocks all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly. Without it, your real IP address could be exposed to the torrent swarm during those critical seconds.

The best VPNs offer:

* **System-wide kill switch**: Blocks all internet traffic
* **App-level kill switch**: Only blocks specific apps like your torrent client

# 3. P2P-Optimized Servers

Many VPNs claim to support torrenting but secretly throttle P2P traffic or only allow it on limited servers. You need a VPN that:

* Explicitly allows P2P on all or most servers
* Has **dedicated P2P-optimized servers** for maximum speed
* Doesn't impose bandwidth caps or data limits

# 4. Fast Connection Speeds

Popcorn Time streams large video files in real-time, so speed matters. Look for VPNs that:

* Use modern protocols like **WireGuard** or **NordLynx** for optimal performance
* Maintain speeds close to your base connection (minimal slowdown)
* Have servers geographically close to your location

# 5. Strong Encryption Standards

Your VPN should use **military-grade AES-256 encryption** to make your data unreadable to ISPs, hackers, and surveillance agencies.

# 6. DNS and IP Leak Protection

Even with a VPN, configuration errors can leak your real IP or DNS requests. The best VPNs include:

* Built-in DNS leak protection
* IPv6 leak protection
* WebRTC leak blocking

# 7. Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction

Ideally, your VPN should be based outside the **Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and 14 Eyes** intelligence-sharing alliances. Countries like Panama, Switzerland, and the British Virgin Islands have strong privacy laws and aren't required to share user data with foreign governments.

# How to Use a VPN with Popcorn Time (Step-by-Step)

Once you've chosen a VPN, follow these steps to set it up properly:

# Step 1: Subscribe and Install Your VPN

1. Choose a VPN from the list above (I recommend **NordVPN** for most users)
2. Sign up for a long-term plan to get the best pricing
3. Download the VPN app for your device (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux)
4. Install and log in with your credentials

# Step 2: Configure Your VPN Settings

Before connecting, optimize these settings:

**Enable the Kill Switch:**

* Go to Settings/Preferences
* Find ""Kill Switch"" or ""Network Lock""
* Turn it ON (critical for Popcorn Time)

**Enable DNS Leak Protection:**

* Usually enabled by default
* Verify it's active in Settings

**Choose the Right Protocol:**

* Select **WireGuard** or **NordLynx** for best speeds
* These modern protocols balance security and performance

# Step 3: Connect to a P2P Server

1. Open your VPN app
2. Select a server optimized for P2P/torrenting:
   * **NordVPN**: Choose from ""Specialty Servers"" → ""P2P""
   * **Surfshark**: Any server works
   * **ExpressVPN**: Any server works
   * **PIA**: Any server works
   * **CyberGhost**: Select ""For Torrenting"" category
3. Connect to a server close to your physical location for best speeds

# Step 4: Verify Your Connection

**Before opening Popcorn Time**, confirm your VPN is working:

1. Visit [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) or [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com/)
2. Verify your IP shows the VPN server location (not your real location)
3. Run an extended test to check for DNS leaks
4. Confirm no leaks are detected

# Step 5: Download Popcorn Time Safely

**Important:** Only download Popcorn Time from the official source at **popcorn-time.site**. Many fake sites distribute malware.

1. With VPN connected, visit the official Popcorn Time website
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. Install Popcorn Time
4. Keep your antivirus software updated

# Step 6: Start Streaming with Popcorn Time

1. Make sure your VPN is connected
2. Open Popcorn Time
3. Browse and select content to stream
4. The VPN encrypts all your P2P traffic automatically

# Step 7: Test Your Kill Switch

To ensure your kill switch works properly:

1. Start streaming something in Popcorn Time
2. Disconnect your VPN manually
3. Your internet should immediately cut off
4. Popcorn Time should stop streaming
5. If you can still browse or stream, your kill switch isn't working—fix this immediately

# Free VPNs vs Paid VPNs for Popcorn Time

You might be tempted to use a free VPN for Popcorn Time. **Don't.**

# Why Free VPNs Are Dangerous

**1. No P2P Support**  
Most free VPNs explicitly block torrenting and P2P traffic.

**2. Data Logging**  
Free VPNs often log and sell your browsing data to advertisers—the exact opposite of what you need.

**3. Bandwidth Caps**  
Streaming a single HD movie on Popcorn Time can use 2-5GB of data. Free VPNs cap you at 500MB-10GB per month.

**4. Slow Speeds**  
Free VPNs throttle speeds to encourage upgrading, making HD streaming impossible.

**5. Security Risks**  
Many free VPNs have been caught distributing malware or failing to encrypt traffic properly.

**6. No Kill Switch**  
Most free VPNs lack kill switches, meaning your real IP will leak when the connection drops.

# The Math Makes Paid VPNs Worth It

At just $1.99-$2.99/month, a premium VPN costs less than a single coffee. Consider what you're protecting:

* Your privacy and anonymity
* Avoiding potential legal fees (thousands of dollars)
* Preventing ISP throttling
* Protecting against malware

For $24-36 per year, premium VPNs eliminate all these risks while delivering unlimited bandwidth and blazing-fast speeds.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Can I use Popcorn Time without a VPN?

Technically yes, but it's extremely risky. Your ISP can see your torrenting activity, your IP is visible to copyright trolls, and you're vulnerable to legal notices or worse. A VPN is essential for protecting your privacy.

# Is Popcorn Time legal?

The Popcorn Time software itself is legal—it's just a BitTorrent client. However, streaming copyrighted content without authorization violates copyright laws in most countries. Using a VPN doesn't make copyright infringement legal; it only protects your privacy.

# Will a VPN slow down my Popcorn Time streaming?

Modern VPNs using WireGuard or NordLynx protocols typically reduce speeds by only 3-8%. For most users with decent internet connections, this slowdown is barely noticeable and won't affect HD streaming.

# Do all VPNs work with Popcorn Time?

No. Many VPNs block P2P traffic, lack kill switches, or log user data. Only use VPNs explicitly designed for torrenting with verified no-logs policies like the ones recommended in this guide.

# Can my ISP detect I'm using Popcorn Time with a VPN?

Your ISP can see that you're connected to a VPN, but they cannot see what you're doing through it. Your Popcorn Time activity is completely encrypted and hidden from your ISP.

# What happens if my VPN disconnects while streaming?

If you have a kill switch enabled (which you should), your internet connection will immediately cut off, preventing your real IP from being exposed. Without a kill switch, your IP could leak to the torrent swarm.

# Which VPN protocol should I use for Popcorn Time?

Use **WireGuard** (or **NordLynx** on NordVPN, or **Lightway** on ExpressVPN). These modern protocols offer the best balance of speed and security for streaming.

# Can I use a VPN on my smart TV or streaming device?

Yes, but it depends on the device. Most smart TVs don't natively support VPN apps. Options include:

* Installing the VPN on your router (protects all devices)
* Using a VPN-enabled Fire Stick or Android TV box
* Sharing a VPN connection from your computer

# How much does Popcorn Time use in bandwidth?

Approximate bandwidth usage:

* SD quality: 0.7-1.5 GB per hour
* HD (720p): 2-3 GB per hour
* Full HD (1080p): 3-5 GB per hour
* 4K: 7-15 GB per hour

Use unlimited bandwidth VPNs for heavy streaming.

# Final Recommendation

After testing dozens of VPNs with Popcorn Time, **NordVPN** emerges as the clear winner for most users. It offers the perfect balance of:

* Blazing-fast P2P servers
* Proven no-logs policy with multiple audits
* Advanced security features
* User-friendly interface
* Reasonable pricing

However, if you're on a tight budget, **Surfshark** delivers premium features at just $1.99/month with unlimited device connections—unbeatable value.

For beginners who want the simplest experience, **ExpressVPN** justifies its higher price with exceptional ease of use and industry-leading audits.

**Remember:** Using Popcorn Time without a VPN exposes you to serious privacy and legal risks. Spending $2-3 per month on a quality VPN is a small price to pay for peace of mind and unrestricted streaming.

Stay safe, stream smart, and enjoy your content without worry.

1pd4g3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmAmazon/comments/1pd4g3g/how_to_clean_adult_coloring_books_after/,How to clean adult coloring books after accidental spills?,"Spilled coffee or juice on your favorite adult coloring book? Don't panic. You can often save your artwork with quick action and the right approach.

**Act Fast**

The moment a spill happens, grab a clean paper towel or cloth and gently blot the liquid. Don't rub or wipe - that'll smudge your colored pencils or markers and damage the paper. Just press down lightly to soak up as much moisture as possible.

**Drying Techniques**

Once you've blotted the spill, you need to dry the pages properly. Place a clean, dry paper towel on both sides of the wet page. Close the book and put something heavy on top, like a textbook or cutting board. This helps absorb remaining moisture while keeping pages flat.

Change the paper towels every 30 minutes until the page feels dry. This usually takes a few hours. If you're in a hurry, you can use a hairdryer on the cool setting, but keep it at least 6 inches away from the page.

**Dealing With Different Spills**

Water spills are easiest to handle. The coloring usually stays intact if you act quickly.

Sugary drinks like soda or juice leave sticky residue. After blotting, lightly dampen a clean cloth with plain water and gently dab the sticky area. Then follow the drying steps above.

Coffee and tea might leave stains on white areas, but your colored sections should survive. Focus on saving your artwork rather than the blank spaces.

**Preventing Future Accidents**

Keep drinks away from your coloring area. Use a side table or coaster at least an arm's length from your book. You can also place your adult coloring books on a protective mat or large tray while working.

Consider getting books with thicker paper. They handle moisture better than thin pages. You'll find plenty of options with quality paper that resists bleeding and warping at [this collection of adult coloring books](https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books).

**When Pages Are Too Damaged**

Sometimes a page is beyond saving. If the paper wrinkles badly or colors bleed everywhere, you have options. Carefully remove the damaged page with scissors or a craft knife along the binding. Most coloring books let you do this without affecting other pages.

You could also color the same design again on fresh paper. Many publishers offer downloadable versions of their pages. Or browse through [various adult coloring books here](https://athomewave.com/adult-coloring-books) to find similar designs you love.

**Storage Tips**

Store your coloring books flat on a shelf, not standing upright. This prevents pages from warping over time. Keep them away from humid areas like bathrooms or basements where moisture can damage paper quality.

Remember, accidents happen to everyone. A small spill doesn't mean your coloring book is ruined. With quick thinking and proper drying, you'll likely save your page and keep enjoying your relaxing hobby.",1,1764769236.0,UmmAmazon,0,1.0,False
1pd4esz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pd4esz/i_have_the_looks_and_attention_everyone_wants_but/,"I have the looks and attention everyone wants, but I feel disconnected from life","I’m 27, male, and I want to make it clear that I’m not writing this to brag. I’m sharing this because I can’t talk about it with my friends. I don’t want them to think I’m flexing or trying to sound proud of myself. The truth is, I feel like something is wrong with me, and I don’t know how to deal with it.

People often tell me I’m attractive or charismatic. When I’m out with friends, whether we’re grabbing coffee or just walking around in public, random girls will smile, flirt, or try to start conversations. And the strange part is that I don’t react the way people expect me to. Instead of feeling flattered or confident, I feel shy and taken aback. Not because the attention is new, but because I don’t feel anything at all anymore. My mind goes blank, and my body reacts instinctively, like I’m suddenly in danger, even though nothing bad is happening. It’s confusing and exhausting.

What people don’t see is that I’ve been dealing with social anxiety and emotional numbness for years. The attention doesn’t make me feel good. It just feels heavy and draining. It doesn’t feel like connection. It feels like pressure.

This goes back to when I was around 14. Throughout high school, college, and even up to age 24, my relationships were chaotic and painful. Almost every year I had one or two girlfriends, but none of the relationships ever felt stable or secure. Eventually I stopped trying with girls I liked or who liked me, because both romantic and platonic connections felt unsafe. I became hyper aware of every tone, every reaction, every little shift in energy. I learned that opening up often meant getting hurt. Whenever someone saw the real me, they either left or used it against me. Over time, I just stopped showing who I really was.

Even with old friends now, sometimes I feel uncomfortable around them. I catch myself wondering if everyone is faking it or if I’m just missing some invisible social code. It can feel exhausting, and I don’t really understand why it hits me so hard. Most of the time, I just want to go home, be alone, and focus on my own things without anyone around me.

Now at 27, it feels like I’m living inside a good-looking shell while the real me stays buried underneath. People see the surface, not the person beneath.

When someone flirts with me, I don’t feel confident or appreciated. I feel anxious, irritated, and pressured to act like the charming guy they assume I am. It makes me want to withdraw even more. It’s like I can only interact with people through a mask.

I’ve also gone through unhealthy phases, drinking heavily, chain-smoking, using drugs, and hiding behind being the “popular” guy. I was well known in my city for esports and trading, and now I’m doing well financially and career-wise. But even with good money, nothing changes emotionally. I don’t feel fulfilled. My mind often feels empty, like static. Some days it’s like my brain is a TV with no signal, just noise but nothing clear.

As I get older, I see people around me settling down, building stable lives, and enjoying the small moments. And I feel a growing distance between their world and mine.

I don’t know how to settle. I can see a sunset, a quiet night, or a small act of kindness, and I understand it’s supposed to feel meaningful. But I can’t feel it deeply. It’s like my emotions are muted.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m so guarded and traumatized that I shut myself down. Other times, I’m scared something is fundamentally wrong with me. It feels like I’m drifting through life, functioning but not fully alive inside.

Everyone else seems to have a full, rich emotional world, and mine feels quiet and distant.

What makes everything harder is the pressure to act like the “put together guy.” I’m scared that if someone gets close, they’ll see how disconnected, lost, or empty I actually feel. I worry that I’m pretending to be someone I’m not.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of disconnect? When your looks or charisma attract people, but your inner world pushes them away? How do you stop resenting the image people see and reconnect with the part of yourself you feel like you’ve lost?",1,1764769151.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

it’s not luck. it’s not the ad spend. it’s how they communicate - and how they reinvent without losing their core.

look at:
• ryanair - low-budget airline, high-impact social strategy; memes, honesty, and personality built a cult following.
• spotify - turned data into culture; “wrapped” is now an annual global obsession.
• netflix - hyperlocal campaigns, sharp humor, and content moments that dominate conversations.
• starbucks - doesn’t just sell coffee; sells routine, comfort, and personal ritual.
• apple - simplicity so powerful it became a luxury category of its own.

then you have brands that once dominated but now barely spark a conversation - not because they ran out of money, but because they ran out of story.
why?

because brands lose when they:
• drift away from their voice
• chase every trend they see
• forget why people connected with them
• evolve the product but not the narrative

so here’s the real question for discussion:
which of these giants is marketing at its peak right now - and which one is quietly slipping? and more importantly - why?

1pd46iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pd46iw/the_doctrine_of_useful_idiots/,The Doctrine of Useful Idiots,"Ambassador Festius of the Vashtu Directorate, Discoverer of Humanity, Accidental Saviour of the Galaxy, Eternal Sufferer of Council Idiocy, and Devoted Viewer of human YouTuber Chapter Master Valrak, liked to think he was a patient being.

He had endured wars, plagues, invasions, philosophical movements, and once an entire four hours in a Karaoke Bar in Manchester, to put it frankly he was used to dealing with idiots.

But nothing tested his patience like introductions to new species, some were outright xenophobic and hostile, others were smug and condescending, until he discovered humans.

Festius Discovered Earth purely by accident on a little holiday in the dead zone of the Orion Arm, he released almost immediately that he was starting to Lose his sanity

Humanity, he quickly learned, was a species that had:

* split the atom twice just to see if the second time was funnier
* created the Internet and immediately filled it with memes and porn
* Explaining why American football is called baby rugby by everyone except Americans
* developed a fictional universe so grimdark that several alien species needed therapy after reading the wiki

And humanity’s crown jewel, its philosopher and king of lore was an aging and balding YouTuber named Chapter Master Valrak.

Festius adored him immediately, his quaint falling off a roof story that had spawned a drinking game which had actually killed people, his half-hearted denials of working for Games Workshop despite being on their board and his hilarious claims to being black listed all added to his naïve childlike charm.

Festius binge watched hundreds of hours, even though ""human Warhammer lore"" counted as psychological torture under six interstellar conventions.

But the heart wants what it wants and so Festius sponsored humanity for Council admission.

This proved to be the single most consequential blunder in galactic history.

Humans joined the Council with an enthusiasm never before seen, almost instantly, chaos erupted.

The Council’s daily schedule, once filled with dull but important matters like “border conflict negotiations” and “quantum trade disputes” was now filled with:

* “Emergency Karaoke Restriction Hearings”
* “Investigation Into Human Use of Ancient Relic as a Cup Holder”
* “Petition: Ban Humanity from Helping with Anything, ever”
* “Cultural Misunderstanding Session #88: Why You Do NOT Pat the Haluun on the Head”

But then something strange happened.

Wars stopped completely

Civil disputes died down and races got on together

Whole sectors forgot their ancient hatreds as they instead cooperatively filed human-related grievances.

Humanity, through sheer, oblivious chaos had become the lynchpin of galactic peace.

They weren’t diplomats, nor where they warriors.

They were strategic distractions.

The Council officially classified them as:

Species 405-C: Useful Idiots (Critical to Galactic Stability).

And life was good, the galaxy prospered like never before.

Then Human Ambassador Jennifer Patel declared one morning in the galactic council chamber:

“Humanity will now strive to fit in and behave responsibly”

It was the single most alarming sentence ever spoken in the Council chamber that left many a diplomat stunned into silence.

Within a week:

* No karaoke complaints.
* No accidental extradimensional breaches.
* No teaching alien children the NSW Rugby League rules.
* No science experiments labelled “probably fine.”
* No cultural misunderstandings requiring seventeen apologies and a fruit basket.

The complaint docket emptied and Ambassadors milled about in confusion, they had nothing to do.

And the galaxy immediately began tearing itself apart.

Ancient wars reawakened.  
Trade federations collapsed.  
Civil wars reignited.  
Four financial systems crashed after having time to actually check their books.

The Galactic Council panicked and a desperate delegation, led by Festius burst into the Human Embassy.

“Humans!” he cried. “You must stop improving yourselves!”

Patel blinked. “We thought you wanted fewer… incidents.”

“We don’t!” Festius wailed. “Your chaos is the glue holding civilization together!”

A Haluun delegate bowed, melodramatic in every fold of their mantle.

“You must return to your natural cultural state: insane, stupid, or preferably both”

Patel raised an eyebrow “so you want us to go back to how we were?”

The Council screamed in unison “YES!”

The next day:

* A human scientist accidentally invented “reverse coffee” and briefly un-aged a Klarnaxi ambassador.
* Someone mixed vodka with a quantum battery, Space was sticky for hours.
* A wormhole was opened to a dimension made entirely of sentient bread.
* And the Vorak requested a fourth ban on baby rugby as wearing pads is “ghey”

The docket filled, war talk vanished, the galaxy stabilised.

Peace, stupid, pointless, structurally idiotic peace returned.

Festius, relieved that reality wasn't collapsing, finally returned to what truly mattered

Watching his beloved Chapter Master Valrak, he wiped away a tear as he remembers how the universe had been unkind to the beloved human lore master.

Centuries earlier, Valrak had been at the top of his game, scamming millions from unsuspecting Lore fans and then as all things do, his downfall, tragically and suspiciously he was converted into a servo-skull by one of his less than loyal followers, a fan known only as Dakka.

Dakka claimed Valrak had “ascended into peak lore delivery form”

But Games Workshop claimed this was “unlicensed copy right infringement” and sued Valrak for millions.

Valrak himself (now a floating skull with a GoPro and a backpack of battery packs) simply resigned himself to his fate and said “Alright lads, we’re going to break down these new leaks”

Dakka kept Servo-Skull Valrak as a toy “for enrichment purposes” until a landmark ruling in the 24^(th) century Terran Supreme Court determined “Servo-Skull Valrak is barely intelligent and only passes for sentience in the broadest sense and legally permitted to continue making videos”

He was freed, plugged into a charger and started to immediately resumed uploading videos to an unsuspecting galaxy.

Festius watched all of it with reverence.

And now, at last after restoring the galaxy’s equilibrium through diplomatic begging, he dimmed his lights, made a pot of Verdani blooming tea, and turned on the newest upload.

“THE LORE HAS CHANGED AGAIN LADS, 25TH CENTURY MEGA ULTRAMARINES UPDATE!”

Servo-Skull Valrak floated onscreen, humming as his servos whirred.

Festius hearts filled with joy.

Finally, finally he had peace.

Humanity, proudly stupid and gloriously chaotic, had once again saved the galaxy.

And Festius could sit back and watch his favourite skull-shaped YouTuber in bliss.

**Chapter** 1 

On the eve of Isabelle Darroch’s wedding to Matteo Norkett, paparazzi caught him hanging out with an intern from his company late at night. 

In a fit of rage, Isabelle bought a plane ticket, trying to get away for a 

bit. 

But when she opened her eyes again, she found herself five years in the future. 

Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked. 

When a message appeared on her computer saying “This identity has been deregistered due to death,” it nearly knocked the wind out of her. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen. 

The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper–a wedding photo of her and Matteo. 

Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to. 

She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo. 

She held her breath, counting each “beep” from the receiver. 

Then, a familiar voice came through. “Hello?” 

The worry in Isabelle’s heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once. · 

“Honey, something weird just happened… I’m really scared. Can you come get me?” 

After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, “Okay.” 

\*\*\* 

It wasn’t until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again. 

She threw herself into Matteo’s arms and cried her heart out. 

After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away. 

“Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?” 

Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer. 

“You really think I’m going to buy that? Five years ago, you never showed up at our wedding, and now, you come up with this ridiculous story.” 

“You don’t believe me?” 

Just a few days ago, they had taken their wedding photos together. But right now, the guy in front of her felt completely unfamiliar. 

“How can I believe any of this? 

“Five years ago, you vanished without a trace. Our engagement turned into a joke. And your parents died in a car accident after searching for you for days without sleeping a wink.” 

Isabelle shut her eyes tight, feeling a wave of pain wash over her as she tried to calm her shaking body.

After a while, she finally managed to find her voice. 

“What about you? Did you even try to look for me these past five years?” 

Matteo didn’t reply, just giving her a cold stare. 

Just then, a soft voice sounded as the door creaked open. 

“Honey, I brought you some coffee…” 

Isabelle froze, and the blood in her veins seemed to have turned to ice. 

She couldn’t bring herself to turn around, but she could feel someone getting closer step by step. ",1,1764768423.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

One of the things I struggled with as someone who absolutely loves (specialty) coffee, is to find cafes that actually allow you to work an hour or 2 from. That's why I'm building [koffiework](https://koffie.work) together with a friend.  
  
I usually end up in a cafe that has great coffee but doesn't allow any laptops at all; or I'd end up in a cafe that allows laptops but the coffee is burned.

  
Because of that we built a platform that is tackling this; finding specialty coffee spots that allow you to work from. And no, I don't mean the kind of places where you order 1 coffee and stay for 3 hours. 

  
Wondering if this would be of any use for someone, would love to hear your opinion.

Panicked, she tried calling her parents, only to find that their numbers no longer worked. 

When a message appeared on her computer saying “This identity has been deregistered due to death,” it nearly knocked the wind out of her. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks, dripping onto her phone screen. 

The screen lit up, revealing her wallpaper–a wedding photo of her and Matteo. 

Isabelle finally realized who she could turn to. 

She quickly unlocked her phone and called Matteo. 

She held her breath, counting each “beep” from the receiver. 

Then, a familiar voice came through. “Hello?” 

The worry in Isabelle’s heart suddenly lifted, and all her frustration and confusion spilled out at once. · 

“Honey, something weird just happened… I’m really scared. Can you come get me?” 

After a moment of silence, Matteo calmly replied, “Okay.” 

\*\*\* 

It wasn’t until Isabelle stepped into the familiar office that she finally felt like things were real again. 

She threw herself into Matteo’s arms and cried her heart out. 

After what felt like forever, Matteo frowned and gently pulled her away. 

“Wait, are you saying you traveled through time?” 

Isabelle nodded quickly, but Matteo let out a cold sneer. 

“You really think I’m going to buy that? Five years ago, you never showed up at our wedding, and now, you come up with this ridiculous story.” 

“You don’t believe me?” 

Just a few days ago, they had taken their wedding photos together. But right now, the guy in front of her felt completely unfamiliar. 

“How can I believe any of this? 

“Five years ago, you vanished without a trace. Our engagement turned into a joke. And your parents died in a car accident after searching for you for days without sleeping a wink.” 

Isabelle shut her eyes tight, feeling a wave of pain wash over her as she tried to calm her shaking body. 

15 86% 

After a while, she finally managed to find her voice. 

“What about you? Did you even try to look for me these past five years?” 

Matteo didn’t reply, just giving her a cold stare. 

Just then, a soft voice sounded as the door creaked open. 

“Honey, I brought you some coffee…” 

Isabelle froze, and the blood in her veins seemed to have turned to ice. 

She couldn’t bring herself to turn around, but she could feel someone getting closer step by step. ",1,1764768361.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

1pd42el,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1pd42el/update_my_fiancé_found_my_reddit_post_about_the/,UPDATE: My fiancé found my Reddit post about the cooking and now he's calling off the wedding,"I posted two days ago about my fiancé Carter expecting me to do all the cooking because I'm a food safety inspector and I ""work with food."" A lot of people said I was right to stop cooking just for myself.

Well. Carter found the post.

I don't know how. I thought I was careful about details but I guess not careful enough. Maybe it was the Omaha thing or the software developer detail or something.

Yesterday morning he came out of his office holding his phone and asked ""Is this you?""

My stomach dropped. I tried to play it off like I didn't know what he was talking about but he started reading the post out loud. Word for word.

Then he started reading the comments. The ones calling him lazy. The ones saying he was using me. The ones saying I should reconsider the marriage.

He was FURIOUS. Like I've never seen him this angry.

He said ""So instead of talking to me you aired our private business to thousands of strangers on the internet?""

I said I DID talk to you. For a year. You didn't listen.

He said posting on Reddit was ""humiliating"" and ""betraying his trust"" and that I ""made him look like an asshole to the entire internet.""

I said you made yourself look like an asshole by refusing to cook for a year.

That made it worse.

We fought for hours. He kept saying I ""violated his privacy"" and that relationships are supposed to be private. I said maybe if you'd actually listened when I talked to you privately I wouldn't have needed to ask strangers for perspective.

He said ""Is this what you're going to do every time we disagree? Run to Reddit?""

I said no, this is what I do when you gaslight me into thinking I'm crazy for asking you to share basic household responsibilities.

He did not like that word. Gaslight. Said I was ""throwing therapy terms around"" and ""acting like a victim.""

Then he said something that made my blood run cold.

""Maybe we're not compatible if this is how you handle conflict.""

I asked what he meant by that.

He said ""I don't know if I can marry someone who puts our relationship on the internet for strangers to judge.""

We kind of just stared at each other. Then I said ""So you're more upset about me posting than about the actual issue. About me cooking every meal for a year while you did nothing.""

He said ""That's not the point.""

I said that's EXACTLY the point.

He slept in the guest room. This morning he was weirdly calm. Made himself coffee, sat down at the table, and said ""I think we should postpone the wedding.""

Postpone. Not cancel. Postpone.

I asked why and he said ""We clearly have communication issues and I don't think we're ready to get married if this is how we solve problems.""

I said the communication issue is that I communicated for a year and you ignored me.

He said ""You went behind my back to thousands of people. That's not communication, that's public humiliation.""

I started crying. Asked if he was seriously calling off our wedding over a Reddit post instead of addressing the actual problem.

He said ""The actual problem is that you don't respect me or our privacy. And I can't marry someone who's going to blast our issues online every time she's upset.""

Then he said he's going to stay at his parents' house ""until we figure out what we're doing.""

He packed a bag and left. That was four hours ago.

His mom called me. She was surprisingly nice about it. Said Carter told her about the post and about the cooking situation. She said ""Honey, I love my son but I raised him to do his own laundry and cook his own meals. This isn't on you.""

That made me cry harder.

Then Carter's sister texted me. The same one who said I was being difficult before. She said ""I read the post. You were right. Carter's being a baby. But you shouldn't have posted it online.""

So now I'm sitting here wondering if my relationship is over because I asked the internet if I was wrong for not wanting to be a personal chef.

My best friend came over and brought wine. She said Carter is deflecting because he knows he's wrong and the post made him face it. That he's embarrassed and taking it out on me instead of taking accountability.

My dad called (my mom must have told him) and said ""If he's calling off the wedding over you wanting him to cook his own dinner, he's doing you a favor.""

But I love him. Or I did. Or I do. I don't even know anymore.

The worst part is our wedding is in four months. We have deposits on everything. I have a dress. We sent save the dates.

And now it might all be canceled because I made a Reddit post asking if I was wrong.

I don't know what to do. Carter's parents apparently told him he's overreacting but he's not answering my calls. His phone goes straight to voicemail.",96,1764768312.0,dustythunder,95,0.96,False

1pd41xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pd41xb/luis_aguirres_pink_bourbon_via_swerl/,Luis Aguirre’s Pink Bourbon via Swerl,"Got out of bed early to do some comparison brewing with this amazing bean from Luis Aguirre via the greats at Swerl. 

Grinding on a VS6. Brewing on a small origami with water at 196F with a 1:17.5 ratio using about 11g of beans for each cup. 

All cups were bloomed with about 40g of water followed by a pour to 165g. This single pour is poured half into the center and the other half while going counterclockwise. The last pour of about 30g is poured counterclockwise when the bed is fully settled. I also like to cover the carafe and let the coffee rest for a couple minutes.

The finest grind was at 0.4.0 on the VS6. I sift the fines out with a 50 mesh screen and use sibarita fast filters. The cup was sweet, bright, and nice bright acidity on the tip of the tongue. Smooth, sweet, and clean. I can’t put the taste to words, but it’s very good. 

The medium grind was 0.6.5 brewed with cafec abaca filters. Very light roast centered cup. The acidity is the star of the show providing lots of the structure in the body. Clean. Aromatic and very strong taste going back well into the throat. Very fruity. Melon comes out a lot more as it cools. More interesting cup than the last but not as yummy due to acidity. I thought this was due to the filters, so I remade it with sibarist fast which did yield a faster brew time but more or less the same cup. Sifting would be good to try at this grind size, but my sift got wet.

The coarse grind was at 0.9.5 brewed with standard cafec filters. The cup was clarity forward with underlying acidity. Next time I’d split up the large spout into two or maybe grind a bit finer. The acidity became more clear and structured as it cooled, but the top notes were lost.

All in all, I really love Swerl’s light roast approach. Of the Nordic roasters I’ve tried, TW including, Swerl is the tastiest to me in terms of roast development. Good stuff. Thanks if you’ve read this far. 

Pictured in the comments is my jian zhan cup that I use to weigh and mist my beans in.

1pd3ylw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1pd3ylw/update_aitj_for_refusing_to_come_home_until_my/,UPDATE: AITJ for refusing to come home until my husband cuts off his best friend who's been bullying me?,"I (31F) posted before about calling out my husband Jake's (33M) best friend Melissa for making mean ""jokes"" about me for two years. A lot happened since then and now I need to know if I'm being the jerk here.

Quick background: Melissa has insulted my weight, my cooking, my career (I'm a cake decorator) for two years. Always disguised as ""jokes."" Jake always defended her saying ""that's just her humor.""

At a barbecue I finally snapped and told her she's just not funny. She left upset. Jake was furious with me.

Here's what happened after:

Jake gave me the silent treatment all weekend. When we finally talked, he said I ""humiliated"" his best friend of 10+ years and that I ""don't get to treat her like that."" I said she's been treating ME like that for two years.

He said ""Melissa's been in my life longer than you have. She's not going anywhere.""

I asked him point blank: if you had to choose between your wife being comfortable or your best friend getting to insult your wife, which would you pick?

He wouldn't answer.

So I packed a bag and went to my sister's. That was four days ago.

While I've been gone, Jake went and got coffee with Melissa. She posted it on Instagram with ""thank you for always being there for me. some people are forever.""

When I confronted him he said ""she was upset and needed someone to talk to.""

Then I found out from multiple people that Melissa has apparently been in love with Jake for YEARS. Everyone in their friend group knows. Jake's mom even confirmed it. I'm apparently the only one who didn't know.

Now Jake wants to meet and talk. But he's not apologizing. He's not saying Melissa needs to apologize. He just says I'm ""overreacting"" and we need to ""figure this out.""

I told him I'm not coming home unless he's willing to set serious boundaries with Melissa. Like, she's not allowed to insult me anymore, she needs to apologize for two years of behavior, and he needs to prioritize our marriage over their friendship.

Jake says I'm being ""controlling"" and trying to ""destroy his friendship."" His friends are split - some think I'm right, some think I'm being jealous and unreasonable.

My sister says I'm being too lenient and should just leave him. My mom thinks I should come home and work it out because ""marriage is hard.""

But I don't think I'm asking for too much? I'm asking my husband to defend me and set boundaries with someone who's been bullying me and is apparently in love with him.

Jake says if I really loved him I wouldn't make him choose. That I'm ""punishing him"" for having a close friend.

His mom is on my side but his dad thinks I'm being ""dramatic"" and that married couples need to compromise.

AITJ for refusing to come home until he agrees to my boundaries? Am I being controlling by asking him to essentially end his friendship with Melissa?

**TL;DR:** Husband's best friend has been bullying me for 2 years, turns out she's in love with him. After I called her out, husband defended her over me, went for coffee with her while I'm staying at my sister's. I'm refusing to come home unless he sets serious boundaries with her. He says I'm being controlling and trying to destroy his friendship. AITJ?",60,1764768037.0,AmITheJerk,76,0.95,False

I’m landing in North Goa on **Dec 7th** with no fixed return date. I’m originally from Delhi and currently in Gurgaon visiting family, but I’ve lived in Canada (Calgary) and the US (NYC/Chicago) for most of my adulthood.

**The Plan:** I’m heading to Goa to escape the Gurgaon smog and settle in for a while. I plan to base myself in the Assagao/Siolim and/or Mandrem area. My days will be a mix of working remotely, scouting real estate investments, and just exploring the slower side of North Goa.

**About Me:** I work in Tech/AI and Finance (Algo trading/Market Psych). Since I’ve been living abroad for years, I’m looking to connect with a mature, globally-minded crowd (expats, digital nomads, or locals) for good conversation.

**Looking For:**

* **Hangout:** Coffee, dinner, or drinks with other solo travellers (30s/40s).
* **Nightlife:** I generally prefer chill bars, but I’m definitely open to hitting a good EDM gig occasionally if the crowd is right.
* **Accommodation:** I haven't booked a long-term stay yet. If anyone responsible is interested in splitting a **premium villa** to get a better experience than a hotel, I’m open to discussing that.

My girl said I'm drinking too much & getting bad again. I agree. My ex girlfriend is a drug dealer & sells Xanax so I tell my girl I can hit up my ex & get some benzos to get me through four or five days, & she understands & she's cool with it.

I text my ex the night before last ""hey wanted to ask you a question when you get this"" cause I'm trying to ease into it & be cordial, even though she is quite literally a drug dealer.

She doesn't answer, no big deal. I tell my girl I couldn't get the drugs & Ill have to think of something else.

Yesterday morning we wake up & my ex had texted her like ""hey OP has been texting me to hang out, are you guys together I just wanted to let you know"" 

My SO is freaked out & upset about this, & I'm like ""baby I told you I hit her up to buy Xanax"" then suddenly my ex sends my current girl pictures of a Facebook conversation from last Tuesday claiming it was me, which never happened.

It was some crazy shit saying ""hey I've got a joint, wanna hang out?"" Sometime around 3 in the afternoon, I don't smoke weed & I had to work @ 5 that night, I would never. But ex GF sent some damning ""Facebook user"" messages & now my girl has completely taken her side.

Anyways, I got some Xanax from someone else & will be coming down @ home. I just hate that I wanted to sober up for her & for us & now I feel like what's the point?

Anyways, sipping Hawkeye vodka @ 7am. Chairs, fuckers, thanks for reading.",6,1764767685.0,cripplingalcoholism,8,0.8,False
1pd3t82,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1pd3t82/clients_who_arent_worth_the_headache/,Clients who aren't worth the headache,"This is a thread for anyone to complain about their clients who are a bigger headache than they are worth. Long post about a pain in the ass client incoming.

Mine is a recent client that paid for an 8 foot x 30 inch wide double waterfall coffee table and a desk chair platform. God what an absolute headache they have been and I'm still not done dealing with them. Now my father and I run our business as a part time side business on top of our full time federal jobs and me being a single father. I inform every client we get about this upfront to have a clearer expectation on our timeframes for custom work.

The project started at the end of April. We meet them and discuss the project. They are nice at first but this turns south real quick. We suggested walnut since they wanted something darker to try and match another piece they already have (already a red flag). They tell us that's too expensive when we show them the price of walnut lumber. We tell them white oak would be fine to use and we can stain it (another red flag for anyone who wants to stain white oak). Show them the prices for white oak and again too expensive. We suggest ash because it's also a hardwood and it's similar to white oak in color but we also inform them it doesn't take stain as well as white oak does but we can try our best to match the color of the other piece and we can make no guarantees about matching because it's near impossible. They okay the project for $3000. We of course have a 50% upfront non refundable deposit to start custom projects. They pay it and off we go.

We get going on the project and complete the desk chair platform with some of the red oak flooring they had leftover from another project in a month. We deliver it and they seemingly are happy with it. The wife gets in contact with me after a couple of weeks and is asking for progress pictures. I shoot her a text telling her I will get some for her (I did not have her number as the husband was the one who contacted us). She tells me don't forget and if I had sent her pictures of the platform they would have told us to stain the edges of it. I screenshot the conversation with her husband and tell her that I did send progess pictures and he said it was fantastic and he was happy with it. I'm not sure why someone wouldn't share these with their spouse but hey it's not my marriage.

June comes and our jointer shit the bed. I inform them the day it happened and told them we have to order a new one and have it shipped to us which I informed them would take about a month. Two weeks go by and they ask us for an update. I tell them we got the jointer finally and we are gluing up the top and the legs will be glued up the upcoming weekend. I text them a few days later asking if we could stop by and show them 4 different stain options (one of them being just the ash finished with poly). They hate all of them and tell us they wanted it to match the other piece. We again tell them it's near impossible but we will try our best. The same day I send them some progress pictures. Three days later I send them another piece finished with rubio monocoats precolor intense black as they told we could try to match their fireplace that's black instead of the other piece now. Two weeks go by and they finally text me telling me they hate that too and to try some colors of stain they researched. I tell them that the 3 we showed them before are those exact stains. They tell me that we suggested ash but we should have went with white oak as it takes stain better and to try a transtint dye now. I then inform them when we spoke in person we suggested walnut as the darker option and we also suggested white oak but they told us those options were too expensive. I also tell them that when we spoke about color matching it is near impossible to do. They tell me it doesn't have to match exactly but they want something specific and they are our customers and for us to make it right.

A few days past and I send them some pictures of the walnut transtint dye they wanted us to try. I tell them the table is sanded and ready to be finished but they have to decide on what they want because once we stain it there's no going back. No response for a week. I send them another text asking if they have made a decision. No response for another two weeks. I text again and ask what we are doing. No response for another three days. They finally get back to me and tell me they are out of the country and won't be back for another two weeks. I tell them to get back with us then and we can go from there. After those two weeks it still takes them another week and a half to get back to us and tell us they are going to just take the table unfinished now. I tell them that's fine and we can deliver the upcoming weekend. No response for 31 days from them. They finally get back to us after a month and ask us when we can deliver the table. At this point, we are out of town due to a death in the family and I don't get back with them for a couple of weeks (I realize this is our fault and I apologize profusely for the lack of communication but explain the situation).

Now, we are doing the finally sanding before we planned to deliver it the weekend before Thanksgiving and some of the biscuits when we did the glue up on one of the waterfall edges decided to come through the wood. The only way to fix this is to buy new lumber and make a new leg. I inform them of this and apologize again but send some of pictures of it and tell them we don't want to deliver it with these defects. They are okay with this. We talk and I tell them we are able to deliver it by December 1st. December 1st comes and we load up the table to deliver it. On our way a truck rear ends us (unfortunately the bed of our truck is 6 feet long and the table is 8 feet) and it breaks both legs off of the table. I call them and tell them and the wife tells me that this has been a nightmare and how we've come up with every excuse in the book and this has taken too long and how it's hard for her to believe someone hit us etc etc. I tell her that while we did have some issues on our end we are not lying about the situation and that they have had poor communication with us and have taken up to a month or longer to receive any communication from them regarding the project when it was up to them to decide a stain. She tells me if it can't be fixed then we should call it a wash and forget about it all together.

At this point I am highly considering doing just that as I do not want to deal with these people (especially the wife) any longer. I told them about everything up front and was completely honest about everything with them. Unfortunately things do come up that are out of our control. Anyway, sorry for the long post but damn some clients are ridiculous. 

TL;DR: Some clients are pains in the ass. Please feel free to share any of your stories of these kinds of clients.

So when I was around 16 I had a boyfriend who I genuinely liked(i have no reason to lie) we would text everyday, go on dates, go on holidays and essentially act like we were a married couple even though we were evidently young.

i was about to mention the problem with him lol but i'm attempting to be self aware so it was me .. well it was MY problem with him. he was my first boyfriend and prior to this i had a few Sa experiences and honestly i was(and am) just coping through being horned out. we also both had dangerously low confidence, when it came to physical he was the opposite he’d avoid or speed through bc he felt his pipi was too small (it wasn't TOO small but definitely small).

 &  me, who had the emotional intelligence of a soggy biscuit, didn’t know how to handle that the right way.

Instead of breaking up like a normal person I kind of… wandered. Not emotionally. emotionally I was still texting him goodnight with hearts, cuddles, love yous all the same and maybe even more. But physically? i would find strangers and give them blowies i think i did this like a few times. i was extremely impulsive and honestly i just lacked self control and wanted validation (see it was me)

I didn’t even think I was cheating, well no i did know i was cheating but i've never had that guilt everyone says i would or should feel. I just told myself the whole “he has my heart” thing and somehow that made sense to me. My self-awareness was on holiday.

Looking back it’s honestly hilarious how seriously I took everything while doing absolutely nothing seriously. i know you guys won't find it funny, but yes I’d cheat and then cry about him not replying fast enough or ignoring me.

Was it wrong? Yes. Did I know better? probably. but can i just say my brain wasn’t even fully cooked yet😔 (there is no true explanation)

Anyway he’s fine now we broke up !, yes he caught me once and no he didn't leave. which i greatly appreciated. we dated for a while after and ended peacefully. Honestly i was so embarrassed when i got caught it definitely wasn't guilt but gosh shame is a stronger emotion for me and I’ve accepted that. i was not a role model in any moral category. It happened, I learned (by staying single), life moved on, and the world didn’t end. i can't quite afford therapy but don't worry i will get there!

Sometimes you just have to admit you were a terrible person while also admitting that doesn't mean anything.

1pd3q6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1pd3q6h/i_compiled_24_sleep_methods_ive_triedall_things/,"I compiled 24 sleep methods I’ve tried,all things other people swore worked for them.","I’ve struggled with falling asleep for a years.I’d feel tired during the day,and spend my weekends trying to make up for lost sleep. It was like this domino effect I just couldn’t stop.

I consulted a sleep specialist, but the doctor only prescribed me a mild sedative, because my situation wasn’t “serious enough.”

But honestly, not being able to sleep feels terrible. it’s hard to even put that feeling into words.That’s why I want to find a way to improve my sleep.

So I started searching for sleep aid methods and tried them one by one. You probably heard of a lot of these methods:

# Some of my favorite methods:

1. **Cognitive Shuffling:** Randomly think of unrelated objects, like lake, bicycle, mountain, banana…，Visualize each object in your mind for a few seconds, and eventually your brain starts to feel drowsy, almost like slipping into a dream.

2. **Paradoxical Intention :** Deliberately tell yourself, “I’m NOT going to sleep tonight! I’m staying up!”By removing the pressure of “I must fall asleep,” you actually end up drifting off more easily.

3. **Random Word Game:** Pick a letter and think of random objects that start with it (A: apple, ant, airplane...). When your mind is too tired to think of the next word, you'll fall asleep.

# Sleep Hygiene

5.  **Accept & Float :**Don’t grab your phone, don’t force yourself to sleep.

Just tell yourself, “It’s okay if I don’t fall asleep.”

Once you stop fighting insomnia, sleep usually comes much more easily.

6. **If you wake up in the middle of the night:** Don’t look at the clock! Get up and do something boring ,fold laundry, read a book and go back to bed only when you’re sleepy again.

 7. **Morning sunlight:**Try to get about 15 minutes of morning sunlight.

It helps regulate your body clock and makes it easier to fall asleep at night.

8. **If you’ve been in bed for 60 minutes and still not asleep:** Do something light read, walk around, do some gentle stretching.This helps prevent your brain from building the association of “bed = anxiety.”

9. No coffee after 1 PM.

10. **Try not to nap:** Light movement is often better than taking a nap when you’re tired.

11. **Supplements:** Magnesium , melatonin, valerian root.

12. Sleep-friendly drinks: Warm milk, almond milk, or tart cherry juice before bed.

13. Strict Sleep Schedule: Wake up at the same time every day (even if you’ve only slept for 2 hours), and absolutely avoid napping during the day. This forces your sleep drive to reset and rebuild. 

# Sleep Environment

14. Keep your bedroom temperature around 18–20°C (64–68°F).

15. Use blackout curtains.

16. Replace with comfortable pillows.

17. Air out your room for 2-3 hours daily to keep air fresh.

18. Use calming essential oil: lavender, agarwood, chamomile, bergamot.

19. Change bed linens regularly: try to dry sheets in direct sunlight, as the ""sunshine scent"" can promote relaxation.

# Bedtime Relaxation Rituals

20. **4-7-8 Breathing method:** Inhale for 4 seconds → Hold for 7 seconds → Exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat several times to calm the mind and relieve stress.

21. **Writing a Worry List:** Before bed, write down everything you need to do tomorrow or anything that’s stressing you out. At the end, write something like “Handled. Shutting down.” It clears the mental clutter.

22. **Listen to something boring:** Such as dull podcasts or monotonous stories to make your brain slowly power off.

23. **Meditate for 10-20 minutes:** Helps relieve anxiety and reduce mental noise.

24. **Listen to soothing music before bed:** White noise, piano pieces, soft and gentle melodies.

**Looking at these methods, do you also feel like:**

Wondering which one will actually work for you?

Even when others swear by a method, you try it and still can’t fall asleep?

Like 2 days later, I let her know it was fun and I would want to see her again. She took a week (7days) to reply. This was her reply: ""Hey!! I’m sorry, I had several important deadlines so I was super busy and totally forgot to reply. 
Yes, let’s keep in touch. Thanks for the invite, it was nice :)"" From this message and the amount of time she took to reply, from this I get that she's letting me down subtly. What do you think?

1pd3ixh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pd3ixh/aitah_for_not_helping_my_sister_who_actually_has/,AITAH for not helping my sister who actually has cancer now after she faked cancer to marry my ex and steal my life savings?,"My sister faked cancer to steal $50,000 from me and honeymoon with my ex-husband, and now she's actually dying and wants me to pay for treatment.

I'm 34F. My sister is 29. My ex-husband is 36. We got divorced two years ago because he cheated on me with someone from his gym. It was brutal. I found out when his Apple Watch activity showed him ""working out"" at 2am on a Tuesday. Tracked his location. He was at her apartment.

The divorce cost me everything. I gave him the house because I just wanted out. Kept my car and my savings. Started over in a one bedroom apartment and worked my ass off to rebuild. It took me two years to feel normal again.

Then six months ago my sister called me crying. Said she had stage 3 ovarian cancer. Needed surgery and chemo. Her insurance was shit and she needed $50K upfront or they wouldn't start treatment. She sent me photos of medical documents. Everything looked real. I didn't even question it.

I emptied my savings. Every single dollar I'd saved since the divorce. Sent her $50,000 the next day. She cried and thanked me and said I was saving her life.

Two weeks later I'm scrolling Instagram and see she's posted beach photos. Maldives. Fucking Maldives. She's in a bikini holding champagne with the caption ""Finally living my best life"" and about fifteen hashtags including #blessed and #newbeginnings.

I thought maybe the doctors were wrong. Maybe she didn't have cancer after all and this was her celebrating. I texted her asking how she was feeling. She said ""so much better, the treatment is really working"" with a prayer hands emoji.

Then I saw who liked the photo. My ex-husband. I clicked his profile. He'd posted the same beach. Same resort. Different angle. His caption was ""Honeymoon vibes with my beautiful wife.""

They got married. My sister married my ex-husband. And they used my $50,000 to pay for their wedding and honeymoon.

I called her immediately. She answered all giggly and I could hear waves in the background. I said ""where the fuck are you"" and she went quiet. Then she said ""I can explain"" and I said ""you're in the Maldives. With my ex-husband. Using my money.""

She tried to say it just happened, that they ran into each other at a coffee shop and connected over how hard I'd been on both of them. That he understood her in ways I never did. That love finds you when you least expect it. That she was going to pay me back but the wedding got expensive and they deserved one nice trip.

I hung up. Blocked both of them. Blocked their families who started messaging me saying I was being dramatic and that I should be happy my sister found love. Her friends called me jealous. Said I needed therapy.

I filed a police report for fraud. Got a lawyer. The medical documents were fake, obviously. She'd photoshopped them using templates from the internet. My lawyer said it was a clear case but it would take time.

That was six months ago. I haven't spoken to her since. Haven't spoken to anyone in my family who took her side, which was everyone except my dad. He called me once to say he was sorry and that he didn't know she was capable of this.

Yesterday my dad called again. Said my sister was in the hospital. That she actually has cancer now. Cervical cancer this time. Stage 2. She needs surgery and her insurance won't cover everything. She's asking for $30,000.

She wants me to drop the lawsuit and help her. Says that karma gave her real cancer because she lied about fake cancer, and that this is her punishment but she doesn't deserve to die over a mistake. That I'm her sister and sisters help each other.

My dad said she's been crying every day. That my ex-husband left her two months ago when the lawsuit started because he didn't want to deal with legal drama. That she's alone and scared and knows she fucked up. He said I'm the only person who can afford to help her and that if I don't, her blood is on my hands.

I told him no. I said she made her choice when she stole from me and married my ex-husband. That I spent two years rebuilding my life after that divorce and she knew exactly how much pain I was in. That she looked me in the eyes and lied about dying so she could take my money and fuck my ex-husband in the Maldives.

My dad started crying. Said I'm not the person he raised. That forgiveness is everything and holding grudges will destroy me. That she's my baby sister and she's dying.

I said she's a liar and a thief and I hope the cancer hurts.

Then I hung up. And now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm a monster. Part of me feels guilty. Part of me feels like she deserves this. Part of me wonders if I said that last thing just to hurt him because I'm so fucking angry.

My therapist says I need to process this on my own timeline and that I don't owe anyone forgiveness. But my entire family is blowing up my phone saying I'm letting my sister die over money. That family is forever and grudges aren't worth a life.

But it's not about the money anymore. It's about the fact that she knew what my ex-husband did to me. She watched me cry for months. She held me when I said I'd never trust anyone again. And then she stole from me and married him and posted honeymoon photos like I didn't exist.

AITAH for refusing to help my sister now that she actually has cancer?

My heart absolutely dropped. My cat just sat there, completely calm (she’s braver than I am), while this coyote paced around trying to figure out how to get in. Luckily, the setup I have kept her totally safe. not a chance that thing was getting through.

After about a minute, the coyote gave up and trotted off like it was embarrassed it got outsmarted by a cat. 😂

Needless to say, I’m extra thankful for having this little outdoor space for my cat. This is a pre built Habitat Haven catio.  It was pricey but it is very well made and we hired some local help to install it for us.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1pd3e58,https://youtu.be/5Imsra1D7JQ,4 Very Scary TRUE Holiday Delivery Horror Stories,"# ""Taken After Four"":

I had just finished my shift at the warehouse—twelve hours of loading trucks for the holiday rush. Christmas was only a few weeks away, and all I could think about on the drive home were the Barbie dolls I’d ordered for my little girl, Emily. She was seven, endlessly energetic, always bouncing between wanting to be a doctor or an astronaut. My wife, Lisa, stayed home with our toddler, and Emily usually hopped off the school bus a little after four.

I pulled into our gravel driveway just past five. The house sat back from the road, quiet and tucked between winter-bare fields. I expected to see Emily’s pink jacket tossed somewhere by the porch like always.

Instead, Lisa opened the door before I even reached it. Her face was drained of color.

“Emily’s not here,” she said. “I looked everywhere inside. She came home from school, we had a little fight about homework, and she went to her room. When I checked later… she was gone.”

I froze, lunchbox still in my hand.  
“Gone? What do you mean gone? Did she go play outside? Check the barn?”

“I called for her. I searched the yard. Her backpack’s still in her room.”

We walked the property together—the shed where she liked to hide, the old swing set, the barn that creaked whenever the wind shifted. The sun was sinking low, draining color out of everything.

“Emily! Sweetheart!” I shouted, voice cracking across the field.

Nothing.

As we headed back toward the house, Lisa spoke again, almost reluctantly.  
“Remember the delivery guy? FedEx came earlier. Dropped off a package—the dolls, I think. He handed it to me at the door.”

“Did Emily see him?”

“She was in her room. But maybe she came out after.”

I opened the package just to confirm. Inside, the Barbie set—“You Can Be Anything.” Emily had circled that one in the catalog weeks ago. The sight of it turned my stomach.

We called every parent we knew. No one had seen her.

By six, I was on the phone with the sheriff’s office. “My daughter is missing,” I said. “Seven years old, brown hair, pink jacket.”

Deputies arrived in minutes, lights strobing against our windows. Officer Ramirez, tall with a heavy mustache, listened carefully to everything we told him.

“We’ll put out an alert immediately,” he said. “Let’s start searching again.”

Flashlights cut across the property. Deputies called her name, their voices growing more strained as time dragged on. Neighbors showed up with lanterns and coffee. The quiet felt wrong—like the whole world was holding its breath.

By midnight, the living room had become a command post. Sheriff Akin arrived, calm but serious.

“We need every detail,” he said. “Especially about that delivery driver.”

Lisa described him—mid-thirties, dark hair, average build, FedEx jacket. Nothing unusual, nothing memorable. And somehow that felt worse.

No one slept. Lisa sat shaking beside me on the couch.

“What if she fell? What if she’s hurt somewhere?”  
“We’ll find her,” I told her. But doubt was starting to gnaw at me from the inside.

At sunrise, investigators arrived. They questioned us separately, methodically. Then, finally—a lead.

“We contacted FedEx,” Sheriff Akin announced, gathering us in the kitchen. “The driver on your route is Tom Harris. Contract worker. We’re bringing him in now.”

My chest tightened. The man who delivered her Christmas gift… could he have seen her walk outside? Followed her? Taken her?

Lisa’s breath hitched. “You think he—?”

“We just need to talk to him,” the sheriff said.

Hours crawled by. Every second without Emily was another weight added to my chest.

Around noon, the phone rang.  
“Mr. Strand? We have Harris in custody,” a detective said. “He’s talking.”

Lisa and I drove to the station in silence. Sheriff Akin met us in a small room, expression heavy.

“He confessed,” he said quietly. “But it’s… it’s bad.”

My whole body went still.  
“What happened?”

“After delivering the package, he backed up the truck and accidentally hit Emily. Barely clipped her, he says. She wasn’t seriously hurt. She stood up. But he panicked. He put her in the truck.”

Lisa’s hand covered her mouth.

“He said she told him she’d tell you about the accident. He… he strangled her to keep her quiet.”

The words shattered something inside me.

“Where is she?” I whispered.

“He led us to her body. Creek bed about ten miles out, near Boyd.”

Lisa collapsed into sobs. I wrapped my arms around her, but inside, all I felt was a hollow, burning rage. The man who delivered her Christmas present—the box sitting unopened on our table—had taken her life.

They let us see Harris through the glass of an interrogation room. He was slumped forward, handcuffed, eyes empty. Not remorseful. Not frightened. Just… vacant.

“Why?” I asked the sheriff, voice barely audible.  
He shook his head. “He says he didn’t mean to. But he made every choice that followed.”

The days that followed blurred into a fog. Funeral arrangements. Reporters. Pink flowers everywhere—her favorite. The Barbie set placed beside the casket.

At a press conference, Emily’s mother—my ex-wife, Karen—held up the Barbie box.  
“This was supposed to be her Christmas joy,” she said. “Instead, a monster stole her from us.”

We pushed for stricter checks on contract delivery workers. But nothing—no policy, no apology, no lawsuit—could bring her back.

The trial dragged on for months. Evidence was overwhelming. Camera footage showed Emily stepping toward the truck, trusting him. Harris tried to break her neck first; when he failed, he used his hands.

I testified, voice breaking. “She hugged me that morning. Told me she couldn’t wait for Santa.”

Harris showed no emotion. Not a flicker.

The night before the verdict, I drove to the creek where they found her. The water murmured softly, completely indifferent.  
“I’m sorry, baby girl,” I whispered. “Daddy loves you.”

When the jury convicted him, the courtroom felt silent, almost disappointed. Life or death—none of it mattered. Justice couldn’t fill the hollow space left behind.

Years later, I still check every lock twice. Every delivery truck makes my chest tighten.

Because once, a man in uniform came to our door carrying a package—and left carrying my daughter.

Emily could have been anything. Now she is a memory I guard fiercely, a ghost in pink sneakers, reminding me that evil doesn’t always knock loudly. Sometimes it smiles, hands you a box, and walks away with your world.

# ""The Flickering Light"":

I started my shift that afternoon the same way I always did—rolling open the metal door of the delivery van, the warehouse lights buzzing overhead, the air thick with cardboard dust and the smell of diesel. Mid-December in South Florida meant the heat hadn’t completely backed off, so sweat gathered on my forehead before I even left the loading bay. Everyone was pushing hard for the holiday rush. The aisles were packed, workers shouting over each other, conveyor belts rattling as gifts for strangers shot past in every direction.

I’d been driving for Amazon for two years, mostly running routes around Fort Lauderdale—quiet family neighborhoods, retirees, folks walking their dogs, kids biking home before dinner. Nothing exciting. Nothing dangerous. Just long days, long miles, and one package after another. I didn’t mind it. Extra hours meant extra money, and extra money meant better presents for my wife and kids. Christmas was close, and that alone kept me moving.

The dispatcher handed me a thick stack of stops—more than usual. “Busy night,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. “Watch the traffic. People are out of their damn minds this week.”

“Got it,” I said, tucking the scanner into my vest. I climbed into the van, the seat creaking under me, and fired up the engine. The air conditioner struggled for a second before kicking in. Then I hit the road, weaving through streets lined with palm trees that shimmered under the streetlights.

For hours, everything was routine. Park. Drop off a box. Scan. Snap a photo. Back into the van. Repeat. The kind of monotony that makes your brain drift—thinking about what my daughter wanted for Christmas, thinking about how tired my wife must be chasing the kids all day, thinking about how good it would feel to finally get home.

By the time I reached my last few stops, the sky had gone deep purple. Most houses had their Christmas lights on, twinkling across manicured lawns. My next stop was on Northwest 10th Terrace—a darker, quieter side road with long stretches between homes and plenty of shadows where the streetlamps didn’t quite reach.

When I turned in, the van suddenly jerked hard to the right. At first, I thought I hit something, but then came the sickening, rhythmic flapping sound—rubber slapping pavement. Flat tire.

“Perfect,” I muttered.

I pulled over beneath a streetlamp that flickered like it couldn’t decide whether to stay alive or die. It wasn’t my first flat tire. I’d changed plenty on the job. I grabbed the tools from the back, knelt by the wheel, and started loosening the lug nuts.

That’s when I saw him.

A figure crossing the street toward me. Average height. Dark clothes. Hood up. Hands buried in his pockets. He didn’t look drunk. Didn’t look lost. He moved with this steady, controlled stride—like he already knew exactly where he was going. Exactly what he wanted.

“You need help?” he asked.

His voice was wrong. Too calm. Too empty. No concern in it. No curiosity. Just… flat.

I looked up. “No, thanks. I’m good.”

He didn’t stop walking. Not even a pause. Before I could stand fully, he reached into his pocket and pulled out something small and black.

Stun gun.

It crackled to life, a burst of sparks lighting his face for half a second.

Then he pressed it into my ribs.

Electricity tore through me like my entire body was being ripped apart from the inside. My muscles seized, locking up so hard I couldn’t even scream. The lug wrench slipped from my fingers, clattering against the pavement. My breath caught in my throat, and I collapsed sideways, trying to understand what was happening.

“Why—?” I gasped.

“Give me the keys,” he said.

Not angry. Not desperate. Just cold. Robotic.

Before I could respond, he shocked me again—this time on my arm. The pain was so raw I nearly vomited. I fell to my knees, vision swimming. My body felt like it was short-circuiting from the inside out.

He reached into my pocket and yanked out the key fob.

Then he pulled the knife.

The blade glinted under the flickering streetlamp—a brief flash of silver, like a warning I couldn’t comprehend fast enough.

Everything in me froze.

“This isn’t just a robbery,” I whispered.

He lunged.

The first slash tore across my shoulder, fire spreading down my arm as blood soaked through my uniform. I stumbled back, hands raised. “Take the van!” I yelled. “Just take it!”

But he wasn’t listening.

He stabbed again, this time in my side—deep. I felt the blade punch through skin, muscle, something vital. The air left my lungs in a choking gasp. I grabbed his wrist, fighting back with everything I had. We fell sideways, hitting the pavement hard. My vision tunneled, heartbeat roaring in my ears.

This guy didn’t want the van.

He wanted me.

My hand scraped the ground until I felt the metal of the lug wrench. I wrapped my fingers around it and swung blindly, cracking it against his knee. He let out a grunt—more irritated than hurt—and loosened his grip just enough.

I shoved him off and staggered to my feet, blood running warm down my torso. My legs were shaking, but adrenaline forced me forward. I sprinted toward the nearest house, the porch light glowing like a lifeline.

I pounded on the door. “Help! Help me! Please!”

Nothing.

I hit it harder, practically throwing myself at it.

Still nothing.

Behind me, his footsteps approached—slow, patient, like he knew I wasn’t going anywhere.

“You’re done,” he called, voice drifting across the street.

Terror surged through me. I turned and ran, lungs burning, vision dimming at the edges. I rounded the corner and spotted a small convenience store up ahead. Warm light poured through the windows. People inside.

I pushed my legs harder, even as they started to buckle.

The door slammed open when I crashed into it. I stumbled inside, collapsing against the counter. “Call 911,” I gasped. “He—he stabbed me—”

The clerk’s eyes went wide. “Oh my God—sit down, sit down—”

Two customers rushed over. One grabbed a towel. Another held me upright as I slid down the counter.

“Stay with us, man. Stay awake.”

The world blurred. Spots of light flickered in and out. My chest felt tight, every breath a struggle. Someone shouted that police were on the way. Someone else said my shirt was turning red too fast.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Then everything went dim.

When I woke up in the ambulance, a paramedic leaned over me. “You’ve got seven stab wounds,” he said. “One punctured your lung. We're keeping it inflated. Stay with us.”

I tried to speak, but all I could do was nod weakly.

Later at the hospital, after surgery, after questions, after the long slow return of sensation to my body, the police told me they caught him. Curtis Gardner. Thirty-three. Long record. Violent history. They said he slashed my tire beforehand. That he was waiting.

Waiting for me.

Attempted murder. Armed robbery. Pre-meditated.

Weeks passed. I healed physically, more or less. Scars marked where his knife had entered. But the mental scars… those stayed sharper.

I quit the job. Found something safer. Something that didn’t require stepping into dark neighborhoods with my back turned.

But sometimes, driving home at night, I still see him—the way he walked, the way he didn’t hesitate, the way the stun gun crackled before the world lit up with pain.

And even now, whenever I see a delivery van pulled over on the side of the road under a flickering streetlamp, a chill runs through me.

Because I know how quickly things can go wrong.  
How fragile a life can be.  
How close I came to losing mine on a quiet street just days before Christmas.

# ""Followed Me All Night"":

I had been driving for the food delivery app for about six months when the holiday rush hit full force. Extra orders meant extra money, and with two kids at home, I needed every dollar I could squeeze out of the night. So on Christmas Eve, instead of winding down with my family, I decided to work late. Most people were gathered around living rooms, eating leftovers or unwrapping early gifts—but there were always a few who still wanted their meals delivered hot.

My phone kept buzzing with pickups from diners and fast-food joints that stayed open through the night. I told myself I’d finish by two in the morning, go home, and wrap presents before the kids woke up.

The first few runs were easy. I grabbed a bag of burgers from a drive-thru and dropped them off at an apartment complex. The guy at the door handed me a five and said, “Merry Christmas, man. Stay safe out there.” I smiled, told him the same.

Next was a pizza order to a house at the edge of town. A tired-looking mom answered—hair messy, dark circles under her eyes, but still trying to be polite. “Thank you for coming this late,” she said. “My husband works nights too.” We talked for a minute about how crazy the season was. She tipped well, and for a moment the job felt human, warm.

But as I stepped back into my car, I noticed a sedan parked across the street with its lights off. Two figures sat inside, silhouettes barely moving. I brushed it off—plenty of people sit in cars late at night.

Still, the image stuck in my mind as I drove to my next pickup, a Chinese place downtown. While waiting inside, I called my wife.

“Hey, love,” I said. “Just a couple more orders, then I’m done.”

She sounded uneasy. “Don’t push it too hard tonight. Empty roads freak me out.”

I laughed. “I’ll be fine. Kiss the kids for me.”

But when I got back on the road, my rearview mirror caught something that made my stomach dip. The same sedan from earlier was behind me—same shape, same headlights. I told myself it was coincidence, but when I turned onto a side street toward the next drop-off, the sedan turned too.

The house was quiet, porch light glowing faintly. I left the bag by the door and snapped the proof photo for the app. As I walked back, the sedan rolled slowly past me. The windows were tinted black, impossible to see through. I kept my head down and my pace even, but my pulse was hammering. They didn’t stop—but they wanted me to know they were there.

Inside my car, I locked the doors fast.

Another order popped up—Denny’s, ten minutes away. Good tip promised. I sighed and accepted. That tip would go straight toward the kids’ gifts.

But as I pulled onto the main road, the sedan reappeared in my mirror like it had been waiting. My throat went dry.

I called a friend who also delivered at night. “You out?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Think someone’s following me.”

He didn’t joke, didn’t laugh. “Turn around if you can. Or call the cops. Don’t brush it off, man.”

I hung up with a promise to be careful.

At a red light, I stared into the mirror. The sedan was two cars back. The moment the light changed, I sped up.

I pulled into the Denny’s parking lot—one of the few places still alive this late. Inside, people were scattered around: a family with kids sharing pancakes, two workers on a break, a few night owls. It felt safe in a way the empty streets didn’t.

“Pickup for Johnson,” I told the waitress at the counter.

“Five minutes,” she said with a tired smile.

While I waited, two young guys walked in—hoodies, masks, hands buried in pockets. They didn’t order. They sat near the door, whispering to each other, throwing glances my way. I pretended to scroll on my phone, but every nerve in my body was on high alert.

The waitress handed me the bag. “Drive safe.”

“Thanks,” I said, but my voice felt thin.

Outside, the cold air slapped me awake. My car was only a few steps away. I reached for the handle—

Footsteps. Fast.

I spun around. The two guys from inside were almost on me. One had a baton. The other…something metallic in his hand. A gun? Or a fake? I didn’t have time to figure it out.

“Keys and wallet,” the baton guy growled.

“I—I got family,” I stammered. “Please.”

The one with the gun lifted it, pointing it square at me. “Now.”

My heart hammered so hard I felt it in my throat. The diner door was twenty feet away—if I shouted, maybe someone inside would notice. But they were too close. Too fast.

The baton guy swung. The hit cracked against my arm, white-hot pain exploding up to my shoulder. I dropped the food.

“STOP!” I yelled. “HELP!”

The gun guy grabbed my shirt, yanking me forward. “Shut up.”

Adrenaline made the world narrow to a tunnel. I twisted hard, shoving him back. He stumbled, surprised. That was my only chance. I ran.

The baton slammed across my back, knocking the breath from my lungs. I hit the pavement, skinned my hands, tasted blood.

“Get him!” the gun guy barked.

I scrambled up and threw myself at the diner door, banging with everything I had. Inside, people shot to their feet. The waitress screamed, “CALL 911!”

The attackers froze when they saw everyone watching. And then, as if on cue, faint sirens wailed somewhere in the distance—maybe unrelated, but loud enough to rattle them.

They grabbed my keys off the ground, sprinted to my car, and peeled out of the lot.

I slumped against the door, gasping, my arm throbbing like it was on fire. The manager rushed out.

“Oh my God—are you okay?”

“I—I think so,” I croaked. “They took my car.”

Police showed up minutes later. I gave them everything I could: two teens, dark hoodies, masks, one taller than the other. They found my car abandoned a mile away, emptied of everything but a few old delivery bags.

No arrests that night, but the officers said the description matched a string of robberies.

I spent Christmas in the hospital with a fractured arm, bruised ribs, and a wife who couldn’t stop shaking as she held my hand. The kids climbed into the bed with me, completely unaware how close things had come.

“Never again,” my wife whispered. “No more late nights.”

Even now, months later, I still check my mirrors every time I drive. That night taught me something brutal and simple: danger doesn’t announce itself. One minute you’re earning a little extra for your family. The next, you’re running for your life in an empty parking lot.

And sometimes, the scariest part is how fast everything can change.

# ""The Quad Bike"":

I had been driving for a food delivery app for almost a year, long enough to know that Christmas Day shifts were a gamble. Sometimes they were slow, sometimes they were chaos. But in 2024, with my kids expecting presents I could barely afford, I couldn’t turn down the holiday pay boost. So I clocked in that evening, loaded up my moped, and headed out into the quiet streets of Epsom.

It felt like the whole town had gone still. Houses glowed warm with family gatherings, laughter muffled behind windows, the smell of roasting dinners drifting through the air. The roads, though, were empty—just me, my moped, and the occasional lonely car rolling by.

My first few drops went smoothly. A pizza to a family on a cul-de-sac. Indian food to an older couple who insisted I take a generous tip. “Merry Christmas, mate,” the man said, smiling like he meant it. “Stay safe out there.”

I didn’t realize how much I’d remember those words later.

Around 9 p.m., I picked up an order from a busy little takeaway in town—a small bag heading to a place on Ashley Road. An easy run. I zipped along the path, my moped’s headlight slicing through patches of shadow.

That’s when I saw it.

A quad bike. Parked at an angle at the corner of a quiet street. No lights. Engine low and rumbling. Two figures sat on it, both in black hoodies, faces hidden behind scarves. At first I shrugged it off—teenagers messing around, probably bored on Christmas night. But as I passed, I felt their eyes follow me.

I turned onto Ashley Road, and seconds later, their engine growled to life behind me.

I looked in my mirror.

They were following.

Not close enough to seem obvious, not far enough to be accidental. A steady stalk.

I reached the delivery house—a small place with warm lights glowing through the curtains. I parked, grabbed the bag, and knocked. A woman answered immediately, smiling as though she’d been waiting right behind the door.

“Oh, thank you! We totally forgot to order dinner today.” She handed me a tip wrapped in a Christmas card. “Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas,” I said, trying to sound normal.

But when I stepped back outside, my stomach dropped.

The quad bike had rolled up right behind my moped.

Blocking it.

The two figures stood now—both young, maybe 18 or 19. One had a small mole just under his right lip. It made him look almost innocent, but his eyes were anything but. Cold. Focused. Predatory.

“Hey, you,” the one with the mole called out in a low, sharp voice. “That’s a nice moped. Hand it over.”

I froze, hands instinctively gripping my helmet.

“What? I’m working. This is my bike.”

The second guy stepped forward, cracking his knuckles like he’d been waiting all night for this.

“We said hand it over,” he repeated. “Don’t make us take it.”

My heart hammered. The street was dead quiet. No cars. No people. Just me and two strangers who didn’t care what happened next.

“Look… I don’t want trouble,” I said quietly. “Let me go.”

The one with the mole chuckled—soft, almost amused.

“Trouble? Mate… you’re the one out here alone.”

He lunged and grabbed my arm.

Instinct kicked in. I jerked away and shoved him. Harder than I meant to. He stumbled. I used that half-second to jump onto my moped and slam the key. The engine hesitated—my stomach turned—then finally roared awake.

The second guy swung and clipped my shoulder, sending pain up my neck.

But I tore past them, swerving into the road as they shouted behind me.

I didn’t breathe properly until I was three streets away. Hands shaking, I called support.

“This is driver 4782—I just got attacked on Ashley Road. Two guys on a quad bike tried to steal my moped.”

The operator’s tone changed instantly.

“Oh my God. Are you injured? Stay on the line. We’re alerting the police.”

I pulled over, chest rising and falling too fast. She asked for a description; I gave it—white, late teens, scarves covering most of their faces, one with a mole below his lip.

Then she asked the question that made me hesitate.

“Do you want to end your shift?”

I thought of the bills I still needed to cover.

“No. I’ll finish a couple more.”

I regret those words even now.

My next order was close, just a few blocks over on Epsom Road in Ewell. I convinced myself the danger was behind me.

But the streets on that side felt different—darker, quieter, as if the town itself had stepped away. I kept checking my mirrors, half-expecting to see that quad bike again. Nothing.

The flat above the shop was straightforward. The man answered annoyed, muttered something about delays, grabbed his food, slammed the door.

Whatever—just another delivery.

But when I walked back down the outside stairs, I heard it.

That engine.

Low. Familiar.

My pulse spiked.

The quad bike rolled out of a side alley, lights off, creeping toward me like a predator testing its next move.

“It’s them…” I whispered.

The mole guy pointed at me. “Look who we found again.”

Before I could react, the other guy charged.

“Give us the bike,” he snapped, “or we’ll f\*\*\*ing make you.”

His fist smashed into my ribs. I gasped and staggered back.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, jumping onto my moped.

He grabbed the back metal frame and nearly yanked me off.

I twisted the throttle full blast.

The sudden jolt ripped me out of his grip. I shot down the road, weaving between parked cars as their quad bike roared after me. My lungs burned. My eyes stung. A horn blared as I cut in front of a car.

I lost them only after taking a sharp corner into a side lot behind a closed store. I hid there, engine off, chest heaving.

I called support again. My voice shook.

“It’s me again. They found me. Same guys. Epsom Road. They— they punched me, tried to pull me off.”

The operator’s voice dropped to a whisper, like she didn’t want to scare me.

“Police are on the way. Tell me where you are. Stay hidden.”

So I did.

The minutes stretched. Every sound—every shifting leaf, every car in the distance—made me flinch.

Finally, blue lights washed over the pavement. Two officers approached quickly.

“You the delivery driver?” one asked.

I nodded. “Yes. They attacked me twice. Same guys.”

They exchanged a look.

“You’re not the only one tonight,” the officer said. “Another driver reported two young men on a quad bike trying to take his scooter earlier.”

“That was me,” I said. “The first time.”

The officer blinked. “Again? Jesus. Okay—we’re escalating this.”

I wanted to go home. Every part of me wanted to go home.

But the app buzzed.

Another order had already been assigned to me—High Street, Ewell.

The officers urged me to clock out.

But the customer started calling.

“Where’s my food? We’re waiting.”

Stupidly—stupidly—I accepted. The officers agreed to stay close.

We made our way toward High Street—busier, brighter. People walking here and there. It felt safer.

Until it didn’t.

I parked and grabbed the bag. As I turned toward the address, the quad bike shot into the street like it had been launched. The two men leaped off before it fully stopped.

“Third time’s the charm,” the mole guy sneered. “Bike. Phone. Wallet. Now.”

His friend cracked his knuckles again, smiling like this was all a joke.

“You should’ve stayed home tonight.”

I backed up, voice cracking. “Police are right here. Back off!”

They didn’t care.

The mole guy slammed a fist into my chest. The air left my lungs. I staggered and nearly dropped the bag.

“No one’s saving you,” he whispered.

And then—

Sirens.

Shouting.

“STOP! POLICE!”

The men spun around. For the first time all night, I saw fear in their eyes. They bolted to the quad bike and tore off down the alley before the officers could reach them.

The street fell quiet again.

I leaned on the wall, chest aching, breath ragged.

“You alright?” one officer asked.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just… shaken.”

At the station later, the truth became clearer.

I wasn’t the first driver targeted. Or the second. I was the third—within forty minutes.

Three delivery workers. Same area. Same quad bike. Same faces.

The officers suspected they were local boys, high, bored, armed with enough adrenaline and stupidity to ruin someone’s life.

I quit deliveries a few days later.

Even now, every time I hear an engine rumble outside my window, my body tenses. My hands shake. And every Christmas, I think about those two young men on that quad bike—out there somewhere.

And how close they came to taking everything from me.",1,1764766528.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1pd3c3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1pd3c3k/road_trip_tips_6_days_late_april_early_may_usa/,Road trip tips - 6 days late April/ early May USA,"I’d love any ideas/recommendations on a trip late April/ first week May, for 6 days and nights, open to anywhere at all in mainland USA.

I like my trips to be fast-paced, focus on nature, scenic drives, National (or State) Parks / Forests, Recreation areas, mixed in with some commercial highlights. A perfect day for me is early starts with good coffee, drive 2-3 hours, stop for an activity/hike or explore an area with nature. After lunch, a couple more hours scenic drive with short stops along the way. Arrive at next hotel early evening, go for a run/walk before dinner.

To give you an idea of my last couple of trips:
1) Florida - Universal Orlando (1 day), Naples (1 day), Big Cypress/Everglades (2 days), Florida Keys (2.5 days), fly to of Miami
2) West - Vegas (1 night), Zion (1.5 days), Bryce Canyon/Capitol Reef (1.5 days), drive over to RMNP (via Grand Junction overnight) for 1.5 days in RNMP, fly out of Denver

I appreciate others may see these as quite rushed, but I love seeing the top 2-3 hours highlights of a wide variety places rather than spending a couple of days really exploring somewhere (for now at least! I will go back to my favourites to do them ‘properly’ in the future). What I loved about these two trips was the focus on nature and scenic drives, and being book-ended by commercial/high-energy cities or must-see spots for a day, and staying in great towns en route (e.g. Springdale, Utah).

I was initially looking at Yellowstone/Grand Teton but seems 2-3 weeks too early from reading on here.

I am also intrigued by Great Smokeys then driving over to Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Outer Banks. Other option could be Oregon/Washington?

He qualified for Season 4 by winning the qualifiers, but the start wasn’t easy: his first opponents were 🇷🇺AGENT, 🇺🇸rapha, and 🇷🇺pavel. He’s currently 0–3, but fire_bot has proven many times that he can surprise anyone — and he still has plenty of chances ahead.

You’ve been in the league since Season 1. How do you feel about the improvements and new players?

Yes, the league gets better every season, and I think we’re moving in the right direction. First of all, the prize pool keeps growing, which is great! Stakes are higher, and so is the competitive spirit. I’ve noticed this has motivated many experienced players to return to Quake Live.

I also like that changes are discussed with players, and the map pool gets slight updates each season. Most participants are already well-established, but inviting rapha was just amazing — super cool! And prox1mo is a machine: he set a goal and broke into the league 🙂

What goals do you have for this season?

I didn’t set any specific numbers.
My main goal is to play better than last season and show progress.

Who do you train with most often? Are there players who are especially useful to practice against?

Last season I practiced with Nitrino, and mostly with Ash. They’re very strong players, and it’s hardest for me to play against them: they know my style extremely well, so I constantly have to come up with something new to surprise them.

I believe that’s the only way to grow — understanding what works and what doesn’t. Often in practice nothing goes right, and they punish me hard for mistakes or for being too aggressive 🙂

Is there a player you prepare for more carefully?

Usually I don’t prepare for specific opponents.
The only thing I always take into account is their map preferences, weapons they favor, where they like to fight, and how they position themselves on the map.

It makes map picking easier and helps understand where it’s best to catch them off-guard — and which situations to avoid.

Do you have any “rituals” before matches — music, warmup, coffee?

My main ritual is to sit comfortably and give myself one mental rule: no matter what happens in the game, I must not lose composure.
Playing with a cold head — that’s the hardest part. The mental game is the most important thing for me.

Who would you like to see in the league in future seasons?

Of course, evil! Please deport him back 😄

TLDR; chick gets mad at me for not doing what she wants when she wants

so i started working at mcdonalds for about 5 weeks. i trained at an older location then transferred to a new one that was built. by the 2nd week of the new location being opened i knew what i needed to know and how things operate. so i love working the ice cream and coffees because its slow and you're standing around doing nothing if its slow. so there were no orders and so i was just standing there.

 this one chick i work with is getting on my nerves. she is always with this one dude and for some reason everywhere he goes she follows him. so im standing there looking around to see what needs cleaned (because we get in trouble if theres even so much as a crumb on the counter) and she has the AUDACITY to say im doing nothing and that im being useless. shes on drive thru and shes been standing around doing nothing in between orders just like i have been. so we start arguing. this whole time she has been trying to get me on drive thru so she can have time with her little boytoy to do whatever she wants. i have crazy anxiety when it comes to drive thru to the point of tears.

so shes making up lies saying that the manager is telling me to get on lane 1. i kept telling her that i am not gonna listen to her because she isnt a manager or shift lead. so she gets mad and is threatening to assault me if i dont listen to what she says. 

then her little boytoy comes around and intervenes saying that im not being a very good teammate by not listening to what shes telling me. the manager and everyone else knows i dont do drive thru for a reason but she doesnt care. so we are going back and forth until eventually i just give up and agree that im a terrible coworker. 

so about 5 minutes go by and im looking at the screen for orders. i look away and the second i look away an order comes on the screen. this chick yells at me HEY DO THAT. i looked away for one second holy shit. ",3,1764765480.0,McDonaldsEmployees,0,1.0,False

Not because of work (my job is about as exciting as watching paint dry), and not because I’m a morning person. I’m definitely not.

It was because of her.

Every day, without fail, she’d board the train at the third stop. Dark hair in a messy bun, oversized sweater, headphones on, holding the same chipped blue travel mug. She always looked like she had just barely made it out of the door on time, breathless but smiling in that soft, sleepy way people do before the world fully wakes up.

We never spoke.

But we kept noticing each other at a point in time.

Sometimes In The mornings she’d catch me glancing up from my book, and she’d look away too fast, like she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t. Other mornings, she’d be the one watching, and I’d pretend I wasn’t ridiculously flattered that someone like her even saw me.

One day, the train jolted hard, and her mug slipped from her hands. I caught it before it hit the floor, and for the first time, we were close enough that I could smell her shampoo something warm, almost like vanilla and rain.

“Nice reflexes,” she laughed breathlessly.

“Years of practice,”  I said, even though I’d never done anything that smooth in my entire life.

After that, it became a thing.

We’d nod good morning. Smile. Move just slightly closer.

Not enough to be obvious, but enough that I noticed when she changed her perfume, or when she bought a new notebook, or when she switched from coffee to green tea because, as she later admitted, “I was pretending to be healthier.”

The real turning point happened on a morning when the sky looked like it was about to split open. The train was delayed, everyone was irritated, and she ended up standing right next to me. Too close to ignore.

She looked up at me, exhaled, and said, “Honestly, this commute would be worse if you weren’t here.”

I Firstly Don't Understand, But I still don’t know what possessed me, but I replied, “I was thinking the same thing as well.”

Her cheeks went pink. “So you did notice me.”

“I think the whole train noticed you,” I said, “but I’m the one who got lucky.”

She laughed not shy this time, but bright and unguarded and before I could second guess myself, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee after work.

She said yes.

I don’t know where this is going. Maybe it’s something small. Maybe it’s something big.

This is my first post on Reddit, so I hope I’m doing this right.

entry-level grinders

affordable espresso machines

pour-over gear

compact setups for small kitchens

🧠 **Step 2: Claude Did the Heavy Lifting (45 mins)**

* Fed Claude the app concept
* Asked it to generate: UI/UX design specifications, complete MVP term sheet, feature breakdown, user flow descriptions
* The output? *Chef's kiss* \- more detailed than my college thesis

🎨 **Step 3: Design Magic (1 hour)**

* Took Claude's specs to Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* This tool is INSANE - it turned my text descriptions into actual UI designs
* Got screens for onboarding, main feed, user profile, settings
* Everything looked like it came from a $10K designer

⚡ **Step 4: Build Time (1.5 hours)**

* Grabbed the designs + Claude's MVP term
* Threw everything into Rork
* The AI literally built the mobile app while I grabbed coffee
* Made a few tweaks and boom - working prototype

**The Hook:** What took dev teams weeks in 2020 now takes ONE PERSON an afternoon in 2025.

**What I learned:**

* You don't need to code anymore, you need to know how to ORCHESTRATE AI tools
* The barrier to entry for app development is officially dead
* Finding the RIGHT idea (via Sensor Tower) is 10x more valuable than coding skills

**Am I going to launch this?** Hell yeah. Already setting up TestFlight.

**Tools used:**

* Sensor Tower (free tier for research)
* Claude AI (for specs/design docs)
* Google Stitch (stitch (dot) withgoogle (dot) com)
* Rork (for the actual build)

1pd2qgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1pd2qgt/have_you_noticed_how_bleak_people_are_when_they/,"Have you noticed how bleak people are when they say ""You've got no future, accept it on the spot"" to you and because of your Autism, they can say it with no emotion and expect you to swallow that information and move on, instantly, not allowed to grieve over it..","It happens to me. I am 34 and incredibly unattractive to women, I've never been able to hold down a job, my Autism is too complex, I need to live in a supported home with 5 other Autistic men and care workers. I cannot even tie a shoe lace. I cannot handle money. I cannot buy groceries on my own.

And when I hear Neurotypical people, especially women, moaning ""Oh I'm 25 and still not setteled down with kids and married"" they act like it is absolute end of days and they vocally display they are miserable because of it.

But when I go through this severe realization that there is no clear sign of any future of me ever setteling down with a woman with kids, it makes me incredibly depressed and missionless as a 34 year old and my care workers moan at me for stop being depressed all the time and go take anti-depressant pills..

My life is just wake up and do chores with my fellow Autistic housemates, get the house in shape and then watch a little TV and then take turns on our shared computer do a little surfing, do my hobbies, then sleep. Not much of a mission. I feel this primitive urge to raise children with a woman that's not accomplished.

The care workers when I tell them about my depression of not setteling down at 34 is ""Oh, you need to accept it, you were born with a disability, you are complicated, you cannot take care of yourself, you can't take care of a baby, you also have hereditary Autism, it will pass to them, there's no way you can take care of a baby with that, when you have it yourself, plus it will be unfair to give a baby Autism from your DNA, you need to accept you can't have it"" And they act like I am able to just instantly say ""Ok, I accept it"".

But Neurotypicals will be crushed! They would never be able to just instantly accept it. There's this coldness that we are to just accept bad fates quicker than Neurotypicals... It's sad.  
We aren't even allowed to grieve we are told ""Oh well, the worst thing EVER, you'll never have a future, never have a child that looks like you to raise, you'll never have a beautiful wife that tells you she loves you to spend the rest of your life with, oh well, accept it"".

I've seen couples go into depression and crying because the woman's womb is not working or the man's sperm isn't working and try and try and try and they cry without kids. But they are allowed to grieve. I'm not? I gotta just say ""Oh well I can't, I wont be succesful reproducing organism I was put on Earth for, oh well"".

And I've had conversations with girls on dating sites who are my age, trying to just get my first date. I just search for girls to go on a date with my age at a coffee shop or watch some TV together and have like a little date. Not realizing that's a teen thing to do. These women at 30+ want a serious comitted settle down, they don';t want little coffee shop giggles.

And they run from me (not only because I am 5''7 and bald and unattractive and Autistic with no house of my own and not financially supportive) but the baby they'll have will have hereditary Autism and they're in ""settle down mode"" and absolutely run to the hills as I'll get in the way of that ""settle down mode""..

So I really don't know what to do. I've heard the tired ""Get hobbies"" over and over. I have so many hobbies, that everytime I move in my bedroom, I hear a ""CRASH!"" or dusting and polishing my room takes hours, because all of my clay sculptures I've filled my room with. It's still not a replacement of love and being a father..

Or the ""get pets, that'll be like a baby"". It wont be MY baby with my features. It wont be with a beautiful woman that LOVES me. It wont be me succesfully reproducing as I was put on this Earth to do. Plus, our supportive home doesn't allow pets and money is a big issue being unemployed and saving resources. Couldn't have a pet even if I wanted.",1,1764764596.0,autism,3,0.67,False
1pd2qe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CELPIP_Help/comments/1pd2qe3/is_celpip_easier_than_ielts/,Is CELPIP easier than IELTS?,"**Before I answer the question ""Is CELPIP easier?"", let me tell you what I have seen.**

  
  
In IELTS, I have seen so many students scoring 9 in Listening, 8+ in Reading, and even 8 in Speaking. But guess what? They fail to score a 7 in Writing. I have seen students take the test 6 or 7 times and still fail to get that 7. They are stuck at 6.5 forever. 

  
Many students choose another path for PR. They apply for a student visa, thinking it will be easier once they study in Canada. However, with the CRS score now around 540, it has almost become necessary to score **Triple 7 and 8** in IELTS.

Because of this, many students are now choosing **CELPIP instead of IELTS**.

Why?  
In this article, I will explain the reasons and how CELPIP can be easier for some students. It is not ""easy,"" but scoring a 9 is much more achievable.



**1. The Spell Check is a Life Saver**

This is the biggest difference.

* **IELTS:** You are on your own. If you spell ""environment"" wrong, you lose marks.
* **CELPIP:** There is an automatic spell checker. If you make a typo, you see a red line and can fix it. This lets you focus on your ideas, not your spelling.

**2. The Writing Task is Much Simpler**

In CELPIP, the second writing task is just an **""Opinion Survey.""**

* You simply choose an option and explain why you prefer it.
* You get about **27 minutes** to write **150 words**.
* This is plenty of time to write and check your work comfortably.
*  You just need to brainstorm about the topic in the given context. However, in IELTS, if you do not know about the topic,  you won't be able to write a 7 -Band essay. For example, Animal Testing. You may say it is not ehtical or may support it  by giving argumets such as there are not alternate options, but write a 7-band essay that convinces examiner that you have suffiicently addressed the prompt will be atough thing

**3. Speaking Strategies Actually Work**

In IELTS, the examiner can ask you random questions that might surprise you. In CELPIP, the questions follow a strict pattern (like ""Give Advice"", ""Sharing Experience"" , ""Describe a Picture"" and so on). Because the pattern is always the same, you can learn **templates** and strategies that actually help you score high.

**4. The Listening Accent is Easier**

* **IELTS:** Often uses British or Australian accents that can be fast or hard to understand.
* **CELPIP:** Uses a standard **Canadian accent**. It sounds like a normal conversation you would hear at a grocery store or coffee shop in Toronto or Vancouver.

**5. Marking Feels More Lenient**

This is just my personal experience, but the marking felt fairer. After being stuck at 6.5 in IELTS writing for a long time, I finally got the score I needed in CELPIP. It felt like the examiners were looking for reasons to give me points, not take them away.

**6. Speaking to a Computer vs. A Person**

* **IELTS:** You sit face-to-face with an examiner. This can be very stressful and make you freeze up.
* **CELPIP:** You wear a headset and speak to a computer. There is a timer on the screen, so you know exactly when to stop. It is much more relaxed.





**Now the question is: If it is easier, then why students are not scoring 9 on their first attempt.**

* The first reason is experimentation. Many students who join my one-on-one classes say they took the exam just to “check how it works,” without proper preparation.
* The second reason is YouTube. Students practice listening on YouTube, which is fine, but what about Reading? You cannot take a proper reading test on YouTube or from random PDF files.
* Many students also avoid proper training because they assume CELPIP is easy. Yes, it can be easier, but a teacher can help you learn faster, avoid mistakes, and use strategies that actually work. Instead of that, students just watch videos and download PDF notes. But in  videos, I can only teach general tips — and those may not apply to everyone.

**If you are stuck at 6.5 in IELTS writing, do not keep taking the same test. Switch to CELPIP. It is friendlier for people who are comfortable with computers, and with the right preparation, a score of 9 is definitely possible.**",1,1764764589.0,CELPIP_Help,0,1.0,False
1pd2qcb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pd2qcb,Blind bought lattafa khamrah qahwa after TREMENDOUS positive reviews,"So.. this is my first time buying a perfume (with my own money) so was really curious to get this one (lattafa khamrah qahwa from perfumeaddiction)

I have azzaro the most wanted intense and David beckham something I gotta see (my sister bought these for me)

Not saying I’d prefer these over azzaro, but damn.. this smells good and warm and IT IS NOT FEMININE smelling. (Seen reviews saying it’s only good for women)

Initially when I sprayed it first on my wrist, it was a bit strong, tasty smell (how do I describe it lol)

Then I sprayed 1 on my cloth, 2 body and 1 on my neck.

For some time after spraying, it smelt a strong alcoholic smell, which in 30 mins blended into something sweet, tasty, dark, coffee smell.

I sprayed it 6 hours ago, can still smell the vanilla and that edible smell I can’t figure it out lol. But the harshness has definitely faded. 

Only the issue was the opening, very strong and harsh. But as it settled, loved it.

8.5/10.

Could be a safe blind buy if you like sweet smelling perfumes.

Nakakamiss yung yakap na ramdam mo pa rin kahit nakatalikod ka na.

This post is for someone who’s not chasing drama — just craving warmth, presence, and a spark na hindi kailangang patagalin.
I used to say I’m into slow-burn, pero to be honest? I’m more spontaneous
 gusto ko yung vibe na mabilis mag-click, mabilis din mag-init.
