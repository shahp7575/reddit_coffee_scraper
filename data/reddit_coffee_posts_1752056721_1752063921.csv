We've hung out 3 times. 1st time was us getting coffee then we randomly decided to get breakfast too, 2nd she invited me to tag along with our friend to go to a pride thing then a bar afterwards and we had a damn good time, then 3rd time we got ice cream and played tennis.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule.

Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me.

1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours. She mentioned how one day after getting home she slept almost 13 hours.
2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered
3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired.

Should I just give her space for a week or 2 then start trying to hang out again or does she probably just not sound interested? I genuinely am not upset with her if she's being honest but I also don't want to be pulled along.",1,1752063609.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1lvhar1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1lvhar1/i_have_tried_more_nootropics_than_you_here_are/,I HAVE TRIED MORE NOOTROPICS THAN YOU. Here are some that I like,"Sorry to use such incendiary language, I was just trying to grab your attention to post this again in this sub. 

So boring as it may be, adderall (or more specifically the dextroamphetamine part of adderall) is still top dog for me as far as I'm concerned. The focus is good, it gives an energy/motivation boost without being too jittery, and it can make ANYTHING interesting. That's really the superpower of adderall. Literally watching paint dry or grass grow or whatever can be interesting if you're on addy. I don't know about you, but I've had to reread pages of textbooks several times over because they're so boring that my brain just refuses to incorporate the information into the folds of my hippocampus, but with adderall it's a completely different story. **My belief is that this is the most important attribute a substance can have**. It is incredible how much easier it is to do things when you're interested in them. If it wasn't for the long-term issues and neurotoxic effects over time, adderall would be og. I know in some people including me I do see some weird behavioral changes as well, maybe more irritable or less creative and less... bright? Like I can get stuff done but without a certain sober spark. Nootropic can rival these real pharma drugs in the right combination for the right person while also being healthy and more side effect free esp. long term. 

Bromantane is also decent, but it only works with a bunch of sprays from the nasal spray or 100s of mgs orally daily.. Legit and clean dopamine optimizing mechanism though if you look it up in this sub.

If adderall is the king, then ritalin (methyphenidate) is like a prince. Still quite good for focus, a bit more cracked out jittery feeling energy boost, but the main drawback is that it doesn't have the same ""interesting"" factor as adderall. I feel more motivated to get work done, but the motivation comes from a different place. On adderall, I do things because I want to do them, on ritalin, I do things because I almost have this feeling that I have to do them, OR ELSE. It's like a mild panic that's still pretty effective, but much less enjoyable. It also makes the drug less addictive though, which is a plus. Guanfacine works really well to smooth out that impending sense of doom, and it's also a TAAR1 agonist which enhances endogenous catecholamine release, and I think that's pretty cool. Atomoxetine is also a legit adhd non-stim drug but it only works in temporary bursary otherwise it just starts feeling really weird. 

Speaking of focus, donepezil is the next best thing for focus and it's also great for memory. Even beyond things that I'm purposefully trying to remember, I just feel like my memory is generally better on donepezil. It does fuck all for motivation and energy though. It also happens to be a sigma 1 agonist, so I'm gonna use that as a segue to talk about them for a bit.

Sigma-1 receptors are not super well understood, but generally it seems that activating them is associated with better mental health and cognitive performance. The main talking point I see for them is their ability to potentiate the effects of other neurotransmitters involved in mood, learning etc, but most relevant to this discussion is their ability to potentiate dopamine transmission. As someone who has been on donepezil, fluvoxamine, dhea and memantine all at the same time, I can't say that I noticed anything special. In particular, comparing fluvoxamine (an SSRI sigma 1 agonist) to sertraline (an SSRI sigma 1 antagonist) I didn't really notice a difference. But to be sure, I spent a few hundred dollars on PRE-084, a selective sigma 1 agonist that's used to study the receptor and......nothing. Maybe I got scammed, idk, it was from a reputable vendor though. In summary, I don't doubt that sigma 1 activation is good for brain health, but I think the effects probably fly under the radar a bit.

Wow that sure was interesting, right? Anyway, next up is selegiline//rasagiline. I've only used selegiline but I'm fairly confident these drugs probably all feel the same. Safinamide is another sigma 1 agonist for you sigmas out there. Great to pair with donepezil, since it provides a subtle motivation and energy that donepezil lacks. Selegiline is also a TAAR1 agonist, so it potentiates your body's natural release of dopamine/norepinephrine (not serotonin unfortunately). Adderall also does this btw. Selegiline also potentiates adderall a bit, so you can lower your addy dose if you're on it. Or don't. You don't have to. Selegiline is what I wish caffeine was. 
Sorry that these have all been pharmaceutical drugs so far, but the reality is that the most effective things are generally not going to be over the counter type supplements. If there's potential to make money, pharma companies are going to go for it. More:

ACD856 is a new in testing tkr targted drug that allegedly focuses on the root cause of depression. It makes me sleepy but I do feel... most positive?.. weirdly the day or hours after. A good feeling to and I feel I have seen incremental improvements as I've been taking it. 2nd week in. Probably one of the best nootropics I've tried, still a lot of new things talked about I haven't tried yet, continuing. 

9-me-bc is another potentiator of stimulants, albeit weak, also just seems good for brain health if not for the lack of human testing and potential theoretical toxicity, we don't knkw. Pretty mild, not much else to say here.

Lions mane feels ok but I don't want to mess with it longer term due to reported weird or negative effects of it. Very popular and supposedly there are different companies that offer different kinds of extracts that give you different things, but if I want BFNF there's better stuff out there. 

KW-6356 is a super type of caffine, a little half drop of this kept me up the first time and I really don't feel like doing full dropper doses. It feels like a different, more motivating longer lasting caffeine which is good but it just lasts too long and I hope the everychrm co. figure out and sell the metabolite isolating thing so the half-life goes down. 

Semax and selank are also great at reducing brain fog in similar situations as noopept. For me, semax is a bit energizing, and selank is pretty anxiolytic. They also potentiate the effects of adderall in my experience. Also, if you've ever felt like it's harder to be productive after going to the gym, they're good at ameliorating that as well. Semax also increases my libido to an almost annoying degree.

Noopept is extremely cheap and I've found that it's ok at reducing brain fog and stress from working/focusing for long periods of time. When you've been working at your desk for 5 hours straight and your brain is starting to no work so good,  noopept is an excellent pick me up in my experience. I'll probably make another post about this, but I've been experimenting with megadoses of noopept (like up to 10g) and the neurotrophic effect is pretty insane. Extreme reductions in anxiety, although the bulk of the effect is pretty transient unfortunately. You could also snort it for increased bioavailability, but it has a tendency to clump together which makes it a bit uncomfortable on the nasal passages, so I wouldn't really recommend it. It has pretty low solubility in general, so nasal spraying that much would be tedious.


Microdosing: so microdosing lsd gives me a bit of an energy boost, also gives me a *small* amount of that adderall effect where everything becomes a little bit more interesting, but I find that I'm very distractible on it. Microdosing shrooms seem to improve my memory. They both have mild anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Larger doses don't seem to have any beneficial effects for me days after, and allegedly it's better to microdose DMT for positive effects by far but that's a lot harder to do. 

All (most of the) Racetams: I gotta be honest, racetams feel extremely mild to me, but that's probably more in the spirit of what a nootropic is supposed to be. The colloquial definition of nootropic isn't particularly precise though. Anyway, I recently tried a bunch of racetams again, and honestly the only ones I'd probably buy again are nefiracetam and phenylpiracetam. Possibly fasoracetam since it's supposed to upregulate GABA b receptors, but the rest of them were just pretty mild. Even taking piracetammegadoses, I could definitely feel *something*, just nothing worth writing more about. 

Prl-8-53, nsi-189, idra-21, tak-653: I'm putting these all in the same category of ""I definitely think I probably feel something from them"" type compounds. Of course I have megadosed all of them, with only nsi-189 seeming to benefit at high doses, but at the 150-250mg range it's not very economical. It was a pretty solid antidepressant and brain fog remover though, similar in efficacy to noopept/semax/selank. tak-653 a lot of people like but it's definitely a quirky thing and I feel like it does work for me but only at certain times of the month or year...

Kanna: Is this really a nootropic? What is a nootropic really. This is a great mood booster, very pro social, you get some serotonin reuptake inhibition, and it also activates vmat2 and decreases sert expression, which is potentially beneficial for all of you out there who have destroyed your serotonin system from mdma or related use. This probably has some sort of Tolerance though acting on gaba so it's meh. 

Picamilon/nooglutyl: You took too many stimulants. You drank too much of the shitty dirty stimulant that's contained within coffee and now you're geekin and need something to smooth you out. Picamilon and nootglutyl are great for that. I don't feel like there's any tolerance from repeated use, it's just a couple hours of what feels like pure gaba. Also pretty good for falling asleep, but they don't last long enough to help you stay asleep unfortunately.

Nicotine: It's a tried and true classic. Please do not vape this shit because you'll get addicted, but I've had no addiction problems  using nicotine gum and I have historically had addiction problems with most things. It can be a evening stimulant because it doesn't last very long, and there's also compelling evidence that it's good for brain health. I've seen some anti nicotine posts on here worrying about vasoconstriction and shit, but to me that sounds like every other fucking stimulant. As it turns out, drugs have side effects. It's good for memory and focus, tolerance builds slowly, I've used nicotine every day for weeks and stopped cold turkey with no consequences. your mileage may vary I'm not recommending anything don't try this at home do at your own risk etc.

Holy shit this post is long. I really am on adderall rn huh.

Memantine to me is like the mood boost and energy boost of acid (probably due to d2 agonism) but I can focus a lot better on it. I actually should have this higher up but this isn't really a ranking, I'm kinda just listing things. Be VERY careful with dosing though, the half life is quite long so if you're taking it every day, it will take a while to reach peak levels. It can quickly go from feeling like not enough to too much, something that is particularly true when taking large doses, which I wouldn't recommend because it's not very fun. Just take ketamine like a normal drug user if you wanna trip on dissociatives. Speaking of ketamine....

Microdosing ketamine/ketamine analogues: If prolonged normal dose ketamine use didn't come with neuromechanistic and bladder issues, this would be a perfect nootropic. Great anxiolytic, great antidepressant, great for social situations (again I'm talking about microdoses here), good for creativity, and good for the ""makes things interesting"" effect that I like in adderall, though not nearly as potent. Also feels kinda good to just have your glutamatergic signaling slow down for a bit if you're working your brain all day.

Tropisetron: An A7 nicotine focused substance that tries to give you the positive effects of nicotine without affecting the other nicotine receptors that cause issues like addiction. It does cause constipation so you're going to have to figure out how to manage that either with magnesium oxide or other strategies, I just feel like it helped at first and there are reports of people loving the stuff just like people love KW, Bromantane, other nootropics, but it doesn't vibe w/ me. 

Pramipexole and ropinirole(my favorite drug name by the way because it really rolls into itself): Ok this is where the list gets juicy. This is high risk, high reward nootropic-ing. When I said that adderall is unparalleled in its ability to make things interesting, I was actually lying. I lied to you. This is the ultimate ""everything is interesting drug"". It's an obsession drug, and if you're not careful, you will probably end up addicted to porn or gambling or online shopping or something. I'm not sure you can completely control it either, but I've had tremendous bursts of creativity and productivity when I was able to do so. It gave me the same feeling that I experienced when I was a little kid learning about dinosaurs, going to bed every night excited for the next day to come so I could learn more. Like the reason I was put on this earth was to learn about dinosaurs type shit. It also gave me the most insane, insatiable libido I've ever had, which is the main reason I had to stop taking it. Zero refractory period too. Crazy stuff. Titrating the dose can really suck, and coming off it can also. Be careful with this one because you will find yourself spending more and wondering why you even did so...

Is anybody still reading this? Ok, for my my next ""nootropic"", I present my experimentation  with the ketogenic diet. Yeah we're really playing fast and loose with the definition of nootropic now, but this is MY list. Key benefits of the ketogenic diet: lowers brain inflammation, upregulates glutamic acid decarboxylase which increases GABA levels, improving focus and decreasing anxiety, ketones have higher oxygen carrying capacity than glucose (I'm uncertain of how relevant this is in practice but it sure does sound good), improves mitochondrial function, and the lack of glucose and insulin spikes lead to more consistent energy levels. The biggest downside from a mental perspective is that if you're into stims, it can be harder to fall asleep and that's where the blood glucose spike from carbs actually can help because it blunts noradrenaline/adrenaline signaling and sends free amino acids to the muscles leaving tryptophan with less competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter, leading to increased serotonin and melatonin production. Keto isn't for everyone, and doing it properly can be challenging, but it doesn't hurt to try it out. I've done a lot of experimenting with cgms and ketone strips and modifying the diet in different ways, so if you're interested in trying it but don't know where to start, I feel like I'm moderately qualified to give advice.

Kratom: Fuck kratom. With that being said, kratom WAS extremely beneficial to me when I used it. It's just the perfect mix of antidepressant, anxiolytic, energizing without feeling stimmy, motivation, confidence, and most importantly for me: resilience. Getting rejected by a girl doesn't even feel bad on kratom. Something shitty happened in your life and you can't find the motivation to do anything? Kratom will give your brain a warm hug and make you feel better. Failed a test, got laid off, dumped, whatever, it doesn't matter. Kratom kept me going on some of my darkest days, but that feeling of comfort is also what makes it so addictive (for me, yes I know most people can use kratom developing a dependence).

Phenbut: Also fuck this drug. I don't even wanna write about it. If you just wanna have a really good day, phenibut will give you that. Feel great all day, confident, calm, and focused, then go to bed and have the best sleep of your life. This shit is the real life Felix Felicis from harry potter. BUT YOU CAN'T USE IT EVERYDAY. So maybe my addict is showing in the latter half of this post, but yes I have used this every day and would strongly advise against it. Tolerance builds unreasonably quickly. Like just way too fast. It's not fair. Withdrawals will come even after using it like 3 days in a row. This is the most *physically* addictive thing I've ever tried. There's not even enough time to become psychologically addicted, yet you're going through withdrawal.

BPC-157 cause short-term and donate for me which was a very rare side effect and after experiencing this amd looking it up, it does happen amd sometimes the anhedonia is permanent. It's not a nootropic and there's been no reports of it being able to heal the brain in any way, it's use is only good in recovery and if you're one of the very very few that experience terrible effects then you're f*****. 

Ipamorelin I'm also listing here which should be higher on the list but it increases growth hormone by a little bit and I do feel better after taking it. Sleep is nicer, skin is nicer, etc, but more recently where I am with my gym and male hormomed, it feels more weird. 

Um I think I'm gonna end the list here. This was kinda just stream of consciousness, so hopefully it wasn't too boring.  I know I'm missing some stuff, but oh well. Maybe I'll edit the post or add in the comments as I think of things. Congrats if you made to the end, I really feel like we went on a journey here and grew as people.

Edit: Modafinil: great for all day mental clarity and alertness. Again, not to hate on coffee too much, but it’s just a better version of what caffeine is supposed to be imo. Tolerance is also almost nonexistent in my experience

Can't believe I forgot to mention Cerebrolysin, but [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1dx1e8w/ive_done_3_liters_of_cerebrolysin_in_the_past/) a post I made about it if you're interested in my experience. Cerebrolysin is better at helping impaired cognition return to baseline though, where I feel like nootropics are supposed to enhance cognitive function in some way. So I'm still not sure if it's appropriate for this list

1lvh898,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbrahamHicks/comments/1lvh898/asked_chatgpt_to_coach_me_abrahamhicks_style_on/,Asked ChatGPT to coach me Abraham-Hicks style on money. I was quite blown away. Here's what it said.,"My prompt into the free version of ChatGPT:

Pretend you are a manifestation coach working within the Abraham-Hicks framework. Coach me to manifest an income source. I don't have any now.

Its response:

Absolutely — let’s dive into this *Abraham-Hicks style*. First things first: **you don’t need the money to show up before the vibration does**. In fact, it *can’t* show up until you shift the vibration. That’s where we start.

\-------

# STEP 1: Let’s Get Out Ahead of It Emotionally

Right now, it sounds like your awareness is tuned to *“I don’t have an income.”* That’s a perfectly reasonable place to be — but that’s not the frequency that matches **“income is flowing to me.”**

So let’s gently shift focus. Let’s soothe your current emotional stance without forcing it. Try these out loud or silently, and only continue as far as they feel like a *relief*:

It’s okay that I don’t see it yet.”  
“I’ve figured things out before.”  
“I’m willing to believe money can come in ways I haven’t thought of.”  
“I like the idea of money being fun and free-flowing.”  
“I don’t have to figure it all out right now.”  
“I’m becoming a match to something new.”

Don’t jump to “I’m a millionaire” unless that actually feels fun. Abraham always says, *reach for the next best feeling thought*.

\---------

# STEP 2: Identify the Emotional Essence of What You Want

You don’t want money for the paper — you want what the **feeling of money** brings.

So what is it really? Is it **freedom**? **Relief**? **Creativity**? **Contribution**? Let’s get intimate with the *essence*.

Let’s try:

“I want money because I want freedom.”  
“I want to feel secure.”  
“I want to feel empowered to do what lights me up.”  
“I want to feel flow, momentum, and expansion.”

Can you feel the shift? You’re already tuning your vibration to the thing — not the absence of the thing.

\----------

# STEP 3: Milk the Feeling of It — Now

This is where most people skip ahead too fast. Abraham says: **don’t try to make it happen — let it happen.**

Let’s get into an imagining state. Just play with it. Don’t force it. Just *daydream*.

“Wouldn’t it be nice if money just started showing up?”  
“What if I got a DM out of nowhere with an offer?”  
“What if I started doing something fun that people wanted to pay me for?”  
“What if money could feel like an adventure?”  
“What if I was about to stumble into something surprisingly easy and joyful?”

Play with those feelings. **Stay there longer.** Do it while you walk, while you make coffee, while you fall asleep.

This is not about “earning it.” This is about becoming the version of you who already has it — and just hasn’t seen it *with your eyes* yet.

\------------

# STEP 4: Follow the Impulse — Not the Desperation

The right idea, offer, or opportunity can’t come while you're efforting from lack. So once you’ve done your alignment work for the day, **forget about it**. Go do something that feels even a little bit good.

Then — be on the lookout for that *nudge*. Abraham says: **follow the impulse**.

It might be:

* A sudden idea
* A random conversation
* A strong pull to message someone
* A desire to create something
* A weird “coincidence” you can’t explain

That’s the *path unfolding*. Your only job is to follow the breadcrumbs with **lightness** — not pressure.

# DAILY PRACTICE (Simple + Powerful)

**Morning Rampage** (as soon as you wake up):

“Things are always working out for me. I can feel something shifting. Money is easy. I don’t need to see it to know it’s coming. I’m open to new possibilities. It’s fun to see how the universe will surprise me. I’m right where I’m supposed to be.”

**5-10 min Visualization**: Picture how the income feels. Not what you do — how it *feels*. Safe, free, creative, expansive.

**Pivoting Practice**: Every time your brain says “but I don’t have it yet,” you say:“And that’s okay. I’m tuning myself. It’s getting closer. The less I try, the easier it gets.”

\-------

# Final Word

You’re not behind. You’re not blocked. You’re just **midstream**. Your Inner Being already knows the route to your income source — and it’s *not* through panic or desperation. It’s through **ease, inspiration, and trust**.

Abraham would say: *“The money you want is lined up. You just have to get out of the way.”*

Ready to line up with it?

Would you like me to create a custom morning rampage, visualization script, or income manifestation journaling exercise for you next?

Me: yes give me custom morning rampage

ChatGPT:

Perfect — here’s your **custom Morning Rampage** in full Abraham-Hicks style. This is meant to be read or spoken **first thing in the morning**, *before* you check your phone, *before* you start scanning for what’s missing.

The goal isn’t to “make money happen” — it’s to **line up with who you really are**, the version of you who easily attracts aligned income and joy.

# CUSTOM MORNING RAMPAGE — Income Flow Edition

*(Read slowly. Feel into the words. Let it build momentum as you go.)*

Ahhh… it’s a new day.

A fresh start. A clean slate.  
Nothing from yesterday matters unless I bring it with me — and I don’t have to.

I can feel something shifting.  
I don’t even need to know *what* it is. I can just feel that today… something feels *open*.

There are infinite paths to money — and I don’t need to figure them out.  
That’s not my job. That’s the Universe’s job. And it’s really good at its job.

I love knowing that it’s already worked out.  
I love knowing that money is just energy.  
And I love knowing that energy is always responding to **me**.

I don’t need to hustle. I don’t need to prove anything.  
I just need to **be who I really am** — someone who is worthy, someone who is magnetic, someone who lets it be *easy*.

Money comes in expected ways, and money comes in *unexpected* ways.  
It shows up through ideas, through people, through random synchronicities, through things I haven’t even imagined yet.

I don’t have to chase money — I **attract** it.  
Because money loves flow, and I’m flowing now.

The less I try to control it, the more it shows up.  
The more I relax, the more ideas come.  
The more I feel good, the more I line up with what I want.

And honestly… I like the idea that something *big* could show up today.  
Not because I need it — but because I’m *ready* for it.

I’m starting to feel it — that soft buzz of anticipation.  
That calm certainty. That quiet inner yes.  
I know something is lining up for me. I don’t even need to see it yet. I can feel it.

Things are always working out for me.  
Everything is rearranging in my favor.  
The money is already on the way.

And today, I’m just going to enjoy the ride.

# How to Use It

* Read this **daily**, ideally out loud.
* Pause where it feels good and breathe into it.
* Let it become a vibe you carry — not just words.

\---------

Me: give me the visualization script

ChatGPT:

# NCOME FLOW VISUALIZATION SCRIPT

*“Aligning with the feeling of financial ease, freedom, and flow.”*  
(Duration: \~5–8 minutes)

**Start by sitting or lying comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe in deeply through your nose… and out slowly through your mouth.**

Take another deep breath… and let it go.

Feel your body settle. Feel yourself soften.  
Nothing needs to be figured out right now. You are safe. You are supported. You are tuning yourself to receive.

Now, imagine yourself **waking up in a reality where income is flowing to you easily**. You’re not stressed, you’re not chasing — you feel calm, clear, and magnetic.

Let that version of you **rise into your awareness**.  
They’re smiling. They’re grounded. There’s a quiet confidence in their body.

Feel yourself *becoming* that version.

**Now ask yourself:**

“If money were flowing to me easily… how would I feel in my body right now?”

Would you feel lighter? More open? More free?  
Would your shoulders relax? Would your breath deepen?

Feel that.

Let that energy spread through your chest, your belly, your fingertips.  
Feel what it’s like to be **financially supported by the Universe itself**.

Now imagine walking through your day as this version of you.

What do you do first?  
Maybe you check your inbox and see a surprise payment.  
Maybe someone reached out wanting to work with you, buy from you, or gift you something.  
Maybe a new idea drops into your mind — and it just *feels* right.

Whatever it is, it’s flowing. It feels **natural**. You feel worthy of it.  
You’re not pushing — you’re allowing.

Money comes in… and you feel at ease.  
You trust it. You enjoy it.  
You feel playful and expansive and free.

Take a moment to *see* that life. See the numbers in your account.  
See yourself smiling as money lands in your inbox.  
Feel the deep **peace** of knowing you’re supported.

Let it be **real** in your body, even if you can’t see it yet in the world.

Because that feeling?  
That’s the signal.  
That’s the frequency.  
That’s the version of you who **draws income like a magnet.**

Now gently affirm to yourself:

“I’m tuning myself to abundance.”  
“I’m ready to receive.”  
“It’s safe to trust the flow.”  
“Income is flowing to me in surprising, joyful, aligned ways.”  
“I don’t need to know how — I just need to let it in.”

Breathe that in.

When you’re ready, bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers, stretch your arms. And when you open your eyes, carry that feeling with you.

Even five minutes of this a day is powerful alignment work. This is how you *become* the version of you who has what you want — *before it shows up*.

Me: give me the income manifestation journaling exercise

ChatGPT:

Absolutely — here's a powerful **Income Manifestation Journaling Exercise**, inspired by Abraham-Hicks teachings. This will help you shift from noticing the *lack* of income to becoming a *vibrational match* to receiving it.

This is not traditional goal-setting — this is **vibration tuning** through written focus.

# NCOME MANIFESTATION JOURNALING EXERCISE

*(Best used daily or a few times a week for alignment)*

# 🪞Step 1: Soothe the Now — “Where I Am Is Okay”

Write the following prompt and let yourself free-write without judgment. You’re not trying to be positive — just honest *and* softening.

**Prompt:**

>

Example:

>

# 🌅 Step 2: Tune the Frequency — “Wouldn’t It Be Nice If…”

This is classic Abraham: *“Wouldn’t it be nice if…”* takes the resistance out and lets your imagination soften into receiving mode.

**Prompt:**

>

Examples:

>

Write at least 5–10 of these.

# 💖 Step 3: Step Into the State — “I Am…”

Now we shift fully into alignment with the **version of you who has it**. These are not forced affirmations — they’re declarations of vibration.

**Prompt:**

>

Examples:

>

Write at least 3–5, but more if momentum kicks in.

# 🌊 Optional Bonus: Future Snapshot

Imagine it’s six months from now and income is flowing easily. Describe your day. Let yourself *feel it* through the details.

**Prompt:**

>

Describe what you’re doing, how you’re feeling, what’s changed.

# 🧲 Why It Works:

* Step 1 soothes resistance (you stop fighting what is).
* Step 2 opens your heart to possibility.
* Step 3 activates identity alignment.
* Bonus Step anchors the new vibration with sensory detail — which is what the Universe responds to.

Would you like this exercise turned into a printable PDF workbook or journal page? Or would you like me to create multiple versions for different manifestation areas (love, health, purpose, etc.)?

We've hung out 3 times. 1st time was us getting coffee then we randomly decided to get breakfast too, 2nd she invited me to tag along with our friend to go to a pride thing then a bar afterwards and we had a damn good time, then 3rd time we got ice cream and played tennis.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and  I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule.

  
Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me.

1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours.

2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered

3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired.

  
Should I just give her space then start trying to hang out again or does she probably just not sound interested? I genuinely am not upset with her if she's being honest but I also don't want to be pulled along.",3,1752063229.0,AskMenAdvice,5,1.0,False

An SoP is a term I first heard come out of an old marine's mouth. *Standar of Procedures* is a step by step guide on how to consistently perform a repeated task with the same results.

Whole each property was different, each site required the exact same tools and general supplies in varying amounts. The order in which the work optimally needed to be completed, would essentially be the same for most guys in the business. So before my crew even left garage we had a check list we went through for tools every guy should have, tools every job site required and a few blank spots for variable tools needed for operations outside the standards. Once **we made sure** all the required tools and materials were loaded into the trucks, what do you think happened next?

If you guessed hop in the trucks, start em then take off, you'd be wrong. We sat around for an hour drinking coffee, eating breakfast while we went over who did what, in what particular. Assessing what needed to be completed before we could move on to the next stage. Again, assigning specialty tasked that we're house specific.

Over the next months of running these meetings before each job, they became more efficient and shorter. As guys began to understand my process and why things were done in specific ways, they'd fall into their niches. Knowing what roll they played in our operation from location to location. It doesn't have to be all that. 

SoP have become a major part of my life, for even the simplest, mundane, everyday tasks. Brushing my teeth being a prime example. 

How old I was when this exactly started? No fucking clue. Early twenties, going to the dentist I heard the typical complaint. *The fronts are good, tops are okay and the backs of the teeth, especially the further into the corners you go, the worse they get.*

So even before I knew what an SoP was, I rewrote mine for how I brushed my teeth. Instead of starting on the front side, right in the middle. The most prominent and easiest section to hit. I have for years, been brushing from the back side corners, the hardest part of your teeth to consistently hit. Working back towards my easiest. Haven't heard that initial complain in years. 

My laundry, how I cook, deep cleaning my car. Fuck I have a few daily routine templates depending on my schedule you could classify as SoPs. Any repeatable task in your life deserves to at least be broken down through thought and optimized for your convience.",1,1752063200.0,u_King_dom_cum,0,1.0,False

I don’t even know where to begin because my chest is literally tight just thinking about it. I’m 23, married to a guy who’s almost 29. Been with him for a few years now. We live near his family like same neighborhood, his parents, his sister, cousins, whatever. Which is fine… until it’s not. So his sister. I never had beef with her before. I even tried to be close. Brought her coffee, asked her to hang out, listened to her drama like a therapist. Thought we were cool. But little by little, she starts pulling this subtle crap that I thought I was just imagining. Like she’d make “jokes” in front of the family “Oh, she’s probably tired, you know she doesn’t do much all day anyway.” Or “She’s not really the type to keep things organized, right?” At first I laughed it off. I didn’t want to start anything. But then it got constant. Every family lunch. Every visit. Always something. Even my husband started going quiet whenever she opened her mouth. Like he didn’t want to make it worse. It wasn’t even just the jokes. She started painting this whole narrative to their mom, their aunts, everyone like I’m lazy, I don’t clean, 

I don’t cook, I just “hang around the house.” Mind you, I work from home. I manage a small online business and keep the apartment clean and tidy. I do his laundry. I cook dinner every single damn night unless I’m sick or literally drowning in work. You know what broke me? We were at a family gathering his cousin’s birthday. I brought this big tray of baked mac I spent hours making. Everyone was eating it. Then I hear her talking to their cousin’s wife, saying,  “Yeah, I had to show her how to boil pasta when she moved in. She didn’t even know how to cut onions. She’s trying though.” Laughing like she’s so proud of me. Like she raised me or something. Are you kidding me?? 

I snapped. I pulled her aside and told her, plain and simple “Stop making me look like an idiot in front of your whole family. If you’ve got something to say, say it to me. But don’t act like I’m this helpless little girl who doesn’t lift a finger.” She rolled her eyes and said I was “being sensitive” and that she was just “teasing.” Then she stormed off and told their mom I “attacked” her and made her feel unsafe. WHAT?? All I did was confront her privately. Now the whole family is acting weird. My husband says I could have said it differently. That I shouldn’t have done it at a party. But when else? I’ve been silent for MONTHS. Letting her drag my name to the ground like I’m some kind of freeloader. And now I’m the problem? So yeah… I don’t even know anymore. I really tried to keep the peace. I held my tongue for way too long. I supported my husband and stayed respectful to his family. But I just… broke. Was I wrong to finally call her out?

He slipped back into the house as silently as he had left, the ghost returning to his haunt. The scent of cooking rice and simmering vegetables filled the air, a humble, welcoming aroma that felt more grounding than the solid earth beneath his feet.

Dinner was an exercise in carefully controlled absurdity. They sat at the small kitchen table, a fragile trinity of survivors trying to pretend they were a normal family. His mother, Emi, fluttered around him, her relief a palpable, nervous energy. She kept piling his bowl with food, as if she could physically replace the years he had lost with extra helpings of stewed daikon. Yui sat opposite him, her initial awe having been replaced by a sharp, analytical curiosity. Her eyes, the eyes of a fellow Returner, missed nothing. She watched the way he held his chopsticks, the unnatural stillness of his posture, the way his gaze would occasionally drift, seeing things that weren't there.

The atmosphere was thick with unspoken questions, a dense fog of all the things they couldn't bring themselves to ask. Where were you? What did you see? How much of our Kenji is even left in there?

He knew he couldn't tell them the truth. The truth was a weapon of mass destruction. Revealing that a Level 786 entity was living in their humble apartment would be like painting a giant, glowing target on their front door. It wouldn't just attract the attention of parasites like the Iron Fangs; it would bring down the full, crushing weight of organizations like Aegis. They would dissect him, worship him, or try to enslave him. His family would become hostages, leverage. His peace would be shattered before it even began.

So, he did what any good strategist would do. He crafted a lie. A calculated, reasonable, and deeply, hilariously false lie.

""I have to tell you,"" he began, his voice a low, steady rumble that commanded their attention. He looked at his bowl, as if gathering the courage to confess a great and terrible ordeal. ""I… I lasted for a long time. I was careful. I grinded slowly, methodically. But… I finally died on Floor 48.""

He let the number hang in the air, a carefully chosen piece of bait.

His mother gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Floor 48! Oh, Kenji…""

Yui’s eyes widened, a flash of genuine respect in them. ""Floor 48? Seriously? That's… incredible. The highest anyone from our neighbourhood got was Floor 15. You must be… what level are you?""

Kenji raised his head, putting on a mask of weary pride, a look he had seen on countless lesser warriors in the Spire. ""Level 52,"" he said, the number tasting like ash and comedy in his mouth.

Level 52. It was a respectable number. Strong enough to be a formidable presence in a backwater city like this. Strong enough to easily handle scum like the Iron Fangs. But it was not so high as to be a legend. Level 52 wouldn't attract the attention of the regional overlords at Aegis. It was a number that promised safety, not glory. It was the perfect lie.

His mother started weeping with relief. ""Oh, my boy. So strong. But it's over now. You're home. You're safe.""

But Yui, his dear, sharp-witted sister, was already doing the math. Her brow furrowed. ""Wait a minute,"" she said, her suspicion a tangible thing. ""Floor 48. Level 52. But… you were gone for a full year. That's almost three hundred years inside the Spire.""

She leaned forward, her chopsticks pointing at him like an accusing finger. ""Three hundred years to reach Floor 48? That's… insanely slow. That's less than one floor every six years. What were you doing? Taking naps?

Kenji maintained his composure, but internally, the long-dormant part of him that appreciated irony was screaming with laughter. She was accusing him, the most efficient and ruthless grinder in the history of the Spire, of being a slacker. It was magnificent.

He had prepared for this. He let out a long, weary sigh, as if recalling a great and tedious hardship. ""You have to understand, Yui. The upper floors are different. The experience gain… it drops off a cliff. And the monsters… they become puzzles. Not just brute force."" He was spewing absolute nonsense, but it sounded plausible. ""I spent, I think, almost twenty years on Floor 34 alone. It was a floor of sentient musical golems. You couldn't damage them with force. You had to learn their symphonies and play them back on stone chimes to pacify them. It was a nightmare of trial and error.""

He was rather proud of that one. It was so specific, so mind-numbingly boring, that it had to be true.

Yui looked skeptical. ""Musical golems? That sounds… lame.""

""It was,"" Kenji confirmed with a grim nod. ""Incredibly lame. And very, very time-consuming. I wasn't blessed with a fast, damage-oriented build like a Berserker. I chose a… a 'Warden' path. High defense, high patience. Slow and steady.""

He was calling himself a tank. The irony was now so thick he felt he could have cleaved it in two with \[Last Word\]. He, the man who had perfected the art of fighting on the brink of death, whose entire philosophy was built on overwhelming, suicidal offense, was claiming to be a patient, defensive wall.

His sister was still suspicious. ""But still… three hundred years. Didn't you get lonely? How did you not go crazy?""

This question was closer to the mark. The lie faltered for a moment, and a flicker of the true, crushing emptiness of the Spire crossed his face. ""I… almost did,"" he said, the words heavy with a truth he couldn't fake. ""I focused on the goal. Getting back here. To you. To Mom.""

That, at least, was real. The sincerity of it seemed to placate her, though he could see the gears were still turning in her head. She would remain suspicious. He would have to be careful.

He turned his attention back to the food. He picked up a piece of stewed daikon. The texture was soft, the flavor subtle and deeply comforting. It was a simple, mundane act—eating dinner with his family. But for him, it was more difficult, more mentally taxing, than any boss battle. He had to constantly monitor his posture, his expressions, the tone of his voice. He had to maintain the elaborate fiction of being 'Kenji Tanaka, Level 52 Warden,' a respectable but ultimately unremarkable Returner. He had to pretend to be a stranger to himself.

He chewed the daikon slowly, the taste of home a stark contrast to the bitter taste of the lie in his mouth. He looked across the table at his mother's tear-streaked, happy face, and at his sister's sharp, suspicious eyes. He felt a sense of purpose solidify within him. This deception, this elaborate theater, was his new form of combat. This peace, this fragile, beautiful moment at a dinner table, was the prize. And he would defend it with all the power he was pretending not to have.

After the psychological tightrope walk of dinner, Kenji retreated to the sanctuary of his room. The house was quiet, filled with the soft, breathing sounds of a family at peace. It was a peace he had purchased with his soul, and he was now its sole, sleepless guardian. To ground himself, to reconnect with the fossilized remains of the boy he once was, he pulled a dusty cardboard box from the back of his closet. It was a time capsule, filled with the detritus of a forgotten life: old manga, concert ticket stubs, a high school report card he was vaguely proud of.

And then he saw it.

It was a faded photograph, its colors washed out by time. In it, two grinning idiots in high school uniforms stood with their arms slung over each other’s shoulders, flashing peace signs at the camera. One was him, Kenji, with a terrible, spiky haircut and a face unburdened by anything heavier than an upcoming exam. The other was Haruki Ito, his best and only friend, a lanky boy with glasses perpetually sliding down his nose and a smirk that always suggested he knew a cheat code for reality.

A pang hit him. It wasn't a sharp pain, not a wave of grief. It was a dull, hollow echo, like feeling a phantom limb twitch. It was the memory of an emotion, a data point labeled ‘friendship’ that he no longer had the hardware to properly process. It was… interesting. He studied the sensation with the same detached curiosity he’d once used to study a monster’s attack pattern.

Later, as Yui passed his open door, he held up the photo. ""Haruki Ito. Is he…""

Yui glanced at the picture, then at him. ""Haruki? Oh yeah, the tech nerd. He's still around. Total gremlin mode. He runs that 24/7 electronics repair shop downtown, the 'Digital Lazarus'. Figures he’d find a way to thrive in the apocalypse by fixing people's broken junk. The guy could probably resurrect a toaster that fell into a bathtub.""

Driven by an impulse he didn't fully comprehend—a desire to gather more data on this phantom feeling—Kenji decided he had to see him. It was another piece of his old life he needed to catalogue and assess.

He donned his hoodie, activated his cloak’s silent magic, and slipped out into the night. The city after dark was a different beast. The fear was more potent, the shadows deeper. But he moved through it all like a ghost, his path leading him downtown to a street flickering with the inconsistent glow of neon signs and jury-rigged floodlights.

He found the shop easily. ""Digital Lazarus"" was written in glowing blue LED strips above a storefront crammed with a chaotic collection of technology from every era of the last thirty years. It was less a shop and more a chaotic cathedral of broken things, exuding the holy scent of ozone, burnt capacitors, and industrial-strength coffee. Through the cluttered window, he could see a lone figure hunched over a workbench, the tiny blue flame of a soldering iron his only companion.

Kenji stepped inside. A small bell above the door failed to jingle, its clapper long since broken. The figure didn't look up. He was intensely focused on the guts of some complex-looking device, his hands moving with a surgeon’s precision. He was thinner than Kenji remembered, his face illuminated by the glow of a magnifying lamp. A constant, caffeine-fueled tremor ran through his fingers, a tremor that steadied into perfect stillness the moment the soldering iron touched a circuit board. His eyes had the weary, hollowed-out look of a man who had seen too many blue screens of death, both literal and metaphorical.

Kenji stood there for a full minute, a silent god in a temple of broken gadgets, completely unnoticed. His \[Spire Hermit\] trait was, he decided, occasionally inconvenient for social calls. He had to consciously try to be seen.

He cleared his throat.

The sound was soft, but in the focused quiet of the shop, it was like a gunshot. Haruki flinched violently, dropping his soldering iron into its stand. He spun around on his stool, his eyes wide with alarm, ready to activate a skill or grab a weapon.

""Sorry, we're closed to—"" he started, his voice sharp. Then his eyes focused on the tall, hooded figure standing in the shadows. He squinted. ""Can I help you?""

Kenji pulled back his hood.

The effect was instantaneous and deeply satisfying. Haruki’s face cycled through a rolodex of emotions: confusion, vague recognition, utter disbelief, and finally, slack-jawed shock, as if he were looking at a ghost who had just tried to pay for a pack of gum with a coupon from the afterlife.

""Kenji…?"" he whispered, his voice cracking. ""No way. No. You’re… you’re a statistic. You were on the list of the Vanished.""

Kenji offered a small, awkward shrug. It was a gesture he hadn’t used in centuries, and it felt alien on his shoulders. ""I got back.""

Haruki stared at him, his tech-savvy brain trying and failing to process this impossible input. ""Got back? Got back? From where? The great beyond? The eternal server reset? Did you bring a souvenir? An autograph from Buddha?"" He ran a hand through his messy hair, his mind clearly blue-screening.

""Something like that,"" Kenji said, his deadpan delivery flawless.

The initial shock finally gave way to a flood of frantic energy. Haruki leaped off his stool and rushed forward, stopping just short of Kenji. ""Man, where have you been?! We thought you were dead! Everyone thought you were dead! Did you Participate?""

Kenji nodded.

""Holy crap,"" Haruki breathed, his eyes scanning Kenji up and down. He wasn't like Yui; he couldn't sense the suffocating power Kenji was hiding. He just saw his old friend, bigger and… quieter. ""So you're a Returner? What level did you hit? I heard stories, man, people coming back at Level 10, Level 20 even. They're practically nobles now.""

Here it was. The moment to deploy the lie again. ""Level 52,"" Kenji said, the number now feeling comfortably fraudulent on his tongue. ""Warden class.""

Haruki’s jaw dropped for a second time. ""Level 52?! Fifty-two?! Holy crap, Kenji! You’re an elite! A top-ranker! I… I died on Floor 1 to a goblin that ambushed me while I was trying to figure out if I could hack the status window. Came back a Level 1 'Tinkerer'. My only skill is literally just identifying the components of broken items. so basically im the same as a unawakener"" He said it with a strange mix of self-deprecation and pride.

Kenji felt a flicker of what he assumed was pride, though it was directed more at the quality of his deception than the fabricated achievement itself. Internally, he compared this social interaction to his past experiences. This was, in its own way, more complex than baiting a Chronos Watcher. The attack patterns were far more erratic.

""You look different,"" Haruki said, circling him like he was a rare piece of alien technology. ""Bigger. You finally hit that growth spurt, huh? Only took you disappearing from reality for a year.""

Then, overwhelmed by an emotion Kenji could only classify as 'unpredictable human bonding ritual,' Haruki lunged forward and threw his arms around him in a hug.

Kenji's entire being went on high alert. His muscles, trained to equate any form of contact with a lethal attack, seized up. A dozen counter-attacks flashed through his mind: a simple elbow strike to the spine, a leg sweep, a grip that could turn Haruki’s shoulder to powder. He had to consciously, with immense effort, suppress every single one of those instincts. He had parried blows that could shatter mountains with less mental focus than was required for this simple, friendly embrace. He awkwardly patted his friend on the back, carefully calibrating the force so as not to collapse his ribcage.

""It's good to have you back, man,"" Haruki said, his voice muffled against Kenji’s hoodie. ""It's really good.""

He pulled away, wiping at his eyes. ""We have to catch up. For real. You have a phone?""

Kenji shook his head.

""Of course you don't."" Haruki grinned, back in his element. He scurried behind his counter and returned with a sleek, black smartphone. It was a refurbished model, but it looked pristine. ""Here. My own custom OS. Encrypted, ghosted signal, military-grade firewall. Can't be too careful these days. Consider it a 'welcome back to the post-apocalyptic hellscape' gift.""

Kenji took the Phone, turning it over in his hand. It was a sleek, black rectangle of glass and metal, impossibly thin and light. The logo on the back was a familiar one: ‘Somsong’. He vaguely remembered seeing advertisements for the new Somsong Galaxy S25 before The Calling. His own phone, a relic now gathering dust in his room, had been the S24. The idea that in a world of Dungeon Breaks and monster-infested cities, a megacorporation like Somsong was still churning out yearly product cycles was a testament to the stubborn, almost ludicrous resilience of human capitalism.

""Telecommunications still work Like i knew that the TV is still a thing but... ?"" Kenji asked, his voice flat.

Haruki scoffed, already tapping away at a tablet to register Kenji's new device. ""Work? Buddy, they're more important than ever. The major trunk lines are some of the most heavily fortified pieces of infrastructure on the planet. Guilds live and die on communication. How else are they going to coordinate a defense against a horde of fifty thousand Armored Orcs? Or, more importantly, post selfies with their new S-rank sword? Priorities, my man, priorities.""

Haruki finished his frantic tapping with a flourish. ""Done. You're on the grid. Encrypted, untraceable, and with a pre-installed ad-blocker that could stop a divine revelation. You're welcome."" He threw his tablet onto a pile of circuit boards and wiped his hands on his pants, a wide, manic grin splitting his face. ""Now. This,"" he gestured vaguely at the chaotic shop, ""is a tragedy. A Level 52 elite hiding in his room? Unacceptable. We are going out. We need to properly catch up. My treat. As a welcome-home present and also as a tax for being a whole-ass hero without telling me.""

Before Kenji could protest—a process he hadn't even begun to formulate—Haruki was grabbing a jacket and herding him out the door. The idea of 'going out' was as alien to Kenji as the concept of 'joy'. His social interactions for the last three centuries had consisted entirely of being stabbed, clawed, or incinerated. This was new territory.

They ended up in a place that could only be described as creatively dingy. It was an underground bar called ""The Last Respawn,"" a name both grim and oddly hopeful. The entrance was a narrow, graffiti-covered staircase that led down into a basement smelling of stale beer, damp concrete, and desperation. It was a place where both low-level Returners and the Unawakened who were brave or foolish enough could mingle. The lighting was low, the music was a thumping, bass-heavy dirge, and the furniture looked like it had been salvaged from a bombed-out IKEA. It was perfect.

They found a booth in a dark corner, the pleather cracked and peeling. A waitress with a bored expression and a low-level \[Minor Haste\] skill took their order with terrifying efficiency.

""Two beers,"" Haruki ordered. ""The cheapest you've got. And a bowl of whatever's fried.""

Beer. Kenji had a vague, academic memory of it. A carbonated, alcoholic beverage made from fermented grains. He’d seen people drink it in movies a lifetime ago.

The beers arrived, two sweating glasses of amber liquid. Haruki raised his glass. ""To Kenji Tanaka. The man, the myth, the Level 52 legend who ghosted the entire planet for a year. May your triumphant return be slightly less confusing than your departure.""

Kenji stared at his glass. He knew, with absolute certainty, that his body could process poison from a Ancient Demigod Viper of the 500th Floor without even registering it. His Vitality stat of 1910 meant that a substance like ethanol would be neutralized by his liver before it could even contemplate reaching his brain. It would be like trying to get a mountain drunk by spitting on it.

But for the first time in a very long time, he wanted to feel… normal. He wanted to feel something other than the cold, detached vigilance of the warrior or the hollow echo of old grief. With a flicker of will, a feat of control far more complex than any physical strike, he reached into the core of his being, into the passive System functions that governed his body, and turned them down. He suppressed the automatic detoxification, the cellular regeneration, the mythic-tier poison resistance. He made himself, for a moment, vulnerable.

He raised his glass and clinked it against Haruki's. Then he took a sip.

The taste was bitter, sharp, and surprisingly unpleasant. He then did as he saw Haruki do and took a long drink. The cold liquid slid down his throat. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the alcohol, free from the tyrannical rule of his VIT stat, hit his bloodstream like a freight train hitting a kitten.

The world tilted slightly. The edges of his vision went soft. The pounding bass of the music seemed to seep into his bones. A strange, warm buzzing started in his chest and spread outwards.

""Whoa,"" he said, the single word feeling heavy and profound.

Haruki cackled. ""That's the stuff! See? The world might have ended, but at least we still have cheap beer.""

And for the first time since he was nineteen years old, Kenji felt a spark of his old self. Haruki, fueled by alcohol and manic energy, launched into a long, rambling monologue about the past year. He told stories of the Cataclysm, of the sheer panic and absurdity of seeing goblins marching down Main Street. He recounted his own pathetic death in the Spire, a tale of hubris and poor situational awareness that he’d polished into a gem of self-deprecating comedy.

""So there I am, right?"" Haruki said, gesturing wildly with a half-eaten fried mystery-ball. ""I've got the status window open, and I'm thinking, 'This is just code. It’s a UI overlay. I bet I can find a command injection vulnerability.' I'm literally trying to SQL-inject the damn System while a goblin, a tiny little green dude, sneaks up behind me and shanks me with what I can only describe as a pointy rock on a stick. I died trying to hack God. Came back with a splitting headache and this useless \[Tinkerer\] skill. Best I can do is well...repaire computer stuff.""

Kenji laughed. It was a real laugh. A rusty, unfamiliar sound that startled him as much as it did Haruki. The sound was rough, but the feeling behind it, the genuine amusement, was a revelation.

The more they drank, the more the centuries of ice encasing Kenji's soul began to crack. He found himself talking. At first, it was just short answers. Then, full sentences. He kept to his lie, embellishing the story of the musical golems, inventing a new floor full of riddling sphinxes that only spoke in haikus.

""It took... five years,"" Kenji slurred, finding the simple act of forming words to be a fascinating new challenge. ""Five years on Floor... Forty. The floor boss was a... a librarian. A very, very strict librarian. You had to... organize all his books. By the Dewey Decimal System. But he kept... moving them.""

Haruki, now several beers deep himself, nodded sagely. ""That's rough, buddy. Bureaucracy. The true final boss.""

The hours bled together. The dingy bar became a warm, fuzzy haven. The weight of his secrets, the burden of his impossible power, felt lighter. He was no longer the Berserker Lord, the King of Ruin. He was just Kenji, a guy having a beer with his best friend. It was the most profound illusion he had ever experienced.

Eventually, the bartender kicked them out, citing something about ""closing time"" and ""you two being a public hazard."" They stumbled out into the cool night air, the streetlights leaving blurry trails in their vision. The world felt soft and wobbly.

""We should... go to the park,"" Haruki declared. ""The one with the swings. It's a place of... contemplation.""

They staggered their way to a small, deserted city park. The old metal swing set was still there, creaking softly in the breeze. The place was empty, a pocket of silence in the sleeping city. They collapsed onto a park bench, the cold wood a welcome shock.

They sat in a comfortable, drunken silence for a long time, staring up at the star-dusted sky. The real sky. Not a simulation on a ceiling hundreds of floors up.

""You know,"" Kenji said, his voice a low, serious murmur. ""The stars... they don't scream here.""

Haruki looked at him, his brow furrowed. ""Scream? Dude, what? Stars don't scream.""

A floodgate opened in Kenji’s mind. The alcohol, the friendship, the sudden, overwhelming safety—it was a combination that his carefully constructed mental defenses were not designed to handle. His inhibitions, fortified over centuries of solitude, crumbled into dust. The weight of his secret became too much to bear.

""They do,"" Kenji insisted, his words slurring together. ""On the upper floors. After Floor 500, the sky... it's alive. And it's in pain. It's all just... dying stars and black holes. And they scream. A sound that... gets in your teeth.""

Haruki blinked slowly. ""O...kay, man. You had a weird trip.""

""It wasn't a trip,"" Kenji said, his voice cracking with an emotion so old it had no name. The loneliness, the trauma, the sheer, crushing scale of his experience began to pour out of him, a torrent of truth that he was powerless to stop.

""It wasn't Floor 48, Haruki. That was a lie. I don't know why I said that. So stupid."" He laughed, a wet, broken sound. ""I never died. Not until the end. I just… kept climbing.""

""Climbing what, dude? The corporate ladder?""

""The Spire,"" Kenji whispered, his eyes unfocused, seeing a different sky. ""It doesn't end. I cleared Floor 100. I killed the dragon. And it just... kept going. Two hundred. Three hundred. It never stops.""

He looked at his hands, seeing not his own skin, but the phantom image of his Ashen King's gauntlets. ""Two hundred and ninety-five years, Haruki. I was in there for almost three centuries. Alone. The whole time.""

Haruki stared at him, his drunken brain attempting to parse the information and failing spectacularly. ""Three hundred years? That's... that's a lot of years, Kenji.""

""I hit Level 786,"" Kenji continued, the words tumbling out faster now, a confession to a sleeping priest. ""I have a mythic sword called \[Last Word\]. My armor is made from the bones of an Ashen King. I have enough gold to buy the moon. And all I did was kill. For centuries. There was no one to talk to. The silence… it gets so loud, Haruki. After the first hundred years, you forget what your own voice sounds like.""

Tears began to stream down his face, hot and real. The Berserker Lord, the Unkillable, the King of Ruin, was crying on a park bench next to his blacked-out friend. ""I just wanted it to stop. So I let them kill me. On Floor 632. I just stood there and let them... I wanted to die. I prayed for it. But it sent me back here. And everyone thinks the strongest guy is Level 122? He's a baby. A toddler. I could break this whole planet with a single skill and I... I just... I...""

His words dissolved into a choked sob. The monumental effort of existence, of holding up the weight of his own history, finally overwhelmed him. His body slumped sideways, his head coming to rest on Haruki's shoulder. He passed out mid-sentence, his final confession lost to the night.

Haruki sat there, motionless, for another ten minutes. His brain, which had valiantly attempted to follow Kenji's cosmic horror story, finally threw in the towel and shut down completely. He slumped over, his head coming to rest on top of Kenji's, and began to snore softly.",1,1752062390.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1lvgu6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdaustralia/comments/1lvgu6g/adhd_depression_and_my_pathway_out/,"ADHD, Depression and my pathway out.","Notes: 

This was my pathway from treatment resistant clinical depression and unmanageable ADHD to my current state.

I cannot stress this enough. 

Its not medical advice, a diagnosis or anything of the like. It was seat of the pants experimentation fuelled by pure desperation at the time. 

I hope something here helps someone. Its the only reason im posting it. 

Here goes. 

In my early thirties, I spent about 3.5 years in the grip of severe depression. It wasn’t just emotional darkness; it was deeply physical. Chronic pain wracked my body. Mood swings made daily life unpredictable. Apathy dominated everything. I tried antidepressants, ADHD medications, therapy sessions, and countless visits to GPs and psychologists. Nothing seemed to cut through the fog.

To cope, I leaned on cannabis. It dulled the emotional edge just enough to get me moving. But it was a temporary crutch. Meanwhile, I craved sugar constantly, lived on iced coffee and nicotine, and watched my weight drop to 55kg (I’m 170cm tall and now 75kg). I was light-sensitive to the point where sunny days felt physically painful. Panic attacks hit hard and resulted in several hospitalisations. Suicidal thoughts weren’t daily, but they hovered in the background like a black fog, and I often felt like (and expressed) that my partner and son would be better off without someone not so damn broken.

Then, something odd happened.

After one more doctor told me they were out of ideas, I was on the verge of giving up. Stopped what little self-care I had maintained and consequently developed a skin condition on my face. I was prescribed cephalexin, a common antibiotic. Within days, I experienced what felt like a manic episode: energy, clarity, and even happiness. It was the first time in years I felt remotely okay. I could focus to the point of forgetting to eat or sleep. Jittery, nauseous and just... shit. Elated constantly I guess? 
(No history of manic episodes, BPD or the like before or since)

I was still on SSRIs and dexamphetamine at the time, so I suspected something like serotonin syndrome and quickly stopped both meds. The intense stimulation faded over a couple of days but something had changed. The mental clarity had partially remained. The fog felt... lighter. 

That clarity triggered an obsessive question: Why did a basic antibiotic temporarily flip me onto the opposite end of depression?

I dove into research and landed on gut dysbiosis as a likely culprit. I wanted to go to the root cause of each symptom and the nutrient cofactors related to them. 
Bacterial or fungal overgrowth can impair nutrient absorption and trigger systemic inflammation, affecting brain function. To test this, I took a supplement aimed at reducing yeast and bad bacteria (Blackmores Candida Relief) In conjunction with Bioceuticals Floractiv 500, probiotic. By day two, my body ached all over—but my brain felt great. This reaction suggested that clearing out gut pathogens might be at the root of my symptoms.

Next, I investigated methylation and took a DNA test to check for MTHFR gene mutations. It seemed like pseudo-science at the time but I figured why the hell not.
Sure enough, I had a variant that reduces the body's ability to convert folate and B12 into their usable forms. I figured this might explain why my blood tests always came back normal for vitamin levels despite feeling completely depleted. I started supplementing with pre methylated B vitamins (Bioceuticals Methyl Max), and it felt like a light came on. I began to define a baseline for what ""normal"" should actually feel like.

Still, I had rough patches and some really bad days. So I turned my focus to the ADHD symptoms and started a food diary. 
That’s when another pattern emerged: every time I ate gluten-heavy meals like pasta, I felt awful the next day. Fatigue, mood swings, physical pain in my lower back and joints... 
Dairy also had an effect like someone holding my brain hostage in a pillow. 
My sister has coeliac disease, so I figured I'd cut out gluten alone at first.

 The results were pretty close to instant: improved focus, reduced anxiety, better mood, and no more body aches which in turn reduced and finally eliminated my need for cannabis in short order. From close to an oz a week to next to nothing. Every time I reintroduced gluten, the symptoms returned in full force.The connection, to me was clear.
Cutting out dairy brought additional clarity to thought and the ability to focus more readily. 
Even my son, who shows signs of ADHD, improved dramatically after switching to a gluten-free diet. His focus and behaviour changed within days.

For two years, I stuck to a protocol of methylated B vitamins, zinc, vitamin C, and omega-3s. I kept my diet gluten-free/ dairy minimal and stayed consistent. My job performance improved. I became more empathetic and mentally sharp. My short-term memory got better. It was slow progress but it was progress.

Finally, I reintroduced the ADHD medication (Vyvanse this time). I did this to see if I could further improve my capability to learn, focus and be productive. 
This time, with a healthier gut, proper methylation, and fewer inflammatory triggers, the medication actually worked. It helped me stay organised, absorb information, and manage my day without crashing.

Key Takeaways from My Experience:

Gut health directly affects mental health. Microbial overgrowth can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause inflammation. Especially when looking after your health takes a back seat.

Methylation issues (like MTHFR gene mutations) can block your ability to activate critical vitamins like folate and B12.

Food sensitivities may impact mood, cognitive function, and physical pain, especially in those with ADHD or autoimmune predispositions.

Once foundational deficiencies and inflammation were addressed, medications like Vyvanse began working as intended.

Tracking and experimentation (like food diaries, gene testing, symptom logs) can help connect cause and effect more clearly.



---

If you’re stuck in a similar loop, this isn’t advice or a prescription. But maybe it gives you a framework to start looking at the whole system—not just the symptoms.

You’re not broken. You might just be out of sync.

I built it using AI agents to speed up development — literally took me longer to pick a domain name than to launch version 1. It’s ugly, it’s simple, and it works.



The crazy part?

Without any serious marketing (just some random TikToks and word-of-mouth), 20 people have already paid for it. That blew my mind. Turns out, when you actually solve a real problem — like students not wanting to do homework — people are happy to throw money at it.



If you’re curious, bored, or just wanna roast my design choices, check it out here:

Happy to answer questions, share what worked, or just chat with anyone trying to build with AI too.

A thirty-year-old man's desire, raw and unfiltered.  
  
Annie Lane felt like her entire body had collapsed, drowned in waves of intense lust, barely able to breathe.  
  
""It's done. Clear my schedule for the next week. I'm taking time off. Book two tickets to the Maldives,"" Said Zane, standing at the edge of the bed, buttoning up his shirt with maddening leisure.  
  
Annie shifted her sore waist slightly, a hint of joy flashing in her eyes. ""Zane, are you taking me on a vacation?”  
  
Zane paused for a second, frowning slightly as he looked at her. ""I'm going with Zoe.”  
  
Annie's smile froze. She looked down awkwardly. ""Okay… Mr. Lewis.”  
  
Noticing her expression, Zane added, ""Annie, you're an orphan, and still young. I'll never marry you.”  
  
Annie looked up at him, her smile tinged with bitterness. ""I never expected you to… But now that Miss Carter is back and divorced, does that mean our little hidden relationship is over?”  
  
Zane's face darkened. He reached out, ruffled her hair, and placed a card on the nightstand. His voice softened. ""Be good. Buy yourself something nice.”  
  
""I don't want to be a mistress…""Annie stared at him stubbornly. She knew Zane and Zoe getting married was just a matter of time.  
  
""It's too soon to talk about that. We'll deal with it when I actually get married. Don't act up, whether it ends or not isn't up to you, “he said, impatience creeping into his tone. He glanced at her once more, then walked out.  
  
The sound of the door closing left a ringing in Annie's ears. Everything else faded to silence.  
  
She was an orphan. Back in her freshman year, her looks had attracted the jealousy of the rich heiress Mia Lewis, who beat her so badly she lost hearing in one ear, had her toe broken, and nearly went blind from cigarette burns...  
  
A video of the incident had gone viral, sparking public outrage.  
  
The school had no choice but to summon the families. The person who showed up on Mia's behalf was her older brother, Zane.  
  
Zane. CEO of the Lewis Group.  
  
Maybe it was to protect the Lewis family's image, or maybe it was pity, but Zane had stepped forward for Annie, who at the time was battered and bruised beyond recognition. The first thing he said to her was: ""Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you again.”  
  
It was pathetic, desperate, even, but Annie had fallen for him.  
  
Because in the loneliest, most love-starved chapter of her life, Zane had become everything she ever dreamed of in a man. Security. Shelter. Fantasy.  
  
She once thought he was her salvation. But now… it was clear. Zane never loved her. He just wouldn't let her go.  
  
Lewis Group Headquarters  
  
Zane was in a meeting, delegating tasks before his time off. Zoe Carter waited in his office.  
  
They were about to fly to the Maldives, for seven sweet days in paradise.  
  
Annie brought her a cup of coffee, pain slicing through her chest like a knife. ""Miss Carter, your coffee.”  
  
Zoe looked at her and smiled gracefully.  
  
Coming from a wealthy family, Zoe was Zane's childhood friend, a perfect match. Elegant, well-educated, poised. Just sitting there, her presence radiated confidence so blinding, it made Annie's eyes sting.  
  
Annie knew she had lost. She had never stood a chance.  
  
A prince doesn't fall in love with Cinderella. He just uses her to kill time.  
  
Setting down the coffee, Annie all but fled the office in embarrassment.  
  
She had nothing. No confidence. No family. No money. And the trauma from her past left invisible scars etched into every part of her.  
  
""Zane and Zoe are headed on their honeymoon, huh? I heard they've made it official. When they get back, they're going public. Both families have approved the marriage.”  
  
Gossip buzzed in the breakroom as coworkers chatted about the upcoming wedding.  
  
Annie was filling her cup when the boiling water scalded the back of her hand.  
  
The glass slipped from her fingers and shattered. Only then did the pain register. Flustered, she rushed to run cold water over the burn.  
  
Zane and Zoe were getting married.  
  
Which meant she and Zane… were done. Her internship at Lewis Group, done.  
  
""Annie, Mr. Lewis wants you to drive him and Miss Carter to the airport at eleven.”  
  
Someone called out the instruction.  
  
Annie gave a faint, bitter smile. Zane… was ruthless.  
  
She knew he was doing this on purpose. He had a full-time driver but chose her instead, just to remind her where she stood. To crush any unrealistic hopes she might still be holding on to.  
  
In the end, Zane and Mia weren't so different. Both were bullies, just in different ways.  
  
One broke her body. The other shattered her heart.  
  
Pulling out her phone, Annie hesitated for a long time before finally dialing a number she had once blocked.  
  
""Hello, Mr. Bennett. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you'd help me study in Italy. Does that offer still stand? “Her voice trembled slightly.  
  
Marriage. That might be the only way she could escape Ever ford. Escape Zane.  
  
""Are you sure? “The man's voice was low and calm on the other end. ""Meet me at Riverfront Estate at 7 p.m. on the 13th. We'll go over the details.”  
  
The 13th. Eight days left.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Hey, assistant."" Annie had just hung up when Zoe Carter called out to her gently.

1lvgp36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1lvgp36/my_lavaredo_120km_race_tale/,My Lavaredo 120km Race Tale,"The Lavaredo Queen Race is a 120km mountain Ultra Marathon with 5800m of vertical gain held in the Dolomites of Northern Italy. The 2025 edition was held on 27th June, starts at 11pm, and the 1700 runners have a maximum of 30 hours to finish.

**Part 1: The Night** (0km: Cortina - 42km: Misurina)

Race day. We'd made it. I’d tried to make it as relaxing a day as I possibly could. Me and my running friend and crew, Frank, headed into Cortina and did the bib pickup as early as we could, before returning to our lovely campsite in Alta Badia in time for lunch. Afterwards I tried to nap, but it didn’t work out. I was too wired, but I lay around and did my best to just stay calm and loose. I’d had a rough night’s sleep the evening before, normal for sleep before a race, but with the oncoming 11pm start, it was a bit of a concern.

When we got to the start line I found a quiet patch of grass to lay down on til I could hand over my dropbag, and I felt surprisingly chill. I found Frank, we drank coffee, I did some leg swings and resistance band warm-ups, it’s just a normal long run, I told myself. As the crowd of runners picked up I found a spot near the back of the pen that wasn’t too busy, I wanted to avoid as much of the pre-race hustle and bustle. So I just sat, breathed deeply, absorbed the energy around me and tried not to think too hard about the gargantuan nature of the task ahead.

Eventually, the clock approached 11pm and I stood up and joined the throng. As the hour arrive, the commentator’s encouraging words were lost within the first notes of ‘Ecstasy of Gold’ from the Good, the Bad and the Ugly - immediate goosebumps. But, exciting as it was, it would turn out to be more than a little anticlimactic— we at the back couldn’t move more than an inch for at least five minutes, and then awkwardly shuffled slowly forwards for another five. I’d heard so much about this race start being something of legend - was this really it? But eventually each of us made it to the front, squeezed through a narrow gate, passed under the arch, and it was on.

The grinding monotony of the last ten minutes was immediately forgotten as the crowd either side of me roared. All plans to ‘go out easy from the get go’ were discarded as I sprinted forwards, high-fiving what felt like every kid in Cortina. As I made it to the edge of the crowd I saw Frank filming, I gave him one last high-five, and then immediately slowed down to a jog as we reached the edge of town.

We eventually hit the first trails and started climbing out of town. It was busy in the first few k's, I felt a little pushed and dragged up some of the first steep climbs, but did my best to set my own pace and not have it dictated by anyone else. I could already hear a few people around me huffing and puffing in ways that seemed just totally reckless not even 30 minutes into a day long race. Thankfully it spread out quite a bit eventually, and the grades eased up, so I eventually found a nice flow and just followed the spot of my headlamp. While I wasn't paying too much attention to it, I noticed I was passing people already without much effort at all, especially on those 10-15% grades that I feel I excel at. 

We reached our first downhill, which started easy but got much more windy and technical down steep switchbacks as it went. I was in a train of people for a while, nobody really able to pass one another, or not really seeing the need given how many more people were ahead. It was silent and lovely in the woods. Eventually we hit the first aid station at Ospitale, which was fine, but only a bit frustrating due to the fact that they didn't have any taps, only bottled water that you had to queue for. So early in the race it felt a bit shit and concerning to have to paused for a number of minutes for what should be a 30 second job. Either way I just accepted it, dumped my trash and kept moving into the night. 

The next section was pretty good, more of a steep climb here and there, and I ended up again in a bit of a stream of runners moving around the same pace. I hadn't spoken to (or been spoken to by) anyone by that point, so I just asked some random dude how he was doing. He was a German banker from Frankfurt, and admittedly, not very interesting/my kinda person, but at 2-3am beggars can't be choosers, and it helped pass the time a little. It was interesting to see that he always pushed more on the steeper climbs, but when I suggested moving a little more deliberately on the lesser grades, he was having none of it. 

Eventually I stopped to refill water at a stream and he headed off, saying I'll catch him up. Then came the first stomach issue of the day, I don't know if it was bending down and putting pressure on my stomach, but when I stood up from filling the bottle I suddenly felt like I needed to puke. It was this kind of gag/retching feeling, more up in my esophagus than down in my stomach. I did bring something up, but not much, and felt infinitely better after, so to my relief I just kept on plodding up the trail. 

After the next aid station I was dog tired, so it’s all a little blurry. I remember I caught up with the German guy at some point, and eventually dawn started to break, which was a nice, hopeful omen. We ran a section together, which all of a sudden opened up into THAT GRADE and I just slipped past him and never saw him again. The next section continued to be really within my comfort zone, long, flowy, undulating trails where I could either power hike up or jog down. I began to see that everyone around me was already suffering pretty badly. People off to the side of the trail, kinda death marching up some of those hills, some puking going on. And while my head was tired from lack of sleep (this was the most sleepy I'd feel in the race), I was moving well and just kept putting one foot in front. 

The few kilometers before the aid station at Misurina were a tad frustrating, as I was caught behind this couple on a very tight single trail in the woods that I felt I could have moved 5-10% faster on, which all adds up over a few km's. I also had a ton of people behind me, which is awkward and a little stressful being the first person behind a slow bunch that seem absolutely disinterested in letting people pass. For me, if someone's been on my tail for more than 5 mins, I just let them go ahead of me, as I don’t enjoy being tailgated. But in the end, maybe it was good to be held back a bit, as my heart rate had started to get exceptionally low (I was in the 110’s), and the perceived effort felt like a 2/10 or something, really easy stuff. 

As soon as the trail opened up coming into Misurina, I bombed past them (it felt somehow great to show everyone who was still feeling good and could run at this point), and headed into the closing part of the first 1/3 of the race feeling good. I grabbed one or two things to nibble from the aid station, but mostly just needed water, downed a gel, and I wanted to try Red Bull to shake off the last of the night. That would end up being problematic however, as only had I finished rounding Lake Misurina that I brought up the Red Bull and maybe my last gel in a few big retches. I kept moving though, which I was relieved about , didn't panic, and again, thankfully, didn't feel any further issues after it was up and out of my system. Maybe it was the caffeine or carbonation, or maybe I'd overdone it on calories the last hours while I was moving slower, I don't know. But I just took some sips of tailwind, small mouthfuls of gel and kept going for the first major climb of the race, up to the Tre Cimi di Lavaredo. 

[Packed crowds at the start line at Lavaredo 120km](https://preview.redd.it/ztovzlj96ubf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c26b0302e6b6d0cce7eb8687b115e843368fdf0)

**Part 2:** The Morning (42km: Misurina - 67km: Cimabanche)

So, this climb was known to be tough. We were headed up to altitude, and I'm pretty sure that my body was missing some calories after that puking session. I was also low on gels, and had had to resort to purely Tailwind, which kinda sucked, but I was still very glad to have it. People moved slowly, it was very rocky terrain, grades of up to 30-40%, and the sun had already started to get pretty warm and blast us in the face. It woke me up though, which was nice, and the vistas and views were already absolutely incredible. It was also nice to be able to physically see the Rifugio ahead of us, mentally that allowed me to pace things right and take my time. 

At the top there were only drinks, which again was a bummer given my lack of gels and how far it would be to Cimabanche, but I refilled, thanked the amazing, cold volunteers, and started a small section of downhill feeling surprisingly chipper. It climbed some more, but again, the views were lovely and distracting. Pete (my coach back in the UK) and Frank were also awake at this point, had sent some really nice, encouraging messages when I left Misurina that I was fast out of that Aid Station, that I looked fresh in a selfie I sent them... it was nice after what had been a fairly isolating night with not many people to talk to. 

Then the downhill started, and ironically, my mood along with it. I think it was namely due to the fact that the 80km race joins up with ours at that point, and man, those people were in a goddamn hurry. These were, maybe not the race leaders, but front of the pack, and it was just a stressful, claustrophobic mess on technical, tight single trails, steep and rocky with sheer drops on one side, where you can't always simply pause and let people go. And the ones that did go, really went. I saw one guy make an insane overtake where the loose rocks at the side of the trail started to give in, and he nearly slipped down what would’ve been a few hundred meters. 

I'm sad to say that the sudden intense vibe did very much let it get to me, I'm easily overwhelmed by people who don't seem to be aware of others, and in this environment and point in the race it really sucked. I envisioned the rest of the day being like this, and just felt sad and annoyed. They came in little streams, sometimes had a gap, so I used some of those spaces to calm down a bit, remind myself that it’s a race, and tried to tap into some of that learning I did with solving emotional problems during long runs. I’ve got a technique during runs where, if something is bothering me, I envision physically picking it up and tossing it behind me on the trail. Not sure if ti worked, but, either way, I was determined not to let it ruin my race. 

It was getting, hot, hot, hot too, especially as I came down into the valley approaching Cimabanche. And apparently the stress from other runners wasn’t quite over:

Arriving into Cimabanche, it's a pretty flat/gradual climb, but it was warm as fuck and swarming with both racers, tourists, e-bikes (ugh) so I just power hiked it in as best I could. At one point I was passing through this group of 2-3 (I think) tourist hikers, who'd kindly left a little gap in the middle of them. I wasn't fast, but I was definitely faster than them, so through the gap I went. 

Right as I went through them, this group of three 80km runners barged through at the same time on my left. The front one loudly tutted at me, and gave my pole (which was absolutely by no means in anyone's way) a very deliberate kick. And I was fucking. livid. haha. I automatically responded 'Don't you fucking dare tut at me, bro, I don't have eyes in the back of my head, you can wait one second'. He either didn't hear, didn't care, or didn't speak English, so off he went ahead, aaaaand off I went chasing after him in a very aggressive power hike/slow jog. I never left Zone 2, but suddenly I was ALIVE and had some shit to say, at least to my own legs. While I hated being taken to that angry place, it was a wakeup call that this is a race, not all these people are my friends. But I had the realization 5 mins later (after I never caught up to him), right before hitting the aid station, that I wasn't going to carry it in there with me, and found a way to let go of it.

I was a little concerned by having only taken in liquids so far, and a lot of Tailwind in the preceding hours, but wasn't bonking by any stretch. I knew when I got into the aid station that I'd need a bit of a reset, dropbag, gels, maybe change of socks... I started thinking about it now rather than when I got in. I was also aware that I was a bit off my time goal, or the one I guesstimated anyway, of around 10:00-10:30 at the halfway point. In the end I think it was about 10:45 when I got in and saw Frank, so behind, but nothing major. 

When I ran in he was there to cheer me, filming to send something to my family back home. I gave him a quick hug, and we stuck note for note to the rehearsed plan of handing him my watch and phone to charge, and he explained to me where he'd be waiting with everything prepared once I was through the station with my dropbag. I grabbed it, refilled on water, think I grabbed soup again, and easily found him, textbook. 

I wasn't hurting too much, and again he told me I was looking great (and somehow I believed him). We both acknowledged that the very ambitious 20 hour goal was definitely off the table, but it didn't matter. 24 hours also seemed kind of unattainable at the time, but I wanted to leave that there as a carrot to keep me moving intentionally, especially out of rest stops. We changed my socks, lubed my feet and other key areas, put on more sunscreen, changed shirt, and refilled my pack with gels and tailwind, and I guess I was out of there in 10-15 minutes or so. Much longer than earlier stops, but I think it was necessary to have a bit of a reset there. Frank was able to pack everything up for me (what a fucking star he'd turn out to be), and I got sent on my way into the hot afternoon. 

[Staying relaxed on the last climb up to the Tre Cimi De Lavaredo](https://preview.redd.it/zht66f5c6ubf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3abbb3eb9c4c5281c9d6e93bc4a060263b8f2460)

**Part 3: The Climb** (*67km: Cimabanche - 97km: Col Gallina)*

Leaving Cimabanche, it was once again hot hot hot. From there we started with a deceptively hard climb, exacerbated by the heat and, again, the multiplied numbers of runners that were now around all the time. While we didn't say anything to one another, I felt at least a little bit of a bond with my fellow 120km runners. I also decided to try and see some positives, and gave myself an extra big metaphorical clap on the back when I passed an 80k runner with relative ease. In my head I was saying 'If I'm passing you, you have cause for concern.’I was being a bit of a competitive dick at this point, it has to be said. 

However, I was now definitely hitting something of a low. I remember having the thought, 'I'm not having a good time', albeit more in an emotional and social way. It was a lonely, lonely road. I’m very introverted, and personally love being alone and carving out solitary time in the mountains to be my way of connecting to me and nature, and I can very happily move for days on my own steam with nobody else around. But being so surrounded by people that didn't seem to even acknowledge one another's existence, no shared camaraderie or solidarity, it felt like city life. Busy and isolated, swarms of atoms all dancing round one another but never bonding. 

But, as I came into the next aid station, though a bit hot and bothered, I suddenly felt really good. I took some Naak drink that I hadn't tried yet, a lime flavour, and it just gave my whole tongue and being a big zap. I also got a text from Pete and Frank: 

**Pete**: Looks like you’re gaining a lot of places at every aid station! Great work man Keep grinding dizzle, you’re doing great 

**Frank**: Amazing work Michael! You just moved up 186 places between Cimabanche and this aid station! 

**Pete:** Textbook pacing dizzle!

And from that I just felt a huge boost. I hadn't realised I was moving that well, how many people I'd left behind at Cimabanche, and I was in and out of the most recent station in less than a minute. After a few km's I also found myself totally alone for 5 mins or so, which felt wonderful. No stress from behind, no one to maneuver around ahead. Given what I knew about what was about to come up, it felt wise not to overdo it, but I suddenly began to realise I was by no means feeling the worst in this race, I was not back at the farthest of backs of the race, but I was now in the top 1000 of runners and climbing in the ranks without really even forcing the issue. 

**Pete:** That's what it's all about. Keep eating, keep drinking, keep kicking ass 

Now. This climb. My fucking god. The sun was on us, it was relentless, no shade, no respite. Every single stream (and thank fuck there was a lot of them) I dunked my headband and cap and let them drip down my body for the next kilometer before doing it again. People were suffering with a capital S. Any small scrap of shade from a cactus and people were crowding into it just to get a brief break from being a bug under a magnifying glass. Again, thankfully I knew this climb, I've done it all before (albeit a lot cooler, there was even still snow here when I was here for the reccy in May), so while it was scary to know what was yet to come, at least it wouldn't be a god awful surprise. 

At the stream crossings I marched right through (lots of people were going to huge lengths to somehow go around or skip over it), and the blast of cold and wetness seemed to wake up my feet, though of course it also made them heavy for a while and risked some blisters, but none would come. While we're on my feet (literally and figuratively), they were gradually becoming the sore spot. The undersides of them, pads or whatever you call them, were tired and achey and sore as fuck. Not in a red raw way, just from having already taken, I guess, 90,000 steps or so, all in relatively minimal trail shoes (I run in the Salomon S-Lab Ultra 3 V2s, which aren’t known for their cushioning). It sucked, and it took a lot of the spring out of them, particularly on the downhills, but I remember acknowledging also that the rest of my legs still felt like, maybe not pure gold, but definitely bronze. No pain, no soreness in the quads of calves, they were just motoring along and would go on to never feel beat up. But we'll get to that. 

Once again nutrition was proving to be an issue. Gels were spent and I was understandably sick of Tailwind, but I knew without it I'd be dead in the water/sun, so kept on sipping it and providing a steady, albeit sickly, form of calories to my tired body. The last climb of that push was. hard.

Looking back now, I realise that this was the tipping, race defining point, 90km in (I'd only ever run 80km in my life before), the longest I'd ever been on my feet, the longest I've been awake in possibly years. I was at the well and looking down at it, realising, ok, I think this day is done feeling easy, this is where we're gonna have to dig deep. I haven't felt that way in so long. We just don't have to go there in training or in blissful long runs in the mountains. This is the test and challenge I came here to face, to see what and who I am when we get here. There's no hiding from it anymore, this is the hardest single physical thing I've ever done, and we're still moving. 

*We're at the top of the climb, we're sipping coke and chewing on some dry bread the beautiful mountain rescue had laid out for us. We're descending, slowly, on battered feet. We think we're heading down, but no, 200m of climb before you really go down and see a friendly face. The sun is still blasting but at least it’s on its way into its early evening wind down routine. Our tired hands scramble around our pack. BINGO. We find a stray gel that had burrowed its way down into a crevice and quickly devour it. We're dropping again, we know we're fucked, we're gonna need to rest at that aid station, it feels like we've been so, so slow, surely we must be majorly behind. Surely this is gonna end up being a 26-27 hour day. How are we possibly going to turn this around?*

I run into Col Gallina, again to Frank's massive smile. I shake my head, draw my fingers across my neck, and say 'it's been. so. hard.' and almost break down in tears. He tells me I'm moving incredibly well, that, again, I've climbed a lot of places, I almost think he's lying, it can't be the case, I'm dying here. He tells me to get what I need, that we'll take as long as it takes to get me back on the trail. 

I grab more Naak because that shit worked, maybe some more soup, find Frank and flop down on a towel in the fetal position. My whole body just exudes fatigue, I've never felt that tired in my life. I could lay on that towel for an eternity. But in the meantime, Frank is busying away, removing my shoes from my slowly reanimating corpse, re-lubing my feet for me, putting on fresh socks, applying sunscreen, just being a complete and total hero. He's also telling me that, according to the UTMB app, I have a finish line prediction of, I shit you not, a 22:30 finish. 23.5 hours. I'd somehow improved my time in the hardest section of any race I've ever done in my life. I can't fucking believe it. Before I know it I'm on my feet, I try and find somewhere in the AS to take a monstrous gel shit that's been burying its way through my colon for the last 10 hours, but no dice, it's too far back down the trail to bother, so I decide to deal with it later. 

I realise it's time to go again, to deal with, again, an impossibly steep climb, one I'm genuinely fearful about. But away I go. My legs seem to be moving okay, my feet don't seem to hurt as much anymore. Five minutes later and I'm puking my guts up mid power hike. Everything I'd eaten in the last hour is on the floor and all over my shirt. Fuck it. I sip at Naak, I take a small mouthful of gel, which is now all I can manage, but I know if I keep doing that, I definitely won't thrive, but I'll survive. I tell myself out loud 'You. have. to. keep. eating.'

[Struggling forwards](https://preview.redd.it/qxjnvmag6ubf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f21f613c41c0bcbd469506fb4d890d5819dbf8f)

**Part 4: Sunset** (97km: Col Gallina - 112km)

So we start this climb, me and, mostly, my 120km torture-mates. Silent as they are, I like them. You can spot us from behind, no need to see our bib colour. We're all singular in our purpose, and couldn't give a damn about the pace anymore, this is move or die, and the only way is forwards. 

At some point I offer a guy behind me to go ahead and pass, as I feel I'm really at my limit and like a snail. He barks something in Italian that seemed to say 'No. Keep going', so I do. My bowels ache with the effort of not straight up shitting my pants. I know there's a Rifugio at the top of this endless climb, and I plan on making the evacuation happen there, wherever I can, if it kills me. After an eternity I reach the top, they have a real, functioning toilet, and being in an actual building, under a roof, in a working lavatory with hand soap just feels like a former life. I'm so fucking grateful to have been able to do that, and I can suddenly, finally think. 

*Michael, you're at 100km. That is insane. You're feeling terrible but moving so well. Frank's right, this is not fucking over. You're gonna drop down into Passo Giau in the next hour and guess fucking what. That's the penultimate last aid station. You're in the last chapter, this is it, unless you stop eating there's actually no longer even a possibility you're not going to finish this shit. Get fucking going.* 

So I jogged downhill, feet caving that bit more with each and every step. People are slipping and sliding on the loose stones and scree, I used my poles in my sore and sunburnt hands to somehow try and stay on my own. Again, the sheer thought of putting another gel into my mouth already made me wanna puke. My tongue felt like a sock that had been dipped in maple syrup then coated in granulated sugar, it had had enough. 

But before I knew it, I could see Passo Giau looming in the distance, and I was already steadily jogging down the trail towards Frank, who again, laughed in that way he had the hours before, and buried me in a hug. I have a video of all these meetings, and side by side they paint such an accurate picture of my rise and demise. At this point, you can hear me croaking while putting on my sunglasses,  'I don't want you to see my eyes. Oh god.', but looking back at that video now, those legs were somehow still fucking going. While I want to be in and out in minutes, I know there's shit to do, and I unveil my strategy out loud in desolate but pragmatic tones. I can't eat. I have to eat. I tell Frank no more Tailwind, it's making me want to down sulfuric acid just to taste something different. Just water, plain water, beautiful Dolomites water, and I'll try and force gels down. I take some Coke, which helps somehow, not sure why, and I do what I should've done at Cimabanche (and Col Gallina) and brushed my motherfucking teeth. And oh god what a difference that made. I felt renewed in my whole eating department, fresh and clean and bright and able to eat anything (probably a major overstatement, but let’s be hopeful together for a moment). 

I say goodbye to Frank for the last time before the finish line. We both know I'm nearly there, this is it, and yet again, I'm fearful of what I know, that the climb ahead is absolutely brutal, perhaps the shortest but steepest single climb of the race. But I also knew, once you're up it, you're at the top of that very literal and metaphorical mountain, and you're going down to the finish line. 

So off I go, down onto a windy little single trail that was covered in snow and nearly impassable the last time I was here. As I go along, again, legs moving well, a group of 4-5 20-something-year old women approach from ahead of me. Now, most of the day, the lovely civilians had done everything they could to let us racers pass, and were unbelievably supportive and kind in their cheering and encouragement, and frankly I felt guilty for being there and ruining their nice, leisurely hikes. This group didn't seem like they were going to let me go, so I gestured for them to come first, albeit with a little bit of 'but please hurry' in my face/voice. They were really sweet, said thank you, wished me luck, and I smiled and tried to whisper thanks, but nothing came out. 

Just as the last one was passing me, this 40-50 year old man came flying through the entire group, before physically grabbing the last one by the shoulders and moving her out of his path. She was very surprised and confused. All to gain, what, 5 seconds? It was a pretty sheer drop off the edge of that trail, and one misstep from either would’ve broken both their necks. I found my voice, quickly apologised to her and yelled to him that he’s a fucking psychopath. Maybe two minutes later I caught up with him. He’d bent down on the side of the narrow path to tie his shoelace, and in doing so he left his hiking poles spread horizontally and directly across the entirety (and then some) of this tiny little trail that me and 5 other runners now needed to pass him on. Genuinely the dumbest asshole on this planet. In my rage I went full circle from my own pole kicking escapade earlier in the day, and smacked his poles out of the way with my own in order to pass him. I said out loud to anyone and no one that that guy 'is the absolute WORST', but nobody else seemed to notice or care. Sometimes I feel like only I see this shit, or maybe I’m the only one who cares. 

5 minutes after that, and apparently we’re still not done, the guy dangerously overtakes every single one of us, scrambling onto the sides of the trail to do so, bounding up this little but technical climb, which I knew immediately would come back to haunt him, given how insanely steep it was about to get. I make a point of remembering what he looks like, as I had a feeling I'd be seeing him again. Write that down. 

And up, up, up we went. As already stated, this is a fucking climb, around 250m in less than a kilometer, with the top genuinely being a hands and knees, smashing poles into the ground to lurch yourself upwards, gaining what felt like centimeters with every agonizing step moment. But, my fucking god, I made it. The wonderful race volunteers scanned my bib and sent me off on my way, and down we fucking went.

[The last big climb](https://preview.redd.it/6jbfepni6ubf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=967d355a0df3a68bfefcdf82cf49345302991569)

**Part 5: The Finish Line** (*112km - 123km: Cortina D'Ampezzo)*

Golden hour was over, we'd lived an entire life in a day, the sun had dipped beneath the sprawling mountains of the Dolomites and everything was quiet. I aimed my legs downwards. Parts of those trails are so random and carved in all sorts of lines and directions, but I've done this before and it was like the path of least resistance was already painted on the trail. I suddenly heard English being spoken somewhere behind me, an 80km runner was sending a voice note to somebody, recounting how 'the trail had been a lot more technical and rocky than he thought', and I was like... ya know what, you're the first guy I've agreed with in some time, and I can’t miss this opportunity.

I asked, 'Are you Bri'ish?' in my exhausted, lazy Northern accent, and he answers, ‘yes’. You could immediately hear the kind of joy and relief in his voice, as though we were both meeting a real life human for the first time in a vast, endless open world landscape after having only interacted with silent NPC's for days. We shared and shared for the next 10 minutes or so, not necessarily about interesting things, it just felt amazing and wonderful to talk again. I forgot where I was, what I'd put myself through for the last night, day and now evening, and just headed forwards together. Down to the right, we could see our destination. Cortina had begun to light itself up. If you strained your eyes you could even make out the clocktower, the landmark where the race starts and ends. 

My new friend told me he's gonna run, he seemed fresh given the 75k he had on his legs. I said I needed to stop for a moment, I had to find and put on my headlamp, try and eat something, but that maybe I'll see him at the finish line. I do my tasks and once again begin to follow a beam of light, my feet are wrecked, but legs remember how to run, we've done this so many times, just try and use gravity, I tell myself.

And lo and behold, surprise surprise, who do I pass? Mr-trying-to-take-out-everyone-and-everything-in-his-path, that’s who. He's staggering downwards, weaving all over the trail, clearly entirely blown up and doesn't seem to have much left to get him back home. I feel kind of sorry for him as I breeze on through, but also, screw that guy. If he'd been good to others, he'd have also been good to himself.

But enough with that, we have one last conflict for the night. At 115km, I was weaving downwards, poles still in hand, taking small pieces of the ground impact forces with them. An Italian 80k runner/boomer moved past me on my right, making a comment as he went. I swiftly replied 'Sorry, I don't speak Italian', and with his back turned to me, he held his folded up poles aloft and said it again. In the moment, I assume he's directing me to put my poles away, maybe for safety on the downhill, (this was a wiiiiide trail for the first time in a long while, and at least three runners, all with poles in tow, could have passed), but since I wonder whether he was trying to advise me that I'll be marginally faster without them. 

But either way, 115k Mick does not want or appreciate advice at this point. 'I'm UUUUUUUUUSING them bro!' I exasperatedly called after him. He seemed to shrug his shoulders. I almost laughed at the notion that this was the time and place to hand out tips and advice to fellow runners. At this point in, I felt maybe we’ve proven that you might know at least one or two things about moving effectively in the mountains. But sod it, onward we went. 

We arrived at the very last aid station by the beautiful Croda Lago, lit up like fireflies by the lights of the tents. I'm aware that I haven't been eating, and that I still have to be. Again, nothing seemed tempting, they were all out of Naak drink, so I filled half a flask of Coke and wager that, if all goes ok, that'll get me there. I said a final thanks, and joined a group of 5-10 runners, all of whom were heading back out into our last chapter in the woods. 

I don't know if it was the dark, the steepness, the pressure of runners front and back, but this last section felt like it took forever. You could barely see, the trees were so thick and the trail so tight and sheer (ironically, given Mr Pole Advice Man) it would've been almost impossible without cheat sticks to keep ourselves upright. I do go down on my ass once, which I think is probably acceptable in a full day of climbing and descending technical mountains. It hurts, and I'm not happy about it, but dust myself off and keep moving. 

Then we hit a bit of a final sad moment. I'd been watching the distance count of my watch climb and tick steadily towards 120km, and right as we hit '119.5km' I saw a sign on the side of the trail that said '4km til finish'. Both me and the other runners around me seem to groan in unison. 4km is a fucking eternity in that state, and when you've been averaging around 5km/h for an entire day, it doesn't take a genius to know we're still not done here. But scrambling for some joy, I acknowledged, quietly in the dark to myself, that my elapsed time had said '24:00:00' right around the time the distance touched 120km. In my own little, secret, dark world, I'd hit my goal of 120km and 5800m in one day. 'Good job, Big Mick, now let's bring it home'. 

I was scraping the last little drops of coke from my flask, trying to find any scraps of sugar left in my pack to drive me forwards. My feet were also suffering badly, and while I'd been able to run the first points of those descents, when I realised that 24 hours to the finish line wasn't gonna happen, I just accepted and slowed down to a power hike. There was no more need for heroics here, we needed to move again like we were gonna be out here for hours, not minutes. Just move in a way your body can manage, I told myself, and my boy you're gonna be there soon. 

Finally, finally the woods opened up and gave way to the first hushed, residential streets of Cortina. One house we passed had a group of supporters who'd clearly been there all day, who were blasting up beat music, shouting bravi, and had laid out a plate of fucking watermelon for us all. Watermelon. What a fucking incredible food. The Australian guy next to me said 'I've been craving this all day', and I fucking agreed with him. It was the last little blast of sugar and life my system needed. My 0.5% battery ticked momentarily back up to 1%, and I knew that was enough. 

As we hit the centre of Cortina, I suddenly lit up. I knew that when I turned that corner at the top of this hill, there was gonna be a crowd of cheering supporters, the finish line, it was all finally going to be over. And if we're gonna end this, let's do it right. 

*I power up the hill, passing a final group of 80km runners, one of whom I remember looks a little stunned by this skinny, bedraggled 120km dude that had snapped into his emergency gear in the last moments. I bomb down the busy streets in a full on sprint, the bars* ove*rflowing with people, all of them drunk and cheering, holding out their hands for high fives. A smile is planted on my face. All that agony, fatigue and effort is converted into sheer joy as people pound batons against the floor, railings, buildings in a pulsing drum beat that my dizzying heart rate seems to match.* 

*I suddenly hear Frank calling from the side of the railing, just as he'd done 24 hours earlier. I catch his eye, beam at him, and point at him in a way that I hoped expressed ‘you got me here, you’. And finally, with the last remaining drops of energy I run forwards under the finish line, arms outstretched, before collapsing against the railing. There was no more road, no more trail, nothing more to give. A tired Italian woman puts a medal over my neck, and I stand briefly alone in the crowds of runners with their loved ones, and don't know what to do or who to be. It's like I'd had a singular purpose or puzzle that every part of me had to scramble to find solutions to solve for an entire day, and now it was done and I had nobody left to be.*

Frank appeared, and I fell into his arms. All I know is I thanked him again and again, he told me he was so proud of me, and I accepted it openly, something it's hard for me to do. It takes a lot for me to be proud of myself, but I was proud of that. 

And as long as it had taken, suddenly it was all over. We were back in the car, my shoes off, feet on the dash, every muscle in my legs was finally able to relax into almost a painful orgasm, a total, final and absolute release.

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever asked myself to do, and now I knew my answer.

*I finished the Lavaredo Ultra Trail 120K in 24 hours and 18 minutes, crossing the line in 769th place out of 1700 starters.*

As you might know the main Fooocus development is discontinued but there are actulually still a few actively maintained forks available that I experimented with.

So I went down the rabbit hole trying to run Fooocus on Google Colab but the experience was more like trial-and-error than plug-and-play.

Therefore being an engineer of course I ended up building my own custom (IMO) optimized Docker images that are optimized to run on Vast.ai (rent-a-GPU service). Boot time is around 5 minutes from launching the machine to generating image (around the time it takes me to make a cup of coffee).

I also added a few other features while on it:

- Authentication
- Web-based file browser, log viewer and terminal
- A powerful provision system that lets you download public and private models 

If you’re in the same situation (laptop user, no GPU) and just want to get started quickly to play with Fooocus this might save you a few hours of your time and headache.

My currently supported versions:

- [Mashbi1t version](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=118093&creator_id=118093&name=vastai-fooocus-mashb1t) - natural continuation of the official Fooocus repo

ich wohne in Stuttgart‑West und beobachte seit einiger Zeit eine echt nervige Entwicklung: Überquellende Mülleimer, achtlos weggeworfene Coffee-to-go-Becher, Zigarettenkippen und Pizzakartons – und Sperrmüll, der einfach an der Ecke „vergessen“ wird. Was ist da los? Vor allem am Feuersee und am Bismarckplatz.

Und das, obwohl es eigentlich genug Infrastruktur gibt – Papierkörbe, Stadtreinigung, sogar Kampagnen der Stadt wie „Sauberes Stuttgart“. Trotzdem wird der öffentliche Raum immer mehr zugemüllt.  


**Meine Fragen an euch:**

* Was denkt ihr – warum verhalten sich so viele so rücksichtslos?
* Welche Orte im Westen fallen euch besonders negativ auf?
* Was könnten Stadt, Anwohner\*innen oder Initiativen konkret tun, um das Problem in den Griff zu bekommen?

Ein paar Gedanken:

* Müssten öffentliche Mülleimer öfter geleert oder smarter platziert werden?
* Bringen Aktionen mit Anwohner\*innen was, um Bewusstsein zu schaffen?
* Helfen mehr Kontrollen & spürbare Strafen?
* Mehr Positivbeispiele – statt immer nur zu meckern?

Info: **Ab dem 13. Juli findet auf dem Bismarckplatz eine Aktionswoche statt.**  
Organisiert wird das Ganze von der Initiative **„Schön hier, oder?“** – da geht’s um gemeinsames Aufräumen, kreative Aktionen und darum, unseren Stadtteil wieder ein Stück lebenswerter zu machen.

**Folgt auch dem Insta-Kanal @schoenhier\_oder** – dort gibt’s alle Infos und Mitmachmöglichkeiten!

Was meint ihr – braucht es mehr Engagement, andere Maßnahmen oder einfach mehr Miteinander?

Pondicherry (Puducherry) is a charming coastal city – often called the **“French Riviera of the East”** – where sandy beaches meet colonial streets. This seaside destination offers a heady mix of sun-warmed bougainvillea, heritage villas, and a tranquil beach promenade. For tourists and foodies alike, dining with a **bay of Bengal view** is a must-do. Imagine inhaling the salty sea breeze while you dig into freshly caught seafood or sipping a chilled drink as the sun dips below the horizon. Pondicherry’s laid-back beach culture and vibrant culinary scene make it perfect for **ocean-view dining**. In this guide we spotlight five top picks – Finz, Theevu Plage, Bay of Buddha, Le Café, and Escape In – each offering a **seaside restaurant experience** you won’t forget. Get ready to explore the best sea-facing restaurants in Pondicherry, complete with signature ambiance and dishes.

# Finz – Seafood & Barbeque-Where the ocean meets your plate — seafood with a view that stuns!

https://preview.redd.it/ap07iz685ubf1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=2133c6d75feb8f9daf6aea5a170c5425e841441a

Situated by the sandy shore near Club Mahindra Puducherry (south of town), **Finz** is a dreamy open-air seafood spot. Perched just off the beach, you can literally hear the waves while dining under strings of fairy lights. The vibe is relaxed but romantic – think candlelight flickering on the sand, the scent of smoky grill and spices in the air, and a cool breeze blowing in off the Bay of Bengal. It’s no wonder visitors call Finz *“a hidden paradise”* with *“fresh and tasty”* seafood. Finz truly feels like one of the best **sea view restaurants in Pondicherry**, combining oceanfront scenery with a friendly, barefoot beach shack atmosphere. It’s casual yet special – perfect for a sunset dinner or a breezy moonlit meal by the shore.

* **Recommended dishes:**  
   * *Clove Roasted Fish* – Succulent local catch slow-roasted with aromatic spices.  
   * *Crab Curry* – Decadent and creamy blue crab curry, ideal for savoring with crusty bread.  
   * *Prawn Masala* – A tangy, spicy gravy loaded with jumbo prawns.  
   * *Chili Garlic Prawns* – Plump prawns tossed in a buttery garlic-chili sauce, grilled to juicy perfection.  
   * *Tandoori Prawns* – Jumbo prawns marinated in yogurt and spices, then charred over the grill.  

The menu at Finz is seafood-centric (with some North Indian gravies), and most items are prepared on live grills or in clay ovens. Diners rave about the buffet’s variety of fish – basa, kingfish, anchovies, squid and more – cooked in different styles right in front of you. Service is warm and attentive, often with chefs explaining dishes tableside. Pull up a wooden chair or low table on the sand; let the salty air and rhythmic crash of waves set the mood. Whether it’s a family feast or a romantic date, Finz delivers cozy **beachside dining** and some of the freshest seafood in Pondicherry.

# Theevu Plage-A coastal escape for beachside dining under the stars.

https://preview.redd.it/bn2ekxb95ubf1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=a661ddd2712d6ce1d57944061dcdadfc39083123

About 5 km from the city, **Theevu Plage** (meaning “Island Beach” in Tamil) sits right on Serenity Beach Road in Kottukuppam. This charming beach shack is literally on the sand of Serenity Beach, giving it one of Pondicherry’s most relaxed shorefront ambiances. Theevu Plage is an *“open area”* restaurant known for its fantastic **beach view** and casual vibes. It’s basic but enchanting – bamboo and thatch huts, picnic benches, and locally made decor. During the day, it’s bathed in warm sunlight; at night, the setting is cozy under hanging lanterns and moonlight. You can feel the soft sea breeze and even dip your feet in the sand between bites. As diners note, the staff are friendly and it’s the kind of spot where *“a Pondi trip without this place is incomplete”*.

* **Recommended dishes:**  
   * *Fresh Fish Fry* – Whole red snapper or pomfret marinated with local spices and shallow-fried until crispy.  
   * *Butter Garlic Prawns* – Big prawns sautéed in butter, garlic and herbs.  
   * *Crab Masala* – Crabs cooked in a tangy southern-style curry gravy.  
   * *Grilled Pomfret/Kingfish* – Choice catch chargrilled with a hint of smokiness.  
   * *Auroville Ice Cream* – A beloved local treat for dessert, creamy and refreshing (made by Auroville co-operatives).  

Theevu Plage’s menu is simple and focuses on fresh seafood and South Indian favorites. It’s also been praised as *“outstanding”* and *“awesome food for non-veg lovers”*. Don’t be surprised if the owner suggests today’s catch or whips up something spicy and rustic. Seating is mostly outdoors (tables under thatch canopies), right steps from where waves lap the shore. This place truly lives up to “restaurant in Pondicherry near beach” – you’re practically at the water’s edge. Being a local treasure near Auroville, it’s slightly off the tourist track, but that’s part of its charm. Come at sunset to see the sky turn pastel over the ocean, or enjoy a leisurely lunch with a cool sea breeze and the smell of curry in the air. Theevu Plage feels like a friendly little hideaway where you can kick back, listen to the surf, and savor coastal Kerala-style cooking.

# Bay of Buddha-Pan-Asian flavours with panoramic sea views – zen in every bite.

https://preview.redd.it/e3cr3bea5ubf1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab74ded45e82af477239306eb6fae672bf05e4c

Perched atop **The Promenade Hotel** on Goubert Avenue in White Town, **Bay of Buddha** is a chic rooftop haven with panoramic views. Its modern glass railings frame an unobstructed outlook over the Bay of Bengal and Pondicherry’s famed lighthouse (the new one is across the road). By day you get blue skies and sparkling water, but the real magic is at sunset when lights twinkle and the sky blushes pink. As the official description says, this *“gorgeous rooftop”* serves Pan-Asian cuisine while offering a *“mesmerizing view of the sea”*. The ambiance is trendy and upscale – think candlelit tables, soothing music, and gentle breeze. It’s perfect for a romantic evening or a fun night out with friends. Staff here are known for being discreet and attentive, ensuring your coast-facing dinner feels special. In short, Bay of Buddha delivers a fusion of international flavors and the quintessential **ocean sunset backdrop**, making it a favorite among couples and urban explorers.

* **Recommended dishes:**  
   * *Golden Fried Prawns* – Lightly battered prawns served golden and crispy, perfect for starters.  
   * *Chicken Yakitori* – Grilled skewers of chicken in sweet-savory sauce, a hit from the live grill.  
   * *Miso Glazed Fish* – Fresh local fish (sourced from the Bay) topped with tangy miso glaze.  
   * *Honey Sesame Lamb* – Tender lamb chunks in a sweet sesame-soy sauce.  
   * *Sticky Rice with Mango* – Thailand’s beloved dessert of coconut rice paired with ripe mango slices.  

Bay of Buddha’s menu spans Chinese, Thai, Korean and more, so it’s a nice change if you want something different from Indian curries. The hit list includes their sticky mango rice (a must-try dessert) and any fresh seafood specials. Many diners also enjoy sipping signature cocktails while watching fishermen boats drift by. Even if you’re not a big eater, ordering a few appetizers with drinks makes for a perfect seaside evening. The rooftop setting truly justifies calling this one of the **best sea view restaurants in Pondicherry** – the combination of dazzling sky and stylish plates is hard to beat. Just remember it’s dinner-only (7pm–11pm), so plan for an early reservation to catch twilight and the first stars over the sea.

# Le Café-Pondicherry’s iconic 24/7 sea-view café — sip, relax, repeat.

https://preview.redd.it/3cjq2geb5ubf1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d687e8930033f4c74c3a62134261f491d9db36

By far one of the most iconic spots in Pondicherry, **Le Café** sits right on the promenade road (“Beach Road”) facing the sea. It’s famously known as India’s first open-air cafe, with teal-blue chairs and picnic tables lining the boardwalk. This breezy, 24-hour café is beloved by locals and tourists who come for its *unbeatable beachfront view*. You’re essentially sitting inches from the surf (with only the road separating you), so the sound of waves and cool ocean wind are constant companions. The vibe is laid-back and lively – expect bicycle bells, street performers, and the chatter of friends over coffee. It’s perfect for a morning filter-coffee sunrise or a late-night pizza under the palms. As Zomato notes, Le Café is known for its *“outdoor seating arrangement, awesome view, best location”*.

* **Recommended dishes:**  
   * *Cappuccino or Filter Coffee* – Wake up with Pondicherry’s best brew and watch the day begin over the bay.  
   * *Croissants & Sandwiches* – Buttery pastries (often baked fresh) or simple veg sandwiches – great snacky bites.  
   * *Salads & Wraps* – Light continental fare (the Veggie Delight sandwich and cheese rolls are local favorites).  
   * *Pasta/Flatbreads* – A few Italian-leaning options like pasta primavera or thin-crust pizza.  
   * *Gelato or Pastries* – Cool off with a scoop of gelato or a slice of cake as you enjoy the view.  

Even though Le Café is casual (self-service style with quick eats), the experience feels special. Parents bring kids for juice, honeymooners linger for hours over desserts, and travelers tap laptops at dawn. It’s entirely vegetarian (with veggie pastries and deli-style sandwiches), making it inclusive for all guests. Longtime visitors claim this is the “best beach cafe” – indeed, grabbing a seat on the beachfront balcony up top literally puts you *“at the best view in town”*. Here you’ll find the sea-facing charm Pondicherry is famous for: mint juleps in hand, toes wiggling in the sand, and pastel beach huts in the distance. It may be simple, but the laid-back, breezy atmosphere and unbeatable waterfront perch make Le Café a must-visit on any seaside restaurant crawl.

# Escape In, Pondicherry-Chill vibes, sea breeze & cocktails — your ultimate beachside hangout.

https://preview.redd.it/mdzg70ec5ubf1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac920cb75a7fd7c3f4fb0397f8a7b0d83e71ce6

Located on the first floor of Goubert Avenue (Beach Road) in White Town, **Escape In** is a popular multi-cuisine eatery with a front-row view of the ocean. Its elevated terrace means diners get a sweeping **sea view** over the promenade below. Reviews highlight Escape In for its *“perfect view”* and *“awesome location”* – it’s a cozy spot to sip a sundowner as the waves glimmer. The interior is modern yet warm, with colorful furniture and open sides letting in the sea breeze. Even though it’s more urban compared to a beachfront shack, the vibe is still relaxed and friendly, drawing both locals and travelers. Tables on the edge feel almost on the water. The menu is wide-ranging (North Indian, Chinese, Continental, and seafood), so it caters to every palate. In other words, Escape In is an *all-purpose* oceanview spot – great for family dinners, date nights, or even a casual lunch over pancakes and fresh juice.

* **Recommended dishes:**  
   * *Tandoori Prawns* – Jumbo prawns marinated in Indian spices and grilled to juicy perfection.  
   * *Honey Mustard Chicken* – Crispy chicken tossed in a sweet-honey mustard glaze (a house specialty).  
   * *Fish Tikka* – Chunks of fish marinated in yogurt and spices, cooked in a tandoor.  
   * *Paneer Tikka Masala* – Cubes of paneer in a rich tomato-cream gravy (vegetarian favorite).  
   * *Falooda* – A decadent rose-flavored milk dessert with jellies and basil seeds – cooling and refreshing.  

Dish highlights include the butter chicken and honey mustard chicken (sweet-savory), and their selection of grilled starters. We also love that they offer some seafood biryani and fresh seafood curries for beach holiday vibes. Expect spicy kebabs, fragrant biryani, and some Indo-Chinese classics too. Escape In is literally marketed as a *“multi cuisine sea view restaurant”*, and the food really is crowd-pleasing. As another bonus, prices are reasonable (about ₹1000 for two). Whether you’re there for the seafood curry or just the ocean panorama, Escape In delivers an easygoing terrace experience – exactly the kind you look for in a *“restaurant in Pondicherry near beach.”* The combination of sizzling grills, breezy sea air and views of the forever-blue bay makes every meal here feel like a vacation-worthy escape.

Need a little diagnosing an issue here. I have been away from home for a week, come back to make a coffee and my pressure reading when pouring a shot is now hitting 4bar, when previously it sat between 9-10. 

A few things to note, these are the same beans as last week and they are only 2 weeks open, roasted in May. Same grinder settings as last week, I have even tried going much finer with same results. 

When I put the back flush group head in I get 9-10 bars of pressure. 

I am probably missing something but nothing has changed so any insight into where I may be faulting would be wondering. 

Machine is a profitec Go
Grinder is a fellow opus - I usual sit at around 3.5 on the grinder to get the best results for me, I have gone down to 2 to try and see if the grind size was the issue.

My (25F) bf (23M) broke up with me dahil according to him hindi niya na raw ako ganon kamahal na mahal. Why? Because he is still unstable sa other aspects in life. I know na some might say na ""nagdadahilan lang"" but I want to know if may times ba na totoo siya and paano malalaman kung totoo nga. 

Context: 
We've known each other since 2018 and he is my first boyfriend. When we were in high school, although matalino , siya yung tipo ng tao na go with the flow sa buhay. Hindi naman siya naging pabaya sa pag aaral niya pero mabarkada siya and that time wala silang inatupag ng mga barkada niya kundi mag-inom and s*x. Kapag nagtanong ka about sa kung ano plano niya sa future, siya yung tipo ng tao who will laugh about it and say ""YOLO"" or ""mamamatay din naman tayo, plano plano pa"". We broke up that same year but still in contact after but ni-cut off ko last 2020.

This year, nagparamdam ulit siya and nag-kamustahan. May nakita naman akong konting growth sa kanya like cinut off niya na yung mga barkada niya from high school na na-stuck sa ganong pamumuhay na puro inom and s*x so nung nakipagbalikan siya I thought why not give it a chance. 

When we started dating, every thing is okay naman, wala naman problem sa friends niya unlike 7 years ago but ang problem na hinaharap naman niya naman ngayon ay yung pressure from his family and sa sarili now that he's in his 20s kasi:

1. Hindi niya tinapos pag-aaral niya kahit one sem na lang kasi hindi niya talaga gusto yung course na kinuha niya, and hindi niya rin daw alam kung ano gusto niya kunin before. 
2. His family is pushing him to join the Philippine Air Force kasi most of his family sa mother side ay nasa PAF dati and sa kanilang magkakapatid, siya ang nakikitang fit na magpa-enlist kaso hanggang ngayon daw wala pa rin opening
3. Dahil wala nang paramdam yung dad niya and dahil siya ang panganay, siya na dapat ang aasahan kaso hanggang ngayon, he still feel lost at walang maayos na savings because yung other income niya ay binibigay niya sa mga kapatid niya pambaon for school. To make things worse, may times na sinasabihan siya ni tita na ""sigurado na ako, mali pagpapalaki ko sayo"" because of that. Ilang beses na ito na-bring up sa relationship namin kapag nararamdaman kong nagiging distant siya kasi ibig sabihin non, nago-overthink siya sa current life situation niya.
4. Namomroblema siya now kasi feel niya stuck siya now sa BPO na work. Although okay naman siya kaso hindi niya raw kasi nakikita yung sarili niya sa industry na yon. 

Recently, he broke up with me and told me hindi niya na raw ako ganon kamahal and those problems are the reason why. He is so unstable in life, hindi niya kaya maglaan ng energy to commit emotionally. I'm a very understanding person kaya I always try to reassure him before and minsan sa dates, ako nago-offer ng pang gas or sa coffee. Naa-appreciate niya naman yun but ayaw naman daw niya na ganon palagi. Gusto rin naman daw niya inii-spoil ako. I'm very much aware sa life situation niya and kita ko naman na unlike before, mas may drive siya now when it comes to life kaso gusto niya ma-achieve lahat nang sabay sabay. Aminado rin siya na minamadali niya rin sarili niya lalo na sa pagbili ng big bike niya pero ayun, hindi pa raw talaga niya kaya mag commit sa relationship, kung siya mismo hindi pa kaya tumayo sa sarili niyang paa. Pero if maging okay na raw yung estado ng buhay niya like months later, babalikan niya raw ako. Ako lang daw ang gusto niyang balikan.

1lvgg38,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lvgg38/im_a_police_officer_in_a_town_gripped_by/,I’m a police officer in a town gripped by something otherworldly,"Have to admit, when I joined the police, I expected a bit more excitement than the daily barrage of petty crime and paperwork.
A pack of scones stolen from the local shop at nine in the morning, followed by six hours of paperwork—only to be called out again because, once more, the postman’s letters had been nicked by the local teens and lobbed into the river. And that, sadly, was often the highlight of an average day here.

Not exactly the foot-chases and crime syndicate takedowns I’d let myself daydream about. But I suppose it was to be expected in the sleepy little town I was stationed in.

The station itself was a converted cottage. From the outside, it still looked like something from a countryside postcard—charming brickwork, slightly overgrown garden, and a hanging sign above the door that simply read POLICE. It didn’t stand out much, though it had that timeless, lived-in quality that made it look like a leftover prop from Downton Abbey.

Like the town, our police force was small—fifteen of us on a busy day. And we barely saw real trouble. At least, not until about six months ago, when everything went tits-up. Nothing’s really been the same since.

But I’ll get to that.

⸻

I’d been on the job just four months, sitting at my desk, lazily spinning in my chair while eating a box of apple crumble that an old lady had given us as thanks for helping her off the roof that morning.
Across from me sat Sergeant Wilson—the man who’d been showing me the ropes since day one. A short, stocky chap with an impressive collection of chin fluff and the gentle energy of a shopping mall Santa. I often wondered how he managed to pass the fitness tests each year. He had the kind of build that suggested he’d never once turned down a second helping of pudding, and frankly, good on him.
He wouldn’t say boo to a goose, but his people skills and natural leadership more than made up for it. Loyal, selfless, and happiest when talking about food.

“Bloody hell, Mrs Pemberton makes a cracking crumble,” he said, eyes locked on his plate. “The way the apples are soft, but the biscuit top still has that little crunch! Don’t be telling the wife, Williams, or I won’t be getting me pud tonight.”

I chuckled with half a mouthful. “Don’t be daft, Sarge. Even if she knew, she’d still feel bad by supper and whip you up something small.”

He laughed, then began coughing slightly on a crumble crumb just as the phone rang. I glanced up at the clock—1:55 p.m.—and rolled my eyes. Nearly time for a break.

I swallowed quickly and picked up the phone .
“Hello, Constable Williams speaking. How can I help?”

A woman’s voice came through, thick with concern but laced with familiarity.
“Oh, hiya love. I was just walking back from the shops, and this older chap in a tracksuit—holding a bottle of something—stumbled past me and fell straight into the bushes down the slope.”

“I see. And where exactly did this happen?”

“Just past the bookshop at the end of the road. Right where it leads down into Cradle Woods.”

“Alright, thank you. We’ll take a look.”

I hung up with a sigh and began gathering my things, but Sarge waved me off.
“Don’t worry about it, lad,” he said. “That’s the fifth call today with the same details. Probably Malcolm—the pisshead from up at number 43—trying to get a free meal and a warm bed again.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Bit excessive, isn’t it?”

“He’s a regular nuisance,” Sarge said, shaking his head. “Last year, he nicked the priest’s bicycle and rode it around the village in the nude, shouting about some ‘stick insect man in the woods who sounded like him.’”

He chuckled again, this time without looking up from his crumble. I gave a tired grunt and sat back down, returning to the never-ending pile of paperwork beside me.

We received three more calls that day—same incident, same location. We finally agreed that any more would just be logged as duplicates and handed off to admin.

But then came the last call of the day.
And that one was different.

Around 5:50 p.m., just as I was considering a cup of tea the phone rang again.

“Hello, Williams speaking. How can I help?”

The reply wasn’t what I expected. A ragged, wavering voice came through:
“Williams… hello… speaking… help…”

I glanced at Sarge and raised an eyebrow. The voice sounded confused—like one of the residents from the old folks’ home had got hold of a phone. Static crackled down the line, then a second voice cut in, sharper but still strained.

“Hello? Can you hear me? Hi—yes, the postman went to collect his letters after those bloody kids threw them in the pond again. But now he’s just… standing there. He’s been like that for over an hour, not moving.”

I frowned. “Have you tried speaking to him? Does he look injured?”

“No… he looks fine, just… standing there. Staring off into the distance.”

“Alright, ma’am. We’ll send someone over to check on him.”

I put down the phone and met Sarge’s gaze.
“Looks like I’m off for a welfare check. Postie’s having a strange one.”

Sarge rubbed his lower back with a pained wince. “You’ll have to foot it alone, lad. My sciatica’s flaring up again, and besides, it’s just around the corner.”

I shrugged. Postie was usually a harmless old bloke who always offered me a boiled sweet and a chat. I headed out.

⸻

It didn’t take me long to reach the pond , The path was quiet, the evening air heavy with the scent of damp earth and moss. I half-expected to find him standing there exactly as described, letters in hand, eyes glassy.

But when I arrived… nothing. The pond was still, reflecting the greying sky like a cracked mirror. A family of ducks drifted lazily across the water, quacking softly. But no postman. No one else.

I scanned the area, called out a few times, checked behind the nearest trees—nothing. Odd, I thought. Maybe he’d snapped out of it and wandered off.
Relieved, I turned back toward the station, glad the paperwork for a “no incident found” report would be mercifully short.

A couple of hours later, I clocked off and made my way to The Wobbly Traveller , It looked much like the station from the outside, but inside, it was cosy and welcoming: battered wooden tables, walls lined with old photographs and odd trinkets, a fireplace that never quite went out.

Big Pat, the landlord, loomed over the bar, his shaved head scraping the low ceiling beams. Despite his size, he moved with a gentle grace. I never knew much about him—he rarely spoke of himself and preferred to listen to others’ tales. Just don’t mention his dog in the photos on the walls. He’d turn stone-cold if you did. We thought it might of died or something but we’ve seen the dog run in and out the pub many times , neither pat or the animal acknowledging each-other. Maybe he just really bloody hated the thing.

His wife, Little Pat—who looked like a scaled-down version of Big Pat—was the true force behind the bar. She’d always have your drink poured before you even walked in. And somehow, she seemed to know everything about everyone.

Today was no different. As I stepped through the door, she called out cheerily, “Ah, Williams! A pint of Orchard Gold waiting for you. How’s that knee tonight, still giving you a jip?”

I blinked in surprise. I’d injured my knee playing rugby in school and it flared up now and again—but I couldn’t remember ever mentioning it. Maybe it was the slight limp I barely noticed myself. “Yeah,” I admitted, “a bit sore, but could be worse.”

She smiled sweetly, wiped a glass with a practiced flick, and waddled off.

⸻

One pint turned to two, then three. By the time I reached six, I felt that warm, comforting fuzz only cider could give. I was just raising my final glass when the pub was bathed in blue light—flashing police car lights strobed through the windows, followed by the wail of sirens.

Three patrol cars and a van sped past at an unusually high speed.

I sighed. “Bugger that,” I muttered. “I’m off duty. Not my problem.”

But just then, my phone buzzed on the table. Normally, if it was work and I wasn’t on call, I’d ignore it. But this was Sarge’s personal mobile. He never called me on that unless it was something important—or the bakery was selling cut-price pastries.

⸻

“Williams!” His voice was tight with panic. “Thank God you picked up. You went to check on Postie earlier—what the hell happened?”

I had to concentrate to keep my words from slurring. “Postie? Yeah… POND! He was there… but then he was gone. Magically disappeared. He’s fine, Sarge… he’s fine…”

“Christ…” I heard shuffling, retching, and the muted sound of someone crying. “Williams… just come to the park opposite the station. Now.”

I left The Wobbly Traveller in a stumbling sprint, adrenaline sobering me faster than any strong coffee. The park opposite the station was less than a minute’s run, but every step felt endless. Blue lights from parked police cars lit up the small green, casting stark shadows across the bandstand and the gnarled old oaks.

Sarge was waiting, wild-eyed, waving me over. He grabbed me by the arm and all but dragged me towards a white tent erected by the pond. As we ducked inside, the metallic scent of blood and something else—something sour and wrong—hit me like a train.

Laid out on the grass was a neatly folded postal uniform. Next to it, an upturned cap. Nestled inside the cap were teeth—dozens of them—along with two pale eyes staring in different directions. A half-clenched hand, severed cleanly at the wrist, lay nearby, tattooed knuckles confirming beyond doubt it belonged to Postie.

The bile rose in my throat faster than I could fight it. I staggered outside and vomited into the bushes, the world spinning around me as muffled voices echoed from the tent. I wiped my mouth with a trembling hand.
The rest of the night was a haze: flashing cameras, paramedics bagging the remains, Sarge giving a shaky statement. I remember trying to comfort Postie’s widow, but she stared straight through me, as if she already knew there was nothing I could say to make sense of it.

The days that followed felt unreal. Because we had neither the resources nor the expertise, the case was handed off to the neighbouring city’s detectives. Our role became little more than forwarding witness statements or collecting CCTV stills. Every morning after the incident, mail kept arriving. On the dot, before dawn, a neat stack of letters would appear on every doorstep in town—including mine.
Some contained normal bills and leaflets. But others… others held envelopes stuffed with blank sheets of paper or newspaper clippings from decades—even centuries—ago. One morning, I opened an envelope addressed in perfect copperplate handwriting and found a yellowed article dated 1904 detailing a mysterious disappearance in Cradle Woods.

A week after Postie’s death, reports started coming in—just like before—of a man in a tracksuit stumbling into the bushes near the same spot. The calls described him slurring his words, reeking of alcohol. It had to be Malcolm, I thought. Up to his old bollocks again.
By that evening, Sarge and I agreed we’d go check on him ourselves.
As we left the station, conversation turned, as it always did, to dinner plans.

“Anything good lined up for dinner tonight, Williams?” Sarge asked, trying to sound light-hearted but his eyes still clouded with worry.

I shrugged. Usually, dinner was whatever leftovers I had at home, but I knew Sarge liked the conversation. “Might try the new chippy by The Wobbly. Heard their fishcakes are something special.”

Sarge clapped his hands together, his eyes lighting up. “Didn’t realise they’d opened! Grandkids are over tonight—they’ll love a chippy.”

⸻

We reached Cradle Woods just as the sun dipped below the rooftops, casting long shadows through the trees. We searched the shrubs and the bank where Malcolm had supposedly fallen. But there was nothing: no disturbed branches, no muddy footprints, no sign of a scuffle.

Then, just as we were about to call it a night, something white caught my eye in a thicket at the bottom of the bank.

“Sarge, over here,” I called.

We clambered down the slope, branches whipping at our legs, until we reached the white object: a trainer poking out of the foliage. As we drew closer, we realised it wasn’t just a discarded shoe—it was attached to a leg. And the leg to a body.

Sarge sighed and nudged the foot with his boot. “Come on, you daft old sod. Let’s get you home.”

Nothing.

“Malcolm, your missus is going to skin you alive for getting your tracksuit this muddy.”

Still nothing.

⸻

“Oh, boys!” a voice called cheerily behind us.

We turned sharply. Standing at the top of the bank was Malcolm himself, looking surprisingly well-kept for a man known to drink his breakfast.

I felt my stomach drop as Malcolm stood there at the top of the bank, swaying only slightly. My eyes darted from him to the trainer poking from the undergrowth. Dread curdled in my gut.

Carefully, I bent down and pulled back the bushes. Beneath the leaves lay a body, or what was left of one: a desiccated corpse, twisted unnaturally, clothes fused to leathery skin. It was as though he’d been lying there for years.

“What the fuck…” I breathed, frozen in place.

Sarge turned as pale as a ghost. His eyes were wide, darting between the corpse and Malcolm, who took one last swig from a nearly empty whisky bottle, smashed it at his feet, and gave us a lopsided grin.

“Well lads , good luck with that ,” Malcolm slurred, whistling Fly Me to the Moon as he sauntered off into the darkness, vanishing behind the trees.

I forced myself to breathe. Then, slipping on a pair of blue latex gloves I kept in my jacket pocket, I reached inside the corpse’s tattered jacket. My fingers found what felt like a wallet tucked in the chest pocket. As I tugged it free, the zipper snagged—skin and fabric had fused in places—and pulling it open sounded like tearing old wallpaper.

The ID card inside read:

Mr. REDACTED Bramley
DOB: —/—/1948
22 Cradle Woods

I felt like the ground had disappeared beneath me. That was my address—the house I’d been renting for months.

I looked up and met Sarge’s eyes. He was sweating heavily now, breathing like he’d run a marathon. He took the ID from my shaking hand, eyes tracing the name, then looked up with a thousand-yard stare. “He is … he was… my friend,” Sarge whispered, voice cracking. “He’s been missing for years. I thought he’d just buggered off after one too many rows with his missus…”

His voice trailed off. His hands were trembling so hard he nearly dropped the wallet. I reached out and gripped his shoulder. He collapsed into me, burying his face in my chest as his sobs broke through the night air. I’d never seen Sarge like this—he was always the anchor, the one holding everything together. Now he felt like a man unmoored.

⸻

A loud thump echoed from the treetops nearby. Branches rustled violently above us, like something heavy shifting through the canopy.

Sarge’s grief transformed in an instant. He pulled away from me, eyes alight with rage, and whipped out his baton. “You bastard!” he roared. “I’ll get you for this!” Without another word, he charged up the bank and into the woods.

“Sarge! Wait!” I shouted, but he was already gone, crashing through the undergrowth.

I scrambled after him, heart hammering, but for a man his size he moved with shocking speed. His footsteps faded, replaced by the whisper of leaves in the wind.

I must have wandered for an hour, calling for Sarge, but the forest swallowed my voice whole. The trees pressed close on every side, their twisted branches clawing at the darkening sky. Blisters formed on my feet from my new boots, each step a fresh jolt of pain. Exhausted and disoriented, I sank down at the base of a thick oak, my back resting against the rough bark.

My breath came in ragged gasps. My shirt clung to me with cold sweat. I tried to steady my hands enough to untie one boot and let my swollen foot breathe.

That’s when something warm and wet splashed across my forehead.

I reached up, expecting to find sweat—but my fingers came away bright red. I froze. Slowly, I looked up.

Sarge was above me, tangled in the branches. His head lolled at an impossible angle, eyes glazed, blood dripping steadily from a ragged wound in his chest. One of his arms hung limp, swaying with the breeze.

Beyond him, half-shrouded in leaves, something moved.

It was impossible to make out clearly in the gloom, but what I saw haunts every waking moment since: a massive figure, limbs long and crooked, joints bending the wrong way with wet cracks. It cradled Sarge like a puppet, twisting him this way and that with casual, inhuman strength.

“Run… Williams…” Sarge gurgled, a final cough spraying crimson. “Just run, boy…”

A roar tore through the forest—a shrieking, discordant wail that sounded like wolves howling underwater. The noise rattled my bones. Panic seized me. I ran.

I bolted blind, crashing through bushes, stumbling over roots. Branches clawed at my face. I risked a glance back once—just enough to see a flash of bright blue light pulsing through the treetops, the whole forest seeming to warp and ripple around it. Then I kept running.

I don’t remember how I got out of those woods. My mind is a patchwork of flashes: moonlight glinting off puddles, the rasp of my breath, brambles tearing at my clothes. Then, somehow, I was stumbling through my front door, slamming it shut behind me as I collapsed on the floor, gasping and soaked in sweat.
Since that night, everything has felt like a bad dream I can’t wake from. Search parties were organized. Officers from neighboring towns combed Cradle Woods, but they found nothing—no sign of Sarge, no tracks, no traces of the thing I saw. Colleagues tried to comfort me, repeating the same reassurances: it was shock, trauma, my mind filling in gaps to explain a terrifying night. But I know what I saw.

I’ve barely slept. Each time I close my eyes, I see Sarge’s lifeless face swinging above me, hear the warping howl that shook the trees. I’ve kept away from his wife; I can’t bear to sit across from her, knowing I ran when maybe—just maybe—I could’ve done something.

Weeks have passed . The case has stalled, and the city detectives have taken over entirely. Our role now is just to send in statements and logs.


I’ve been promoted to Sergeant. It’s an empty title that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, one I never wanted—not like this. Sarge should have been the one wearing these stripes.

And now, as I sit here typing this—on a PC that can barely stay on long enough to finish a single report—I’m trying to piece it all together. Writing this down feels like the only way to make sense of the last month or so to put the horrors in order before they swallow me whole.

We keep receiving occasional calls at the moment : several sightings of a man, dressed in a police uniform, running into the woods, screaming. My phone is ringing again.

I’m sorry, Sarge. I’ll make this right.

I've been part of various reactive/anxious dog forums and groups for years now, finding so much comfort in knowing I'm not the only one dealing with this... It's such a relief to find people who actually get it!

So I've decided to start an **Online Reactive Dog Support Group!** Would anyone be interested in creating a safe space together? Like a support group where we can:

* Talk openly without judgment
* Feel heard and validated in our experiences
* Connect with others who understand this journey because they live it every day
* Share what's working (and what isn't)
* Celebrate the progress
* Build genuine friendships with people who get it
* Learn from each other's experiences

**A few details:**

* Monthly online meetups via Zoom for now, but if the group grows I'll add more dates!
* Everyone's welcome no matter what stage you're at in your journey, whether you're just starting out, in the middle, or on the other side like me
* Everything shared in the group stays in the group - complete confidentiality
* Virtual meetings so anyone in the world can join!
* This is peer support, not professional training advice

I'm not a trainer, but I've been through the absolute worst of living with a reactive dog and come out the other side thanks to the right professional help. But what I wish I'd had most during those dark days was a community of people whom I could talk to and who understood me.

If you'd like to join our next virtual Reactive Dog Support Group meetup, comment or start a chat with me, and I'll send you the details :)

Hope everyone's having a good day with their reactive dogs ❤️

So… this is an update to my last post, the one about my grandpa’s TV and Channel 103. I wasn’t planning on writing anything else, but something happened last night, and I can’t sit with it anymore.

It’s followed me.

I know how that sounds. I know how crazy I sound. Believe me, I’ve tried every rational explanation. Sleep deprivation. Stress. Grief. Hallucination. I even went to a walk-in clinic yesterday because I thought I was having some kind of delayed breakdown.

But none of that explains what I saw last night.

I’ve been back at my apartment for five days. I haven’t turned on my TV at all. I even unplugged it. Honestly, I’ve been sleeping like shit, but otherwise just trying to act normal. The whole “if I ignore it, maybe it’ll go away” approach.

Last night around 3 AM (of course it’s 3 AM) I woke up to this faint humming noise. Like an old fridge or an electric razor just barely audible through the wall. At first I thought it was my upstairs neighbor (he’s always doing weird stuff at night), but when I sat up, I realized it was coming from inside my living room.

I didn’t even want to check. I just laid there for like 20 minutes trying to convince myself I was imagining it. But it kept getting louder. Like static rising under the floorboards.

Eventually, I grabbed a flashlight and walked out.

My TV was on.

Still unplugged.

Same static screen. Same channel number: 103 in the top right corner, glowing faint green.

But this time, the static didn’t last long. It flickered once — that weird blink again — and then it showed my apartment. Live. From the ceiling corner of the room.

Except this time, I wasn’t in the shot. The camera angle was looking down at my couch and the dark hallway behind it.

I should’ve left. I wanted to leave. But something about seeing my own apartment on screen rooted me in place.

Then something moved in the hallway.

On the screen, I mean.

Something tall, thin, dragging itself out from the dark like it was peeling off the wall.

Same figure as before. No eyes. Just that stretched-out mouth, too wide, like it was trying to smile and scream at the same time. It stopped behind the couch and just stood there. Watching.

And then — I swear to God — the image on the TV slowly panned, like the camera was turning.

Until it was pointing directly at where I was standing.

And I saw myself on screen.

But it wasn’t… quite me.

It looked like me, yeah, but the mouth was just slightly open. No expression. Blank stare. And something about the eyes — they weren’t mine. It was like someone wearing my skin but not knowing how to move it right.

It raised its hand.

And I felt something touch my back.

I screamed. Not proud of it. Just full on panicked and fell backward into my coffee table. The second I hit the ground, the TV cut off.

Just dead black. Like it had never been on at all.

It hasn’t turned on since.

I threw a blanket over it and shoved it in the hall closet. I didn’t even care if the door didn’t close all the way. I just couldn’t look at it anymore.

I’ve been sitting in my kitchen since 4 AM with all the lights on. Haven’t slept.

I keep thinking about the last thing that voice said on the TV back at my grandpa’s:

“Now we are watching you.”

Not “I.” We.

There’s more than one of them. Whatever “they” are.

And they don’t need the TV to see me anymore.",2,1752060544.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

**What is Chain of Thought?** Instead of asking for a final answer, you ask the AI to walk through its reasoning step-by-step. This leads to more accurate, detailed, and useful responses.

**THE MAGIC PHRASE:** Add this to your prompts: *""Let's think through this step by step""* or *""Walk me through your reasoning""*

**REAL EXAMPLES:**

**Basic Prompt:** ""Should I invest in Tesla stock?""

**Chain of Thought Version:** ""Should I invest in Tesla stock? Let's think through this step by step, considering market conditions, company fundamentals, and risk factors.""

**The difference:** Instead of a simple yes/no, you get a structured analysis covering multiple angles.

**ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:**

**1. Numbered Steps:** ""Give me a marketing strategy for my coffee shop. Break this down into 5 numbered steps with reasoning for each.""

**2. Pros/Cons Format:** ""Help me decide between MacBook and ThinkPad. First, list pros and cons for each, then give your recommendation with reasoning.""

**3. Question Laddering:** ""I want to learn Python. Ask me 3 questions about my goals first, then create a personalized learning plan based on my answers.""

**PRO TIP:** This works especially well for:

* Complex decisions
* Technical troubleshooting
* Creative brainstorming
* Learning new concepts

**Try it yourself and share your results below!** What's one decision or problem you could use Chain of Thought prompting for?

[How U.S. buyers of critical minerals bypass China’s export ban | The Asahi Shimbun: Breaking News, Japan News and Analysis](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15894328)

[Pipes coming from a rare earth smelting plant spew polluted water into a vast tailings dam near Xinguang Village, located on the outskirts of the city of Baotou in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in this October 31, 2010, picture. \(REUTERS\)](https://preview.redd.it/byb2zknwptbf1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6b584f35e584db72b6caaba505f51027cc7d37)

BEIJING--Unusually large quantities of antimony - a metal used in batteries, chips and flame retardants - have poured into the United States from Thailand and Mexico since China barred U.S. shipments last year, according to customs and shipping records, which show at least one Chinese-owned company is involved in the trade. China dominates the supply of antimony as well as gallium and germanium, used in telecommunications, semiconductors and military technology. Beijing banned exports of these minerals to the U.S. on December 3 following Washington’s crackdown on China’s chip sector.

The resulting shift in trade flows underscores the scramble for critical minerals and China’s struggle to enforce its curbs as it vies with the U.S. for economic, military and technological supremacy.

Specifically, trade data illustrate a re-routing of U.S. shipments via third countries - an issue Chinese officials have acknowledged.

Three industry experts corroborated that assessment, including two executives at two U.S. companies who told Reuters they had obtained restricted minerals from China in recent months.

The U.S. imported 3,834 metric tons of antimony oxides from Thailand and Mexico between December and April, U.S. customs data show. That was more than almost the previous three years combined. Thailand and Mexico, meanwhile, shot into the top three export markets for Chinese antimony this year, according to Chinese customs data through May. Neither made the top 10 in 2023, the last full year before Beijing restricted exports. Thailand and Mexico each have a single antimony smelter, according to consultancy RFC Ambrian, and the latter’s only reopened in April. Neither country mines meaningful quantities of the metal.

U.S. imports of antimony, gallium and germanium this year are on track to equal or exceed levels before the ban, albeit at higher prices.

Ram Ben Tzion, co-founder and CEO of digital shipment-vetting platform Publican, said that while there was clear evidence of transshipment, trade data didn’t enable the identification of companies involved.

“It’s a pattern that we’re seeing and that pattern is consistent,” he told Reuters. Chinese companies, he added, were “super creative in bypassing regulations.”

China’s Commerce Ministry said in May that unspecified overseas entities had “colluded with domestic lawbreakers” to evade its export restrictions, and that stopping such activity was essential to national security. It didn’t respond to Reuters questions about the shift in trade flows since December.

The U.S. Commerce Department, Thailand’s commerce ministry and Mexico’s economy ministry didn’t respond to similar questions.

U.S. law doesn’t bar American buyers from purchasing Chinese-origin antimony, gallium or germanium. Chinese firms can ship the minerals to countries other than the U.S. if they have a license.

Levi Parker, CEO and founder of U.S.-based Gallant Metals, told Reuters how he obtains about 200 kg of gallium a month from China, without identifying the parties involved due to the potential repercussions.

First, buying agents in China obtain material from producers. Then, a shipping company routes the packages, re-labelled variously as iron, zinc or art supplies, via another Asian country, he said.

The workarounds aren’t perfect, nor cheap, Parker said. He said he would like to import 500 kg regularly, but big shipments risked drawing scrutiny, and Chinese logistics firms were “very careful” because of the potential repercussions.

**BRISK TRADE**

Thai Unipet Industries, a Thailand-based subsidiary of Chinese antimony producer Youngsun Chemicals, has been doing brisk trade with the U.S. in recent months, previously unreported shipping records reviewed by Reuters show. Unipet shipped at least 3,366 tons of antimony products from Thailand to the U.S. between December and May, according to 36 bills of lading recorded by trade platforms Import Yeti and Export Genius. That was around 27 times the volume Unipet shipped in the same period a year earlier.

The records list the cargo, parties involved, and ports of origin and receipt, but not necessarily the origin of the raw material. They don’t indicate specific evidence of transshipment. Thai Unipet couldn’t be reached for comment. When Reuters called a number listed for the company on one of the shipping records, a person who answered said the number didn’t belong to Unipet. Reuters mailed questions to Unipet’s registered address but received no response. Unipet’s parent, Youngsun Chemicals, didn’t respond to questions about the U.S. shipments.

The buyer of Unipet’s U.S. shipments was Texas-based Youngsun & Essen, which before Beijing’s ban imported most of its antimony trioxide from Youngsun Chemicals. Neither Youngsun & Essen nor its president, Jimmy Song, responded to questions about the imports.

China launched a campaign in May against the trans-shipment and smuggling of critical minerals.

Offenders can face fines and bans on future exports. Serious cases can also be treated as smuggling, and result in jail terms of more than five years, James Hsiao, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm White & Case, told Reuters.

The laws apply to Chinese firms even where transactions take place abroad, he said. In cases of transshipment, Chinese authorities can prosecute sellers that fail to conduct sufficient due diligence to determine the end user, Hsiao added.

Yet for anyone willing to take the risk, big profits are available overseas, where shortages have sent prices for gallium, germanium and antimony to records.

The three minerals were already subject to export licensing controls when China banned exports to the U.S. China’s exports of antimony and germanium are still below levels hit before the restrictions, according to Chinese customs data.

Beijing now faces a challenge to ensure its export-control regime has teeth, said Ben Tzion.

“While having all these policies in place, their enforcement is a completely different scenario,” he said.

1lvg5pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1lvg5pj/just_wanted_to_share_an_excerpt_from_a_book/,Just wanted to share an excerpt from a book. - Leaving Las Vegas.,"Firstly, if you haven't heard of Leaving Las Vegas, it is most remembered for being a 1995 film staring Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue. The film is a devastating look about a man who is profoundly alcoholic during the entirety of the film. After finally losing his job in L.A. he rids himself of his possessions and goes to Las Vegas with the mission to drink himself to death. 

The movie is great, but the original 1990 book it's based on by author John O'Brien, himself a lifelong serious alcoholic who committed suicide as the film was being made, I feel is FAR better than the book. I won't post a huge detailed review, but if you have the chance to read it (or like me, prefer audiobooks) I implore you to. 

O'Brien is so fantastic with his language and his devastating look into the mind of a true and hopeless alcoholic. I've relistened to the book so many times and found myself for years and years going, ""yep, spot fucking on..."" --- O'Brien clearly wrote a lot of his real life experiences with alcoholism into the book, but this one excerpt gets to me a lot and I just wanted to share it... 

This scene takes place just after our main character has yet another booze soaked night and wakes up with next to no memory of the night before on his kitchen floor the next morning. 

\----------------

The perpetual cloud of alcohol wears momentarily thin, or perhaps it is just his survival instinct beating through. Either way, before leaving for the nearby bar he is struck with the realization that he hasn’t eaten for quite some time—hasn’t eaten substantially for even longer. Though he is not hungry, and though the very thought of solid food brings a clear and present rush of nausea to his gut, he knows that he must make a go of it, must try to eat something. If for no better reason than to extend his drinking base, to sustain the heart that pumps the blood that carries the alcohol to his brain, he seeks out nutrition.

The refrigerator abruptly clicks off its motor as he opens the door and, now awake after a long nap, yawns a breathy white mist in his face. Ben scans its interior for his options. In disuse it has remained neat and clean. Not one to let things spoil, other things, he has kept the fridge free from mouldy cheese and rotten milk. Free from the usual assortment of unitdentified dying objects usually found in the overstock refrigerators of happy, healthy, families. It contains only a partial chocolate bar, a baked but not eaten potato, which he throws in the garbage, a tub of margarine filled with water which he returns to the freezer, several bottles of gone flat mixers and sodas, a small bag of coffee and a green pepper purchased last week, now in the final stages of edibility. Inclined to something green, he selects the pepper and taking a gulp of vodka for courage, slices it into quarters. 

Discarding the shrivelled sections of the vegetable, he is left with two cavernous sections, they rest alone in the center of his plate. The sweat beads on his forehead as he bites half of one of the pieces and chews. He swallows the small pulpy quantity and waits while watching for distraction a high mileage very beat cat run across the street. A protest begins in his outraged stomach. Reflexively he pushes away from the table and bends slightly forward. Determined not to surrender this little bit of hard won food, he stiffens in his chair and slowly blows air out of his mouth. A trick successfully used by him in the past to fight nausea in public. 

Painfully, white faced in his kitchen chair, he fights the good fight and manages to keep the bite of green pepper down until the crisis passes. Then hopeful, renewed, proud of his victory and rather sated, he tosses out the remaining food and jaunts out the door....

Every day, immediately folllowing my workout, I have a balanced breakfast with protein and fiber and all that. I’ll wait 30 minutes or so to have a coffee after that.

On the lifting days, this works great and I feel great all day. On the yoga days, usually an hour or two after my workout, I get super angry and irritable. I find myself snapping at people at work, and having a really short fuse. I know I’m not hangry — I don’t feel hungry and easily make it to lunch.

Why is this happening, and why just on the yoga days and not the lifting days? Anything I can try to prevent it? I can’t shift yoga to evenings, and also I’d really like to keep doing it, I enjoy the flexibility and core benefits. Thank you for any advice!",7,1752059450.0,xxfitness,8,0.89,False

The only changes are that now he’s home for the summer and we’ve taken away his tablet completely cold turkey. 

He’s never been easy. He’s definitely a tough kid but he’s never been mean. Now, hes demanding things, growling at us when he doesn’t get his way, telling us that we’re bad and mean, saying he doesn’t love us, throwing things, and yesterday he even screamed at the top of his lungs when he received a consequence for being rude.

I ordered him to pick them all up and he did. As a consequence he didn’t get his juice. He didn’t tantrum, but he grumbled how I wasn’t nice and he didn’t love me anymore.

My to-do list was basically a guilt trip in bullet points. Then I stumbled across **time blocking.** Not just some productivity hack, but a total mindset shift. I started mapping out my day in focused chunks, and suddenly I wasn’t multitasking or guessing what to do next. I was *actually doing the things.*

**What’s time blocking?**  
Instead of vague goals like “study later,” you reserve *actual* hours for *specific* tasks. Think Google‑calendar‑Tetris:

* 8 – 9 AM → calculus problem set
* 9 – 9 : 15 AM → stretch + coffee
* 2 – 3 PM → review notes
* 6 – 6 : 30 PM → shower + “I exist away from my desk” break

Why it slaps:

1. **Built‑in deep‑work mode** – Your brain learns “oh, it’s 8 AM, time to focus,” so you waste zero willpower deciding what to do.
2. **Regulates dopamine** – Structured routines keep that motivation chemical on a steady drip instead of crash‑and‑burn spikes (there’s legit research on this).
3. **Kills decision fatigue** – Fewer tiny choices = more mental juice for stuff that matters.
4. **Flex‑friendly** – Blocks aren’t a prison; if life happens, drag‑and‑drop to tomorrow. Clarity > perfection.

**Quick‑start**:

* Pick tomorrow’s *top 3* priorities.
* Give each one a fixed, realistic slot.
* Schedule breaks, meals, even the shower. (If it’s not on the calendar, it’ll get skipped.)
* Run the plan, tweak the lengths next day, repeat.",1,1752058863.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False
1lvfv5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/7Brew/comments/1lvfv5s/tips_for_the_bogojackpot_hour_from_a_brewista/,tips for the Bogo/jackpot hour from a brewista,"I think we all saw how crazy this last BOGO was. A lot of the lines were out to the street, kind of crazy. At my stand, we have a super big parking lot with the other businesses near us, and even wrapping around other businesses and weaving throughoutthe parking lot, our line was still out into the street. But what we can learn is to make Bogo smoother so everyone can get to enjoy the ducks and the promo.

1. Please don't do separate orders. 

When we started this last BOGO, I was outside texting, and I felt like I was taking forever for each car because of the number of separate orders I had to do, which, yes, takes more time. For my stand, the texters during BOGO take your order, take your payment, put a sticky note with your order number, and we give you the ducks. With having separate orders, I had to do all of this twice, and for a couple of cars, I had to do it 3 times! Also, by separate orders, I mean using separate phone numbers. I don't think a lot of people know you can have everything on the same order but just split the payments. It's a lot easier to do it this way and saves tons of time. 

2. Know how it works.

For this time around, we had a lot of new people at the BOGO, and a lot of people didn't know how it works. which I can understand since we only do the BOGO once a month. So BOGO means buy one get one free. So you have to buy a drink, any size, any drink, and then you can get another one free. A lot of people didn't realize that this is what BOGO meant, and I had to explain how it worked since a couple of people wanted to buy 1 drink or an odd number of drinks for the BOGO to work, but it just doesn't work that way. 

3. Please move forward.

Please, if there is a space in front of you while I'm taking your order, trust me, I can see it, and yes, I need you to move up all the way. Don't worry; if you get to the front faster than me, I will run to catch up. 🫡 

4. Have an idea of drinks you want.

With this I don't mean you need to know exactly what you want. Maybe just know if you want a coffee or something fruity. Just something like that so it's easier for me to give you some suggestions. Also know what flavors you like, since a lot of times I ask, and it takes a while for someone to tell me what flavors they like. For example, if you want a coffee, think of flavors like caramel, hazelnut, vanilla, and toasted marshmallow, and for something more fruity, we have tons of options, so just name a couple of fruits. Also be open to suggestions if you don't know what you want. 

5. We don't have control over everything please don't take it out on me.

No, I cannot make more ducks pop up out of nowhere. I'm all out ☹️. I can't control how loud the music is. There was a really mean guy during the BOGO, but the music was being controlled by the manager, not me. I don't control when we end, Bogo. Again, the manager decided who was the last one and put a sticky note and some of our cones on the last people to receive BOGO. After that, we weren't allowed to give you the BOGO. 

all that being said just remember to be mindful of those behind you so that they can also receive the fun from BOGO. I can't speak about all stands I can mainly speak about my stand/stands within our franchise. also if u have any questions I will try and answer them and I can update this post with with q&a",2,1752058859.0,7Brew,0,0.75,False

Hey everyone, I (39M) know there are many similar topics but just putting this out there — I’m looking to make a few new friends in Dubai, ideally women. While I was in Amsterdam, I had some really great female friendships and I’ve come to realize how much I miss that here. All my friends here are male and it is just different what things you can discuss or do with a straight male friend vs female one. There are just some conversations, perspectives, and even hobbies that I’ve found I can only really share with female friends — and it would be nice to have that kind of friendship again. I tend to get along best with open-minded, down-to-earth people, and usually click more easily with Western backgrounds, but I’m open.



Not looking for anything specific — just genuine connection. Coffee, a good conversation, whatever hobbies or activities develop from that.



Feel free to DM if this is of an interest.

1lvfs76,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lvfs76,Watercolour Books,"I enjoy painting with watercolour, but I suck at drawing, so I've been hunting for colouring books that have paper thick enough to handle the water. For those who don't know, typically watercolour paper would be 300 gsm (140 lb) weight. 

Even the halfway-decent paper would also typically be 100% cotton, and lightly textured (hot press) or more heavily textured (cold press). There's some other things to consider, but for the sake of simplicity I'll leave it at that.

Anyway I found this brand Mindful Palette on Amazon (Canada), and it's been responding really well to the watercolour. The picture with the coffee is a mix of Winsor & Newton Pro watercolour, and Castle Arts watercolour pencils. The food/kitchen picture is entirely Castle Arts watercolour pencils.

I took a picture of the back of the food/kitchen page to show there was almost no warping, and 0 bleed-through. 

I was very generous with my water use. A couple of times I had some pilling, but only when I really overworked it, or when I tried too hard to correct some painting outside of the lines 😂

The paper is definitely not 100% cotton, and it doesn't have a noticeable texture. I'd compare it to a heavy-weight mixed media paper with a smooth surface. Still works great for watercolour, and the water doesn't seem to puddle on the surface any more than it does on watercolour paper.

I found one other watercolour painting book called ""Splash of Color"", but I personally hate the drawings in it with a passion, so I'm not sure how much use it'll get lol. But it's printed on actual watercolour paper.

Anyway just thought I'd share my find, for any others that might be looking for the same thing ❤️",5,1752058585.0,AdultColoring,1,1.0,False

Only in his own mind does Ryan Walters think he has the power to override the law. And let's be honest ― this latest stunt? It'll probably end in yet another lawsuit.

Backup Copy:

Let's just take a look at where we're at with Ryan Walters.

It's starting to feel like the funny papers from when I was a kid. You'd open them up to see what kind of mess Dennis the Menace got into that day. Only difference is ― I liked the funny papers. This? I'm getting tired of it.

Seems like every time you turn on the news, there he is again ― Ryan Walters making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The nonstop drama. The political stunts. The ego. His need to be front and center. None of it is helping our schools, our teachers or our kids.

People are fed up
------

And I'm just an ordinary guy. I talk to the construction crews, oil field hands, wind turbine guys south of Seiling. I chat with moms and grandmas at the grocery store, retired teachers at the coffee shop, business owners, old ranchers, folks at City Hall. Doesn't matter where I am ― the message is the same: People are fed up.

They're tired of seeing Walters in the news while classrooms go underfunded and teachers are expected to do more with less. They're tired of watching lawsuit after lawsuit pile up on his watch ― and footing the bill for it.

Just recently, a judge ordered the state to pay another $170,000 in legal fees because of Walters. That's on top of the $300,000+ we've already spent defending his antics. Over $400,000 down the drain ― money that should be in classrooms, not courtrooms.

Here we go again
------

And now, here we go again. He's pushing a brand-new unfunded mandate ― trying to slash administrator pay and meddle with school breakfast and lunch programs. But the Legislature already addressed administrative pay. It's in statute. This isn't his call to make.

Only in his own mind does Ryan Walters think he has the power to override the law. And let's be honest ― this latest stunt? It'll probably end in yet another lawsuit, paid for once again by ― you guessed it ― Oklahoma taxpayers like you and me.

Meanwhile, we're still sitting at 49th in education. And now there's talk he wants to run for governor? Heaven help us.

Oklahoma deserves better. We need someone focused on students, not headlines. Someone who stands up for teachers, not court dates.

We've had enough of the circus.

1lvfijc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lvfijc/the_criminology_thesis_that_disrupted_my_close/,The criminology thesis that disrupted my close friend.,"Hi everyone ! I have a friend in college that studied criminology in Athens. Let’s call him A.


Some years ago a friend of the group was asked by their college to make a thesis on a real missing person case that was never resolved and try figure out faults in the investigation and make a report out of it. (The college was also in cooperation with our neighbouring police stations in order to help the students. )

A had been working in order to find something to work on that was challenging. His close friend from college lets call him B  had an older sister that went missing around 1980-1985 but the case was closed due to no find of the body or any evidence that proved someone took her.After months the case was closed and the girl was still missing he didn’t remember her at all and there was a rule in his house that her name wasn’t to be mention due to his mother heartache. A and B discussed that it would be easier to use this case cause he had the means as family to get the records as an adult without his mothers intervention. Apparently this whole incident was something that made him wanna join criminology in order to try to find his older sister  and give closure to the family. My friend agreed and thus started their journey. 

After 1 month of painful paperwork filling (thank Greece for that) they managed to get the files and start working on the case. According to it the girl was 4 years old and playing in the mountain close to their cottage and her mother was getting pictures of her. The mother started going back at the house for dinner and called her little girl who began trailing behind her. Halfway through the route the mom discovers that the child is missing. After the investigation the only thing found was a red shoe with bloodstains and a pink ribbon near a tree along the route back to the cottage. Countless nights of searching of the police in nearby mountains and cliffs but nothing was found. No body, no foot trails just like she vanished from thin air. The cottage was left abandoned due to the heartache and things were left hanging before it closed as unresolved.

The first couple days were rough reading through files, testimonies of close neighbours , gathering pictures and sorting them (pre incident (mom’s archive photos of the girl) and after incident (police photos of the scene and trail).

Around the week mark while processing the files they find a picture that showed the little girl with her blue dress smiling at the camera close to the tree the shoe was found . While comparing the two photos (the girl and the shoe after search) they find a place in the tree that looks different in the two photos and decide to try developing the photo digitally in their college lab the next day. B closes the file tacks it under his armpit and leaves for the night. The same night while A was sleeping he begins to hear a little girl voice calling “help me” while banging his apartment door. He wokes up in a daze and hears the door banging . He hurried to the door but from the piphole he sees nothing . Just the pitch black of the apartment staircase. he starts yelling through the door if someone is there but nothing. He opens the door, flicks the light and climbs up and down the staircase but still nothing. He blames it on the thesis cause it was pure exhaustion and the trill of finding something new and calls it a night. 

The next day A and B take coffee and meet in the college lab. A tells B about the incident but B just said that probably was the exhaustion of the week due to the case. While they upload the photo and try zooming in and adjusting the explosion they see a  dark siluete of something from inside the tree. In a daze they search through the paper trail but they find no mention of the silhouette  and after some consideration they say that they will call the cops that handled the case and see if they can remember something . They take the new evidence and talk to the college and with the help of their teacher they fill papers to ask from the police to open the case in search of a better picture of the silouete or who it belongs to. Two weeks pass while trying to set up a meeting  with the first responder cop and they begin to travel to the cottage where they clean it in order to spent the night. (The village is in a rular area and mostly abandoned with people only visiting for the summer. The cops handle multiple villages) They leave their bags and meet in a nearby coffe shop with the cop.

When B opens the file and the cop picks at the girl he asked if this was the case they were working on and the team says yes due to him being B’s older sister. He is visibly shaken and tells them to leave the case cause it’s old and they probably wont find something while quoting that some things are better left as they are. B gets irritated and asks what that is exactly supposed to mean. The cop sais again to drop it and go back home and leaves in a hurry claiming family emergency.They try reaching him again but nothing.

They find a coworker of the first cop they tried to talk too and he agrees to meet them. While they were talking the second cop also tells them to drop it the silouete probably is just something messing with the original photo due to the old age of the evidence and the case will probably remain closed. The cop ends by confining to them that the coworker that they first met was the first in search parties of the little girl. It was his first real case and after the closing of the case  he asked to be transferred to another village with no apparent reasons. His mentality and health was fragile due to age and to pay no attention in his behaviour cause he is old.

They leave it at that and decide to go get some pictures of the trail for their thesis in the afternoon. They arrive with the camera a little before dawn and decide to take pictures. They trail to the tree the shoe was found and fix the camera while holding the original photo beside to take the perfect shot . When they align it they take a shot of A standing before the tree and when they see the picture in the camera they go pale . Right beside A in the spot he was standing they see the same red show with blood in it and behind him is the tree fully decorated with little pink bows like a Christmas tree. Their eyes snap to the tree but everything seems perfectly normal. When they put the picture and the tree side by side they see nothing but they realise that the mountain is eerie quiet. No sound is coming from anywhere and their neck hair prickles and feel that something is terribly wrong. Suddenly a little girl rough voice echoes behind the tree in a whisper. “Heeeeelp”, “Over here! Help me!” The sound was really difficult to pick and they hear the leaves crunching all around them like people are walking on them .  In a panic they run back to the car where they drop the camera by accident and floor it.

On the way back my friend is terrified  and B tells him to spent the night at his cottage. While they are preparing to sleep their professor calls and tells them that the police won’t open the case, they labeled the new evidence unfit due to the age of the archive and that this is the final opinion and the case shall remain closed.

They decide that tomorrow they will go again to take the camera back and return to end the thesis with the case still unsolved and burry the whole thing. They go to their rooms and fall asleep. My friend then has a dream, he sees the little girl in the corner peeking at him and asking him why did they stop with a sobbing expression. when her first tear falls a black claw emerges from the side of the bed and scratches my friends back trying to grab him . Then the girl shouts and screams “GET AWAY. LEAVE NOW”. My friend wakes up drenched in sweats and B comes bursting through the door and tells him to get up and that they are retrieving the camera and going away right now cause something is wrong with the house. In a panic they fetch their bags and get in the car to go and retrieve the camera. While they approach they see the camera glistening in the night, everything seems normal and they park ride beside it. when my friend opens the door to get it his sees in front of his eyes a trail from the camera to the tree with pink bows and red shoes left and right and the little girl standing at the foot of the tree glaring at them with hatred. My friend asks B terrified if he sees the same thing and he just murmurs yes come inside quickly. They grab the camera in a panic and floor it back home. 

A little before they arrive and with their panic slowly fading my friend asked B why he came in the middle on the night and woke him and if it was because he was having a nightmare and woke him. B said he also saw a dream where the girl was grabbing him and trying to get him out of the house when in a demonic voice asked him to get out before it’s too late. He woke up and something in his gut was screaming from him to get out. Which is what he did. My friend tells him he also had a dream but in his something had actually scratched him in his sleep. B asked where and my friend lifted his shirt to point the place when they both saw claw marks on the exact same spot and blood dripping. Something they hadn’t notice due to the rush and the black T-shirt he was wearing. He drove him to the hospital and my friend got stitches due to the incident . 

The case was marked closed after that and they didn’t dare to bring it up again. The camera was shattered due to the panic and when they transferred the photos of the trail the photo with the  bows decorating the tree wasn’t there. The first cop had left the area again and he didn’t pick their calls up again. They closed the thesis and gave back the files to the police. Afterwards everything was normal again except of course of the scar in my friends back. Everytime I see it I am transferred back to this story . We went for a swim today and while looking at him I asked if I could share the story here with yall since it fit the theme. 

Thanks for reading his story ❤️

  ""Tell me again how much you paid for that paring knife.""  
  
  Stephanie frowned at her mother. ""It's not a pairing knife. It's no knife used to just peel a peach. This knife is designed especially for the firedrop.""  
  
  Lauren laughed at her daughter. ""Well, I suppose saying it's for slicing firedrop justifies the expense. Suppose I'll have to trust you. I still can't understand all the rage about that alien weed. They tell me that firedrop doesn't even have any taste. Maybe I'm too old to understand why everyone is so obsessed to put something on their plate that doesn't have a single calorie and no nutritional value. Why not just crowd our plates with tissue paper?""  
  
  Stephanie did not turn her attention from the window over the kitchen sink that afforded a view of her home's drive. Looking back at her mother would only encourage Lauren to continue arguing.  
  
  ""It's not meant to be sustenance,"" Stephanie grumbled.  
  
  ""Is it just the way it glows, Steph? Is that it?""  
  
  ""There's more to it than that.""  
  
  Lauren scoffed. ""Still seems like a terrible waste of money to me. Money wasn't so easy to come by when your father and I raised you. It was harder then, when people still carried cash and coin instead of all the plastic cards. I wonder sometimes if you realize the real cost of things.""  
  
  Stephanie reminded herself that her mother only cared for her. Stephanie had been an only child, so it was natural for her mother to fret over the silliest of concerns. Looking out of that window above the sink reminded Stephanie that a woman could not control everything. It was her mother's problem if she wanted to take all her anxiety out on the firedrop.  
  
  Stephanie believed she had a very good idea of the firedrop's expense. Nothing in the preparation, presentation or consumption of firedrop was affordable. She understood that it must have been difficult to harvest that glowing growth some thirty or more light years from Earth. She knew enough to realize that none of the starships, the equipment and the men required to harvest were free. And Stephanie remembered where she came from, recalled how hard her mother and father had toiled to fill her plate, to provide a shelter over her head, to lift her above the pubic school in favor of a private academy. Stephanie rose from a proud and simple family. Of course her mother would struggle to understand the allure, the implication, delivered upon a plate well-garnished with the firedrop.  
  
  But didn't Stephanie and her husband Paul deserve to indulge in the firedrop? Had they not earned the opportunity to decorate their plates with the glowing, pulsating crimson and gold delicacy? Had they not scrimped and saved? Had they not been disciplined with their finances? Had they not sacrificed? They both held firm to their demanding jobs. They had not taken vacations. They had burned much midnight oil. For almost twenty years, they had chosen salaries over children. For two decades they had given so a night would come when they would serve the firedrop.  
  
  Stephanie smiled as she waited to see the beams from Paul's automobile headlights turn into their drive. Could her mother not understand how to deny the firedrop now, after having given so much for it, would make a mockery of all of her and Paul's efforts?  
  
  ""How many did you say are coming to your dinner party?"" Lauren shifted at the table, twirling a spoon in a mug of coffee.  
  
  ""There'll be five of us, counting Paul and I.""  
  
  Lauren raised an eyebrow. ""Doesn't seem like a lot of people. Seeing how much you two gave up for it.""  
  
  ""Are you saying you feel left out?""  
  
  Lauren shrugged. ""A mother only wants to feel a part of the family. And there's not much family left after your father's passing. Not like there's going to be any more.""  
  
  Stephanie sighed. She refused to allow her mother cloud the day she finally realized the firedrop.  
  
  ""You just old me that you didn't understand any of the excitement concerning the firedrop. You just told me you didn't care for it at all.""  
  
  ""I only want to understand this thing that has so shaped my daughter.""  
  
  Stephanie knew of no one as adept at wielding cutting guilt as her mother. Stephanie had been raised surrounded by that guilt, surrounded by her mother's hunger for pity. Stephanie had hardened her heart against whatever guilt Lauren pulsed from the kitchen table.  
  
  ""We won't have enough firedrop for you,"" Stephanie turned and stared into her mother's eyes, ""but I'll set a place for you at the table. You'll be able to see the firedrop glow. Maybe then you'll start to understand what it's all about.""  
  
  Lauren said nothing in response. She sipped from her coffee, and Stephanie knew that for the moment her mother had been satisfied.  
  
  ""What's taking Paul so long?"" Stephanie turned back to the window. ""Perhaps I shouldn't have made him purchase a new, self-piloting vehicle last summer. The old roadways are so much less congested compared to the automatic superhighways. I hope he's not stuck in traffic, with the firedrop wilting in some plastic sack. I hope nothing's gone wrong.""  
  
  Paul's headlights finally appeared several hours laters, leaving Stephanie ample time to clean and dry the best china and plates, to polish the silverwar  
e, to fold napkins into origami, white swans.  
  
  Paul stomped from the garage into the mudroom. Stephanie wanted to rush to him, to grab him and demand to look upon the firedrop. But fear held her back. She had heard her husband slam the car door, stomp into the home, throw his coat upon the ground. What did it mean if he returned in a sour mood? What if he had failed to bring the firedrop home?  
  
  Paul burst into the kitchen, a smile stretching one ear to the next.  
  
  ""I have it! I have it!""  
  
  Stephanie jumped into his arms. She planted kisses on his cheeks. Her head fell upon his shoulders and she sobbed.  
  
  ""Careful, Steph."" Paul grunted and squirmed. ""The firedrop's in this cardboard box. Don't smash it.""  
  
  Stephanie gasped and jumped away from her husband. ""Oh, I'm so sorry.""  
  
  Lauren chuckled. ""Wouldn't that be something. That firedrop traveling all this way and getting smashed in this small kitchen at the end of its journey.""  
  
  ""The box is fine,"" Paul smiled stiffly at his mother-in-law. ""I had no idea how long it would take to get hold of the firedrop today. I was at the tent market on the outskirts of the spaceport before dawn this morning, and there was already lines snaking around the streets. Watching those capsules dropped from the starships burn their way back down through the atmosphere like comets was really something. Everyone cheered as they landed, and the lines went wild. I know, we've all seen those landings a hundred times before on television, but all those plumes were just amazing in person.""  
  
  Lauren's face paled. ""You've all gone mad. What would happen to those tents, to all those people, if one of those capsules exploded? It's happened more than once. Why, the entire market would vanish in flames. Think of all the fuel stored in those spaceports. I tremble to imagine the mushroom cloud.""  
  
  Paul only stared, dumbfounded, a moment at Lauren before shaking his head.  
  
  ""Everyone jostled in that line the moment the first capsule touched down, Steph. You just can't be afraid to elbow and kick if you want to defend your place in the line. They had armed security teeming all over the place to let us know they meant business. It took them hours to unload the firedrop from the capsules, and that line was restless as it waited until afternoon to start inching forward. But I stayed with it. I didn't let anyone shove me a single step back in that line. We've worked too hard for it. Saved too much. I wish I'd remember to bring a camera so you could've seen a picture of all that firedrop sparkling in those piles by the time the line moved me beneath those market tents. It was like it was Christmas, and I was a boy, all over again.""  
  
  Lauren frowned. ""I miss those Christmases when you were young, Steph.""  
  
  ""I waited it out Steph,"" Paul pushed ahead. ""I was worried there wouldn't be any firedrop left by the time I reached the vendor. But the vendor had one ready in this box with our name written on the side. Our name's never looked so good in ink. I didn't dare drive a mile over the speed limit all the way back home. I didn't want to get pulled over on this of all nights. I have it, Steph. Our dinner party is going to be incredible.""  
  
  Stephanie wrung her hands. ""Have you looked at it?""  
  
  ""I resisted,"" Paul grinned. ""The seal's still on the box.""  
  
  ""Let's look at it. Let's make sure we got a good one, with lots of color and glow.""  
  
  Paul nodded. ""But only for a moment, Steph. Then we'll get it in the refrigerator like they say you should to make sure it keeps its sparkle. It'll be incredible tomorrow night.""  
  
  Stephanie beamed. ""It will be wonderful.""  
  
  Paul carefully broke the cardboard box's seal. With shaking hands, he opened the box and a glow of crimson light flooded into the room, accented by shimmering, golden pulses that winked and reflected off the kitchen windows and off the appliances' chrome. Paul and Stephanie felt their feet float from the ground.  
  
  Lauren could not deny her curiosity when she looked at the joy spreading across Paul and Stephanie's faces. She walked to the edge of the box and whistled.  
  
  ""I""ll be damned,"" and Lauren returned her attention to her cooling coffee.

  
Chapter 2 – Invisible Death...  
  
  ""Will we get to see any of it after the Carmack returns? Do we get to see any of the glowing firedrop, or does the Carmack's crew just place it all straight into storage?""  
  
  Sissy Carpenter chuckled at Sal. It was only Sal's third hop out of Earth's star system, and everyone remained very green around the ears during their third hop. Sissy could not fault Sal. He was only a rookie, and as such, he had not had the opportunity to gaze at the glowing firedrop before the captain sealed the cargo doors closed. She found Sal's fascination with the firedrop charming, reminding her of what she took for granted, of what she had first felt many star hops ago when she first scratched her name on a starship freighter's roster.  
  
  ""Don't be in such a hurry, Sal,"" Sissy winked and brushed strands of the red-dyed hair that marked her as one of the ship's harvesters out of her face. ""The firedrop will lose some its charm, even in your eyes, once you start seeing it all the time. Don't be in such a rush to destroy the early mystery.""  
  
  Sal shook his head. ""Seems like I've come too far not to at least get a peek at it. Seems I've risked a lot.""  
  
  ""In time, Sal. In time.""  
  
  Sal sighed. It was hard to fight with Sissy's green eyes and her flaming, red hair. Captain Darringer had been wiser than Sal could have guessed when he had assigned Sissy to mentor the rookie Sal.  
  
  ""Well, I thought I was joining the roster for something more than cleaning and organizing gear. I didn't have to jump light-years through space to do that.""  
  
  Sissy disarmed Sal with a smile. ""Before you know it, you'll be wishing that polishing space helmets was all you had to worry about.""  
  
  Sal argued no further as he drifted beside Sissy through the hallway's zero gravity towards the captain's observation deck. He remained green in the life of star hopping, and his bones had not yet acclimated to the sensation of free-floating through a ship's halls. He had not yet looked upon the freshly-harvested firedrop with his own eyes, and so Sal had not yet decided if he would choose to cement his career among the stars, until his skeleton weakened so that Earth's native gravity would feel as crushing upon him as it did to the veterans of their freighter's crew. Sal drifted too quickly towards the observation deck; and as Sissy giggled, Sal bumped into Roy Henderson at the deck's entrance, who then bumped into Gary Beumont, who then careened into Erin Madcap, who was, for an instant distracted from the vital numbers scrolling along her digitized notebook.  
  
  ""Mind yourself, Sal Maddox,"" Captain Darringer did not look behind his shoulder upon Sal as the more veteran crew members quickly returned to their positions. ""Find a space in the rear and try not to jostle.""  
  
  Though Sal would have usually faced a sterner scolding for his clumsiness, those in the observation deck offered him no criticism or consideration. Business demanded everyone's attention as a giant gas planet loomed just beyond the observation deck's glass.  
  
  Glazkov IV stretched across deck's view, its bands of blues, greens and beiges swirling together like thick clouds of paint. The sight of that silent planet beyond the glass still stole Sal's breath. None of the videos the star freighters carried back to Earth and none of the high-resolution photographs the tent vendors sold in the firedrop markets conveyed the quiet majesty, the crushing power that coalesced into the gas giant Glazkov IV.  
  
  It was the largest planet to which mankind had ever traveled. Glazkov IV dwarfed mighty Jupiter. He was no physicist, no star cartographer, but Sal imagined the mighty gas giant, if magically teleported into his native solar system, would've swallowed and crushed all rival planets. He was only a common, green rookie on his third hop to harvest the firedrop, and Sal did not understand the science behind the electrical storms that flashed all across Glazkov IV. Long bolts of cracking, white and silver electricity exploded from the planet's clouds, clenching outward towards the stars like broken fingers filled with terrible charge. The observation deck's lights flickered when the swirling electrical storms jettisoned the largest plumes of alien lightning. Glazkov IV was immense, and it was alive, demanding the crew of Captain Darringer's star freighter named Klondike to remember that they were all interlopers in that giant planet's gravitational court.  
  
  And Sal had never witnessed anything like the electrical storm Glazkov IV currently flashed beyond the deck's glass. All the dark space surrounding the planet seemed charged with power. Even the stars appeared to recede from the heavens and bow before the fury sparking from the planet's atmosphere. Sal was thunderstruck. How did any woman or man ever dream to get close enough to Glazkov IV to discover the small moon which orbited the giant, that small moon upon which had been discovered the firedrop.  
  
  ""Try raising the Carmack again,"" Captain Darringer turned to face a woman floating slightly above him to his left. ""The discharges appear to have calmed a bit. Maybe now we can get a signal through to our harvester.""  
  
  The woman's fingers flashed over her notebook, and the deck's speakers hummed to life.  
  
  ""Klondike to Carmack. What is your status?""  
  
  None in the deck made a noise while they waited for a reply. The passing minutes felt like hours.  
  
  ""What's the Carmack's estimated position?"" Captain Darringer asked a man floating a little below him to his right. ""Give me as precise a guess as you can based on the harvester's last known position before the electrical storm blinded us.""  
  
  ""Sixty-two parsecs from drop,"" the man quickly replied.  
  
  ""Last known velocity?""  
  
  ""One-quarter parsecs per second.""  
  
  ""Keep trying to raise them through all that static,"" sighed the captain. ""They're beyond the drop now if they weren't able to slow and execute the landing. We can't know what that storm flashing outside has done to their systems. Their window is closing. That giant swirling on the other side of the glass is going to embrace them soon if he's not already done so.""  
  
  Sal peered at Glazkov IV beyond the glass. He could read nothing amid the flashing electricity.  
  
  ""What's going on?"" Sal gently touched Sissy's shoulder so as not to send her tumbling through the zero gravity.  
  
  Perhaps the light show of Glazkov IV simply overwhelmed the sparkle, but much of the life appeared to have vanished from Sissy's green eyes.  
  
  ""None of us have ever seen this kind of electrical storm around Glazkov, Sal. It's playing havoc on all of our systems. We've not heard from the Carmack for over an hour since we first lost contact when the harvester drifted through a jettisoned electric arc. If the Carmack's lost navigation, it wouldn't be able to slow down enough for the drop. And if its trajectory missed the landing, then Glazkov is going to claim the harvester with its gravity.""  
  
  ""What will happen to the crew?""  
  
  ""They'll be crushed.""  
  
  Sal looked again at the hulking planet looming beyond the observation deck. Everyone remained silent so that the captain could listen to the quiet clock ticking in his mind. Somewhere between their freighter, the Klondike, and Glazkov IV awaited that small moon that had summoned them to that quadrant among the stars. The moon didn't even have a proper name. All the star charts simply called it AU803, and Sal wondered what happenstance tempted the first explorer to dare the giant planet's gravity to navigate closely enough to that small moon to discover the glowing firedrop. Glazkov IV turned the moon invisible, but Sal knew the moon was out there, and he prayed the crew of the Carmack had found it.  
  
  Sal wondered what Captain Darringer saw in the arcs of lightning erupting from the planet. Did all those blues, green and beiges give the captain some kind of clue concerning the fate of the lost harvester? It was only his third hop between the stars, but it was time enough for Sal to learn that space travel was nothing like it had seemed in the movies he worshipped as a boy. Explosions did not blossom in the cold vacuum. Only silence existed outside of that thin shell of ship that separate Sal and his crew mates from the void's lethal touch.  
  
  Captain Darringer faced his navigator who floated slightly above him to his left.  
  
  ""Time?""  
  
  ""One hour, seventeen min  
utes and twenty-three seconds since we lost contact.""  
  
  ""The Carmack is either on AU803 or it is not,"" the captain replied. ""No way of knowing for as long as all that static keeps popping. I'm not inclined to believe that Glazkov's light show is going to stop any time soon. Gather a secondary harvesting crew, Miss Carpenter. We drop the second harvester within the hour.""  
  
  The navigator looked up from the numbers scrolling across her digital notebook's display. ""Do we have the time for a second drop? The anomaly back to home is scheduled to arrive in a little under five hours. Does that leave us enough time to fill the second harvester with enough firedrop to make it worthwhile? And what if the second harvester experiences the same type of static?""  
  
  ""There's time enough,"" nodded the captain. ""We can wait for another freighter to hop into system if we must. We can float around Glazkov IV for a long time without the luxury systems powered if we have to wait for a second freighter to schedule a new anomaly for us when that crew returns home. That will salvage our harvest, however it cuts into our earnings. And the Carmack may already be on the moon filling their hold with firedrop. We're not going to know for sure one way or another until we set some boots onto AU803.""  
  
  The navigator raised an eyebrow. ""And what if we fail to reach anyone through all that static? What if they're already lost?""  
  
  A fire smoldered in the captain's eyes. ""Save any other further objections and questions for the record, Navigator Garnett. The second harvester launches within the hour.""  
  
  Navigator Garnett responded with only the slightest nod. None in the observation deck betrayed emotion. The captain had spoken, and his crew pushed off from the walls to float through zero gravity to whatever duties awaited them. Much remained to be done before the second harvester could drop towards AU803. Everyone aboard the Klondike knew the risk involved in the harvesting of the firedrop. They all knew the danger when they arrived at the spaceport and penned their names into the Klondike's roster. They had all accepted the jeopardy for the lucrative salary. They had accepted the danger so that their eyes might look upon the freshly-harvested firedrop, so that they might see the fresh firedrop glow in a splendor unfaded following the transit to the vendors' tents.  
  
  Sissy suddenly punched Sal's shoulder. The playful blow struck Sal unprepared and squeezed his face against the observation deck's glass. Glazkov IV had never looked so massive in Sal's vision.  
  
  ""Smile,"" Sissy pulled Sal's face away from the glass, ""you've just been chosen to serve aboard the Skookum.""  
  
  Sal's face turned several shades whiter. ""The second harvester? Me?""  
  
  Sissy winked. ""Don't look so crossed. It's just want you were asking for. You're about to receive one hell of a jump up the pay-scale. You're going to get to stare upon the firedrop in the field. You're going to look through your own eyes on the splendor of AU803. You won't be a green recruit when you return from that trip. You'll even get to take your own firedrop home once the Klondike returns home with a hold brimming with firedrop.""  
  
  ""Why me? I don't know anything about harvesting firedrop.""  
  
  ""Because according to our ship's protocol concerning the drop of a second harvester, your skills have been deemed among those least vital to the Klondike's operation. You're expendable compared with those who will have to stay behind to see to their ship duties. Lighten up, Sal, there's nothing to harvesting firedrop. You'll be amazed how easy it is.""  
  
  Sal hated himself for ever expressing a sentiment of discontent in Sissy's presence.  
  
  ""I'm no soldier, engineer or medic,"" Sal stammered. ""I'd be useless in an emergency.""  
  
  Sissy chuckled. ""Chances are we'd never have the time to realize when something went wrong.""  
  
  Sal had nothing more to say as Sissy grabbed his forearm and towed him through the ship's bowels to the waiting harvester. He never got over just how quiet space could be.

1lvfe5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cymbalta/comments/1lvfe5s/my_first_week_on_duloxetine_for_fibromyalgia_20f/,My first week on Duloxetine for Fibromyalgia (20f),"I wanted to share my experience with being on Duloxetine for the first week. To hopefully not only validate my own feelings but also others.

TLDR - extreme fatigue, napping during the day. Shit sleep. Pain a bit better

  
So I started Duloxetine on the 1st to help treat my chronic pain from Fibromyalgia (with an added bonus of treating my probably undiagnosed depression of many years too). I started on 30mg, and today I took my first dose of 60mg.

**fatigue**

It was pretty instant that I began to experience EXTREME fatigue. I was tired all day, and started having 2-4 hour naps after midday. I already experience tiredness everyday, but this was something else. My family said I had the 1000 yard stare all day. The past 3 days I have been able to pull all dayers and not take a nap after midday. Though I had a shift yesterday and at around 10 I had to go buy a coffee because I could barely keep my eyes open (I stopped drinking coffee everyday a couple years ago, so this is very unusual for me). But it had gotten better, Im still not back to my normal energy levels, but I can feel them SLOWLY getting there.

**Sleep**

My sleeps have gotten worse. I am not a quiet sleeper, ill toss and turn all night, haven't gotten a solid sleep in MANY years, and this has made it worse. Even when I dont take a nap during the day, I havent gotten a solid sleep since starting. I have taken Magnesium + Ashwagandha tablets to try help this, but they havent helped. Hopefully this will get better.

**Pain**

This star of the show, which I notice about the 6 day mark has slightly improved. I have a dull achiness in both my wrist 24/7, but this has gotten a bit better. I don't feel that achiness 24/7 now. Though my wrists are still VERY quick to get irritated, so the simple things of typing and scratching my ass still hurts.",1,1752057179.0,cymbalta,0,1.0,False

I’m really hoping this can reach someone somewhere. I haven’t been able to contact anyone and this is my last hope at finding someway out of this fucking hell. Bear with me I’m not a great writer and just need to get this out as soon as possible. 


My name is Jay and I’m 22 and made the worst decision of my life to go on my first cross country roadtrip. I’m freshly out of technical school and decided traveling down south to start a new job in a new place seemed like my golden ticket. 


For reference, I’m coming from Indiana to the low south/east of Virginia, so a good portion of my trip is through Appalachia. I’ve always heard the terrifying stories about that place but I’ve never paid it much attention as I don’t really believe in that stuff, so I was pretty excited as it’s the middle of summer and I knew the drive would be beautiful. 


I left on a crisp summer morning with my car packed full of the very few things I own and my cat zombie. I decided to take the longer more scenic root off the highways and main roads as I can get pretty bad highway anxiety and I wanted to see the scenery anyways. 


The first few hours of the trip were pretty great, plenty of cool views and small urban towns packed with old school cars, diners, and such. I spotted this particularly intriguing looking small diner around hour 4 and realized I hadn’t eaten a damn thing all day so I figured it was a great spot to catch a bite, fill the car up and let zombie do his business. I pull in and nothing seemed too off and looked pretty inviting. A big red checkerboard sign hung above the place “pattys roadside diner” that’s neat, I thought. Climbing out and stretching i put zombie on the leash and walk him around a bit then take him inside for us both to eat. 


The waitress was a kind older lady, “hi sweetheart I’m patty what can I get ya?” 
I make my order and sip on my coffee while looking through all the little nicknacks they have strewn across the diner. She returns with my meal and asks “what brings you out this way darlin we usually only get regulars here”. I respond “well I’m moving down south to start a new job and figured I’d take the scenic way, specifically Route 64”. The few others at the diner all go quiet giving me sideways glances. She immediately lost her smile and responds in a low strained tone, “hun I’d suggest you take the main highway up north about 10 miles” and with that left me with my food and my bill. 


Very unsettled I quickly finish, pay my tab, and I’m out of there as quick as I came. 
Surely she only meant it was just a rough road and would maybe take a toll on my car, I drive an old muscle car so steep hills and such can be a nuisance. I take off and head towards route 64 without another thought. 


Winding through the trees with zombie peacefully sleeping in the passenger seat, I’m checking my maps and realize I’m only about 20 minutes from my turn onto route 64. As I’m driving I can’t help but notice the sky getting a bit darker and the trees seeming thicker, it’s only 5pm and it wasn’t supposed to rain today but I know mountain weather can be spontaneous so I’m not too worried about it. 


As my turn gets closer I can tell this road hasn’t had much traffic as the asphalt is cracked and worn with overgrown shoulders and faded lines. Seemed pretty cool looking at the time. Finally I approach my turn, it’s a fork in the road with the opposite way leading back to the main highway and just for a minute I contemplated listening to that waitress and just getting back on the main road, I take a look at my maps and quickly calculate that this route 64 is only 85 miles, I just filled my tank up so I figured even if there’s not a single gas station on this road I have plenty fuel to get across it no problem. It leads back to the main highway anyways and doesn’t have any turn offs so I figure that it would be a piece of cake. 


I make my decision and turn onto route 64, the road sign glaring at me covered in moss and vines. Still again I thought it looked pretty cool as I’m super into post apocalyptic stuff and was honestly hoping to find some cool abandoned houses or small gas stations along the way. This road seemed to be even worse than the one I turned off from as the turns were sharper, asphalt tore up pretty bad, and clearly no one had mowed here in the last couple decades lol. So I decide to take it a little slow going no more than 30-40mph just taking in the scenery.


Only about 10 minutes into this road I lose all cell service, not a huge deal as I know this road has no turn offs and leads right back to the main highway. So I put my phone to sleep and just enjoy the drive. A little while later zombie wakes up and is looking around skittishly which isn’t unusual for him as he doesn’t really like car rides but he had been pretty chill up until this point so I put on some music and just hope he calms down. Roughly an hour passes and everything is going well when I finally see one of those abandoned gas stations I was hoping to come across, so I pull in and hop out to take some cool pictures of my car, stretch, and have a cigarette while I peak around a bit before I get going again. 


It’s around 7pm at this point and it’s a little darker than usual so it was kind of hard to see into the gas station. Taking a look around the gas station it didn’t seem quite as abandoned as I had expected but none the less it still seemed out of service. I decided to mess around with the pumps to see if they happened to still work when i hear a stern “can I help you son?” Absolutely startled out of my mind I whip around to see a middle aged man roughly in his 40’s, clean shaven and wearing a typical farmers get up. “Oh sorry sir, I didn’t realize this place was still open and I just wanted to take a couple pictures before getting back on the road. Do you happen to know how many miles are left till I hit the main highway again? I lost all cell service a while back and just want to figure out how much road I should expect to be left.”


He just stood there and stared at me for what seemed like an hour before saying in a low gravely voice, “you should’ve just taken the main highway in the first place, this is ain’t a part of road you want to be on after dark” I respond “yea I know but it seemed quicker and I wanted to see the scenery”. He says “well that’s your own fault, keep heading up this road for the next 20 miles and you should hit the highway, I’d get going if I were you”. Didn’t have to tell me twice, I thanked him and get ready to pull out when he says “one more thing son, don’t stop anywhere again while you’re on your way, whatever you see, whatever you hear, you just keep driving till you make it back to that highway”. I left without saying a word and needless to say I was pretty freaked out. 


“20 miles” I say to myself, that should only be about 30 minutes max at the rate I’m going so I should be back to the main road well before dark. As I’m driving I’m now constantly checking for cell service but to no avail each time. No location, no calls, messages, or anything. It’s now been about 40 minutes since that stop and surely I should be coming up on the main road, but still the road seems to drag on forever. After another 20-30 minutes or so I start to get pretty worried, it’s getting dark quick and there’s absolutely no sign that there’s a main highway coming up and this road just seems to get more dilapidated as I go along. Now I’m really freaking the fuck out and contemplate if I should just turn around and try to go back the way I came, but that seemed pointless as that would be at least another 2 hours of driving on this road that I’m desperate to get off of at this point and there’s no way the highway can’t be jsut right around the corner. 


Another fucking hour goes by and I swear I’ve seen this part of the road before, my dim yellow headlights are the only thing illuminating my surroundings which jsut makes everything seem more claustrophobic and worse. Still no signal. It’s then I see a dim light through the trees as I’m coming around a corner and I think, thank fucking god the highway. I round the corner and see yet another abandoned looking gas station with one singular street lamp dimly lighting the pumps and small parking lot. 


I slow down as I go by to see if there’s any signs of life and I see what I swear is the same man I talked to earlier standing at the front door of the gas station with his back to the road. I stop just in the middle of the road and call out to him “hey sir! I think I’m lost can you point me back to the main highway?”. Silence. “Sir excuse me I’m just trying t-“ “BOOM” a gun shot rings out and I see the man’s arm fly back as he slumps to the ground. “WHAT THE FUCK” I scream as I slam the gas and get the fuck out of there. At this point I can’t tell if I’m seeing things or if what just happened actually happened. I’m now flying down this road just desperately trying to reach the end. 


It’s midnight now. The last incident was a few hours ago and I seriously can’t comprehend what’s happening right now. I haven’t seen anything for hours and I’m starting to get a little low on gas and I’m absolutely starving. I know I can’t sleep here but I’m starting to fade a little bit behind the wheel. Still no fucking service. I try calling anyone in my contacts but everything goes immediately to voicemail. The maps still show me at the same point when I lost service. This cannot be fucking happening, this physically can’t be happening. As I round yet another corner I find a small service lane and decide to pull over and try to see if I can get any kind of signal. 


I don’t dare turn the car off as it’s my only light source. Stepping out of the car I hear the soft whistling of the wind through the trees and I swear to god I can hear whispers and voices. Too faint to make out but I chop it up to me just being really tired. I walk around a couple feet away from my car and finally get a single bar. I frantically look at my maps and when it updates my location it shows my on a winding road with what seems to be no end or beginning. No matter how far I scroll out it shows nothing but this road. I figure that’s just the service being slow and that it’ll load eventually. When it doesn’t I decide to head back to the car and just get on with it. Surely this road HAS to lead somewhere.


As I open my door I hear a rustling in the bushes, I grab my gun from the center console and against my better judgement yell into the woods “hello?? Is anybody there?! Please! I need some help! I’m lost and just need to find my way back to the highway!” The rustling stops and I figure it must’ve been just an animal or something. As I go to sit down in the car a loud wooden thump to my immediate left just about gives me a heart attack. I whip towards the noise and see laying in the road a small 2x4 of wood. I walk over and pick it up and scrawled into it reads “no way back” I throw it back into the woods as hard as I can and run back to my car peeling out of there, looking in the rear view mirror I see what appears to be a tall skinny figure run out from the trees and cross over to the other side of the road. God damnit I’m losing my fucking mine I need to sleep. 


I decide that the next gas station I find or building of sorts id stop and try to hide the car and rest. I’m not even sure how much time has went by at this point but I come up to yet another gas station that looks strikingly similar to the last, I stop about 50 feet before I even reach the station and look around hesitantly before deciding to pull into the back and park. I lock all my doors and put up some clothes in the windows and try to doze off. 


I started dreaming. I find myself standing in the middle of the woods staring down at a cabin in a little ravine, it seemed so real yet I knew I was dreaming. I looked around frantically and decide the cabin is the best place to go, as I run in to the cabin, standing right behind the door is the first man from the first station. He stands there staring at me with cold eyes moaning softly. I ask him to please help me that I’m lost and really just need some help before he whisper “aren’t we all?” Before taking a gun out and shooting himself in the head. 


I jolt awake in my drivers seat sweating profusely. How long had I been asleep for??? Was it finally daylight?? I look at my phone and it says “9:46am” I rip open the curtains from my windows only to find the same unwelcoming darkness I’ve found myself trapped in for what seems like forever now. I also notice the date on my phone. July 28th. That’s impossible. I left June 15th I’ve only been driving for roughly one full day. It’s at this moment that I notice the murmuring come from somewhere outside. 


Zombie is sat on the dash staring across the parking lot unmoving. I look and see the same man from the gas station and my dream stand at the pumps shaking slightly with his head down. It seemed like he was talking to himself. I thought for a second about asking him again but I decided it was best to just leave. I start the car and as soon as I do he stands straight up in one jerking motion and slowly twists his head upwards at an unnatural angle. He lets out a scream that I can only determine came from the depths of hell itself and i immediately pull out, as i pass him I can see his face more clearly, he’s got a much longer beard and grey hair and his skin seemed to be rotting and moving, i didn’t want to spend another second looking so i just continued and didn’t look back.


As im driving now trying to make sense of what the hell is going on I notice my gas is refilled and the miles I’ve driven have magically vanished from my odometer putting it right back where I was when I started on this road. I just ignore it and keep moving on. I decide again to check, even tho I already know the answer, to see if I have any service. Nope, nothing. As im looking down at my phone I glance up at the road and see a woman frantically waving her arms in the road, I slam on my brakes but still bumped into her a bit, “oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck” I jump out quickly to check on her thinking it couldn’t be too bad as I wasn’t really going that fast to begin with let alone when I hit her. 


I get out and approach her, she’s laying away from me on her side not breathing, I slowly go to turn her over when her arm basically just comes off in my hand, in total shock and horror I trip backwards trying to get away, she turns her head slowly to me. with eyes as black as the night sky her jaw slowly starts to open and starts cracking and tearing apart into 3 separate jaws. A disturbingly distorted “heeeelpppp meeeee!!! HELLPPPP!” Comes screaming out from what seems like everywhere around me. I can’t even manage a scream as I’m frantically trying to get back to my car, as I get to my car door I take a look back to see her skin slowly greying and weighing down, with one final “pleeeeeeease” her body is launched up into the trees followed with the horrific sound of flesh tearing and bones snapping. I wasted no time hauling ass out of there pleading that the highway is just around the corner.

  “Over here, Registrar Ferris! I say! Over here!”  
  
  Calvin Moon poked his fingers into his mouth and whistled above his stunt location’s din of whirling cameras and bustling technicians. The thin, silver-haired man dressed in a Registrar’s customary dark suit, here accentuated by the pink tie that identified that Lester Ferris was the Registrar who would be responsible for the stunt’s approval, waved stiffly back at the stunt artist to show he heard that whistle. Mr. Moon frowned. He had worked with Registrar Lester Ferris several times in the past, and Mr. Moon knew that Registrar Ferris would not overlook any oversight his crew may have made in preparation for the day’s stunt.  
  
  “You’re looking slim as always, Registrar Ferris. May I help you with your briefcase?”  
  
  Registrar Ferris’ gray eyes chuckled at the offer. “It’s quite alright, Mr. Moon. It’s not my first walk around the block. I’ll manage the tools of my trade just fine, thank you.”  
  
  Mr. Moon responded with a wry smile. Mr. Moon was the most famous, and the wealthiest, of all the day’s celebrity stunt artists. People stampeded the memory shops’ doors on the first day their dream tanks offered a new memory of Mr. Moon’s stunts. People took out second mortgages to taste the rush of a Mr. Moon stunt memory before their neighbors. Mr. Moon had provided that hungry market with stunt memories of walking across a biplane’s wing, of hurtling by rocket-pack power across river canyons, of descending, breathless, into the deepest and most dangerous pressures of the sea. Mr. Moon had given the hungry crowd thrilling memories of jumping from city skyscrapers, of skydiving from balloons perched upon the edge of space, of striding through explosions and flame, of leaping upon moving trains. In return, those crowds loved Mr. Moon. They made him wealthy. And in doing so, they gave Mr. Moon the confidence and clout to know that Registrar Ferris might on a technicality delay his newest-dreamed venture, but that in the end that man in the pink tie would be unable to prevent him from achieving his stunt dream no matter whatever small infraction the Registrar might find.  
  
  “So, where’s our clone? Where’s your Gus?”  
  
  “He’s just up on the ramp looking the over the jump a last time,” and Mr. Moon returned his fingers to his mouth and again shrilled over the noise of his cameras and technicians.  
  
  Gus, the clone whose coordination and poise would achieve Mr. Moon’s artistic stunt vision, lingered a second longer to stare from the top of his motorcycle ramp across the divide over which he would fly. He revved his black motorcycle’s engine before turning the bike around and riding back to Mr. Moon waiting for him at the start of the asphalt lane that ran to his ramp.  
  
  “How you feeling today, Gus?” Mr. Moon patted the top of Gus’s black helmet, branded with the white, crescent moon that served as the stunt artist’s logo, his brand seen in every stunt memory designed by his mind. “Are you feeling energetic? Are you brimming with pep?”  
  
  Gus winced as Registrar Ferris flashed a humming, hand-held scanner’s light into his right eye to read the blue rings of hashes and binary code that told a man trained as Registrar Ferris of every detail in that clone’s construction. Mankind branded every clone the Company introduced to the market with those blue rings tattooed around the right eye. No matter if the clone was a meek model assigned to plant and plow in the field, or one of the tantalizing, feminine pleasure toys, each clone received the blue circles of the Company’s brand. The inner-most ring consisted of hashes, which in a Registrar’s scanner displayed the genetic bonds that made each clone possible. Such hashes could relate a clone’s lean towards sickness and towards health, and Registrars were rumored to hold the skill to predict the death of the short-lived clones by quickly reading a strand of those hashes. The outer ring of zeros and ones was a serial code that told a Registrar the clone’s place of construction, an identifier that linked each clone to an owner as a title might connect driver to car. The Registrars never shared what information they took from their scans. Those blue rings expressed a language only Registrars could read, an alphabet whose secrets the Registrars guarded.  
  
  “You sure that jump’s four-hundred feet, Mr. Moon?”  
  
  Registrar Ferris suddenly turned the light away from the blue rings circling the clone’s right eye and squinted at Gus. Mr. Moon flinched.  
  
  Anxiety twitched Gus’s hand, and the clone’s motorcycle engine revved. It was never a clone’s place to question. It was a clone’s place to do. Thus Gus gulped before he continued. “I’m real sorry I asked, Mr. Moon. But I barely cleared the three-hundred and seventy-five feet of last week’s jump. That jump was only supposed to be three-hundred and fifty. But there’s always a few extra feet, and those few extra feet get to meaning a whole lot when I’m jumping that kind of a divide.”  
  
  Gus forced himself to breath. No matter what the Company printed in their catalogs concerning his model of clone, Gus very often felt afraid. But what else could he do? It was expensive to stage the stunts required to create the memories Mr. Moon wished to harvest. Everyone needed an increasingly sp  
ectacular thrill. In the midst of some previous jump atop that black motorcycle, Gus’s mind had fired, and though he was only a clone, he had realized he would never be able to provide enough thrill. Mr. Moon would always push for more.  
  
  “You don’t sound like yourself, Gus.” Mr. Moon squinted at his rider. “There’s nothing to this jump. That motorcycle that’s purring beneath you is top of the line. It’s light, and it has all the horsepower, and then some, that you need to fly across that space. Trust me, Gus. I got all the numbers locked down.”  
  
  Gus’ heart raced. He dreaded to push his concern. But the anxiety burned in his throat as he peeked behind him at the ramp that waited for him.  
  
  “Then what’s with all the coolers stacked on the far side?” asked Gus. “There’s never been so many coolers before.”  
  
  Glancing at Registrar Ferris, Mr. Moon forced a weak kind of laugh. “There’s nothing new there, Gus. We always keep those coolers nearby. You know that.”  
  
  Gus tensed on that motorcycle. He knew he could not retreat from that ramp. Mr. Moon had painted his white moon logo onto all the components that the consumer would witness when tasting the memory of Gus’ jump. All of the pieces were assembled, and Gus was placed atop that black motorcycle. He was only a clone, with the right eye branded by the clone’s mark, by those blue rings of binary numbers and hashes that detailed his genetic recipe. He was only a Gus, and it was his place to go faster, to fly further, to burn brighter so that his creators could share in his memory of the surging adrenaline.  
  
  Gus patiently waited, his heart thumping against his fire-resistant jacket, as Registrar Ferris retuned the light to his face and scanned his clone’s brand, checking the data to insure that Gus was properly registered, that there remained no leans against him, that Mr. Moon had properly insured the clone he had financed through the Company. The moments moved slowly in Gus’ mind, but soon Registrar Ferris took a step away from that motorcycle and returned his scanner to his briefcase.  
  
  “You’re the real deal,” Registrar Ferris nodded.  
  
  Mr. Moon clapped his hands. “You hear that, Gus? The real deal. I know good stock when I see it. Don’t let your knees go weak. This jump’s nothing to you. Only a hop and a wink. Have I let you down before?”  
  
  Gus shook his head. “I’m still standing on this here motorcycle.”  
  
  Mr. Moon slapped Gus’s helmet and pulled down his clone’s dark visor. “You wouldn’t think it, Gus, but I envy you and your brothers. To think about the rush you must feel the moment your tire lifts from the ground.”  
  
  “I thought the whole reason I was getting ready to do this stunt was so that mankind could safely experience the thrill of it without feeling the harm of it.”  
  
  “You don’ understand. How could you?” Mr. Moon frowned. “It’s not fair of me to expect you to. You’re only a Gus. But I’m the designer of these stunts. I dream up one parachute drop after another, and every one has to be a greater spectacle than the one that came before. I can only write out all the equations governing the physics of every one of my car wrecks. It’s your kind, Gus, who gets to ride all the motorcycles, who get to jump out of all those planes. People don’t want to hear about all my science. They want the simple thrill. And you’re the one who gives that to them, Gus. They’ll worship you for it.”  
  
  Gus sighed inside of his helmet. What use did he have for glory? “Sorry to make you worry, Mr. Moon, or if I’ve let you down in any way. It’s the adrenaline that’s talking. It’s only because I felt the wind shift slightly as I checked the jump out on top of the ramp.”  
  
  Mr. Moon winked. “Even the wind can’t stop you, Gus. You won’t let me down.”  
  
  Gus twisted a wrist, and the motorcycle popped forward as the clone rode beyond Mr. Moon and Registrar Ferris to the group of technicians gathered at the very start of the asphalt path leading to the ramp who were ready to put the motorcycle through its final inspection.  
  
  Registrar Ferris lingered after he clasped closed his suitcase, though it was not his custom to remain and witness the unfolding of any of Mr. Moon’s stunts.  
  
  “How many stunts has that clone pulled off?”  
  
  Mr. Moon rolled his eyes. “Hard to believe, but he’s pulled off eleven attempts. A clean dozen if he manages to launch that motorcycle across this one.”  
  
  “You think he’s gonna make it?”  
  
  Mr. Moon shrugged. “I didn’t really think he’d make the last four.”  
  
  “Then why risk it? A clone might not be a man, but a clone is certainly a very expensive piece of equipment.”  
  
  “It’s the most expensive piece of equipment,” Mr. Moon responded, “but we’ve gotten our investment, and then some out of this Gus. It’s all icing now. And these last jumps he’s made are just incredible. People can’t get enough of it. If he makes this jump, my investment will come back in diamonds. If not, I step away from the motorcycle jumping for a bit. Let that niche calm down while I try something else. Maybe something with cages and sharks.”  
  
  Registrar Ferris stared at the clone who sat, motionless, atop that motorcycle as the technicians checked the tires one last time, listened once more to the revving engine. There had been something different about that clone, something Registrar Ferris had not anticipated witnessing.  
  
  “Have you noticed any change in that Gus’ personality? Is he the same clone now as he was the first day you placed him on that bike?”  
  
  Mr. Moon’s face paled. “You said the numbers and the hashes ad up. You better believe I’m doing this by the book. I’ve invested too much to jeopardize this stunt by doing anything under the table.”  
  
  “Not what I meant. Has that Gus changed?”  
  
  Mr. Moon slowly nodded. “His questions seemed odd for a clone.  
  
  “I would agree, Mr. Moon.”  
  
  Mr. Moon was very happy when Registrar Ferris offered no further observation and took a place among the technicians to watch the next jump made by that particular clone model named Gus. A technician raised a black flag, upon which was stitched a crescent, white moon. Mr. Moon poked his fingers into his mouth and returned a whistle, and so gave the final approval. It was then all up to Gus to roar that motorcycle down that lane and launch himself into the four-hundred and thirty feet that Mr. Moon knew to be the true measurement of the divide.  
  
  Gus’s strong hand pulled back upon the throttle and roared towards the ramp, a black blur of speed. Gus fed fuel to the engine without hesitation, and his motorcycle did a little more than a hundred miles per hour as it hit the waiting ramp. Mr. Moon and the witnessing crowd held their breath as Gus launched himself into the jump’s graceful arc, the clone’s poised body atop that bike making all of it look easy, the clone’s skill tricking the mind into believing there was nothing unnatural concerning the way a piece of metal and a body of flesh attempted to fly.  
  
  Mr. Moon smiled as his eyes tracked Gus’s flight, his mind salivating for the taste of that memory he expected the day’s stunt would harvest. It would be a marvelous memory. Even the most jaded of memory consumers would swoon as that memory washed over their minds. And Gus made it look so easy perched atop that black motorcycle. Mr. Moon’s nimble mind knew Gus had hit the ramp just right, that the arc would precisely deliver that motorcycle to the other side. Next week, Mr. Moon would widen that divide a little further. With that particular clone model named Gus, Mr. Moon knew he could push the envelope a little more.  
  
  Only four-hundred and thirty feet was an awful distance, a chasm that left so much room for malfunction.  
  
  Forty fountains of golden sparks and orange flames waited for Gus to fly overhead in the divide between the ramps. The technicians had installed forty fountains of pyrotechnic wonder set to explode when that motorcycle flew overhead, forty jets of brilliance that would make the stunt memory all the more wonderful. Gus soared above the first twelve fountains a wink before they launched their fiery plumes into the high sky. But the thirteenth fountain erupted a wink too soon, and Gus sailed through the orange and gold pillar of sparking fire before ex  
iting the other side burning in flame, transformed in a wink into a comet whose arc streaked across the sky.  
  
  Mr. Moon could not move as he watched that comet fly. His arms would not lift from his sides. His breath could carry no words to scream out from his throat. The timing of those remaining fountains was all wrong, and Gus flew through one pillar of flame and into another, while his motorcycle’s momentum wrestled against those fountains’ resistance to reach the ramp that waited on the other side of that wide divide.  
  
  Gus felt the pain eating upon his skin as he continued to soar. His helmet filled with gold as his motorcycle crashed through the fountains. His hands burned upon the handlebars, but Gus clutched for control no matter the pain. He was but a Gus, and so he had no option other than to ride that arc through all those golden fountains of fire and pray he would reach the divide’s other side to realize Mr. Moon’s dream.  
  
  Something strange happened to Gus somewhere between fountains twenty-seven and thirty-two. A vision formed amid those sparks and flames enveloping him. The world beyond Gus’s helmet turned white, and a figure with brilliant, spinning halos of pearl and silver walked into his sight like a man who stepped through an invisible door that had opened somewhere beyond the waiting landing zone. Gus’s pain retreated as the figure raised his arms towards the flying clone. Gus felt a blanket’s comforting warmth embrace him.  
  
  Gus nearly made the four-hundred and thirty feet of that jump as a flaming comet, but hampered by the friction of so many fountains, his motorcycle’s front tire struck the waiting ramp at a terrible angle. Gus’s flaming form tumbled through the air as his motorcycle exploded around him, its pieces clattering across the landing zone.  
  
  Mr. Moon broke out of his trance and shouted towards his technicians. “Don’t worry about the burns and the bones! There’s nothing we can do about those injuries! Get that helmet off! Get into that skull and get to that memory!”  
  
  Mr. Moon’s responders, his technicians and his medics, extinguished the flames with trained efficiency. Mr. Moon’s stunt crew was the best. Mr. Moon hired only those most skilled in the harvesting of memory. They cut the clothes from Gus’s smoldering body. They pulled the black helmet, with the charred logo of a moon, from the clone’s head. Before Gus’s body could cool, they bore into that stunt clone’s brain. The large coolers were ready and frosty as they carefully set the pink matter upon ice.  
  
  Mr. Moon panted as he jogged across the four-hundred and thirty feet of that divide. “What did we get?”  
  
  One of the technicians raised his head from the grizzly work of harvesting memory from a failed stuntman. “The brain matter looks good enough, Mr. Moon. We’ll pull something out if anyone can. We’ll find something.”  
  
  Mr. Moon set his hands upon his thighs and gasped to catch his breath. “At least there’ll be something.

Chapter 2 - The Memory Shop…  
  
  “Well, I’m sorry if it’s not a convenient time for me to take one of my personal days. I don’t care what the home office might have to say about it, Lucinda. Hang on a second.” The commuter train jostled as Digger Newman transferred his cell phone to his other ear. “Yeah, I’m on the rails. What do you think, Lucinda? It’s always a mess on the rails. Hang on a second.”  
  
  Digger pushed his way through the throng of commuters towards the rear of the commuter car, where he hoped he might find enough quiet to convince Lucinda he had every right to take an unplanned day off from work. He hated having to move towards the rear of the car. It smelled worse and worse the further one moved towards the back. He hated having to elbow and jostle at strangers who appeared to have no empathy for his need. He hated the mumbling babble of so many voices speaking so many different languages that numbed his mind. Most of all, Digger hated having to push his way towards the back of that car because doing so took him further from the double doors of his eventual exit.  
  
  For on that day, Digger had an appointment with the memory shop he vowed not to miss, and he hated to think he might find himself trapped on the back of that commuter car while his destination’s station rolled past in the windows.  
  
  “Listen, Lucinda, it can’t be helped. No, I feel very fortunate to have any job at all in this economy, but I’ve stashed all those personal days away.” Digger glared at a woman who eavesdropped on his conversation. “I’ll make it up to you. I promise.”  
  
  Digger failed to feel as thankful as he thought he should have after Lucinda finally relented and agreed to help him. He had given the home office fifteen years, fifteen years of constant threat of lay-off and termination, of the home office always hinting that a clone model would soon appear to replace him. Perhaps it was time for Digger Newman to call the home office’s bluff.  
  
  Digger had an appointment to keep with the memory shop, his most important appointment yet, and everything other commitment felt vain in comparison.  
  
  Working for the home office certainly had not made him wealthy. He was fortunate to afford a seat on a commuter car that smelled of urine and sweat. He lived in a dim cubicle of an apartment, with hardly enough room for his single bed and his microwave. He didn’t possess any of the savings that might in the end save him from one of the elderly condos the city couldn’t find even enough clone labor to build at a pace to keep up with the rate at which the city aged.  
  
  Though the home office had hardly provided him with much of a living, Digger had never missed an opportunity to taste on of Mr. Moon’s new memory. He had always found a way to scrimp and to save. He had found the funds his taste for those memories required in the sale of his family car. He had pawned his old wedding band. He had put less and less aside for his daughter’s college fund. And so Digger had always found a way to afford the newest taste Mr. Moon’s catalog of memories offered.  
  
  The loyalty Digger had always shown to his local memory shop was about to be rewarded. His supplier had given him a tip that a new memory from Mr. Moon was about to hit the shelves. His supplier promised Digger that he could be the first to taste that memory’s thrill. Digger would not allow any home office from holding him back from that appointment Digger had with his favorite shop’s memory tank.  
  
  “Pardon me, sir, but you got a dollar to give to a hungry man?”  
  
  Digger tried to glance away, to act as if he had not heard the young man of a beggar plead for a dollar. Digger looked aside to give that man the chance to simply move along, to take back his request. Only, the young man did not retreat, instead holding his hand higher towards Digger. Digger frowned as he peeked at the man’s face and saw how the man had tattooed a clone’ two blue rings around his right eye, a brand more and more of the increasing poor were forced to forge upon their faces to earn a bowl of free mudder stew the work vendors reserved for Company clones. Digger’s nose wrinkled. The man smelled of that stew.  
  
  “I don’t have anything to give you.” Digger pushed deeper into the crowd, hoping to put elbows and thighs between himself and the begging man.  
  
  “Not even a dime? You look like a keen man. You don’t even have a nickel?”  
  
  “I tell you I don’t have anything,” growled Digger. “You’ve got the mark around your right eye now. You go back to those street vendors and get the mudder stew.”  
  
  Commuters cursed as Digger pushed through them to separate himself from the begging man, whose attention soon turned to another commuter standing in the aisle. Digger despised the poverty of the world. He hated how it walked among the streets, how it begged for nickels and dimes. He hated the smell, and the grime. Most of all he hated the poverty for the way it made him fear, for the way it made him worry that he too might soon count himself among those who pleaded for a next meal.  
  
  Digger sighed as he found an open enough space upon the commuter car to simply stand and lean against the cool window. “I should’ve been at the memory shop a half an hour ago. It’s all that new highway construction. What’s taking the clones so much time to finish all the work?”  
  
  Digger snarled as he peered out of the window and down upon the teams of clones working the concrete and asphalt of the growing highway. Even from his distance, he had no trouble seeing that Gus clone models composed all those work teams - athletic, wide-shouldered, strong-armed, and sun resistant Gus clones. Digger hated them most of all. He hated the ease with which a Gus clone completed his labor. He hated how the Gus clones never suffered a common cold, never burned with fever. All those Gus clones were stronger than him. They were smarter than him. And Gus suspected, like the home office so often implied, it would not be long until a clone replaced him. Digger’s hatred was a last possession he might hold back from those clones, who made mankind so poor, who shamed their very creators for their meek willingness to do so much for so little.  
  
  The commuter car’s intercom buzzed. “Next stop, Chancey Lane. Exit on the right.”  
  
  Digger ignored the glares and the murmurs as he pushed his way through the crowd to the double doors of his exit. Outside the commuter train, Digger panted up the station’s steep steps to reach street level. His right foot throbbed for the plantar fasciitis that haunted his heel, the fault of Digger’s cheap shoes.  
  
  Finally, after shuffling the handful of street blocks between the rail station and his destination, Digger saw the memory shop’s purple and blue neon sign flickering in the rain, hissing as the raindrops fell upon its heat. The commuter car had been crowded with rude commuters who had no sympathy for his suffering. But the sign made all that indignity worthwhile to Digger. Digger’s mouth salivated thinking how it would taste to be the first to experience Mr. Moon’s newest memory.  
  
  “Do you have it, Ray! For the love of the Maker, tell me you have it!”  
  
  Digger burst through the memory shop’s doors and nearly sprawled into the man in the dark suit accentuated with a slim, pink tie. The man frowned and scrawled a note on small writing pad he pulled from the inner pocket of his suit jacket, causing Ray, the shop’s proprietor behind the counter, to sigh.  
  
  “It’s against the regulations of the memory trade for any vendor or shop to advertise the arrival of a new memory before first receiving a Registrar’s certificate of approval.”  
  
  Ray’s fleshy face trembled. “But he’s only Digger. He’s just a friend. I only whispered a little something, just hinted a new memory was coming my shop’s way. I didn’t tell anyone else, and I certainly didn’t take out any advertising in any of the memory papers.”  
  
  The Registrar shrugged. “I’ll note that. They’ll be a small fine this time. But take note that another offense may force us to revoke your license.”  
  
  Ray’s shook his head. “And the rest of the shop? Does it meet your approval to move forward?”  
  
  “It does,” nodded the Registrar. “You have all the requisite bulletins posted through the shop clearing stating to your customers which memories have been created by clones. Your shop has all the bu  
lletins reminding your customers how to spot a clone in the street who may be attempting to hide his or her mark. Your books are in order, giving me no reason to suspect you’re dealing in unlicensed memories. You’re shop’s in fine order for the shipment of a new memory, but remember to never again hint at new product before gaining a Registrar’s approval.”  
  
  “I’ll remember.” Ray grunted as he signed the final forms proffered by the Registrar.  
  
  Digger jumped out of the Registrar’s path as the official turned from the counter and strode out of the memory shop’s door.  
  
  “I’m sure sorry, Ray. I had no idea I was going to get you in hot water.”  
  
  Ray shrugged his shoulders. “It’s not your fault, Digger. I knew better than to give you a hint that a new memory from Mr. Moon was arriving today. It won’t take me very long at all to make the money to cover that fine. Main thing is all the equipment’s good, that the shop’s in order. And that Registrar certificate should last me until the end the month.”  
  
  “Happy to hear it,” and Digger slapped the counter and grinned. “Will I be the first?”  
  
  Ray winked. “Digger, you’ll be the very first just like I promised.”  
  
  “I owe you. I’m not going to forget it.”  
  
  Ray swiped Digger’s plastic debit card and raised an eyebrow. “Sure you want to go through with this? Sure you want to pay to be the first? There’s no shame in waiting a while until the memory cools off a little and the price drops a bit.”  
  
  “I said I wanted to be the first, and I promised to pay for it.”  
  
  “Alright, Digger. We’ll head on to the tank.”  
  
  “You’re wonderful, Ray. Simply wonderful.”  
  
  Digger’s spirit soared. No matter what would come of that unplanned personal day, no matter the stinking commuter car, Digger’s day was going to be wonderful. He would be the first to experience a memory crafted by none other than Mr. Moon. He wouldn’t even have to sit in the memory shop’s waiting room for his turn in the memory chair. He wouldn’t have to idly sip at the bitter and cold coffee Ray prepared for his waiting clientele. Digger skipped as he followed Ray down that dim and narrow hallway that led to the memory shop’s heart.  
  
  Ray cracked open the door at the end of the hall, and Digger’s skin thrilled in anticipation of his appointment.  
  
  “You know the drill, Digger.”  
  
  “That I do.”  
  
  Ray flipped on the chamber’s lights before vanishing behind a door on the opposite wall. The shop’s sensory-deprivation tank filled the center of the room. The first tanks had been simple contraptions, little more than inexpensive, fiberglass tubs encased in domes of sewn-together garbage bags. Yet when the memory industry exploded, market competition forced shop owners to be vigilant for ways to attract clients. The shops grew more luxurious, with fine leather furniture replacing the folding chairs first gathered in the waiting rooms. The sensory-deprivation tanks became chambers shaped from curved and fine hardwoods. The most posh of memory shops offered their clients a variety of tank choices for their pleasure, and the Association of Memory Shops held each winter a prestigious contest to challenge the most celebrated of memory tank crafters to create their masterpieces from glistening ice.  
  
  Ray’s tank might not have been a masterpiece, but Digger never felt the proprietor had a thing to feel ashamed about regarding the shimmering, green memory tank of jade housed in the shop. Elegant lotus flowers, carved by such a skillful hand as to seemingly float across the chamber’s surface, adorned the cylindrical tank. Fine pearls of silver and white dotted the tank like stars. Though Digger knew it was a trick of his imagination, he often felt like the tank’s deep green pulsated in accord with an inner heart. Nothing lifted Digger’s spirit like Ray’s memory tank. No matter how bitter the day’s disappointment may have been, Digger knew the jade tank would refresh his soul. The tank, and the memories the shop proffered within its confines, was what made Digger’s life worthwhile.  
  
  Digger stepped out of his clothes and entered the jade tank’s teak doorway as a naked man. He lowered himself softly into the inner chamber filled with warm, soothing water. The tank’s door closed at the press of a button, surrounding Digger in perfect darkness. Though he could not see, Digger’s practiced hands easily found the waiting headband that would deliver Mr. Moon’s memory to his mind.  
  
  Digger sighed in comfort as the water level rose to float his body. There was no light, no sound. There was only the nothing, and it made Digger’s soul grin.  
  
  Soon, Ray would finish installing Mr. Moon’s new memory into the shop’s system, and then Digger would be the first to feel that great artist’s most recent thrill. Meanwhile, Digger thought back to the day his ex-wife and his daughter had tried to push him away from the memory shop by holding a surprise intervention. They had known nothing of the memory shop. They could only see Mr. Moon’s memories as a vice. What could they understand of his need to find one place in that dingy world in which to become lost to himself? How could they understand what it meant to Digger to meditate for that moment before a thrilling new memory came rushing into his vision? They could not understand how the lost savings were nothing compared to the memory. What was the value of a retirement account when compared to the pleasures Digger felt in the tank - from the thrilling jet pack flights around snow-capped mountains, to the simple, joyous, guilt-free sex sessions with curvaceous and talented love clones? And if even those memories failed to sweep aside a day’s disappointment, then the tank offered the violent and red murder memories that might give his heart the catharsis it so badly craved.  
  
  Ray’s voice whispered in the tank’s dark. “Are you hooked in, Digger? The memory’s in the system now. I’ll start the transfer as soon as I know you’re ready.”  
  
  “What do you think Mr. Moon’s going to give us now?”  
  
  Ray chuckled softly. “You’re guess is as good as mine. I’ve never been the first to taste one of Mr. Moon’s memories. That honor’s all yours now. So promise not spoil any of the surprise to me once you step out of my tank.”  
  
  “I hope it’s something special.”  
  
  “You certainly paid for something special.”  
  
  “Don’t take this the wrong way, Ray, but Mr. Moon’s memories haven’t been the same as of late. They haven’t elevated me in the same way.”  
  
  Ray sighed. “You’re not the first to say it. But rumor has it Mr. Moon was really excited about this one.”  
  
  “I hope it’s grand, Ray. I hope it’s grand.”  
  
  Digger felt the first tingle, and he knew that the memory began its transfer into his mind. The memory arrived with a fog. It’s outlines were blurred, and Digger for a moment feared that Mr. Moon had lost his touch, that the greatest of all the memory stunt artists had lost his touch. Curtains of orange and gold washed the fog away, and a sensation came to Digger of flying at incredible speed. Digger recognized no faces. He saw no landmarks. He could not see from what origin the memory had been drawn.  
  
  Digger felt most disappointed as he felt his skin warm. He resented the price he had paid for such a poor beginning to one of Mr. Moon’s thrills. For a fraction of an instant, Digger felt betrayed.  
  
  But then, Digger’s vision blinded into white a moment before a figure with halos of pearl and silver whirling behind its head reached out to embrace him.  
  
  And Digger Newman knew in an instant he had found the memory his soul had always craved.

I (M19) met with this girl (F19) from Himachal at Pune now for college. — smart, funny, cute dimples, bio said “chai over coffee any day” and I was like yep, i like this girl (but let's be honest, I was just trying to get laid).

She came over after three days of witty banter and bad memes. I cleaned my PG room like it was going to be inspected by the Swachh Bharat Mission — new bedsheet, room freshener, even borrowed my roommate’s Bluetooth speaker for vibes.

The plan was simple: one-night stand. What I didn’t plan for was how good it would be. Like mind-blowingly good. Not just the ""thing"" — the vibe. She laughed when my knees cracked. I laughed when she sneezed mid-kiss. Afterward, instead of leaving, she said “yaar, Zomato pe kuch mangate hain?” and we ordered momos and binge-watched Jewel Thief. It was ass.

That was it. I was gone. Hook, line, and simped.

She started visiting frequently. Wore my oversized hoodie like it was her own. Called me “pookie” unironically. I introduced her to my friends. She met my maa on a video call. We were full filmy couple mode.

Then came the downfall.

We were out with a group of mutuals — one of those casual cafe scenes. One of the guys, trying to be funny, casually said,
""Bro, that Rohan guy your girl hangs out with? He posted this story with her last night… looked kinda couple-y.""

I laughed it off thought that lonely ass was jealous. But later that night, curiosity ate me up. I checked.
Story was gone — but the tagged post wasn’t.

There she was. Same smile. Wearing the exact same hoodie I’d given her.
Was hard to believe thought probably some simp, then she hit me up and we went on a date followed by at my place got drunk and she was kinda resting up and i sneaked her phone to the bathroom and checked it to verify, there was nothing. I was really relieved.
Fast forward to the very bloody next morning saw that bitch and the guy holding hands and kissing at gym. Video by that same guy I assumed was jealous of me, and there he was looking after me.
 
My heart didn’t even sink — it just went blank it was so aching badly i bloody cant explain. 

I didn’t confront her. Didn’t ask. What was the point? She made her choice. I was just the comfort pit stop before her upgrade


I didn’t even need to open it. I just knew.

Confronted her calmly. She said, “We never officially said we’re exclusive, na?”
Didi… you called my mom aunty and she started asking about your kuldevi. Don’t gaslight me now.

Turns out she had been sleeping with a guy from her gym for a month. Said she was “confused.” I walked out without drama. She didn’t stop me. She stood there in my hoodie like I was the villain.

The final slap?
A week later I see her Insta story: new guy, arms like a protein shake ad, wearing my hoodie while holding her hand in Khan Market.

So yeah. TIFU by catching feelings during a hookup, and now my hoodie is dating someone else.

She can keep the hoodie. I’ll keep my dignity…",0,1752057043.0,TeenIndia,24,0.33,False

Yes she was at a hen do, but she wouldnt be the first person to leave a group.

It’s not a big thing, but it’s made a big difference. I’m genuinely grateful for the small moments that help me feel human again.

1lvfb15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lvfb15/all_greek_to_me_by_i_c_springman/,All Greek To Me by I. C. Springman,"  1 Song of the Dispossessed  
  
  Being dead comes with its own set of problems. Signing a lease for instance. Even if the landlord isn’t too picky about references and likes the idea of a cash transaction, particularly if you shell out for six months in advance, you might find yourself in the middle of a global financial crisis where banks fail, mortgages foreclose, and the landlord apologetically comes home to roost. With his entire extended family in tow. And without any mention of a refund.  
  
  “How can I put this,” Jane said, standing on the threshold and pretending to think deeply. “What’s Greek for ‘No’?”  
  
  “Όχι.” It sounded like “Okay.”  
  
  “Okay,” Jane echoed. And shut the door.  
  
  When the knocking persisted, she simply ignored it. Until she couldn’t. This time there were two men on the doorstep. The landlord and a police officer. A number of children had broken containment and were shrieking up and down the garden path. The inevitable spidery grandmother sat huddled beneath the pergola, like an elderly oracle retired from Delphi in her head-shawl and winter coat. Mrs. Landlord looked benumbed and anxious standing beside a van, hugging a quilt. Further down the rocky hill, in the narrow street, a knot of teens and twenty-somethings leaned against cars or mopeds, glancing up at the cottage and muttering, their breath and cigarette smoke fogging the February air.  
  
  “We signed a lease,” Jane objected.  
  
  “I sent an eviction notice.”  
  
  “I never got it. This can’t be legal.”  
  
  The policeman spoke for the first time. Jane cursed herself for slacking off on her Pimsleur. Then she cursed John, who spoke Greek like a native. Or like an Albanian at any rate. She glanced at the landlord.  
  
  “έτσι μου μηνύσει,” the landlord repeated. He coughed a little before translating. “So sue me.”  
  
  Which was of course out of the question. Dead people - or at any rate people who are presumed and/or pretending to be dead - don’t go to court in the best of times. And these were not that, as the landlord and his merry band could attest. For Jane it was something of a bad joke, with a punch line that was getting old. Before this, in Ireland, it was a tweedy registrar who had come knocking at the rented door, with a tale of investor default, receivership, and trickle-down consequences. Perhaps because eviction was his business, he wasted no time on guilt or remorse. “It’s under six months on yehr lease yeh are, so out yeh go, no warnin’, no recourse, yeh’re done here. And I’ll be taking none of the lip off the two of yehs, as it’s yehr own Mr. Geithner yeh can be thanking, with his bailou  
ts for some and not for t’others, so ‘tis.”  
  
  OK. Jane mentally tossed in the towel. It was just one of those things. Another one of those things (they were piling up). Without another word, she walked away from the open door and into the bedroom. John had pretty much cleared out his things when he left, so she had only her own belongings to gather and she was travelling light, as the dead tend to do. She swept clothes, cosmetics, computer, a slim coil of piano wire into a single suitcase and in less than ten minutes she was done. The tiny bureau was empty, the cupboard built into the whitewashed wall was bare. She gave the room one last sweeping glance. Aside from fingerprints and DNA, you’d never know they’d been there.  
  
  She emerged to find that the Greek legions had already established a beachhead in the tiny living room. Under the direction of noisy, pushy elders, a bucket brigade of younger family members was conveying an escalating jumble of boxes, bags, and naked piles of anything and everything from the cars to the cottage floor. The spartan space was quickly occupied and overrun. The police officer had gone. Someone had switched on the radio:  
  
  Έκαψα το χθες νύχτες μου παλιές  
  
  όνειρα και εφιάλτες ρίχνω στις φωτιές  
  
  Δάκρυα καυτά ψέμματα πολλά…  
  
  \[I burnt the past, my old nights  
  
  Dreams and nightmares I cast into the fire  
  
  Burning tears, too many lies…\]  
  
  When they got to the chorus, everyone sang, “OPA!” Until they saw her standing there and fell silent. From a chair in the kitchen, one little girl and the grandmother continued to sing, an oddly pure and Picking her way through the debris of other lives, sidling past the suddenly motionless line of others to whom the debris belonged, Jane ignored the landlord, who came forward with a piece of paper in his hand. It was the clinic report with her test results. She didn’t remember dropping it. Oh well.  
  
  “Missis, I didn’t know. You should have said. Συγχαρητήρια!” \[“Congratulations!”\]  
  
  Jane reached above the front door to grab the Uzi cradled there on two hooks. Behind her, she heard muffled cries of alarm and terrified whispers. She didn’t turn around, just lifted the weapon over her head as she marched down the garden path. One faint, derisive word came floating back, echoing the song that had not quite ended. The ghost of a word: “OPA!”  
  
  2 Somewhere Near Texas (I Lost My Man)  
  
  As the daylight drained out of the sky, the dead buck on the picnic table turned a darker shade of black.  
  
  “Oh. Fuck.”  
  
  “Yeah,” John said, leaning against the side of a Chevy pickup many moons past its better days. Vinnie for once was speechless. John smiled, wincingly. “What, no high five? Who was it used to say I oughta kill that lying bitch.”  
  
  “That was before. Holy shit. How bad is it?”  
  
  John bowed his head, shifted the piece of hay to the other side of his mouth, and stared into the dented truck bed, which was rapidly becoming a bottomless well on that moonless night. “Pretty bad.”  
  
  “OK, for those of us just tuning in, are we talking - ‘I want to hit a strip club, get shit-faced, and things will probably look better in the morning?’ Or - ‘I’m going to sleep with every slut from here to Detroit and if you’re my pal you won’t let me sober up until the divorce papers come through?’”  
  
  “She doesn’t know about Detroit. Correction. She refused to consider Detroit.”  
  
  Vinnie did a double-take. “That’s - that’s like Princess Leia refusing to consider the Rebel Alliance.”  
  
  John shrugged and quoted Jane quoting Sun Tzu: “’He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.”  
  
  “Oh right, advice from a dead Chinese guy.”  
  
  “Ummm - you can kinda see her point? It was a whole lot easier when we were wearing white hats for the empire. In and out of countries hassle free, best hardware money can invent, and if all else fails, the Marines have your back.” He tossed the piece of hay aside. “All of that is gone.”  
  
  “You mean - ‘all that is on the other side’,” Vinnie corrected him.  
  
  “I mean ‘just who the fuck do we think we are?’” John said. “So, for the record and for the sake of what remains of my marriage, I’m here because of you and the ‘rents. If anybody asks.”  
  
  “Uh huh. I see. And if saving the world is no longer on the agenda, you’re supposed to spend the rest of your lives doing what exactly.”  
  
  “My dear Watson, there you have the situation in a bally nutshell.”  
  
  “That guy was so gay.”  
  
  “Bi maybe.”  
  
  “Not that there’s anything wrong with that,” they repeated in unison.  
  
  “Brooo - mance, if I loved you more I might be -“ Vinnie stopped short mid-refrain, feeling a presence at his elbow.  
  
  “Julio,” John stepped to one side to acknowledge his friend, little more than a shadow on the chalky road.  
  
  “John Whitehorse,” the shadow replied, by way of greeting. Half his face glowed dead white with phosphorescent paint. He wore an eagle feather in his hair.  
  
  Vinnie tried to explain. “We were just getting into bachelor party mode.”  
  
  “We were just getting into war party mode.” Julio nodded over his shoulder toward the village that sat maybe a quarter mile away across dry, flat land. A bonfire in front of the traditional bent-branch houses tongued the desert night. Stick figures etched themselves against the flames as the chanting rose and fell. The women began to keen, and beneath it all beat the hypnotic tempo of the drums. It was a song of loss, catastrophe, collapse. Far from Europe, where affluent societies were breaking down, far from Tahrir Square and Tunisia where people were defying the unjust order of their human universe, there was this ancient music. To John it sounded like the soundtrack to the end of just about everything.  
  
  “Ow!” Julio yelped. Behind him, a deep voice spoke slowly and at length, in Algonquin. Julio rubbed the spot where a sharpened stick had gone drilling for his ribcage. “The chief says I am a bad host and a worse liar. Also that you must walk with Wisaka, John Whitehorse, for there are no deer left in this country.”  
  
  “I was thinking that Wisaka sent the deer as a gift for the chief,” John said, returning compliment for compliment, as his father had taught him. “We got his truck out of hock and brought along some supplies. Flour, coffee, the usual.” The chief limped to the picnic table and let his hands wander over the fifty pound sacks heaped like so many big-bellied white sows beside cardboard boxes of canned peaches and corn, cartons of Lucky Strikes, a 5-gallon stand of lard. He nodded his approval, the white stripes on his face moving quickly up and down. The eagle feathers of his war bonnet were the palest whisper of white above his head. “But the deer ran across our path just outside of town,” John added.  
  
  “One shot,” Vinnie said. Not too archly. Not too De Niro.  
  
  “One shot is what it’s all about,” Julio agreed, without cracking a smile.  
  
  “I like the trees, you know?” Vinnie said, getting into it.  
  
  “I ain’t gonna hunt with no assholes.” Game, set, and match to Julio, who had gone line for line and capped out with an insult. “Ow!”  
  
  The chief and his stick had hobbled back and wanted to begin another speech. A long one this time. He spoke in careful, measured sentences underscored by the drums and the ritual wailing of the women. Julio faithfully translated, and John listened politely, with Vinnie following John’s lead. As if they were not two ex-pat desperados itching to run the border. As if they had all the time in the world.  
  
  “The chief says you know our history. Our tribal name means ‘he who wanders from here to there.’ We came from a northern country of forests and lakes, forced to move many times over many seasons to reach this final home, far to the south. And even here we have no peace, for land that once was open is cut by fences, the deer have run beyond the farthest hill, and since the miners began to take the water we can no longer irrigate our fields. Our people believe they were placed on this side of the Earth to take care of the land through their ceremonial duties, just as other races have been placed elsewhere around the Earth to take care of her in their own ways. Together, we have held the world in balance. The old ones have always said when we can no longer do these things, when we can no longer fulfill our tasks as guardians, a great purification will come to destroy this world, as previous worlds were destroyed. Today we have welcomed the New Year. It was the smallest gathering in the chief’s lifetime. Two clans have died out in the past six months alone and today their sacred bundles were buried forever. This is sadly in keeping with the prophecies.”  
  
  John listened with a sinking heart. Well, here was another fucking reason to celebrate. He knew his father, a full member of the tribe, would take it hard. About the clans, that is.  
  
  To Vinnie it was just so much mumbo-jumbo. He looked impatiently and inquiringly at John, who gently nudged him with the toe of his boot. The chief went on.  
  
  “You wonder why I bend your ears with an old man’s tale. It is not for the sake of my people, who have kept the old ways and have been promised a place in the next world. We have kept to the path of nature and of spirit law, while your people have pursued technology and material things. For a little time remaining, there is a bridge between these diverging paths.  
If everyone on your side will cross that bridge and join us here, we can use the best of your science and the best of our ancient learning to make a paradise for all. It will take a great turning among your people to change course in this way. It is said that a man from the south and the east may arise to lead them. We do not know his name. Or the hour of his coming. So I tell every stranger I meet. Until the message, like an arrow, finds its mark.”  
  
  “Don’t look at me,” Vinnie said. “I’m from the Bronx.”  
  
  The chief examined Vinnie critically as Julio translated. When Julio had finished, the chief crossed his arms and sighed.  
  
  “But - speaking of paradise,” Vinnie said, more to fill the uncomfortable void in conversation than anything else, “we’re headed for your casino. On the other side of the Rio Bravo.” As if Julio and the Chief needed that piece of information. “Maybe the Chief would like to join us. Top-of-the-line VIP treatment, all expenses paid, right there on the Texas side of the reservation, convenient to hearth and home. Broads. Booze. Blackjack. We were already planning to party like there’s no tomorrow.” Struck by a sudden thought, he said to John, “Is it me or is getting married like some kind of total fucking Apocalypse?”  
  
  “The case can be made,” John acknowledged, remembering Jane’s face when she entered the kitchen. The shocked disbelief.  
  
  “And you didn’t tell me?”  
  
  “Misery loves company.” For the hundredth time,

he took his phone out of his pocket and checked to see if she had answered his ninety-nine previous messages.  
  
  Julio repeated Vinnie’s invitation and the chief laughed outright, a short sharp bark. He said a few words to Julio and got into the truck. On the passenger’s side.  
  
  “Was that a yes?” Vinnie wondered.  
  
  “Climb in,” Julio said. “There’s a tarp back there you can hide under when you get to the river.” He began to walk away.  
  
  “You’re not coming?” John asked, straddling the side of the truck bed.  
  
  “Someone’s got to dress that buck.”  
  
  “But - who’s going to drive?” For answer, the pickup truck shuddered, coughed, and sputtered to life. “Uh, not to be a total ingrate or anything, but in town they told us they impounded the truck because he was caught driving while blind,” John lowered his voice, not wanting to offend the chief.  
  
  “Yeah, they took his license a while back,” Julio conceded carelessly. “But he doesn’t let that stop him. Besides, he’s going straight across the river so you don’t have to worry about him driving off the bridge or anything.”  
  
  “And then there were two,” Vinnie grumbled. “I don’t think you can have a bachelor party for two. It’s against the rules.”  
  
  “Tell that to Hugh Hefner,” John said.  
  
  “I’ll be there,” Julio insisted. “A couple hours behind, riding drag, just to make sure the coast is clear. And the chief is coming. He said he wouldn’t miss it for the world.”  
  
  “He said that?” With a hellish grinding of gears the truck lurched forward. Stalled out. Lurched again. Julio walked beside them as the vehicle struggled to gather momentum. In answer to Vinnie’s question, he grinned and gave a half shrug.  
  
  “I think his exact words were: ‘Remember when the white man used to get us drunk and take our money?’ You might want to brace yourselves against those hay bales. ‘Cause he may be blind -” Almost before the words were out of Julio’s mouth, the truck spat gravel, fishtailed, and seemed to make the jump to light speed, John and Vinnie bouncing in the back like popcorn. Julio watched as the taillights disappeared in a white spume of dust and remarked to no one in particular, “But he does like to drive fast.”  
  
  3 You Are a Tourist  
  
  Tens of thousands of Greeks were rioting outside the parliament building, but a mile away all was calm and quiet in Exarchia.  
  
  The tattoo parlors, bookstores, second-hand emporiums, and coffee shops were shuttered in solidarity with the general strike. A few Japanese tourists wandered the narrow avenues examining the graffiti scrawled across every wall and many first floor windows. All around, the balconies of the funny apartment buildings, tiered like ziggurats and shaded by threadbare awnings, were practically deserted. Jane had the place pretty much to herself.  
  
  The cold and the damp had followed her from the cottage in Evia. Fortunately, when Exarchia rolled up the sidewalks, it did not remove all the tables and chairs essential to its 24/7 street life. Jane found a seat outside a bar called Kypos Tis Kalashnikof \[Garden of the Kalashnikov\] where she could nurse the cup of coffee she had purchased in a nearby park. Under a palm tree, the shivering Nigerian had a traditional Greek pot, a briki, set up on a hot plate that drew electrical current through a series of extension cords snaking many yards away and up the side of a building papered with about a hundred years of protest posters. As she watched him measure out the coffee and the sugar as if he were measuring her fate, Jane reflected that she could have made coffee in her hotel room up on the Strefi Hill, with its view of the Acropolis. There was a compact machine along with the requisite filters and foil packets of Nescafe. But that had seemed just too fucking depressing for words. So when her morning nausea and general lack of appetite gave way to a craving for some form of creature comfort, she had goaded herself out of bed and into the wider world. Which was how she found herself listlessly wandering the seediest neighborhood in Athens, subject of US State Department warnings, dear to the hearts of anarchists everywhere, with no agenda other than living through however many minutes, hours, days it took for the jagged incessant pain to go away.  
  
  Because it would go away, she thought, taking a sip of the boiling hot coffee. Too soon. She could feel her tongue blistering. It was worth it though, to dispel the Nigerian’s anxiety and to give herself something real to cry about.  
  
  “Όχι πραγματικά. είναι καλό, σας ευχαριστώ,” she assured him, with difficulty, her eyes filling. \[“No, really, it’s good, thank you.”\]  
  
  Because nobody could feel like this forever, she assured herself as she walked away, sucking air between her teeth.  
  
  Not that she had an extensive basis for comparison. Men had always come and gone, plentiful as air; but from the time she first understood what men want - in the orphanage, the foster homes, reform school - the rule was: keep it light. Do not freak out. Do not become attached. Do what you must. Get what you can. Then move on. As the Andover lady had advised. The poised and perfect mystery lady who got Jane’s files expunged, and got her into Andover, and was never heard from again. But the most important thing, the thing that Jane remembered, was the way the Andover lady said those things out loud, coolly and matter-of-factly, distilling into a few not unsympathetic words what Jane already knew from harsh experience. And after Yale, after a brief stint in the Corps, after SAD training, the rule simplified, sharpened, clarified. Boiled down to this: do not fall in ‘love.’ Like a clueless, uninitiated civilian. Like a First-World bubble-wrapped teenybopper.  
  
  Because there was no such thing. Outside of sloppy songs, silly novels, and sentimental movies. Love? Pffttt…  
  
  And then along came John.  
  
  She swallowed more scalding coffee. Dropped into the chair outside the bar. Glanced at the books on the window-ledge. One of the many free libraries scattered throughout the neighborhood, in this case a line of paperbacks. A muddle of graphic novels and political philosophy. The citizens of Exarchia were a literate bunch. She made a selection. Laid it aside after the first page.  
  
  All she could think about was John. Which made her crazy. What the fuck? Let it go already, she berated herself. It was doomed from the start. Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, government tries to annihilate boy and girl - what were they thinking? How could that scenario ever turn out well? It wasn’t possible. Nine years all together, the last two spent on the run. The past was irretrievably gone, the present intolerable, and they could not agree on a viable future. When he left Evia last week, he was drinking like a fish and anger was her new favorite color. No, if she were honest, she would admit that ‘The Jane and John Show’ was done for. She didn’t need to find him kissing a village idiot to know the score. She was surprised, alarmed even, when he didn’t call or text immediately after the little episode with the kitchen wench. At first. Not so much now. She looked at her phone for perhaps the millionth time.  
  
  Nope, nothing. Oh well. Everything had an expiration date. After all, she told herself with grim irony, the standard marital contract did stipulate ‘until death us do part.’ And both technically and officially, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, they were dead, the two of them. So there was a certain cock-eyed logic to finding themselves in this last of all forsaken places - absolute Splitsville.  
  
  On a balcony across the street a radio or iPod was playing:  
  
  You made me love you,  
  
  I didn’t want to do it,  
  
  But you made me do it.  
  
  A half-dressed couple, a slim boy and wraith of a girl who looked too young and tattooed to know how, were ballroom dancing in the tiny space. Jane closed her eyes and groaned silently.  
  
  The Kid sat down without asking.

when the world is loud and moving fast—

my thoughts quietly drift…
to *you.*

I don’t know if *you* feel it—

but something in me believes *you* do.

*I hope you’re feeling this too.*

I wonder—

what stirs *you* awake each morning.

Do *you* take your coffee slow, like me?

Do *you* sit in stillness for a moment
before the rush begins?

I imagine *you* out in the world,

unaware of how your presence softens things—

how just being you
makes the day quieter, warmer.

how *you* stay grounded—

yet still feel deeply, observe deeply.

There’s something in me that reaches for *you* in the in-between moments—

without logic,

without reason.

*you’re feeling it too, right ?*

I don’t want a grand arrival.

I want that quiet second—

the kind where time forgets how to move,
because we’ve found something
we didn’t even know we were missing.

Maybe it’s the brush of our fingers,

the stillness between two laughs,

the way your gaze might hold mine
a second too long.

I imagine sitting beside *you*—

knees almost touching,

hearts a little louder
than either of us expected.

We won’t rush.

We’ll stay.

Five more minutes.

Then five more.

Not because we have to,
but because nothing else feels as right.

a wordless promise.

I imagine your breath
at the curve of my neck,

your hand resting
just where I need it most—

not to hold me down,

Feel. 
Seen.
Heard.

And when the day is over,

and I’m lying in bed,

missing something I’ve never even had—

I still feel it too — 

In my bones. 

The ache.

The knowing.

The quiet longing.

*you’re feeling it too, right?*

Because somewhere out there,
you exist.

you’re reaching back
the same way I’m reaching for *you*.
