This reading happened approx 2 months ago.. and yesterday my grandpa has been informed that he has cancer.

I hope I don't sound dumb but, how can it be that they can predict such things? I am just freaked out, I was freaked out on the day as well because some things were very spot on... but now this is just insane.
Can someone just tell me how the hell these coffee readings work and how they are literally predicting the future ?!?!?!? Neither of us have told our family the man predicted this.

I'm a girl in my 20's. One of our customers has hired a new employee to do his orders. And this guy has been trouble from the start. He has been flirty and been calling me things from the start. I tried to stay professional, share no personal information. Staying polite, but not too nice. He kept getting more and more informal, and last weekend he tried to call my work mobile multiple times and left some really disgusting and inappropriate text messages and pictures. 

We are a family business. And I showed my dad those texts. He went nuclear. 

Now, what course of action would you take here? Dad wants to get a lawyer and the police involved and sue. Mum and I favor maybe talking to our customer first. Mum and I know the owner of the business, and we think he might like a chance to set things right. I have an appointment with the police this afternoon. But we have no clue how to handle things with the other company involved. Has one of you ever had an incident where an employee of another company went way out of line? How did you handle it? Would you rather let a lawyer handle this kind of situation? Or would you give them a chance to set things right?  

I feel like failing our client by getting the police and lawyers involved.... Would really appreciate some advice. 

And just to be painfully clear: I don't flirt with clients. I even lied and suggested being in a relationship multiple times. Like, when clients get flirty, I stop offering them coffee and stuff, I always make sure there's a third person in the meeting, I stop small talk and keep it to a very formal distant politeness.  I already had this f..... conversation with a lawyer...  No way. 

Also, I will be reporting this guy to the police, and dad will kill him if he comes near to our property ever again, that's set in stone. But how do we professionally handle things with the other company involved? To be honest, I never had a problem with them. And I would continue to handle them, if they would like me to. I just won't deal with this pervert anymore. My dad wants to drop that company and wants to talk to a lawyer about legal action...

Sorry for my bad English.

I met Dude on 1/1/24, I instantly fell him, but we agreed on taking things slow to build a solid friendship first. There’s a few things I wish there was more of: text and phone communication (we send memes/stories/post all day everyday), affection, sex(about once a week), time together and intimacy (not sexual). I take responsibility that in the beginning he would constantly message me and I was the one that backed off since it was so new, well he matched my energy and backed off too. A few months have passed and my feelings have grown stronger and I’m hoping that my efforts will develop into something more. I’ve taken him food when his sick, snack packages, taken care of his dogs when he’s had to work away, and cooked/prepped meals for him on his busy days. 

Overtime he mentioned how he was with his HS ex gf for a few years and they ended in bad terms however he remained friends with her sister who now lives in Hawaii. They stayed in touch over the years and she offered to pay for his flight if he ever wanted to visit. His birthday is this week and I encouraged him to go since he’s only traveled within the state for work never for leisure, he works hard and deserves the break. I’ve been to Hawaii and recommend everyone to go. As a gift I got him all his toiletries and clothes, packed everything nicely. Two days before his flight I asked him who was taking him to the airport, I wouldn’t mind.He said his roommate who has no car would use his to drop him off. The day before he got car trouble and asked if I would take him, no problem. I’d would spend the night at his place since his flight was at 6am, we would be there 5am. At 1am he barely started packing and it was chaos, just balling up his clothes and throwing stuff around. I’m the opposite - I work for a luxury brand and know how to fold things properly and organize for space saving. The way he did things was completely frustrating me, my anxiety was so high and I was visibly upset that he wouldn’t accept my help. I’m not controlling, but seeing how he did stuff was just hurting me lol. I was also incredibly tired, but still wanted sex before we went to sleep. He didn’t want to. I went to bed secretly sad. 

I drop him off at the busy international airport, he says he appreciates me, gives me a peck not even a real kiss and he’s off. We texted all through the day, he then arrived to his destination and the ex SIL picks him up, he hasn’t communicated at all with me since then which was Monday. Just dead silence on all socials and text. I’m worried, but I know he’s okay. 

He returns next Tuesday and I decided I’m not going to pick him up if he asks. I realize that as much as he claims he appreciates me, I don’t know if he truly cares about me or likes me, but rather enjoys someone being there for him. I’m hoping he brings me back a souvenir since he’s never gotten me anything, not even on my birthday which was in June. He didn’t ask if I wanted anything though (I would like locally sourced Kona coffee beans, jewelry -necklace or ring, keychain or kava) but I feel weird asking for that. If he doesn’t bring back anything I think that’s my sign to call it quits. Part of me wants to block him right now, my heart is hurting, the other part is telling me to give him grace and respect his time there. What do I do? ",1,1728547466.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I'm day 3 into an (at least) 5 day hospitalized EEG to better determine where on my brain my epileptic activity is coming from.  I had an MRI a few months ago and finally found more information on it.  I have scarring on my hippocampus above my memory circuit.  I'm fully off of meds as of right now (supervised, obviously) and since my seizures are related to lack of sleep it's now 2:59am and I've probably put down 10 cups of coffee since 8pm.

  
The idea is to get as much info out of this to see if I can be a possible candidate for brain surgery.  

  
I'm on Depakote ER and Vimpat at the moment but nothing's ever really stopped them.  I tried Lamictal (sp?) first about 15 years ago, but it just didn't work for me.  Depakote and Vimpat have kept them at bay, but I'll still have my periodic seizure activity where my eyes will get glossy and i'll space out, my hands and jaws will clench, and i'll start humming for 30-50 seconds.  I've been in 4 car crashes since I've been dealing with this.  Each time I've been told, ""ok, you should be good to drive!"" and then I crash into a pole a year later.

  
I've spent 3 days watching EVERYTHING on Netflix and i'm bored out of my skull here in Chicago.  

How many of you have had one of these, and did it turn out successfully for you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div> The charm of a hobbit house interior design is all about creating a space that feels warm and inviting. Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novels, these interiors embrace cozy, earthy vibes that make you feel at home. Are you ready to transform your living space into a delightful retreat that captures the essence of a hobbit's abode? Here’s how to bring that enchanting atmosphere into your home. ### Natural Materials

 One of the key elements of hobbit house interior design is the use of natural materials. Think wood, stone, and clay. These materials connect you to nature and create a rustic charm. - **Wood:** Use reclaimed wood for flooring, beams, and furniture. It adds character and warmth.
- **Stone:** Incorporate stone walls or features, perhaps around a fireplace or as accents in your kitchen.
- **Clay:** Use clay for pottery or decorative items to enhance that earthy feel.
 
### Curved Lines and Arches

 Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to shape. Hobbit homes often feature rounded doorways and archways that soften the space. You can mimic this in your design with arched door frames, round furniture, or even circular rugs. ### Warm Color Palettes

 The color scheme in a hobbit house is warm and earthy. Think greens, browns, and soft yellows. These colors evoke the natural environment and create a cozy atmosphere. Here are some tips for incorporating warm colors into your interior design: - **Wall Colors:** Try using soft greens or warm neutrals for the walls.
- **Accent Pieces:** Use rich browns and yellows in your furniture or decor items.
- **Textiles:** Incorporate earthy tones through curtains, pillows, and throws.
 
### Cozy Nooks and Corners

 Every hobbit house has its cozy nooks. Create your own by using furniture and accessories to form intimate spaces. Add a small reading corner with a comfy chair, soft blankets, and a side table. Here’s how to achieve this: - **Furniture Arrangement:** Arrange furniture to create small, cozy groups rather than large, open spaces.
- **Lighting:** Use soft lighting in these areas to enhance the cozy vibe.
- **Plant Life:** Place indoor plants or potted herbs to bring in the outdoors.
 
### Unique Decor Elements

 Adding unique decor elements can instantly infuse your home with the spirit of a hobbit. Look for items that reflect folklore, nature, and craftsmanship. Here are some ideas: - **Crafted Furniture:** Seek out handmade tables, chairs, or shelves that tell a story.
- **Nostalgic Items:** Display vintage items that add character, like old maps or old-fashioned teapots.
- **Local Art:** Incorporate artwork that’s inspired by nature or showcases local landscapes.
 
### Soothing Textures

 Texture plays a big role in hobbit house interior design. Mixing materials can create a rich and inviting space. Consider adding the following textures: - **Soft Fabrics:** Use plush wool, cozy cotton, and gentle linens for curtains, cushions, and upholstery.
- **Natural Fibers:** Incorporate jute, hemp, or sisal for rugs and accessories.
- **Stone and Wood Touches:** Keep stone or wood elements rough to add an earthy feel.
 
### Functional and Charming Lighting

 Lighting in a hobbit house is essential to create a warm environment. Look for fixtures that offer soft light. Options might include wooden lamps, lanterns, or candles. Mixing different levels of light will help create a cozy ambiance throughout. ### Integrating Nature

 The final touch to any hobbit-inspired interior is the integration of nature. Use flowers, plants, and natural elements like stones or branches to enhance the earthy feel. Here are a few ways to do so: - **Indoor Gardens:** Create a small herb garden or plant collection on a windowsill or shelf.
- **Natural Decorations:** Use driftwood or branches as decorative items or wall art.
- **Seasonal Decor:** Change decorative elements seasonally to reflect the outdoors!
 
 Embracing these elements will help you create a hobbit house interior that feels cozy, inviting, and closely connected to nature. Whether you live in a small apartment or a sprawling home, capturing the essence of those enchanting burrows can make your space feel like a true retreat from the outside world. </div>How to Incorporate Hobbit House Aesthetics into Modern Living Spaces
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Bringing the warm, whimsical aesthetics of a Hobbit house into your modern living space can create a cozy, inviting atmosphere. Imagine a home filled with earthy tones, rustic elements, and the charm of nature. Here’s how you can create a Hobbit-inspired interior that feels both enchanting and contemporary.

### Embrace Natural Materials

One of the most significant features of Hobbit house interiors is their use of natural materials. To embody this look, consider:

- **Wood:** Utilize reclaimed wood for furniture, beams, or even flooring. The rich textures and natural imperfections give a home a story.
- **Stone:** Incorporate stone elements, such as a feature wall, fireplace, or countertops, to enhance the earthy feel.
- **Textiles:** Choose wool, linen, or cotton for upholsteries and curtains. Opt for patterns inspired by nature, like leaves and flowers.

### Warm Color Palette

A Hobbit house interior often features a warm and inviting color scheme. You can achieve this with:

- **Earthy tones:** Colors like browns, greens, and creams will make your space feel grounded.
- **Accent colors:** Add touches of soft yellows, deep reds, or subtle blues to provide visual interest without overwhelming the senses.

### Cozy Lighting

Lighting can dramatically affect the ambiance of a room. For a Hobbit house vibe, use:

- **Warm light:** Choose yellow-toned light bulbs for a soft glow that mimics candlelight.
- **Lamps and lanterns:** Incorporate decorative lamps, fairy lights, or authentic-style lanterns to create a magical feel.
- **Natural light:** Maximize windows to let in natural light, enhancing the connection to the outdoors.

### Curved Lines and Arches

Soft, flowing lines and arches are reminiscent of Hobbit design. You can incorporate this element by:

- **Furniture:** Look for furniture with rounded edges, which can counterbalance sharp angles and give your space a more inviting look.
- **Architectural features:** If feasible, add arched doorways or rounded windows to create that quintessential Hobbit feel.

### Decorate with Nature

Nature plays a vital role in Hobbit aesthetics. Here’s how you can integrate this idea into your home:

- **Indoor plants:** Choose a variety of houseplants to bring life and freshness into your home. Consider ferns, succulents, or flowering plants for added charm.
- **Natural elements:** Use branches, stones, and pinecones as decorative accents. A simple bowl of these items can represent the outdoors.
- **Artwork:** Hang bird or forest-themed artwork. You can also display nature-inspired prints or crafts.

### Functional and Cozy Spaces

The essence of a Hobbit home is in its coziness and functionality. Create spaces that invite relaxation. Consider:

- **Reading nooks:** Use a comfy chair, a soft blanket, and a good lamp to create your own little retreat.
- **Gathering areas:** Design spaces that encourage family or friend gatherings with a large dining table or a rustic coffee table surrounded by cushions.
- **Warm fires:** If possible, have a wood-burning stove or a fireplace that can act as the heart of the home.

Hobbit house aesthetics into your modern living spaces doesn't mean abandoning contemporary design. It’s all about balance. Blend these elements seamlessly to create an enchanting home that pays homage to the whimsical world of Hobbits while remaining current. By embracing natural materials, warm colors, cozy details, and inviting nature indoors, you can transform your home into a warm and delightful sanctuary that feels straight out of a fairy tale.

### Conclusion

Bringing the charm of Hobbit house interior design into your living space can create a warm and inviting atmosphere that resonates with comfort and simplicity. By embracing unique elements such as natural materials, earthy colors, and whimsical decor, you can transform any area into a cozy retreat reminiscent of the Shire. Imagine curling up in a nook adorned with vibrant cushions and wooden accents, enveloped by the embrace of nature-inspired design.

To seamlessly incorporate these Hobbit house aesthetics into modern living spaces, start by selecting furniture that boasts a handcrafted feel. Opt for rounded shapes and soft lines, reflecting the gentle curves of Hobbit architecture. Utilize light fixtures that evoke a playful yet rustic vibe, like lantern-style sconces or hanging pendant lights made from natural fibers. Potted plants can bring life to the room, adding a touch of greenery that echoes the serene landscape of the Shire.

Layering textures is key. Consider throws made from natural materials like wool or cotton, combined with wooden or stone elements that ground the space. Artwork showcasing pastoral scenes or landscapes can tie together your theme, while quirky decorative pieces, like vintage books or handmade pottery, can elevate the overall character of any room.

Embracing Hobbit house interior design is more than just a style; it's about creating a lifestyle that values simplicity, warmth, and a connection to nature. This approach fosters a sanctuary where you can relax and escape the chaos of the outside world. As you embark on this design journey, let your creativity flourish, and remember to make your space authentically yours — just like a cozy Hobbit hole, it should be a reflection of you.",1,1728547293.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

1g0dr9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1g0dr9u/best_coffee_in_bologna/,Best coffee in Bologna!,"Gday all!

Hey, I asked here recently about some third wave coffee shops, and I've found the best coffee in Bologna. Actually no, I've found the best coffee in Italy I've had so far.

Look, Italian coffee is bitter, burnt and wakes you up with its ash and hot water taste, tempered by a sugar. I'm ok with it. It's functional. 

But, finding Aroma Speciality Coffees was genuinely one of my Bologna highlights!

Totally found by accident by it appearing on my Google Maps as I was looking for other stuff. Happy accident for sure.

Lady Owner and I talked about her beans' origins, their roast level, the acidity and tasting notes in her perfect English. She made recommendations on what I'd like - and what I might not like so much. And she was right on the money each time. Really knowledgeable and super info her third wave coffee. Genuinely, an absolute delight to be in her shop talking to her about coffee and trying her different beans.

I had them as double espressos, but I'll be going back today to try her V60 method.

I can't talk about her food yet, as I was too caught up with trying her coffee, but it looked standard cafe pastries that I'll try today as well. What I CAN say though, is that she had some single origin chocolate in her shop too. She offered me a square after the god-tier coffee, and GODDAMN it was good!! I will buy a bar of that too today.

In summary: The best coffee in Bologna, and the best coffee in Italy so far that I've had. Owner amazing. Go here if you're from Australia and want a good coffee. Also go here if you're over standard Italian espresso and want a coffee that is actually nice and tasty for a change.

Recommend A+++

Hope this helps someone!

By that I mean moments in your life where it seemed as if something didn't add up in terms of timing or as if an almost similar reality merged with yours and you experienced something that was either too long or too short to be logical. I'll share one of mine that is pretty harmless.

One time me and three of my friends were all gaming together online in the week-end as we often do. At some point, one of my friends, I'll call him Vincent let's say, said that he had to walk out the dog and that he'll take a coffee break before coming back. He said he would have for 10 minutes max since he had a very small dog. 

Since the time was very short we decided to wait for him. At first we just chat patiently and whenever the 10 minutes mark arrive, we think that he is going to be late, as he usually is and sometimes he can be bothered by his family so we decide to start watching a 1 hour long video all together so we don't get bored.

Eventually, after a total of 45 minutes he comes back and asks if we're up to game, we answer on the positive but then we ask him what took him so long out of curiosity. Vincent asks what we mean by that and we explain that he took much longer so we wondered if it was his family asking him for help or something.

He said that no, he just walked out the dog, drank his coffee and came back. We told him that we have been waiting for 45 minutes for him. He starts laughing and tells us that it's impossible, he did chat with his parents a little but he assures us it took 15 minutes at maximum.

We kept explaining that all three of us had in fact, had time to wait for around 10 minutes plus over half of our 1 hour long video so no, it didn't take as little as he claimed. We tried to get to the bottom of this and he seemed pretty annoyed that we didn't believe him and he had not explanation.

There is no point for him to hide anything, usually even if something private happened he'll just say ""Oh you know, family"" and keep it there but at least he'll confirm that he was late and took more time but this instance he was hellbent on saying that he didn't take that long. It wasn't to defend anything either since we never care when he is late as we're used to it by now but it felt strange that him and us clearly didn't experience the same length of time.

Every time we bring it up with him he'll stick to his version so it's not like he is messing with us after all of that time so our best guess is that either he didn't feel the time pass so quickly (we which doubt but would be the most likely explanation), that something happened at his place and tried to dismiss it (although he could have just acknowledge the delay and give us a vague explanation or straight up lie) or in fact, a time slip.

But it's worth mentioning that when I first started doing these fasts I was literally dying for the first three days and from the fourth one things always started looking up! *


My goal for these fasts was always weight loss so l would drink coffee and use artificial sweeteners in the past but this time I really want to stick to the bit and do just water and unsweetened tea!


So if anyone else is also doing this right now, l'd be more than happy to not go through it alone lol

Welp, after getting the run around from my PCP and OBGYN, I was able to do a walk-in urine test yesterday and it turns out that I AM indeed pregnant. Two and a half years post-vasectomy and here we are, deciding what to do next. I have an appointment next Wednesday where they’ll start the bloodwork and whatnot. I don’t even know if termination is an option with my current doctor’s office or if I’ll have to see an outside clinic if we choose to go that route, heck if we can even go that route at this point...

I talked to my husband about the last post shortly after making it, he laughed at those who jumped to cheating, and then berated himself and his medical team for not following up on the vasectomy (he was never told the count was supposed to be zero… but with his ADHD it could just be he didn’t process/remember exactly what he was told). He was with me when I went it to do the walk-in test since I only had a 30-min window after work and picking up the toddlers before the doctor’s office closed to get it done, he managed to leave work early to run around with the kiddos while I waited for results. Immediately following, he went to see if he can get his count done, but was told he needs a referral from his PCP first, who happens to be on leave. Of course.

We haven’t really had a chance to sit down and process together because of work and not wanting our big kids to overhear.

Speaking of, I spoke with my eldest shortly after my post, which I guess was all for naught because she was fine after her initial freak out, since she only saw the test briefly and firmly believed that what she glimpsed was a negative result. We haven’t had the chance to do a real sit-down talk like I want because I was sick, then she was sick, and now we’re both getting over being sick but busy with school and work that we won’t have our family bonding time until this weekend.

One of the big problems is, Hubbs and I really have no one to talk with about this besides one another. We feel if we went with termination, it would be a secret we’d forever keep from our families. There are a few friends we could possibly confide in but they’ve also got a lot going on in their lives we don’t want to burden anyone with our troubles. And god the waitlist for a counselor is just disheartening.

We need to talk about it. As much as we both love kids, especially OUR kids, we just don’t feel our future, especially our near-future, is at all ready or able to support caring for another life, especially one 1000% relying on us alone. We can’t imagine adopting-out since, as much as our family will give us crap for being pregnant again, they love their nibblings. But everyone, EVERYONE we know are going through their own financial difficulties, that if we do add to our family, then it means we’re very nearly starting back at square stinking one, possibly from filing bankruptcy. We own nothing of value, are making payments on both our vehicles, credit cards, loans… it’s so painful to look at finances and know how bad off we are. To bring another life into this, our, mess? It just feels so cruel. And not just for this child, but for the children we already have. We make ends meet and they’re not wanting for much of anything, but we don’t have disposable income right now, and won’t for a while, even without the current circumstances.

So I’m here, just venting to the void, since I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. Hubbs should come to bed and we should be talking together, but he’s downstairs trying to hydrate so he isn’t hungover. I get it, if I could I’d be drinking right now too I suppose. It’s certainly not the healthiest of coping mechanisms. Sometimes I want to just yell at him that ignoring problems doesn’t help, but he’d call me a hypocrite since I’m usually the one to clam up and busy myself with life’s distractions to avoid facing harsh discussions and truths that need to be had, until it bottles up and breaks. Again, not right nor healthy. 

There’s a lot I’m leaving out, I know, so my ramblings might not make a lot of sense since I keep going back and forth in my thoughts. 

For starters, we’re a military family. Hubbs has been career and put in his paperwork to retire at the 20-year mark in a few months’ time, and plans to take advantage of the free schooling and work towards earning a degree. Maybe take a job here because the pay would be good, but it’s kind of a shithole of a town with not much for kids in the immediate area, and a HCOL area to boot. We’re at least closER to family than we have been in a long while, but it’s still a 7-hour journey to visit. We’ve stopped making the trip earlier this year when it cost us over $2000 for the week we were visiting (food, gas, lodging, entertainment…) and like I said, we just don’t have that kind of disposable income right now. 

Further background: We purchased our first house in 2019 (moved in one week and had my last miscarriage the following week, the same time the water heater broke), but we loved it and was working on all the projects to make it our forever home, had our second son in 2020, and then the military does what it always does and changed course, so we had to scramble to move across the country and sell in 2021. Our beloved canine companion died from an unknown illness just two months before moving (this was so hard since it was so sudden and he had been with us around the world since 2011), the truck we owned broke down two days before we were scheduled to leave, and the  other car we had and used to get here died shortly upon our arrival. So having to buy two new-to-us used vehicles during the peak of prices was absolutely disgusting, with the bittersweetness of finding out I’m pregnant before we even started to get settled. What little we made on our house we sold went to preparing for the birth of our last babe in 2022 and down-payments for the vehicles. We’ve been “in survival mode” ever since it feels, literally just trying to get through life day by day.

I’ve got houseful of kids to keep alive and well, a husband who was already on the verge of a breakdown before finding out we’re expecting again (this started and led to him submitting his retirement paperwork, but he’s been seeing a psychiatrist to help him through the worst of it), absolutely no safeguard for the future within the next 6 months, a dryer that stopped heating, a car that stopped air-conditioning, the holidays coming up, and my own boss that’s become so passive-aggressive it’s making a job I love into such a headache that I’ve contemplated quitting but just my little bit of income helps keep our heads above water of just barely… I just feel so stupid and judged for winding up pregnant AGAIN. Everyone has heard Husband and me say we’re done and happy, hence the vasectomy! Thinking about having to tell work that I’m pregnant again? The cost of childcare? Hell, even the ability to find decent care…?! Yeah, if we keep this pregnancy and have another child, I would have to switch back into being the SAHP and really get a handle on our finances…. So having to tell work I’m pregnant AND have to quit… siiiiiiigh. 

Also to add that our beloved black-gargoyle-of-a-house-cat has been missing for over a month as of this weekend, and my heart breaks at having to accept that she’s most likely lost to us for good. She was my furbaby who had also traveled much of the world with us. The loss of her combined with everything else going on has just made me so… incredibly sad.

I did NOT mean to enter “insanity mode” in this part of our game of life. But here we are.

I’m off to try to sleep off the nausea. The food aversion has already started and I can’t enjoy coffee in the morning, or much of anything now that my sense of smell has gone haywire. Hopefully tomorrow I’ll go shopping and indulge in some crackers to keep by my bedside to help stave-off the morning sickness for as long as possible.

The following morning, the pair of siblings remained on the premises of Petro’s longer than what they’d initially considered; each awoke with a hangover and slept late and when they did arrange their gear and descend the stairs to the barroom, Petro was angled over the stove behind the bar and the smell of pepper and ham greeted them. They took to a booth and ate the tough meat with hard bread and Petro occasionally started with conversation only for it to peter out in the morning dullness; the barman played Bill Evans from the speaker, and this added to the dreamish scene. They enjoyed cowboy coffee cooked with an egg; Petro insisted on its flavor, but neither of the travelers had a liking for it, though Trinity did comment, seemingly for the sake of kindness, on its unique profile. Petro beamed and nodded.

After breakfast, Trinity took the appropriated repeater rifle to a local pawnbroker at the direction offered by Petro. Hoichi remained with the barman, and they chatted idly in the hunchback’s absence. The warmth between the barman and the clown persisted from the previous night and Petro removed an old checkers board from a hidey hole and commented how he’d lost some pieces, but they could use some rocks he’d found to replace them.

Trinity left the place and though they’d overslept, Dallas seemed well awake; already, the barkers from across Dealey called out and the slave auctions began again. Briefly, she stood there, by a marred lamppost on the sidewalk, and vaguely watched the goings-on. The man in leathers was not there with his caravan.

She took down South Houston Street and along the way, city folk passed her by without notice; being a hunchback, her eyes remained averted to the legs of those around her and her angled gait dispersed whatever throng she came to. Although no one accosted her, there were those that mumbled apologies, surprise, or comments they did not believe she could hear.

The day’s sky was yellow with pink cloud streaks.

Manure rose above even the smell of raw-food market stalls casually dressed along either sidewalk of South Houston—Trinity maneuvered with some difficulty around the crowds there till she recognized the place which Petro had told her about. Across the street, there stood a lamppost which bent over, unlike the others installed throughout Dallas she’d thus seen, and she waited for a moment to dart across the street.

Upon standing in front of the pawnbroker’s, there was no great indication what sort of place it was, besides the hand-chiseled placard on the door which read: We By and Sell.

She pushed through the door, silvery rifle slung over her shoulder, and after dealing with the man behind the counter—a great-headed elderly fellow—and selling the rifle outright, she left the place hurriedly; she was stopped though, deftly by a hand grabbing ahold of her elbow. Trinity swung around and was confronted by the narrow face of the man in leathers—he grinned. Upon her glaring at the hand which he’d grabbed her with, he let go and put both of his gloved hands up and chuckled long. He remained in leathers; his hat swung across his shoulder blades from the cord around his throat. His hair stood on ends like he’d only just awoken himself.

“I meant no offense,” said the man in leathers, “But I noticed you last night at that bar. I couldn’t stop thinking about you, of course, and I kept thinking about the color of your skin and how nice it was. It is immaculate.”

Trinity straightened herself away from the man and angled with a forearm against the strangely bent lamppost. “My skin?” she asked. The bustle of people on the street seemed lesser with the crowds at the markets across the thoroughfare. Still, a few passersby came and went and paid neither of them standing on the sidewalk any mind.

“Of course.” he said. The man meticulously removed his gloves then he held them like a set of rags and batted them into his open palm while searching the street. Lorries and trucks and wagons went on. “Your skin—last night anyway—had a purple hue to it in the light of that bar. It must’ve reacted strangely to the pigment. The lights, I mean.” He shook his head and though his grin remained, his eyes did not smile at all. “Seeing it in the daylight like this, it’s like chocolate. It’s like a deep rich candy. It contains a warmth when interacting with the light of the sun; you glow.”

Trinity bit the inside of her cheek and attempted to brush by the man in leathers, but he put a friendly hand up and shook his head again. “Let me go,” said Trinity, “I’ll scream.”

His smile became rectangular—it was an expression between joy and a primeval urge. “Do you oil it? Do you keep it well?” he asked.

“What the fuck is your problem?” Each of her fists—one of which still held the scratch she’d gotten for the sale of the rifle—protested audibly at her squeezing her nails into the fats of her thumbs. The sidewalk on that side of Houston Street was becoming sparse of people.

“Hey!” said the man in leathers; he snapped his fingers in front of Trinity’s face, “Do you keep your skin hydrated?”

“I’ll scream,” she repeated.

The man in leathers threw his head back, bellowed loudly a noise like a shriek. No one stopped what they were doing. The customers and vendors across the street did not so much as look in their direction. He came in close to Trinity—so close that she recoiled. He smacked his lips then wormed his tongue around the inside of his closed mouth. “What do you say we get out of here?” he asked her, “Come, lost lamb.”

Trinity trembled then spasmed in fright as the door of the pawnbroker spilled open. The man from before, which she’d sold the rifle to, called out to them, “You alright?”

“We’re fine,” said the man in leathers.

“I was leaving, and this strange man came up to me,” said Trinity.

The pawnbroker raised a single bushy eyebrow.

The man in leathers guffawed and placed an arm around Trinity’s shoulder. “I was only helping her,” he told the pawnbroker,  “I don’t think she’s from around here and she seems quite lost.”

The pawnbroker lifted an arthritic clawlike hand to the back of his head and scratched behind his ear. “You should leave her alone now,” he said plainly; his words did not contain the venom of an overt threat.

The man in leathers stood the way he was with Trinity under his arm for seconds and waited on the sidewalk; he looked frozen there like a man stopped in time. No emotion could be discerned from his face—it wasn’t the face of a man, but the face of a creature beyond sight, the face of a thing never seen. There was nothing and then like a queer animatronic, the man in leathers leapt from the side of Trinity, put up both of his hands and laughed. “Of course,” he said.

Trinity unclenched her fists and fled from the man and took down the sidewalk, restraining her breaths.

“Hey!” called the man in leathers.

She had only made it a few yards from the man. Trinity swallowed, pivoted around to see the man standing there, leaning against the strangely bent lamppost.

“You’ve dropped this!” he called after her. He held up the scratch which she’d dropped. “Thought you might want it back.”

She glanced at the pawnbroker which still stood there in his doorway; though he remained, his gaze had gone across the street to where the vendors were. “T-thanks,” said Trinity upon closing the distance between them. She reached out to grab the money from the man in leathers, but he maintained his grip and kept that alien smile. It was primitive and it glistened and reflected what sunlight came through the gathering red clouds.

A gas-powered car backfired as it drove by, and Trinity flinched and the man in leathers remained still.

She ripped the money free from his hand and took away without anything further.

The pawnbroker returned to his store and the man in leathers remained on the sidewalk, gazing after Trinity till she disappeared, and he returned the gloves to his hands and flexed his fingers there; the skin of the gloves creaked when he did that. He lifted the ragged leather hat to his head and tugged it over his mess of hair.

Black shadow horizons stood in all directions and the siblings fled across the wasteland. They made good time from Dallas and then Fort Worth came ahead, and they rounded the city’s edges without entering.

The added gear—canteens, cutlery, cookware—they purchased swung from their belts and from their packs. In the dawn, the two took on brown robes so there on the cusp of morning, the pair seemed like two dark ghosts against the paling sky.

They carried on with only each other and spoke infrequently during their travels, but at night, they camped by lowlight and cooked canned goods or chewed on pemmican and spoke in cheerful whispers. Sometimes Trinity sang and sometimes Hoichi joined her, but mostly he listened and applauded his sister’s voice; no one ever applauded the hunchback’s voice, but the clown did.

Some nights they slept separately and some nights they slept bundled together and stared at the stars and breathed their conversations into one another’s faces. It was light and fast travel, and they put days and miles behind and soon they were leaving signs which read: Weatherford and they spoke about the west in grand terms. Neither knew what the future held—neither knew what waited for them in the west. There was the vague idea of non-Republican city-states, and reservations, and whatever.

Perhaps Petro was right, and the world was all the same everywhere—there was truth to it, but not an entire truth.

Soon, the slaver and Dallas both became darkened places in their minds, and they brought it up less frequently.

On amiable nights, whenever fellow travelers spotted them, Hoichi hid the earless spots on the sides of his head with a wrap and Trinity remained seated and they invited others to join their camp and something like ‘commerce’ came and went and the strangers changed, but the conversations remained the same. “Where are you going?”, “What’s it like where you come from?”, “I’d like to see the North Country before I die.”

Always, the clown joked. Many times, Trinity asked why Hoichi did so and performed crass, and often he gave the same answer: “I am a clown. It is what they expect. A dog barks and a bird flies.”

Seemingly, this response did not sit well with Trintiy, because often she tried to tease more from her greatest friend, but the answer continued to remain a variation of: “A dog barks and a bird flies.”

Of course, she persisted and told him he was not an animal and to this he merely shrugged and offered a noise without any real follow-up.

The wastes, as it was in the time after the first deluge, expanded in all directions with warped ecology, it was deadened land, but it was not such an infrequent occurrence that a traveler might come upon some family, some rag-tag clan, some group of survivors—that’s what they were—and human faces were abundant in comparison to what would come. The catastrophe of the second deluge neared. No one knew.

Skies, pink and splattered with blood-mark clouds, seemed to go on to eternity. The dead world was all around, and in the day, a person could sit underneath that sky and wonder beyond reason. If not for mutants, demons, the monstrosities which lurked here and there, it would remain tranquil. There was otherwise absolute deathly silence. But on nights, long nights where the pink sky went to gray then to full black then even the stars and moon seemed to give no good light, those things came up from the earth and from the derelict places possessed by the old world, and looked on this strange desolate land with glass-eyed visages and slithered and lumbered and scanned the darkness for something to eat like beasts fresh from hibernation.

On the long nights, the nights which seemed colder than others—these were the nights which Trinity and Hoichi gathered into some alcove or crevasse and kept body-close together, and they sometimes witnessed in glances the yellow glowing eyes of the mutants which stalked from whatever place they perched.

Often, Hoichi gazed in wonder at the creatures and then turned to his travelling companion and asked her, “It feels like they’re looking right at us when I see those eyes?” The end of his words always came with the elevation of a question; it might’ve been a hope that there was any doubt.

Trinity calmed him when he became this way and told him it was unlikely—she would carry on about how she’d seen many mutants, and even demons, and she told how a person would know when they were stalked by those things, surely. This was a lie though. She did not know. Still, they comforted each other in these ways.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity saw the caravan from Lubbock first and notified her brother and they took to scattered refuse—debris and garbage—along the easternmost side of US-84; the dual roads were cracked from yellow grass and neglect and they lowered to the ground in their robes, and they held to their gear to keep it from clanking. The two of them spied on the caravan.

“That’s a lot of people,” said Hoichi.

Trinity pinched her mouth shut so wrinkles formed around her lips, and she shook her head. Her mouth opened, but no words came, so she shut it again. They watched.

Upon the caravan’s approach, the pair of them rose from their prone positions and hesitantly waited and watched and continued to whisper to one another. Hoichi angled higher from the ground with his knees beneath himself and it was only when the pair of them gathered enough details about the caravan that they wrestled from the ground entirely, patting their robes.

Hoichi called to those passing and the caravan from Lubbock called in return and stopped.

Evening came on so everyone and everything was bathed in abstract haze.

The caravan consisted of several vehicles—some carried by electricity, and some carried by horses or mules—and many walkers. Tanker trucks relaxed on their axles as the drivers braked and the work animals beat their shoed hooves against the road. It was the kindly faces of children which eventually spurred the siblings to greet the troupe openly.

The vehicles halted completely, and the Lubbock people came from their perches and the walkers gathered to the fore and among them were merchants and travelers looking for safety in numbers; so, the word was the Lubbock people were on their way to Fort Worth for a delivery of oil.

Trinity and Hoichi dealt with the merchants and reupped their dwindled supplies of water and rations and while doing so, a scrawny fellow with straw-colored hair and freckles emerged from the crowd—a group of young girls, fifteen in total, followed the freckled gentleman. The girls varied in age from twelve to sixteen and all wore matching, blue-faded dresses—the hems of which exposed the hairier shins of the eldest girls.

The man butted into the conversations and asked the pair where they headed.

“West,” said Trinity.

The man’s voice was narcotic smooth, “West is a direction like any other, but I mean to ask your destination.”

“Does it matter?” asked Hoichi.

The man smiled and revealed a smoking pipe which he kept and stood to lift a boot from the ground to knock the loose ash from its chamber by banging it against his heel. “Oh, I don’t mean to pry.” He stood properly and examined his pipe and blew across the open mouth of the chamber. “I’m Tandy O’Clery,” he offered out his free hand and Hoichi took it to shake; the man’s smile radiated.

The siblings offered their names, and the merchants dispersed to their carriages while the uniformed girls remained following Tandy; each of the girls remained silent. The sun dipped further over the western horizon and against the shadow-blackening fields in all directions, Tandy offered for them to camp with the troupe for the night.

Between the dual roads, the caravan cooked around a series of low fires with iron cookware and offered their guests both food and drink openly, especially Tandy. The display had the comfort of a small settlement once the merchants and troupe and travelers unpacked their belongings. When the siblings offered their own rations for adding to the meager feast, they were turned away and told to eat and not to worry.

After their meal, they languished casually around the fire, stuffed.

With night came a chill so everyone sat around the embers in groupings and drank wine—Tandy lit his pipe while he sat in a metal folding chair alongside a fire, and the smoke which came from it stank, but not like tobacco.

Hoichi and Trinity took to the hard earth on their bottoms alongside Tandy and absently stared into the fire—lining the circle opposite them were the uniformed girls.

Though the girls little prior, they now spilled themselves emphatically, guffawed, and even told stories to one another from their side of the campfire.

“Who are they?” Trinity asked Tandy.

Smoke bellowed from Tandy’s open mouth as he lazily slanted his head across the back of the chair and stared at the starry sky. “The girls?” he asked.

“Yeah.” The pair of them spoke lowly enough to not garner the girls’ attention. “Why are they all dressed like that?”

“I bring music to this world. Their parents say it’s for them. They are called ‘The Hollies’ in Lubbock—a musical choir I’ve been authorized to instruct.”

“They sing?” asked Trinity.

Hoichi studied the ground beneath him, plucked sickly yellow grass from a clump beside his foot and tossed it into the campfire; he watched it shrivel as it burst into flame. Everything, save the vehicles which were cast in the orange glow of firelight, looked to be a part of another world entirely—a world of absolute darkness. It was only this.

Tandy nodded at the hunchback. “They sing. I direct them to sing, so they do.”

Silence followed; Tandy smoked more, and Trinity took whatever drinks the ‘The Hollies’ handed her—she finished them quickly with gusto. Hoichi abstained and simply leveled back on his palms where he sat with his legs crossed and he put his head back as though examining the sky.

Hoichi broke the silence from their side of the campfire, “Trinity sings sometimes. She’s very good.”

Trinity flubbed her words around a mouthful of drink so the only thing which arose from her was a splat of wine across the earth.

The choir director, pipe still in hand, adjusted himself straighter in the chair, “You sing? Are you any good?” His grin shined in the darkness from the lowlight.

The hunchback shook her head and choked the wine which she’d kept in her mouth; after gasping then laughing, she pulled a bit of excess robe from around her sleeve and swiped her mouth dry with it. “Hoichi is my backup. I can’t sing without my backup, isn’t that right?” She leveled a wry grin in the direction of her brother.

The clown shook his head and continued stargazing. “I’m too tired to sing.”

“Me too then.”

Tandy puffed smoke and set the pipe by his foot and angled forward in the small folding chair; it creaked beneath even his wiry frame. “That’s a shame.”

“Were you looking for more to join your choir? In the market for talent?” asked the hunchback.

Tandy placed his chin in his hand and swiveled his entire body like shaking his head. “Oof,” he groaned, “I wish we had set out earlier in the day. It was nearly evening already when we set off from Lubbock.” Tandy shrugged then relaxed his body and fell back onto the chair dramatically. “It’s no worry, I suppose. We won’t miss the concert. It’s many days out.”

“How do you pick the girls?” asked the clown.

Tandy cocked his head and bit into his bottom lip before saying, “I don’t pick them. It’s the parents. The parents pay for their education—the choir is only one part of that education, you understand?”

The choir director lifted his pipe once more and took a few more puffs before corralling the conversation, “Oh! I asked you two before where you were going and you said ‘west’. I wonder if there was anything out west you were searching for.”

Trinity finished her latest drink of wine and sat it by her legs. “Freedom,” she said, “Someplace free, I think.”

“What a word,” said Tandy, “Freedom? I wonder if it’s a thing that’s real.”

Trinity’s expression became severe for a moment, long in the shadow. “That’s an easier thing for you to say.”

Tandy nodded, “Maybe you’re right.”

The clown interjected, “Tucson? Phoenix? I wonder if the reservations take anyone.”

“You have thought of anywhere further north?” asked Tandy.

“Vegas?”

“Stop thinking west. Besides, what I mean is further north than that even.”

“I wouldn’t know it well.”

“You should,” said Tandy, “It might be worth a shot.” He paused, cast his visage to the fire then lifted himself from the chair and moseyed into the nearby darkness where trash wood laid. He returned with an armful, cast it into the embers then fell into the chair again. “Anyway, I hope whatever you’re running from never catches you.”

“Who said we’re running?” asked Trinity.

Tandy shrugged, “Maybe you’re not. I hope you’re not. It’s harder to run than anything else. I’ve run forever myself.”

Trinity crossed her arms, gathered her robe around her; the firelight grew with replenishment and the circle became brighter and the choir girls chattered. “You’ve been running? From what?”

Tandy nodded, “I’ve been running from death forever. I’m immortal, I guess.” He broadened his shoulders by winging his elbows outward and he craned forward on his chair; he intentionally locked eyes with the pair, glancing his gaze betwixt them for some seconds. The siblings shifted where they sat and then Tandy burst out laughing. “I’m kidding!” he cried, “Who’d believe that, anyway?” He settled back on his chair and rested his hands in his lap and tilted back at the sky. “I do hope you’re not running from anything. Intuition tells me you are, but that’s none of my business. You’ve each got a scared look like someone’s after you.” He shrugged.

Hoichi stood and removed himself from the light of the fire and no one called after him while Trinity remained and took another cup of drink from the choir girls. He went into the outer darkness of the camp rings and relieved himself and stared into the vast westward nothing. Upon finishing, he pivoted to look north, where the road went, and he quietly whispered in the direction, “Lubbock?”

A shriek popped the silence and Hoichi moved quickly to the nearest wagon for cover and his eyes darted around madly; the people knotted around the fires became erratic in the darkness and he fled in the direction of his sister.

She stood by the peculiar choir director where he was flanked by the girls. Trinity moved to Hoichi and they stood dumbly by the firelight, eyes scanning the scrambling crowd of Lubbock folks. Shouts came further north—in the direction of the other parked vehicles—and upon Tandy’s movement, all the rest followed.

Upon winding through the overturned pots, pans, sundries, chairs, and lit fires, they stumbled through the throng gathered off the eastern shoulder of the road where yellow grass grew sparsely; onlookers shouted. All the merchants and travelers were there and two groups of them yanked on dual ropes which led tautly into the dark. Some heavy thing grunted in the shadows in response to the pull.

Hoichi and Trinity held onto one another; her nails pressed into his forearm. The pair of them did not breathe and watched the spectacle.

The tug-o’-war groups protested with groans and shouts and expletives as they offered a final yank. Those gathered, leveled lights in the direction of the thing in the dark, and as it exploded into the light, those watching stumbled over themselves and over each other to remove themselves from the creature’s presence. It was a sick mess displayed in the dancing lights of those panicked travelers.

The creature, finally observable as all those people gathered their wits and directed their lights appropriately, was cancerous incarnate; its pinkish body was coated in something like watery jissom—it was that which the thing excreted to ease its abysmal movement wherever it dragged itself along. It was a great oblong mass of twisted limbs and faces; its many eyes blinked as the thing shifted unnaturally.

Those gathered, tugged on the ropes to ensure the security of the thing while Hoichi and Trinity fell to the wayside. The ropes’ ends not in the hands of the Lubbock folks were bound to hooks and those hooks had sunk deep into the mushy flesh of the creature. Merchants and mercenaries and vagabonds pushed through the crowd to get a look at the thing while the siblings muttered to one another.

Tandy shouted for the choir girls to return to their camp; the man snapped his fingers and the normally jovial cherubic quality in his face was gone—he spoke sharply, looked angry, and stomped at any rebuttal the choir girls offered.

Everyone else wanted a look at the thing—everyone besides the siblings.

After some deliberation—the Lubbock folks tossed stones at the creature and trash wood too—they gathered up the courage to stab the thing with makeshift pikes and an overzealous woman among them fired a bullet from a carbine. Still, the thing writhed; its many mouths dotting its tongue-like body, gasped for air and sighed like whistles. The Lubbock folks growled primitively and whooped at the creature and further spilled its blood by jamming those pikes into the soft flesh. Only when it stopped moving did they elect to soak the thing with what oil was nearby.

They yanked the thing away from the vehicles and into the vast open eastern land then cut their ropes and when the thing came alight, the long-shadowed faces of the Lubbock folks stood against it as they watched and while they were watching the thing squeal and burn, Trinity and Hoichi watched the Lubbock folks.

Tandy called to the siblings and motioned for them to follow back to his camp, and they did, and they took around the campfire while the Lubbock folks participated in spectacle. The sky remained the same, the dirt beneath their feet was the same, and they were all they could be.

The camp remained quiet and many of the girls sat there too—others angled on their tiptoes to glimpse in the direction of the great bonfire across the way, but it was difficult with the arranged vehicles. Voices from far off called and couldn’t be deciphered, nor did anyone try. The choir camp sat and watched the fire and did not speak and Hoichi plucked at the yellow grass around his feet and tossed it into the fire.

“What was that thing?” asked one of the choir girls; her face was cut from distorted shadow, as all theirs were.

Tandy stamped his boot dully against the earth while he sat in his chair—hair hung in his face. He moved for his pipe and lit it and called for another girl to grab more wood and she did, and he puffed the pipe with a look of consternation. The girl dumped the wood and all that could be heard besides the far spectacle was the crackle of the fire. Then Tandy removed a flute and began to blow into it; no song came—he merely played with the thing and examined it in his hand like a toy. The choir director continued puffing on his pipe.

Finally, Trinity broke the camp’s silence, “It was a mutant. I’ve seen them before.”

Tandy placed the pipe and the flute to the side and smiled so smally it might not have happened. “You know the story behind it then?” he asked.

“Behind the mutants?” Trinity adjusted how she sat, again pulled her robes around herself tighter.

Tandy nodded, “About that kind of mutant. It is interesting,” he nodded again, seemingly to himself more than anyone, “Aristophanes, an old dead guy, said humans were split apart. So, we are to search the earth for our soulmate. Sometimes that soulmate is found, and sometimes the love from the reconnection is so powerful that what was once separate can then again be reunited. But,” he trailed off and leaned far back in his chair, so much that it looked like the thing might break from the way he was, “But, either the love is tainted or the love is too strong, and it consumes. It grows and grows and takes in everything from everyone that touches it. Even those not of the original pairing of soulmates. Some people call it a fiend, some call it cancer, some call it other things, I know.”

Hoichi, legs crossed, angled back on his palms, “What are you talking about?”

Tandy swept his hair back, “You saw it,” he angled to look at the choir girls—each of them were now craned toward his talking, “I know some of you saw it too. It has many eyes, many mouths, many arms and legs, and all the many pieces we too possess, plus whatever else was added in its consumption.”

Trinity asked, “It’s human?”

“It was,” he nodded, “At one point, it was many different humans. Now, those mutants, they only consume. If you were to touch it, it would swallow you whole, make you one with its many.”

“Is it true?” asked the hunchback.

“Is what?”

“You were talking about soulmates before. About tainted love or love that’s too powerful.”

Tandy guffawed theatrically, “I made it up! I don’t know anything about them. I know it eats you. I know it makes you one of its many.” He tilted his head to the side, planting his cheek in his hand. “Legion. Mhm. Maybe that would be a good name for it, then.”

“You lied?” asked Hoichi.

Tandy nodded, “Sure. Stories make sense of reality. It felt better when you thought it meant something, didn’t it?”

No one answered.

“Well,” said the choir director while leaping to his feet, “Maybe it doesn’t make you feel better. My travelling companions are burning a monster in a field tonight and I’m going to bed.” He turned his attention to his young charges, “You too.”

I have a manager who impulsively picks their thumb cuticles, we work in hospo and they are dear to me. They usually work on the coffee machine, and as such has often ingrained coffee grounds or muck that get into their raw skin and heal over, akin to temp tattoos. 

I am a nail biter (or cleaner if any of y’all relate) and know that it’s not a ‘fix’ I’m looking for, but they have admitted plenty of times their frustration with themselves and and wanted to give them something to help with it. I know a general hand moisturiser is a bit of a shit gift and wanted to know if any of you had any insight on things that could help.

Aware that it’s 100% psychological, as is mine, but they are going on an overseas trip within the next year and is planning on proposing to their partner. They’ve expressed want to fix this problem before the proposal. 

Not sure if this makes sense, but am trying to give them a gift that specifically helps the ‘bottom of the cliff’ problem, rather than trying to insert myself into their psyche. Obviously a sit down, or insertion into their life isn’t okay, but I wanted to show a thoughtful way of displaying my care for them. This unprovoked, so perhaps I am over stepping.

 Including but not limited to - mentioning the nails after she showed bi bracelet, alluding to dysphoria when she brought it up and saying ""I can neither confirm nor deny"" when she asked if/what kind I have, saying I'm going to turn into a crazy car lady when I turn 50. 

I kind of forgot to eat anything today, but as I actually *haven't* been starving myself lately so my food battery isn't that low. I ate 6 slices of French toast at 9pm once I realized the only thing I had today was a coffee. And as long as we're on the topic of self care, I really need to start getting to bed earlier... My sleep battery*is* quite low. Consistent 3-4am nights are not good...

The following morning, the pair of siblings remained on the premises of Petro’s longer than what they’d initially considered; each awoke with a hangover and slept late and when they did arrange their gear and descend the stairs to the barroom, Petro was angled over the stove behind the bar and the smell of pepper and ham greeted them. They took to a booth and ate the tough meat with hard bread and Petro occasionally started with conversation only for it to peter out in the morning dullness; the barman played Bill Evans from the speaker, and this added to the dreamish scene. They enjoyed cowboy coffee cooked with an egg; Petro insisted on its flavor, but neither of the travelers had a liking for it, though Trinity did comment, seemingly for the sake of kindness, on its unique profile. Petro beamed and nodded.

After breakfast, Trinity took the appropriated repeater rifle to a local pawnbroker at the direction offered by Petro. Hoichi remained with the barman, and they chatted idly in the hunchback’s absence. The warmth between the barman and the clown persisted from the previous night and Petro removed an old checkers board from a hidey hole and commented how he’d lost some pieces, but they could use some rocks he’d found to replace them.

Trinity left the place and though they’d overslept, Dallas seemed well awake; already, the barkers from across Dealey called out and the slave auctions began again. Briefly, she stood there, by a marred lamppost on the sidewalk, and vaguely watched the goings-on. The man in leathers was not there with his caravan.

She took down South Houston Street and along the way, city folk passed her by without notice; being a hunchback, her eyes remained averted to the legs of those around her and her angled gait dispersed whatever throng she came to. Although no one accosted her, there were those that mumbled apologies, surprise, or comments they did not believe she could hear.

The day’s sky was yellow with pink cloud streaks.

Manure rose above even the smell of raw-food market stalls casually dressed along either sidewalk of South Houston—Trinity maneuvered with some difficulty around the crowds there till she recognized the place which Petro had told her about. Across the street, there stood a lamppost which bent over, unlike the others installed throughout Dallas she’d thus seen, and she waited for a moment to dart across the street.

Upon standing in front of the pawnbroker’s, there was no great indication what sort of place it was, besides the hand-chiseled placard on the door which read: We By and Sell.

She pushed through the door, silvery rifle slung over her shoulder, and after dealing with the man behind the counter—a great-headed elderly fellow—and selling the rifle outright, she left the place hurriedly; she was stopped though, deftly by a hand grabbing ahold of her elbow. Trinity swung around and was confronted by the narrow face of the man in leathers—he grinned. Upon her glaring at the hand which he’d grabbed her with, he let go and put both of his gloved hands up and chuckled long. He remained in leathers; his hat swung across his shoulder blades from the cord around his throat. His hair stood on ends like he’d only just awoken himself.

“I meant no offense,” said the man in leathers, “But I noticed you last night at that bar. I couldn’t stop thinking about you, of course, and I kept thinking about the color of your skin and how nice it was. It is immaculate.”

Trinity straightened herself away from the man and angled with a forearm against the strangely bent lamppost. “My skin?” she asked. The bustle of people on the street seemed lesser with the crowds at the markets across the thoroughfare. Still, a few passersby came and went and paid neither of them standing on the sidewalk any mind.

“Of course.” he said. The man meticulously removed his gloves then he held them like a set of rags and batted them into his open palm while searching the street. Lorries and trucks and wagons went on. “Your skin—last night anyway—had a purple hue to it in the light of that bar. It must’ve reacted strangely to the pigment. The lights, I mean.” He shook his head and though his grin remained, his eyes did not smile at all. “Seeing it in the daylight like this, it’s like chocolate. It’s like a deep rich candy. It contains a warmth when interacting with the light of the sun; you glow.”

Trinity bit the inside of her cheek and attempted to brush by the man in leathers, but he put a friendly hand up and shook his head again. “Let me go,” said Trinity, “I’ll scream.”

His smile became rectangular—it was an expression between joy and a primeval urge. “Do you oil it? Do you keep it well?” he asked.

“What the fuck is your problem?” Each of her fists—one of which still held the scratch she’d gotten for the sale of the rifle—protested audibly at her squeezing her nails into the fats of her thumbs. The sidewalk on that side of Houston Street was becoming sparse of people.

“Hey!” said the man in leathers; he snapped his fingers in front of Trinity’s face, “Do you keep your skin hydrated?”

“I’ll scream,” she repeated.

The man in leathers threw his head back, bellowed loudly a noise like a shriek. No one stopped what they were doing. The customers and vendors across the street did not so much as look in their direction. He came in close to Trinity—so close that she recoiled. He smacked his lips then wormed his tongue around the inside of his closed mouth. “What do you say we get out of here?” he asked her, “Come, lost lamb.”

Trinity trembled then spasmed in fright as the door of the pawnbroker spilled open. The man from before, which she’d sold the rifle to, called out to them, “You alright?”

“We’re fine,” said the man in leathers.

“I was leaving, and this strange man came up to me,” said Trinity.

The pawnbroker raised a single bushy eyebrow.

The man in leathers guffawed and placed an arm around Trinity’s shoulder. “I was only helping her,” he told the pawnbroker,  “I don’t think she’s from around here and she seems quite lost.”

The pawnbroker lifted an arthritic clawlike hand to the back of his head and scratched behind his ear. “You should leave her alone now,” he said plainly; his words did not contain the venom of an overt threat.

The man in leathers stood the way he was with Trinity under his arm for seconds and waited on the sidewalk; he looked frozen there like a man stopped in time. No emotion could be discerned from his face—it wasn’t the face of a man, but the face of a creature beyond sight, the face of a thing never seen. There was nothing and then like a queer animatronic, the man in leathers leapt from the side of Trinity, put up both of his hands and laughed. “Of course,” he said.

Trinity unclenched her fists and fled from the man and took down the sidewalk, restraining her breaths.

“Hey!” called the man in leathers.

She had only made it a few yards from the man. Trinity swallowed, pivoted around to see the man standing there, leaning against the strangely bent lamppost.

“You’ve dropped this!” he called after her. He held up the scratch which she’d dropped. “Thought you might want it back.”

She glanced at the pawnbroker which still stood there in his doorway; though he remained, his gaze had gone across the street to where the vendors were. “T-thanks,” said Trinity upon closing the distance between them. She reached out to grab the money from the man in leathers, but he maintained his grip and kept that alien smile. It was primitive and it glistened and reflected what sunlight came through the gathering red clouds.

A gas-powered car backfired as it drove by, and Trinity flinched and the man in leathers remained still.

She ripped the money free from his hand and took away without anything further.

The pawnbroker returned to his store and the man in leathers remained on the sidewalk, gazing after Trinity till she disappeared, and he returned the gloves to his hands and flexed his fingers there; the skin of the gloves creaked when he did that. He lifted the ragged leather hat to his head and tugged it over his mess of hair.

Black shadow horizons stood in all directions and the siblings fled across the wasteland. They made good time from Dallas and then Fort Worth came ahead, and they rounded the city’s edges without entering.

The added gear—canteens, cutlery, cookware—they purchased swung from their belts and from their packs. In the dawn, the two took on brown robes so there on the cusp of morning, the pair seemed like two dark ghosts against the paling sky.

They carried on with only each other and spoke infrequently during their travels, but at night, they camped by lowlight and cooked canned goods or chewed on pemmican and spoke in cheerful whispers. Sometimes Trinity sang and sometimes Hoichi joined her, but mostly he listened and applauded his sister’s voice; no one ever applauded the hunchback’s voice, but the clown did.

Some nights they slept separately and some nights they slept bundled together and stared at the stars and breathed their conversations into one another’s faces. It was light and fast travel, and they put days and miles behind and soon they were leaving signs which read: Weatherford and they spoke about the west in grand terms. Neither knew what the future held—neither knew what waited for them in the west. There was the vague idea of non-Republican city-states, and reservations, and whatever.

Perhaps Petro was right, and the world was all the same everywhere—there was truth to it, but not an entire truth.

Soon, the slaver and Dallas both became darkened places in their minds, and they brought it up less frequently.

On amiable nights, whenever fellow travelers spotted them, Hoichi hid the earless spots on the sides of his head with a wrap and Trinity remained seated and they invited others to join their camp and something like ‘commerce’ came and went and the strangers changed, but the conversations remained the same. “Where are you going?”, “What’s it like where you come from?”, “I’d like to see the North Country before I die.”

Always, the clown joked. Many times, Trinity asked why Hoichi did so and performed crass, and often he gave the same answer: “I am a clown. It is what they expect. A dog barks and a bird flies.”

Seemingly, this response did not sit well with Trintiy, because often she tried to tease more from her greatest friend, but the answer continued to remain a variation of: “A dog barks and a bird flies.”

Of course, she persisted and told him he was not an animal and to this he merely shrugged and offered a noise without any real follow-up.

The wastes, as it was in the time after the first deluge, expanded in all directions with warped ecology, it was deadened land, but it was not such an infrequent occurrence that a traveler might come upon some family, some rag-tag clan, some group of survivors—that’s what they were—and human faces were abundant in comparison to what would come. The catastrophe of the second deluge neared. No one knew.

Skies, pink and splattered with blood-mark clouds, seemed to go on to eternity. The dead world was all around, and in the day, a person could sit underneath that sky and wonder beyond reason. If not for mutants, demons, the monstrosities which lurked here and there, it would remain tranquil. There was otherwise absolute deathly silence. But on nights, long nights where the pink sky went to gray then to full black then even the stars and moon seemed to give no good light, those things came up from the earth and from the derelict places possessed by the old world, and looked on this strange desolate land with glass-eyed visages and slithered and lumbered and scanned the darkness for something to eat like beasts fresh from hibernation.

On the long nights, the nights which seemed colder than others—these were the nights which Trinity and Hoichi gathered into some alcove or crevasse and kept body-close together, and they sometimes witnessed in glances the yellow glowing eyes of the mutants which stalked from whatever place they perched.

Often, Hoichi gazed in wonder at the creatures and then turned to his travelling companion and asked her, “It feels like they’re looking right at us when I see those eyes?” The end of his words always came with the elevation of a question; it might’ve been a hope that there was any doubt.

Trinity calmed him when he became this way and told him it was unlikely—she would carry on about how she’d seen many mutants, and even demons, and she told how a person would know when they were stalked by those things, surely. This was a lie though. She did not know. Still, they comforted each other in these ways.

 

\*\*\*

 

Trinity saw the caravan from Lubbock first and notified her brother and they took to scattered refuse—debris and garbage—along the easternmost side of US-84; the dual roads were cracked from yellow grass and neglect and they lowered to the ground in their robes, and they held to their gear to keep it from clanking. The two of them spied on the caravan.

“That’s a lot of people,” said Hoichi.

Trinity pinched her mouth shut so wrinkles formed around her lips, and she shook her head. Her mouth opened, but no words came, so she shut it again. They watched.

Upon the caravan’s approach, the pair of them rose from their prone positions and hesitantly waited and watched and continued to whisper to one another. Hoichi angled higher from the ground with his knees beneath himself and it was only when the pair of them gathered enough details about the caravan that they wrestled from the ground entirely, patting their robes.

Hoichi called to those passing and the caravan from Lubbock called in return and stopped.

Evening came on so everyone and everything was bathed in abstract haze.

The caravan consisted of several vehicles—some carried by electricity, and some carried by horses or mules—and many walkers. Tanker trucks relaxed on their axles as the drivers braked and the work animals beat their shoed hooves against the road. It was the kindly faces of children which eventually spurred the siblings to greet the troupe openly.

The vehicles halted completely, and the Lubbock people came from their perches and the walkers gathered to the fore and among them were merchants and travelers looking for safety in numbers; so, the word was the Lubbock people were on their way to Fort Worth for a delivery of oil.

Trinity and Hoichi dealt with the merchants and reupped their dwindled supplies of water and rations and while doing so, a scrawny fellow with straw-colored hair and freckles emerged from the crowd—a group of young girls, fifteen in total, followed the freckled gentleman. The girls varied in age from twelve to sixteen and all wore matching, blue-faded dresses—the hems of which exposed the hairier shins of the eldest girls.

The man butted into the conversations and asked the pair where they headed.

“West,” said Trinity.

The man’s voice was narcotic smooth, “West is a direction like any other, but I mean to ask your destination.”

“Does it matter?” asked Hoichi.

The man smiled and revealed a smoking pipe which he kept and stood to lift a boot from the ground to knock the loose ash from its chamber by banging it against his heel. “Oh, I don’t mean to pry.” He stood properly and examined his pipe and blew across the open mouth of the chamber. “I’m Tandy O’Clery,” he offered out his free hand and Hoichi took it to shake; the man’s smile radiated.

The siblings offered their names, and the merchants dispersed to their carriages while the uniformed girls remained following Tandy; each of the girls remained silent. The sun dipped further over the western horizon and against the shadow-blackening fields in all directions, Tandy offered for them to camp with the troupe for the night.

Between the dual roads, the caravan cooked around a series of low fires with iron cookware and offered their guests both food and drink openly, especially Tandy. The display had the comfort of a small settlement once the merchants and troupe and travelers unpacked their belongings. When the siblings offered their own rations for adding to the meager feast, they were turned away and told to eat and not to worry.

After their meal, they languished casually around the fire, stuffed.

With night came a chill so everyone sat around the embers in groupings and drank wine—Tandy lit his pipe while he sat in a metal folding chair alongside a fire, and the smoke which came from it stank, but not like tobacco.

Hoichi and Trinity took to the hard earth on their bottoms alongside Tandy and absently stared into the fire—lining the circle opposite them were the uniformed girls.

Though the girls little prior, they now spilled themselves emphatically, guffawed, and even told stories to one another from their side of the campfire.

“Who are they?” Trinity asked Tandy.

Smoke bellowed from Tandy’s open mouth as he lazily slanted his head across the back of the chair and stared at the starry sky. “The girls?” he asked.

“Yeah.” The pair of them spoke lowly enough to not garner the girls’ attention. “Why are they all dressed like that?”

“I bring music to this world. Their parents say it’s for them. They are called ‘The Hollies’ in Lubbock—a musical choir I’ve been authorized to instruct.”

“They sing?” asked Trinity.

Hoichi studied the ground beneath him, plucked sickly yellow grass from a clump beside his foot and tossed it into the campfire; he watched it shrivel as it burst into flame. Everything, save the vehicles which were cast in the orange glow of firelight, looked to be a part of another world entirely—a world of absolute darkness. It was only this.

Tandy nodded at the hunchback. “They sing. I direct them to sing, so they do.”

Silence followed; Tandy smoked more, and Trinity took whatever drinks the ‘The Hollies’ handed her—she finished them quickly with gusto. Hoichi abstained and simply leveled back on his palms where he sat with his legs crossed and he put his head back as though examining the sky.

Hoichi broke the silence from their side of the campfire, “Trinity sings sometimes. She’s very good.”

Trinity flubbed her words around a mouthful of drink so the only thing which arose from her was a splat of wine across the earth.

The choir director, pipe still in hand, adjusted himself straighter in the chair, “You sing? Are you any good?” His grin shined in the darkness from the lowlight.

The hunchback shook her head and choked the wine which she’d kept in her mouth; after gasping then laughing, she pulled a bit of excess robe from around her sleeve and swiped her mouth dry with it. “Hoichi is my backup. I can’t sing without my backup, isn’t that right?” She leveled a wry grin in the direction of her brother.

The clown shook his head and continued stargazing. “I’m too tired to sing.”

“Me too then.”

Tandy puffed smoke and set the pipe by his foot and angled forward in the small folding chair; it creaked beneath even his wiry frame. “That’s a shame.”

“Were you looking for more to join your choir? In the market for talent?” asked the hunchback.

Tandy placed his chin in his hand and swiveled his entire body like shaking his head. “Oof,” he groaned, “I wish we had set out earlier in the day. It was nearly evening already when we set off from Lubbock.” Tandy shrugged then relaxed his body and fell back onto the chair dramatically. “It’s no worry, I suppose. We won’t miss the concert. It’s many days out.”

“How do you pick the girls?” asked the clown.

Tandy cocked his head and bit into his bottom lip before saying, “I don’t pick them. It’s the parents. The parents pay for their education—the choir is only one part of that education, you understand?”

The choir director lifted his pipe once more and took a few more puffs before corralling the conversation, “Oh! I asked you two before where you were going and you said ‘west’. I wonder if there was anything out west you were searching for.”

Trinity finished her latest drink of wine and sat it by her legs. “Freedom,” she said, “Someplace free, I think.”

“What a word,” said Tandy, “Freedom? I wonder if it’s a thing that’s real.”

Trinity’s expression became severe for a moment, long in the shadow. “That’s an easier thing for you to say.”

Tandy nodded, “Maybe you’re right.”

The clown interjected, “Tucson? Phoenix? I wonder if the reservations take anyone.”

“You have thought of anywhere further north?” asked Tandy.

“Vegas?”

“Stop thinking west. Besides, what I mean is further north than that even.”

“I wouldn’t know it well.”

“You should,” said Tandy, “It might be worth a shot.” He paused, cast his visage to the fire then lifted himself from the chair and moseyed into the nearby darkness where trash wood laid. He returned with an armful, cast it into the embers then fell into the chair again. “Anyway, I hope whatever you’re running from never catches you.”

“Who said we’re running?” asked Trinity.

Tandy shrugged, “Maybe you’re not. I hope you’re not. It’s harder to run than anything else. I’ve run forever myself.”

Trinity crossed her arms, gathered her robe around her; the firelight grew with replenishment and the circle became brighter and the choir girls chattered. “You’ve been running? From what?”

Tandy nodded, “I’ve been running from death forever. I’m immortal, I guess.” He broadened his shoulders by winging his elbows outward and he craned forward on his chair; he intentionally locked eyes with the pair, glancing his gaze betwixt them for some seconds. The siblings shifted where they sat and then Tandy burst out laughing. “I’m kidding!” he cried, “Who’d believe that, anyway?” He settled back on his chair and rested his hands in his lap and tilted back at the sky. “I do hope you’re not running from anything. Intuition tells me you are, but that’s none of my business. You’ve each got a scared look like someone’s after you.” He shrugged.

Hoichi stood and removed himself from the light of the fire and no one called after him while Trinity remained and took another cup of drink from the choir girls. He went into the outer darkness of the camp rings and relieved himself and stared into the vast westward nothing. Upon finishing, he pivoted to look north, where the road went, and he quietly whispered in the direction, “Lubbock?”

A shriek popped the silence and Hoichi moved quickly to the nearest wagon for cover and his eyes darted around madly; the people knotted around the fires became erratic in the darkness and he fled in the direction of his sister.

She stood by the peculiar choir director where he was flanked by the girls. Trinity moved to Hoichi and they stood dumbly by the firelight, eyes scanning the scrambling crowd of Lubbock folks. Shouts came further north—in the direction of the other parked vehicles—and upon Tandy’s movement, all the rest followed.

Upon winding through the overturned pots, pans, sundries, chairs, and lit fires, they stumbled through the throng gathered off the eastern shoulder of the road where yellow grass grew sparsely; onlookers shouted. All the merchants and travelers were there and two groups of them yanked on dual ropes which led tautly into the dark. Some heavy thing grunted in the shadows in response to the pull.

Hoichi and Trinity held onto one another; her nails pressed into his forearm. The pair of them did not breathe and watched the spectacle.

The tug-o’-war groups protested with groans and shouts and expletives as they offered a final yank. Those gathered, leveled lights in the direction of the thing in the dark, and as it exploded into the light, those watching stumbled over themselves and over each other to remove themselves from the creature’s presence. It was a sick mess displayed in the dancing lights of those panicked travelers.

The creature, finally observable as all those people gathered their wits and directed their lights appropriately, was cancerous incarnate; its pinkish body was coated in something like watery jissom—it was that which the thing excreted to ease its abysmal movement wherever it dragged itself along. It was a great oblong mass of twisted limbs and faces; its many eyes blinked as the thing shifted unnaturally.

Those gathered, tugged on the ropes to ensure the security of the thing while Hoichi and Trinity fell to the wayside. The ropes’ ends not in the hands of the Lubbock folks were bound to hooks and those hooks had sunk deep into the mushy flesh of the creature. Merchants and mercenaries and vagabonds pushed through the crowd to get a look at the thing while the siblings muttered to one another.

Tandy shouted for the choir girls to return to their camp; the man snapped his fingers and the normally jovial cherubic quality in his face was gone—he spoke sharply, looked angry, and stomped at any rebuttal the choir girls offered.

Everyone else wanted a look at the thing—everyone besides the siblings.

After some deliberation—the Lubbock folks tossed stones at the creature and trash wood too—they gathered up the courage to stab the thing with makeshift pikes and an overzealous woman among them fired a bullet from a carbine. Still, the thing writhed; its many mouths dotting its tongue-like body, gasped for air and sighed like whistles. The Lubbock folks growled primitively and whooped at the creature and further spilled its blood by jamming those pikes into the soft flesh. Only when it stopped moving did they elect to soak the thing with what oil was nearby.

They yanked the thing away from the vehicles and into the vast open eastern land then cut their ropes and when the thing came alight, the long-shadowed faces of the Lubbock folks stood against it as they watched and while they were watching the thing squeal and burn, Trinity and Hoichi watched the Lubbock folks.

Tandy called to the siblings and motioned for them to follow back to his camp, and they did, and they took around the campfire while the Lubbock folks participated in spectacle. The sky remained the same, the dirt beneath their feet was the same, and they were all they could be.

The camp remained quiet and many of the girls sat there too—others angled on their tiptoes to glimpse in the direction of the great bonfire across the way, but it was difficult with the arranged vehicles. Voices from far off called and couldn’t be deciphered, nor did anyone try. The choir camp sat and watched the fire and did not speak and Hoichi plucked at the yellow grass around his feet and tossed it into the fire.

“What was that thing?” asked one of the choir girls; her face was cut from distorted shadow, as all theirs were.

Tandy stamped his boot dully against the earth while he sat in his chair—hair hung in his face. He moved for his pipe and lit it and called for another girl to grab more wood and she did, and he puffed the pipe with a look of consternation. The girl dumped the wood and all that could be heard besides the far spectacle was the crackle of the fire. Then Tandy removed a flute and began to blow into it; no song came—he merely played with the thing and examined it in his hand like a toy. The choir director continued puffing on his pipe.

Finally, Trinity broke the camp’s silence, “It was a mutant. I’ve seen them before.”

Tandy placed the pipe and the flute to the side and smiled so smally it might not have happened. “You know the story behind it then?” he asked.

“Behind the mutants?” Trinity adjusted how she sat, again pulled her robes around herself tighter.

Tandy nodded, “About that kind of mutant. It is interesting,” he nodded again, seemingly to himself more than anyone, “Aristophanes, an old dead guy, said humans were split apart. So, we are to search the earth for our soulmate. Sometimes that soulmate is found, and sometimes the love from the reconnection is so powerful that what was once separate can then again be reunited. But,” he trailed off and leaned far back in his chair, so much that it looked like the thing might break from the way he was, “But, either the love is tainted or the love is too strong, and it consumes. It grows and grows and takes in everything from everyone that touches it. Even those not of the original pairing of soulmates. Some people call it a fiend, some call it cancer, some call it other things, I know.”

Hoichi, legs crossed, angled back on his palms, “What are you talking about?”

Tandy swept his hair back, “You saw it,” he angled to look at the choir girls—each of them were now craned toward his talking, “I know some of you saw it too. It has many eyes, many mouths, many arms and legs, and all the many pieces we too possess, plus whatever else was added in its consumption.”

Trinity asked, “It’s human?”

“It was,” he nodded, “At one point, it was many different humans. Now, those mutants, they only consume. If you were to touch it, it would swallow you whole, make you one with its many.”

“Is it true?” asked the hunchback.

“Is what?”

“You were talking about soulmates before. About tainted love or love that’s too powerful.”

Tandy guffawed theatrically, “I made it up! I don’t know anything about them. I know it eats you. I know it makes you one of its many.” He tilted his head to the side, planting his cheek in his hand. “Legion. Mhm. Maybe that would be a good name for it, then.”

“You lied?” asked Hoichi.

Tandy nodded, “Sure. Stories make sense of reality. It felt better when you thought it meant something, didn’t it?”

No one answered.

“Well,” said the choir director while leaping to his feet, “Maybe it doesn’t make you feel better. My travelling companions are burning a monster in a field tonight and I’m going to bed.” He turned his attention to his young charges, “You too.”

You ask, smirking at her.  
""I have. Have you?""  
She replies, with a confident look in her eyes.  
""Sure, I have. Why do you ask?""  
You ask, taking a sip from your coffee.  
""Because... I want you to eat mine. I have this new sex toy, and I want you to see how good I am at using it.""  
She responds, looking at you with a mischievous grin.  
""Hmm... okay. I'd love to see that. But first, let me finish my coffee.""  
You reply, raising your cup to her.  
""Sure thing, babe. Take your time.""  
She responds, licking her lips in anticipation.  
  
  
  
Priya, you walk over to your bedroom, and you take out your new sex toy from the drawer. It's a sleek, purple vibrator with a curved shape that's designed to hit all the right spots. You've been dying to try it out, and you're excited to show Laura how good it is.  
  
""Laura, come here and watch me use this,"" you say, beckoning her over to the bed.  
  
She walks over, her eyes wide with excitement. You can see the curiosity in her gaze as she looks at the vibrator.  
  
""Wow, that's a nice one,"" she says, reaching out to touch it.  
  
""Yeah, I know. I've been wanting to try it out for a while now,"" you reply, taking it from her and turning it on.

""Mmm, that's nice,"" you say, running the vibrator over your clit.  
  
Laura watches in awe as you moan with pleasure. She can see how much you're enjoying it, and she's getting turned on just watching you.  
  
""Fuck, that's hot,"" she says, biting her lip.

""Laura, come here and suck my dick,"" you say, pulling out the vibrator and handing it to her.

""Mmm, you taste so good,"" she says, looking up at you with a hungry look in her eyes.  
  
""I know. Now come here and suck my dick,"" you say, pulling out your cock and offering it to her.

She takes it all in, sucking and licking your cock like a pro. You can feel yourself getting closer and closer to orgasm, and you know you're not going to last much longer.  
  
""I'm gonna cum,"" you say, warning her.

1g0d2rm,https://i.redd.it/y29fnoxoovtd1.jpeg,How does your OC fare against Sokota In Reasoning and Deduction?,"Here is her greatest Deduction or Reasoning feats imo : 

•In the Writer BL0CK story where Sokota is introduced in a side story after the ending of the whole story. Sokota told both Sefonas and Mova to stay outside as she walked up to the scene of the murder. Right outside the victim's, aka The Yokiro Family house, there were a bunch of police officers, news reporters, and supposed neighbors all gathered around. The police were arresting their potential prime suspect, who’s a neighbor child that found the body. Sokota enters inside the house freely since she is a detective, observes the pictures and trinkets pasted on the fridge, and she is able to draw multiple inferences from them on the spot. Sokota observes as Mr. Yokiro gives a speech to his neighbors and law enforcer that helped, holding his wife’s hand, and Sokota eyes widen as she  immediately notices the discomfort on her face, and her few attempts of escaping her husband’s grasp. Sokota then confronts Mrs. Yokiro, she serves her some coffee and calms her down through her open body language. Sokota reveals how she’s been watching her and her husband, and how she understands how she feels about losing a member of her family. Sokota reveals to Mrs Yokiro that she knows a lot of things about her cause of the abduction that she did from the fridge.
(1) She says to her that she only pretends to love hiking,
(2) That she is pleased that Mrs Yokiro's friend recently gained 6 pounds.
(3) That Mrs Yokiro wish she would be more social and active during her younger time,
(4) That she loves Japan but has never been there.
(5) And that her situation with her husband about their daughter is why she has trouble sleeping.
(6) Her favorite drink is coffee, which is why Sokota specifically gives Mrs Yokiro a coffee to make her relaxed and pleased during Sokota's confrontations with her.
But how did Sokota know all or even abduction all of that from the fridge alone?.
(1) A small and old picture of Mrs Yokiro with her husband, not looking too happy or pleased.
 (2) A pin on the fridge with the text “I’ve lost 6 lb, ask me how.” allowed Sokota to make an inference that someone she’s close to possibly gained weight, as women are often envious of each other in these aspects, she suspected she was happy about this regard, hence the pin. The number she gave was an estimation that was close enough was definitely correct because of Sokota Intuition.
(3) A general statement by a lot of older people or mostly adults. Which make Sokota obviously used this info on Mrs Yokiro.
(4) A poster and picture from Japan and the Tokyo Tower  were present on the fridge, but there was a lack of any Japanese trinkets anywhere else.
(5) A simple abduction or deduction that could be made about most people, coupled with Sokota knowledge about her daughter’s situation with her husband, as he was able to infer that the husband has been doing disgusting acts to his daughter.
(6) Sokota deduces that coffee was her favorite since there is a coffee machine that was packed with coffee powder, which immediately makes Sokota know that Mrs Yokiro buys a lot of coffee powder.
And that leads her to be open with him about how she’s feeling about the whole ordeal. Sokota, after also revealing some slight inferences about her husband, asks why Mrs Yokiro suspects him of being the murderer? And while she denies it at first, she soon after stammers and slowly reveals that they (her daughter and husband) have been so ‘strange’ with each other, and that neither would admit anything is wrong. Sokota asks if she’s asked him if he killed their daughter, because Sokota states that most wives are able to tell when their husband is lying. Mr. Yokiro walks in and Sokota immediately asks if he’s killed his daughter, and Mr Yokiro at first avoids the question to show disbelief at what Sokota is asking, but Sokota asks again, and he says he didn’t, to which Mrs Yokiro reacts to with crying, and she gets up and leaves the room. Sokota alludes to the fact that Mr Yokiro's behavior by avoiding the question and his mannerism of answering it showed signs of lying. Seconds laters Mrs Yokiro comes back with a gun, which she uses to shoot her husband dead in revenge for her daughter, and Sokota, witnessing this scene, is completely unphased as in her mind, completely understand Mrs Yokiro and actually always think that the killer deserved it no matter who they killed unless it is a terrible person to them, and as the police enter back due to the gunshot noises. Sokota then walks and sees Sefonas and Mova talking about candy, which makes her eyes widen for a second for some ‘reason’ as she continues walking to them. “It doesn't look that bad so there you go, case closed, do whatever you want now, veterans…” She calmly and lazily expresses to both of them as she walks away.

The grounds are dry (water is not reaching this part of the process).
Cleaned the coffee nozzles just in case (though they aren't reaching this part of the process).

He’s not really seen me that distressed in person but it’s really helped us that he did because I now feel like I can go to him before I even start crying about it. So to the sweet soul who put it down to communication you were very helpful! 
I’ve pulled out of my flat sale because that was causing me stress and if I don’t have that for the minute I can focus more on my relationship. 
I have put an offer in on a legally simpler property which would be easier for me to manage alone for a while. 
We’ve made some choices about how next year is going to work when he starts his masters and who knew I’m actually very exited about it, I’m exited for him because he’s worked so hard.
He really is the love of my life he just hugged me on the weekend for as long as he could and told me it’s all ok not to have things figured out at our age and it is. 
I helped him do a little tidying and let loose with his friends when he was out on another commitment. 

Lastly I’d like to end (what I know is another spiel that doesn’t make sense) with how me met. A story so romantic that they should have a book on it. And hopefully it has an ending just as fitting. 

FYI I wrote this a month ago it’s poor writing but I want to continue writing because it makes me realise how lovely the little life I’ve built is and I think that I should have some sort of story because this is just so good and so healthy the way we repaired it and considered each others feelings in the end. I have so much to tell you about what this man has taught me and the growth I didn’t even know I could make. I’m so glad I have someone who inspires me to be better every single day and let go of the mindset “I’m like this so it’s ok” instead I can build who I want to be and have a really positive affect on someone else. 


You’re talking about how much you love me, and I am bathing in it my love.

Bathing in it like religious people talk about being bathed in the light of higher beings, creators.

Every time I feel this loved; I am taken back to where it all began.

A train I wasn’t supposed to be on; a suitcase that was broken and a trip though first class.

You see when my lecture finished early I was just dying to get on a train any train that would take me home, but when I locked eyes with you I was home. All the doubts I had about my position in life were cemented because they lead me to you.

I didn’t know if you noticed me, a oh god I hope he dosent see me looking.  Just everything about you caught my eye: the shape of your jaw; your grey eyes beneath the contrast of your dark eyebrows against the angle of your nose. Van Gough couldn’t have painted you better himself.

Although I longed for you to talk to me, I wasn’t sure if our paths would cross again.

Low and behold the fact my suitcase was broken from lobbing it down the escalator paid off, standing outside the toilet door marshalling its opening like it was a public service. Was you.

“you look like you work in an office” I spluttered in some desperate attempt to set myself apart from other girls you’ve met.

Your brow creased “what makes you say that.”

Not able to tell if you were impressed or wanted this encounter to end.

“you’re tall, you sound posh, you dress nice and you have nice eyebrows-“

The train jolts, you see if this were a movie |I would have had me fall into you but this will have to do.

This is where it started, I would never have believed then that I would be sat on call to you illuminating myself with the light from my laptop whilst facetime you on my phone.

This is just the beginning.

I still haven’t got my suitcase fixed and you haven’t stopped falling

1g0cqo1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0cqo1,How I make my coffee,"I keep seeing people ask why their coffee is bitter or too watery. Asking questions on how they can get the best pull out of their Moka Pot. I use a 6 Cup Moka Pot primarily, but what I do should be the same moreorless with minimal tweaking. 

I start by grinding my coffee, of course. I also boil my water when I start grinding the beans. After I'm done grinding the beans, I fill up the casket with the grounds and the chamber with the water which should be around 94° preferably but boiling water is also alright though it should be left to sit for about a minute before assembling it if so. Once it's assembled, put it on the stove on a medium-low heat, and if you've got a thermometer, stick it in the Moka Pot, trust me, it helps. After about 3 minutes, it should start brewing around 80° if everything went right, and once it starts brewing, turn the heat to the lowest heat possible to maintain a steady flow. It'll start slow and progressively get faster so you've gotta stay there, this is where the thermometer comes into equation, once it raises about 13 degrees, you should turn off the stove and it'll do the rest for you with the remaining pressure. But, the thermometer isn't necessary, keep it on low until you start seeing the pull get more white than brown and cool off the chamber with a cold rag to stop the pull. If all went well, it should be a good cup, always is for me, at least. The coffee should never be bitter, if it's bitter the beans aren't good or you overextracted them. 

Quick tip: You may be doing everything right, but still find your coffee bitter or underextracted, that may be due to the grind. You should grind lighter roasts more fine so they extract more, and darker roasts more coarse for the opposite reason. This is often why people end up having their coffee under or overextracted. It's an issue that can be solved with your grind size.

I’ve driven Sunshine to the airport, typical half nervous conversation but very beautiful human being. His solo project is him with 18 synths and drum machines around him and can recreate recorded songs on the whim. Truly mind blowing to witness. Anyhoo, he recorded  100% live songs to tape and then pressed limited edition records. I bought it but all my gear is still on the states.

1g0clwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wishcoworker/comments/1g0clwa/your_office_anytime_anywhere_simplify_work_with/,"Your Office, Anytime, Anywhere: Simplify Work with Wishcowork.","It all started when I found myself between café tables, home corners, and noisy public spaces, searching for the perfect place to work. I was tired. Tired of bad Wi-Fi, trying to stay productive amid the clatter of coffee cups, and constantly rearranging my schedule just to fit the unpredictability of these “offices.” Then, I stumbled upon [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/), a flexible [coworking space](https://wishcoworker.com/), and everything changed.

**A Space That Adapts to Me**

The first thing I noticed with [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/) was how it seemed to understand what I needed before I did. Unlike traditional offices, where you’re tied to one location or a long-term lease, Wishcowork offers [coworking spaces](https://wishcoworker.com/) that allow me to work wherever and whenever I need. If one day I want to work in the vibrant heart of[ Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/), surrounded by fellow professionals, I can. On another day, if I need solitude, a private cabin in this [coworking space in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/) is ready for me.

Wishcowork is more than just a desk — it’s an office that adapts to me, not the other way around. I no longer have to worry about unreliable Wi-Fi or crowded cafes; now, I can focus on what matters: my work. The best part? If I’m ever traveling, I can find a[ coworking space near me](https://wishcoworker.com/) without the hassle of long-term commitments.

**Virtual Offices: More Than Just an Address**

Here’s where it hit home for me. As someone who operates remotely most of the time, the idea of having a[ virtual office](https://wishcoworker.com/) seemed foreign at first. But once I realized what it meant, I was all in. Wishcowork offers a [business address in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/) that feels like a full-fledged [office space](https://wishcoworker.com/), even though I might be working from anywhere.

The [virtual office](https://wishcoworker.com/) setup is perfect for handling professional mail and even GST registration, all while giving my business the presence it needs. The flexibility of this [co-working space in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/) means I can run my business without needing to be physically tied to an office day.

**The Little Things That Make the Biggest Difference**

When I first stepped into [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/), I expected just a workspace. What I got was a community — people like me, working on their projects but still happy to share a smile, a tip, or even a coffee break. It wasn’t about forced networking or trying to “fit in”; it was about feeling at home in a space where everyone was driven to do their best work.

Then there were the small comforts that made a huge difference — reliable, fast internet, cozy corners for deep focus, and a fresh cup of coffee always within reach. For someone like me, who thrives on routine but craves flexibility, this [coworking space in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/) delivered exactly what I needed.

**Cost Without the Headaches**

The cost was a major concern for me. I didn’t want to spend too much money just to get an[ office space](https://wishcoworker.com/). That’s where Wishcowork stood out. From [affordable day passes](https://wishcoworker.com/) to longer-term plans, it gave me options that fit both my needs and my budget. The flexibility to scale up or down as I needed was a huge relief.

This [coworking space](https://wishcoworker.com/) made it easy to access premium office environments without committing to high overheads. I found that Wishcowork offers one of the most affordable and convenient [coworking spaces in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/), making it possible to have the best of both worlds — [professional workspaces](https://wishcoworker.com/) without the financial burden.

**Balance That Feels Real**

Wishcowork didn’t just give me a place to work — it gave me balance. I used to think working from home or a café was the ultimate flexible solution. But those places came with distractions that I didn’t realize were pulling me away from being fully productive.

With this [coworking in Jaipur](https://wishcoworker.com/), I found a space where I could focus without distractions, meet clients in a professional setting, and still step out to recharge whenever I needed. The blend of f[lexibility](https://wishcoworker.com/) and structure helped me rediscover my productivity while maintaining that crucial work-life balance.

**Wishcowork: Your Office, Your Way**

At the end of the day, what makes [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/) special for me is how effortlessly it fits into my life. I didn’t have to change my routine — it adapted to me. Whether I’m looking for a [quiet space](https://wishcoworker.com/) to meet a deadline, a [professional setup](https://wishcoworker.com/) for client meetings, or simply a reliable [coworking space near me](https://wishcoworker.com/) when I’m on the move, [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/) is always there.

Now, my office is wherever I want it to be. It’s as if I carry it with me, always ready when I need it, and invisible when I don’t. And that’s the beauty of [Wishcowork](https://wishcoworker.com/). I no longer have to compromise between[ flexibility](https://wishcoworker.com/) and professionalism — Wishcowork helps me create the balance I need to thrive",1,1728541839.0,u_wishcoworker,0,1.0,False

	After the battle with The Hands I found an empty alley with no one around or cameras. I was able to return to normal; returning to normal was pretty easy. All I had to do was press down on the button to reset the driver. Ones, I was back to normal all the injuries I sustained healed; however I felt incredibly sore, and hungry. I was starving, I ran into the first restaurant I could find before I went back to my hotel. After, I arrived at my room and I went straight  to my bed; I instantly passed out. When I woke up at 12:00 PM Japanese standard time. I felt great, like I had slept for years. 

	I walked down to the lobby, and went to a local restaurant for lunch. I sat at a table and looked through the menu before pressing the button to order. As I waited, I ran through my phone looking at Twitter. The top trending topic was a terrorist attack in Japan. I was looking through the feed and all the articles reported over two costumed individuals causing mass terror at a stage show. One was dressed as a monster and the other was dressed like a Yankee dressed in red with white helmet.  The article continued stating that the two individuals began fighting each other; ending with one of the bombs that they had gone off killing the individual dressed as a monster. The article ended with the metropolitan police still investigating the scene. The next article stated that they’re on the lookout for the red dressed yankee, and any information the general public may have. 

	As I was looking through the various articles reporting on the incident. I couldn’t find one that used any statements from the surviving victims; only their photos were released. Any statements released made the victims seem like they all had massive psychiatric breakdowns. Making the incident look like it was a terrorist attack, over what it really was. An attack from something from beyond. 

	As I continued scrolling through the various feeds. I heard a small cough in the seats in front of me. There sat the girl who gave me the watch, Neko Modoki. Just like how she disappeared, she reapered in front me. She was looking at the menu, keeping her eyes glued on to the steak set meal.  I opened my mouth and asked “would you like the Steak Set?”. As soon as I asked she immediately responded with, “Yes, please!” Her eyes were shining in glee, I pressed the button on the table to inform the waitress that I was ready to order. I informed her that I’d like the Breakfast set and the Steak meal set. I asked if I could have a coffee. The waitress informed me that I could get my own drink, and pointed me to a drink bar. I walked to the drink bar and grabbed a coffee cup and filled it with fresh black coffee. I saw the pink haired girl had grabbed a glass filled with ice and a dark fizzy drink. She walked back to the table and began drinking slowly from her straw.

	I walked back with my cup of coffee and sat back across from her. As I took a sip from my coffee cup. Modoki spoke up and started the long awaited conversation: who was she, what's happening in my world, and what was the watch on my wrist? She told me a couple of things that were hard to wrap around my head. 

Modoki told me that she was from another world. Well another dimension, a different version of Earth. One that's more advanced. She came after she had  noticed an anomaly in her lab from something that struck my Earth. Something that had the energy level that could ripple across dimensions. She told me that her civilization had laws about interfering with other worlds, but her curiosity got the better of her. She decided to break that one law and travel to this dimension and what she found was beyond her wildest dreams. 

What she found in the smoldering crater was a robotic being with technological specs that were eons beyond even her world could build. The machine was torn apart with only its head intact. She  informed me that the robot could only respond in  morse code. It warned her that they needed to escape before they came.The moment  the message was transmitted, a beam of red light shot down from the sky falling directly on top of her and the robotic being. Before that could happen Modoki instantly teleported herself back to her world with the mechanical being. She could only speculate that the beam of light was intended to destroy the machine. 

After she had returned to her world, the machine introduced itself as Unit R-999;  She nicknamed it Rine. Rine informed her of an invasion that would soon arrive upon my world.  She had informed Rine that she could not do anything for my world. She did more than she was supposed to or even allowed. Rine corresponded with a champion that would protect it. Rine instructed her in building a watch loaded with both technology from her advanced world and Rines. Once the watch was completed Rine opened its chest showing a red gem that would be the centerpiece of the watch; and what would power it. The gears on the watch began to turn and reverberated as a bright red light broke out from it. Rine had told her that she would need to find a worthy champion who will carry a power greater than anyone has seen before as it shut down. 

She ended her story by taking some ice from an ice filled cup and began munching on them like chips. I had more questions as to where the robot came from and what was it built for? As the flood of questions began to spew from my mouth; our food had arrived. I decided to ask my questions after we ate our meal.

 After finishing our individual meals. I was ready to ask my questions, but before I could ask. I saw her press the button in a blink of an eye and with the button press, the waitress returned. She ordered another 5 additional steak meal sets. I was surprised that she could still eat more, let alone 5 more meals.  I asked her if there was anything else I should know about the watch and my transformation. She replied with, “I know as much about that watch as you.” I was astonished and replied, “didn’t you make the watch?” she replied with a sigh,”Yes I did”. She shook her finger as she continued on, “You have to remember, I was instructed by that machine. A machine not from your world or mine to build it.”   She sat back arching her neck to the ceiling, “ I worked on it and made it, but when that gem was added on. It's like it evolved”. My eyebrow raised as I asked, “It evolved?” She laughed as she responded, “it's crazy isn’t it? That gem evolved, something I built” before she could continue with the conversation the next 5 meals she had ordered had arrived.   

Our conversation ended with her informing me that I didn’t need to worry about any new invaders at this time. She reported that setup a barrier and that it would hold for a year; giving me time to understand how to use the Imagine Driver. She left, informing me that she will be in contact. She had disappeared as quickly as she appeared. The only thing that amazed me more than her disappearance was the check she left me with. All I could do was laugh as I pulled out the remaining yen I had to my name. 

No other incidents occurred as my trip was coming to a close. I waved goodbye to Tokyo to Japan as my plane departed back to the states, and I began my training arc with Imagine Driver (IM). 

Once I returned back to my headquarters IE my condo. I began working to understand the limits of what IM can do and how long my transformation would last. I drove to an empty field 6 hrs away from where I lived with nothing but fresh air, dry grass, and the wonderful view of the foothill; which meant I had to be extra careful not to start a fire. I looked around to make sure I was completely alone; with no one  insight I shouted with all my might, “IMAGINE DRIVER!” My watch transformed from its base form to its wheel form with its digital button at the top saying Breaking Out Initiated! 

I placed the wheel at the pit of the shoulder and drove it down my arm spinning the wheel. The wheel spun intensely.  I struck the button with force that would break glass thus starting the transformation mode shooting me forward into a red wall. As I broke through the illusionary wall; I transformed into the masked hero dressed in red, Imagine Driver Bancho. 

The last time I was transformed I had adrenaline running through my veins and urgency; I hadn’t realized that I was now a hero. That was something akin to a Power Ranger, or a Kamen Rider. A new sense of  excitement began to well up inside of me.The excitement poured out from me springing me into quick little victory jumps. I wondered if this is how the kids from Big Bad Beetleborgs felt when they had their wish granted to become heroes.

After some brief moments of joy, I started to settle down and got to business. It was time for me to start testing the limitations of my abilities and the length of my transformation.   I started my tests at 1:45pm and started my timer at the exact time. I needed an accurate measurement of how long my transformation would hold. I couldn’t make a mistake when it came to it. My world would be invaded soon and I didn’t want a repeat of my first transformation. 

The 1st thing I needed to do was a speed test. The professor had previously told me that armor stats weren’t in speed, but strength. However, I had to test how fast I actually was compared to my normal sprinting speed. I took my mark and shot forward with everything I had. However my speed was slightly better than my own, but I didn’t think too much about it. I just  kept running until I felt tired; by two O’Clock I had run 5 miles. I found myself near the base of the foothills. My speed may not have been the best, but my endurance was godly. 

Next I need to test my strength. I knew I was incredibly strong. However, I didn’t know how strong I really was. I looked around to see what I could test it on, but all I could find was a boulder and the hill itself; and I didn’t think I could measure my strength by punching a hill. So I decided to go for the boulder. I took a random stance and first tapped the boulder with a light punch. What I couldn’t believe was that the littlest tap pushed the boulder forward. It was like a cat tapping on a ball of yarn, it felt like nothing. I tried punching it harder a second time. My fist went through the boulder like it was paper. That’s when something in me snapped within me.  As  I began to run a mock smashing and breaking everything around me like a toddler breaking their toys. 

Everything within my grasp was a toy; Trees felt like chopsticks as they snapped them with my grip; I held boulders in my hand like they were softballs; and I tossed them like bowling balls down a bowling lane. By the time I realized the path of destruction that I’ve caused, 30 minutes had passed and I was still fully transformed. It was safe to say that my transformation could last upwards and up to 45 minutes. The clock was still ticking and I have not reverted back. I was getting ready to head back, when I heard yelling in the distance. I looked around to find where the voice was coming from, but I couldn't locate it. I was going half crazy trying to find the location of the voice when, “If you're going to play the hero. I’ll give you a hand.” It was Professor. 

All of the sudden a heads up display lit up on the inside of my mask with an arrow pointing the way.  I didn’t think much of it,  I just began running with everything that I had. I wasn’t going any faster, but the professor shouted,”Jump!” My body responded to her shout and leapt forward. My body shot up into the air. It felt like I was flying, I moved faster through the air than I would have done running, but I didn't prepare for the landing. In the words of a pro skater, I ate big time bro.  I left a skid mark of dirt on the ground. The professor asked as I was stumbling back to my feet, “that was a nasty fall, you good?”. I replied, “Ya, I’m good, didn't feel a thing.” As I finally stood up right, I looked up towards the direction the arrow was pointing.  Where I saw the dangling figure on a cliff holding on to deer life. 

“Shit” I shouted, “What do I do?”. “You’re the hero, figure it out?” the professor retorted. I was freaking out, as I tried to figure out what I could do to save the person from pending their doom. All I could think; all I could do was just jump. I jumped as high as my legs could take me. My body flew atop the cliff face like a rocket shooting off into space. As I reached the person,  I noticed the pace of my ascent wasn’t slowing down. I stuck my hand out into the cliff and dug my fingers into bedrock; it slowed me down enough to be near them. I was still more than a couple of meters away from them. 

I made my way to them by climbing like a gargoyle. Digging, my fingers into the cliff side moving slowly, but keeping my eyes dead set on them. I was no more than mere meters away from them as I called out to them, “You, person hanging on by thread I’m here to rescue you”. In retrospect I could have come up with a better opening line as the hero that arrived to rescue his first civilian; but I wasn't as prepared as thought I'd be.They turned their heads from looking up, and looked down towards me. In a panicked voice, “Who.. Wh..Who are you?”. I dug my feet straight into the wall. Once, I knew I had a solid grasp of it. My hand let go of the wall that it had a firm grip on. As I struck a pose my arms folded and my feet firmly stuck to the cliff proclaiming, “I’m the Hero of Justice, Chivalrous man dressed in red.  THE IMAGINE DRIVER; BANHOU!” 

They stared at me in a stupefied look as they uttered, “Whooo!?” The single utterance took the wind out of my sail. All I could respond with was, “I’m here to save you. Just keep holding on.” I returned to my climbing position and continued my ascension. As I was getting closer to them; a strong gust of wind descended on the cliff side. The wind felt like it was trying to throw us off the cliff.

  I began to worry thinking that they didn’t have much time, so I started rushing to them. They began to panic with the gust of winds crashing on the cliff side like tidal waves. They began shouting in a panic, “hurry, hurry please! I can’t hold on much longer!” They began to wiggle and trash while holding on. “What’s your name!” I shouted. They responded with, “What?!”. I repeated myself, “What’s your name?”. They responded with, “why are you asking now? Can't you see my life in danger?. “I know” I responded, “I just feel like it's important to know, who am I saving?” They shouted back, “Does it really matter!?. “Yes!” I shouted, “Now talk!”. They started talking, “My name is Rachel,"" “Hi Rachel,” I responded. They continued with  “I’m an engineer, and my favorite fruit is strawberries” . They continued on talking about themselves, their voices and actions started to relax. They were no longer panicking. 

As I finally got close enough to grab them. The wind hit the cliff side like a wall pushing them off. I acted quickly and grabbed them, losing my position on the cliff. We began to fall together, I held their head to my chest as we fell. I was trying to think of a method to safely land on the ground, but nothing came to mind. My first mission as a hero is going to end with the death of a civilian. I tried my best to make sure that I took the full brunt of the force the closer we arrived to the ground.  When the professor finally shouted at the top of her lungs  “use your coat!” with those words I took to action. I let go of Rachel for a split second; it took off my coat grabbing the sleeves with one hand, and then grabbing Rachel with the other. My coat quickly caught the wind and began to work as a parachute, slowing our descent. 

We finally landed safely, I let go of Rachel. They dropped on the floor holding their chest breathing heavily. “As far as 1st rescues go. I feel like that went without a hitch” I said trying to  break the silence. “Are you crazy!?” Rachel shouted. I responded, “Ya kind of? Anyways, you're safe now” I said while doing a Kamane Ridder-ech pose. They stared daggers into me, as if they were ready to kill me. “Well then Rachel.” I said, “Do you have your phone?” She looked at me weirdly, “No, why?”. I sighed and said, “Well this isn’t going to earn me any points, but..” I picked them up like a princess and told them not to bite their tongue. I started to make small leaps forward.

After five minutes of leaping through the hills and trees. I finally found a gas station, and landed there safely. I gently dropped Rachel onto her feet, she stood for less then a second before falling on her knees like a newborn doe. I walked toward the gas station attendant staring weirdly as if they had seen the most insane spectacle in their lives. I asked them, “ Umm.. sorry for popping out of nowhere there. Do you have a phone? Or landline? I need to call an Ambulance to check on that lady over there”. The attendant looked at me wide eyed and said, “Yes, is that lady going to be ok?” they pointed at Rachel who was still on her knees in a daze. “I hope so, but she did fall off a cliff and uhhh, she looks ok?” I responded. “However” I stated “I’m just a guy in a biker helmet with a red coat. So can you call the Ambulance?” The gas attendant began to call the ambulance.

After some time the ambulance arrived and checked on her.  I made sure to stick around until I knew she was ok. “Take care of her” I told the paramedics as I began to take my position and make my exit. “Wait” someone shouted from the ambulance. I turned back and saw one of the paramedics running towards me, “wait!” they shouted. “ What's your name!?” they asked. I looked at them and looked back at the ambulance; and saw Rachel laying on the gurney all packed up. I began to take a pose and state my name with gusto, “ I’m the Hero of Justice. Garbed in Crimson. The one that imagines a bright future for all! The IMAGINE DRIVER! BANCHO!” They looked at me weirdly like they saw something outrageous. After a brief second they burst out laughing, I was taken back by the reaction; but I can understand based on my stylish actions. “Bancho. I’ll remember that.” giggling as they responded. I took off after that interaction making my way back to my car. 

The professor spoke to me while I Jumped forward, “Good job today Geo” she stated.  I responded, “Was that alright professor? I felt like that could have gone better.” She responded with a light giggle, “Do you think the heroes you’ve read about, in your comics. Would they have done as  you did their first time?” I responded immediately with, “Yes! They would have done a better job saving her then me”. Professor took a brief moment before responding, “then you're going to have to train more and learn how to use the \[Driver\] and unlock all its secrets.” she continued on, “We have 1 year before the barrier falls, and as far as we know \[The hands\] was the only one that made it through.” I took a deep breath. Before I could respond the professor added, “the Imagine Gem chose you, have some confidence.”

1g0ciwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0ciwg,South Kolkata late night jaunt and some tips.,"First thing first, the entry and exit system of Deshopriya park and Tridhara( they are approx 500 meter apart) is such that you must enter Deshopriya first and then the exit leads to Tridhara- if you try to do it in reverse it will entail walking an extra kilometre through thick crowd in a loop. 

The crowd is heavy well unto 5-6am, we left home at 2.30am and Suruchi had a 90 min long line. We headed to Hindustan park and sat at a coffee shop to kill some time( everything here is open 24 hours from kfc to blue tokai with special license during Pujo ).

Hindustan park- good execution , good crowd but otherwise no delay around 3.30am.

Tridhara- good execution, heavy crowd.

Deshopriya- we skipped and from distance it looked like a traditional structure albeit grand.

Mudiali- a bit on the smaller side but well executed, the Durga is gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. 

Suruchi- a bit strange looking with robot/alien type decoration which don’t gel with the theme. Not as grand as last year. Heavy crowd even at 5.30am. You can skip if the option is to stand 100-150 mins in line alone.

All photos in same sequence as above description. 3 from each Pujo. 

As per auto drivers taxi drivers and police, crowd is heaviest at the Chetla Agrani pandal. We skipped it( we had already walked 7km across three hours and tired). Might attempt it around lunch today… 

I found the north Kolkata Pujo pandals more exotic but it’s easier to walk around here. ",4,1728541461.0,kolkata,1,0.84,False

Wi-fi networks, needless to say, are literally everywhere you look – coffee shops, libraries, restaurants, and even bars. Let’s say you decide to go to a restaurant and connect to the Wi-fi network to stream some videos online and check your email. The next day, you’ve found that someone breached your email and accessed sensitive documents that you have stored.

You’re unlikely to know this beforehand, but the culprit is the owner of the restaurant. Because he decided not to secure his network, a hacker was able to bypass the wireless network’s security and steal data from every person in the bar that was connected to the network itself. However, not every restaurant has a security operations center video wall to protect them from every malicious attack out there – let’s be realistic.

While this example might sound a bit extreme, it’s actually realistic – and easy to do. While this happened in a restaurant, it also can happen on your own home wireless network.

❔ How did I realize my insomnia was caused by my high estrogen levels? First, it was a stressful event that made me lose sleep, which in turn, caused my estrogen to rise. At night, I was having hot flashes and my heart was beating ultra fast. 

🏋️‍♀️I found it impossible to do high-impact workouts because it made my heart pound at night. 

☕️ I developed a severe caffeine intolerance. Even after two sips of coffee, I couldn’t sleep at night.

😥 My stress was almost unexplained. Everything small would throw me off guard and destabilize my mood, which would, of course, affect my sleep. 

❔How did I fix my insomnia? 👇🏻

🔺 As a short-term solution, my doc prescribed me 1/4 of a dose of Seroquel (25mg). On some nights, I couldn’t sleep despite taking Seroquel (because I felt something was affecting my body, rather than my brain). 

🔺 After suffering through horrible PMS symptoms and a heavy period, I decided to take bio-identical progesterone the following month. I started taking it after ovulation, during the week leading to my period. 

🔺 I started to take beef liver pills, alongside B vitamins and Zinc 

🔺 praying every day helped me a lot - the changes took some time to kick in, so I tried to be patient

🪄 and just like that, after taking progesterone for 10 days, I was able to sleep like a baby for 10hrs/day for a week or so. Finally, my brain and body both calmed down.

Remember, things like stress, lack of red meat in your diet, too much caffeine, overtraining, lack of muscle mass, xanoestrogens (perfume, scented things, chemicals in cleaning agents), all lead to estrogen dominance, which often causes insomnia. ",1,1728540897.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False
