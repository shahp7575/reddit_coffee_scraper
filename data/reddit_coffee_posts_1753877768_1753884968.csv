I wasn‚Äôt trying to eavesdrop or anything, but I caught the phrase: ‚Äú...at first I thought it was a scam, but then I actually withdrew the money.‚Äù That got my attention. I googled a few keywords, followed some links, and ended up on a post by \[u/dtanmango\], where he breaks everything down in detail.

I figured I‚Äôd give it a try. Worst case, I waste an hour‚Äîno big deal. But then... it worked. I stuck with it, and now I‚Äôm making around $200 a day. Honestly, didn‚Äôt expect that at all.

I‚Äôm not the type to post about stuff like this, but hey maybe someone out there is just scrolling through their feed, waiting for coffee, same as I was.

1md7oih,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1md7oih/lets_talk_about_coffee_and_comics_again/,Let's talk about Coffee and Comics AGAIN,"I'm going to beat a dead horse with this.



The following below is what I had posted in both posts by who I presume is the owner of Coffee and Comics.

*One former barista I spoke with explicitly states that Alex the owner of Coffee and comics had stolen thousands of dollars in tips from her.*

*That same Barista came forward about a possible SA Allegation that was levied against Alex by another barista that to my knowledge works there currently.*

*I was harassed and had my life threatened at the Moana location by a convicted felon that would regularly go to this location. All because one of the baristas said that he was too friendly with women, I had warned said barista who made the claim that this man was ‚Äúlooking for her‚Äù.*

*I had made the owner aware of what happened, no response, no attempt was made to amend the situation.*

*This happened to me in 2023.*

*Years later, I had one former store manager at the Moana location corroborate my version of events, and had stated that the way I was treated was absolutely not ok.*

*To this day Alex has not formally apologized. Coffee and Comics is not a safe place for neurodivergent people such as myself. The owner, Alex has on multiple occasions failed to protect his employees and also has allegedly SA‚Äôd their employees or stolen funds from them.*

*I implore people here to consider taking their business elsewhere.*

It appears that each time I posted this comment, both posts were taken down, or I was likely blocked by the Account holder the second time. I cannot confirm this. 

The irony here is that the person who operates that account made those posts and took them down because it was deemed some of the comments were ""hurtful"". 

I want to make something clear. It was hurtful of Alex to allow someone to threaten my safety, my life right in front of his business. I went to Coffee and Comics to try and find friends too you know? But what did I get? Someone trying to start shit with me, all because I was looking out for one of Alex's employees.

Coffee and Comics has never taken any responsibility for what happened to me, and then I hear everything else that the owner may have allegedly done, and **I have no reason to believe those accusations are untrue**, I have my own personal experiences to base that off of, and my experience is that by being silent on what happened to me, Alex had condoned how I was treated. 

Don't get angry at Coffee and Comics for the use of AI Art (I do loathe AI Art myself). Get mad at the owner for not protecting their patrons, or employees. ",1,1753884777.0,Reno,0,1.0,False

1md7nzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1md7nzz/should_i_confront_this_guy_who_lied_about_hooking/,Should I confront this guy who lied about hooking up with me in HS,"hi,  I 25F am wondering, after like 7 years, should i send a fb message confronting this guy who lied about hooking up with me (to me in HS that just meant kissing, but now I know he is from an area/school in the city that, over there hooking up could mean more, things that never crossed my mind to do in HS to be honest)

so the story goes like this pre-freshman weekend visit for seniors at an ivy league, this guy says hello to me we don't talk so much as I recall, I was quite shy and had a situation with a boy from my HS who honestly if I met him today would just have my heart completely. Said boy was in and out of hospital for mental health (probably anxiety and depression) we never really got the chance to talk about it in depth . Partially because of this a\*h\*, he had offered to walk me to my host's dorm to get my phone at night, college campus, underage girl, he was also a senior. I had a feeling, since he was nervous and eager that he might make a move - even ask for my number or something, and I did think he was cute but my on and off 'bf' in hs was back in hospital so...I was going through it throughout HS and could not be tempted to let any other boy touch me. 

I tried to politely decline, but I was never good at boundaries so he walks me and we small talk, I keep saying I need to charge  my phone and call my dad so he knows I'm ok (parents were rightfully worried about this whole thing, strict-ish household there was no way I was sleeping away for college if it was up to them). 

So i keep things short and awkward as I do and way before we get to the dorm to retrieve my phone, he says let's go sit over there, there's a nice view - alarms sounds and anxiety ring through my brain - i say no, sorry, i really should get to my phone and call my parents, thank you for offering though"" doesn't take much and I cross my own boundary again, sitting with him under a tree awkwardly, looking out at supposed view, at night. 

He eventually asks if he could kiss me, I say sorry I don't want too. he asks me if I have ever kissed any one, I didn't want to lie so I say yes, only he was my bf and I just don't want to do that with someone who isn't. so he says ""ok...why?"" confusion apparent in his voice, but not pushy or disrespectful that I can detect.

He says we should get back shortly after, I agree and I remember thinking ""that went well! what a nice boy, a little confused but no negative reaction or trying to convince me, phew!""

we get back to the hall they prepared a dinner to say goodbye. He walks over to his friends, one gets close and I realize from the body language and excitement they all knew he was going to ask to kiss me, and I think to myself, that is my worsst nightmare, being gossip among teenage boys, thank gd i didn't!""

 Then, I see his blush and nod and his friend give him a handshake and all his friends are like ""ooh nice"" and I. Am. So. Embarrassed. SHocked. I feel so violated but I'm too shy and spineless to say anything as we are also now in front of people from the entire event in a small hall. 

fast forward to even a few months later. A friend who sits in front of me in chem (who is a cousin and best friend of my HS bf and first love) turns to me and says "" I hear you know so& so"" I say ""who?""

he says ""so&so from university visit"" I say ""oh, yeah"" and my stomach turns as I ask why. He says I heard you two hooked up

I told him I didn't, that I was shocked especially because he was nice about it and he was smirking saying ok, I believe you.

but like who knows, basically when his cousin (the bf) came back and was ready to reconnect with me, we went for a coffee and a chat that was hard for me and I'm sure for him at least. And we basically never spoke again.

I can't help but think he heard the news from his cousin once we reconnected that his gf and first lvoe was off making out with who knows who she met on a weekend away whilst he was in hospital. technically we weren't together officially most of HS but it was mostly a given. I think we knew we were too young and things got so complicated but we tried until maybe this was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

and my being too shy and crashing out on my own, (and not telling him about that because I didn't want to burden him, which only made things worse because if I didn't tell him I didn't tell anyone) never brought it up and we literally never spoke again.

what kind of makes me sick is the fact that in this guy's circle, hooking up can mean so much more, and I only ever kissed innocently with my bf, so it makes my stomach churn at the thought of what he could have said we had done together, or implied. 

so! i see for some weird reason i am friends with this man on facebook, and I really want to send a message saying just so you know, ""your lie got back to me and impacted a relationship that was really important to me. not cool and I hope that was the first and last time you have done something like that"" short, sweet, and done. 

I cannot say this is the first time  I have thought to do this

1md7mot,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1md7mot/aita_for_having_an_affair_with_my_married/,AITA for having an affair with my married professor and causing his family to fall apart?,"I (26F) have been involved with my former professor (41M) for about six months. It started innocently enough; I was a graduate student in his literature seminar last semester, and we bonded over late office hours discussing my thesis research. He was brilliant, charming, and made me feel like my ideas actually mattered. Things gradually became more personal, and eventually romantic.

He told me his marriage had been dead for years and that he was only staying for appearance's sake until he could figure out the right time to leave. He made it sound like separation was inevitable and both him and his wife know already, so I convinced myself I wasn't really breaking up a happy home. We started meeting at coffee shops across town, and eventually began spending evenings together at my apartment when he claimed to be working late at the university.

I'll be honest, the whole thing felt intoxicating. Here was this accomplished academic who chose me over his mundane suburban life. He would complain constantly about how his spouse didn't understand his work and how intellectually stifled he felt at home. I started to believe I was saving him from a miserable existence.

Three weeks ago, his spouse found text messages between us on his phone. Everything exploded overnight. His spouse immediately contacted a divorce lawyer and kicked him out of their house. Now he's calling me in complete panic, saying this is all my fault because I ""seduced"" him and destroyed his family. He claims that if I hadn't pursued him, he would have found a way to work things out with his spouse.

The worst part is that he has twin daughters who are 8 years old. He's terrified he won't get joint custody because of the affair, and he keeps saying that I've potentially ruined his relationship with his children forever. He's now living in some extended-stay motel and expects me to help him figure out his housing situation and provide emotional support through the divorce proceedings.

I feel terrible about the girls getting caught in the middle, but I also think he's being hypocritical. He pursued me just as much as I pursued him, and he's the one who was married and told me that his marriage is already over.

So, AITA for getting involved with a married professor and contributing to his family's destruction, especially knowing he had young children?",1,1753884662.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

**Kendu's IRL Range**

As we all know crypto has been the subject of many bad actors, including leaders of countries, celebrities and cabals, this has tarnished crypto's reputation in the eyes of the average person, can we blame them for being cautious of crypto?

Honestly, no we can't.

But here's where Kendu's IRL efforts come in, these IRL efforts show that Kendu has substance and has something **physical** behind our efforts, we wont just disappear tomorrow, we are here to stay and grow for multiple cycles. Kendu's real world efforts show **proof of humanity** in a world where AI and bot use has become quite rampant. 

Kendu although evolving the memecoin space has not stopped pushing on social media, we are arguably the biggest presence on Reddit, Stocktwits, whilst both having very strong efforts on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Social media efforts are still very important imo but they aren't the full picture anymore. 

Shib, Doge and Pepe evolved the space in their time, but Kendu is the current coin to evolve the space, we are taking it to a level never been met before. Kendu has the potential to give holders the largest return on investment this cycle. We have no ceiling, We are unstoppable and We are changing the game.

1md7lsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1md7lsv/my_story_termination_at_13_weeks/,"My story, termination at 13 weeks","I was nearly 13 weeks pregnant when we found out that there was an all but 100% chance of down syndrome, and our choice was to terminate. The decision, though I won't go in to it, was based on our opinion that life is difficult enough even for us, difficult enough for children with ""perfectly clean slates"". Our choice in no way condemns or discredits the opinions and choices of people who think differently, it is simply our own personal choice and opinion on our personal life.

In any case, I wanted to share this experience not only as a lament to it for myself, but hopefully as a shoulder to other people in similar positions, whatever they may be. 



Grief is a strangely alien being, for how often it interrupts and overwhelms our lives.¬†I don't think we give it its due credit for being an entity of its own, with its own rules and processes, maybe that's why we have such a tough time of it, since we only ever treat it like an uninvited visitor we never bother to get to know.¬†On my part, grief often comes in a form of withdrawal, withdrawal from feelings, from day-to-day life. In a way I think it even withdraws itself¬†from me myself, so much so I don't even know it's there.

¬†It hit me like a freight train, much harder than I expected it to, when I was lying there for that defining ultrasound and she said with no uncertainty that our baby only had one certainty, which was not to be.¬†At the time I think one of the primary feelings was shame, humiliation even, at having failed so colossally on something that should come so naturally. I had made a big show of telling all my colleagues only just the day before, something in my heart I knew I shouldn't have done. That morning I'd even seen the awful news in the images in the clouds without looking for it, known what it meant, and chosen to ignore it.¬†Now, not only would I have to go through This, but I had opened the way for a volley of judgement. I had invited it.¬†

They treated my partner so poorly too, at the hospital. They ignored him, disregarded him and anything he had to say, not that they asked him anything. We imagine it's the inevitable albeit unfortunate result of the doctors having to deal daily with so many uninterested, dead-beat, even abusive male partners... but it's nothing short of a grievous insult to those who only ever tried their best.¬†With sombre politeness we were told that the next steps would be to induce, i.e. to go through labour and birth which could take the whole day, and that I may even need surgery if the ""delivery"" wasn't complete. I was given the various pills to begin this process.¬†That Wednesday night, I took the first of these pills, along with 2 bottles of wine.

I figured out that I actually did have options, mainly to have instead a legitimate abortion. There's no getting around the weight of the stigma of that word, but all in all, we both as well as our family and immediate friends agreed that as far as the resulting trauma would go, this option was best for me.¬†I didn't want to labour, birth, and hold a child I would never get to keep. God knows I didn't want to vaginally birth what could have been a perfectly healthy child, also for traumatic reasons due to my past, let alone.

 That is something that I admit without shame, that terrified me; the idea of the weight of that new trauma, and what it might do to me. I know that I am strong, but even those incredibly strong people who've lost their minds have during some moments of lucidity been able to say that there had been signs, that in some way they had seen it coming. I saw it coming now, and I'd have sooner bolted dead that door and dug the moat for the crocodiles with my bare hands.¬†So I called the clinic, and set the date for Tuesday, 29th July.

Anyway.¬†I spent the next days in bed, binge watching The Crown and ordering in food I dibbled at only when the resultant munchies from smoking pot like a little chimney hit. I think I only got up to piss and shit, and wipe away the blood that started Thursday morning. And I cried. I cried in bed, in the hallway, on the toilet...whenever I caught myself in a moment I wasn't being distracted. Mostly I cried in the shower, where I pushed myself to go for no other reason than my body being so uncomfortable I could think of nothing else to do. I sat there on my shower chair that I'd happily bought for myself the weekend before, for my later bigger self, and wept hard. I played the song I Am The Antichrist by Kishi Bashi over and over again while I sat there. Don't jump to assumption now, I don't think I'm the antichrist, it's just a very good song. Soft and miserable, hopeless and at the same time strangely comforting, in the same way I imagine Death to be when it takes you - a sad but understanding friend.¬†Then, as I imagine happens when you let your grief play out in the way it's supposed to for you, the night before while I sat there, I did not weep, I only cried.¬†

I was so scared that morning, I didn't know how things were going to happen, what I was ""in for"". Speaking as one from experience now, the pain of the situation itself if only comparable to the pain that the stigma had drilled into you. The clinic was adjacent to the hospital, it was even their recommendation so no issues there, but we had to laugh at the statement ""it's just behind the Jumbo"".. It just seems so insultingly pedestrian, to go have an abortion behind the supermarket. I'm so glad that I was raised on bitter, bleak comedy so that this was indeed strongly comical, even under the circumstances.¬†

My partner, my love and life kept my spirits up the whole morning, how he could I don't know if I'll ever understand. But that's one of the many things about him that's so wonderful. For all his many faults every human has, the empathy and calm, the kind of understanding that invites confidence instead of demanding it, the sheer goodness that pours out of this man... How he cleaned the whole house on Sunday and happily showed off his success like it was any other day and time, how he gently pushed me to eat because evidently I'd forgotten to for a few days in a row, how he'd still call me sexy and beautiful even in my wholly dishevelled, miserable state cartoonists would have accentuated with a cloud of tiny flies about my head. When I say that I am a lucky woman, how indeed could those doctors be prepared for a man like him, I certainly wasn't.

¬†It was a bright, sunny day and while we biked over to the clinic you had to notice it even smelled beautiful. There was this strange anticipation in the air for me, not of misery but like a party, I may as well have been on a quick last minute shopping run while everyone else was getting ready back home.¬†Everybody was so lovely at the clinic, from the receptionist to the nurses. It's protocol, due to the general assumption I explained before, that I spoke to the nurse alone first. The second she understood our situation, that this pregnancy had been wanted and was being terminated due to no ""want"" of our own, they called him in immediately. He was after all, an equally important part of this whole experience.¬†There was no second-guessing, or prompting of taking more time to think etc, which was appreciated. We all knew what the situation was, I even got the impression that the clinic people were not impressed with how the hospital had handled the situation, least of all which that they'd made me wait for so long. Maybe that's why they hide the clinic behind the supermarket, where the real people with real feelings instead of insurance-money driven professionals are.¬†

They gave me some more medication and pain-killers, and then it was time for me to go to the next room and for my partner, after many kisses and hugs, to wait outside.¬†The next room was equally calm, with soft white recliners and blankies with hot water bottles. I sat wrapped up in one for about an hour, again taking in the strangely happy vibes. Like when I took the pregnancy test that day in May, except this time without my pleading for support, I felt that my grandmother and father, dad and perhaps even my partner's father all long since passed, were there. I felt they were dressed in their best, excited for what was to come. It was indeed like a queer kind of christening, I could almost see the coffee table set for guests, complete with those tiny doilies for each cup. I think this is what people mean when they say their faith helped them, because I don't doubt that the feeling was directly related to my paganism and connection with energies, and it very much helped me.

I was scared and helplessly sad, but at the same time it in no way felt like what you think when you hear the word ""abortion"". Instead it felt every bit like a hand-over, a happy one even.¬†Go-time came eventually and I was lead to yet another little room, this time a small operating theatre where there was one big hospital bed on wheels for me for after, and the seated type with the stirrups for the procedure. There were two young, kind and friendly nurses, and the main doctor. All of them spoke gently, asked the usual medical questions, and when I became overwhelmed by it all and started to cry they held my hand and soothed me without judgement or air of business is business.¬†They doped me up with milk of amnesia, which turns out to be extremely aptly named.¬†I vaguely remember some joke-like chatting, one nurse asked if I was going on holiday to which I replied that I'd be busy trying to make another baby. She passed a funny comment, that that's a great activity to do on holiday.

I don't remember the procedure, or how they got me into hospital underwear with a pad, or in the bed. The next thing I remember is lolling around in the bed, albeit high of my kite as I'd ever been, I felt better than all week.¬†I sipped my little cup of juice and thanked the doctors who came to check on me over and over again for their kindness and gentleness. As soon as I was able to stand I waddled over to their little coffee table for a cup of tea and a piece of cake, a true homage to the christening party I had been feeling before. Speaking of which, I felt everybody had gone, along with a tiny, very pink and puffy-faced looking bundle.¬†

Again, the feeling of my unfathomable sadness seemed to be forcefully enveloped with a sense of calm happiness. I won't discredit the drugs they gave me, but I am nevertheless certain it was mostly due to the knowledge I had in my heart that this was a choice that had had to be made for the better of everybody involved, and that I, and everybody involved, was ok.¬†

This morning my partner and I had breakfast at the living-room table, bacon and eggs, tea, the whole thing. I feel the cramps still, I bleed still, but I can't deny that I do feel, so much better. With great effort I remind myself that though I feel better at this moment, I am healing and not ""there yet"". That though the doctors did the very best of their work and the pain-killers are doing an equally good job, my leg is still broken and the absence of pain does not mean I am in any way ready to run.

I believe, that that is one of the many over-looked qualities of grief as its own entity, and thereby a trap we continue to fall into. Grief, like any force, wants to exist and the only way for it to is to force its way in though any crack or opening, it's very clever especially when its own existence is at stake, and will even use the tiny slivers of your own happiness as ways to re-enter and take over. I believe that is why people suffering from burn-outs eventually do burn out - because in that tiny moment they felt ok again, they let their guard down.¬†

But I won't, I can't. If I'm going to be a good mother I have to be strong even in the light of everything that wants to tear me down into darkness, because I have to be the one person who doesn't, who can be relied upon, who can fight every boogey-man under every bed. Not only because I have to, but because I want to. And I will.¬†



My story ends with the hope for a new run, and I appreciate very much that this is not the case for everyone.

For these people I want to say, You are not alone, or invalidated, or in any way less of a person. Life throws everything it has at you without warning, and you know yourself best and what is best for you. If you are feeling guilt, use that feeling not as a punishment but instead as proof that you have the will to do what is right for you, even when those who don't know you think otherwise. If you are in pain, use that pain not as sign of some part of you that is dying but as proof that you are very much, alive. If you feel yourself weak, remember that often real strength means closing doors, until you find the one that is right to open, for You. Your very existence now, is a testament to the fact that you are, in your own way, fathomlessly important. 

To each and every single person reading this post I send love, understanding, and the hope for the very bestest of days to come.

1md7k9g,https://i.redd.it/kx55hzk2r0gf1.jpeg,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:

‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô

‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù

‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù

‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù

‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù

‚Äúbad mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm going to show you the world‚Äù

‚Äúbad mouse is getting worse!‚Äù

‚Äúme me me me me me‚Äù

‚Äúattention‚Äù

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.",1,1753884493.0,Fakelostmedia,0,1.0,False

1md7h3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppreview/comments/1md7h3i/why_i_stopped_taking_the_nootropic_everyone_loves/,Why I stopped taking the nootropic everyone loves,"Tried the brain supplements everyone won't shut up about.

Honestly, they sucked.

Here's what chasing the hype actually got me.

**The hall of fame nootropics that ""changed lives""**

Lion's mane, magnesium l threonate, NAD boosters.

You see those miracle threads and think, why not?

So I went all in: 

* Lion's mane for six weeks 
* Magnesium threonate for a month 
* NAD boosters for three weeks (barely made it)

Not one lived up to the hype.

**Lion's mane: brain fog traded for brain static**

Week one, I felt sharper.

Then it flipped.

Brain started buzzing like static, like a radio stuck between stations at 3am.

What happened: 

* Racing thoughts at bedtime 
* Dreams way too vivid, woke up tired 
* Felt overstimulated, but still tired 
* Couldn't turn off the inner chatter

Held out for six weeks.

Never got better.

**Magnesium l threonate: maybe a memory boost, but sleep was wrecked**

Supposed to help you chill out.

All I got was waking up every two hours, drenched in dreams.

The reality: 

* Sleep so broken I'd wake up groggy  
* Digestion went sideways, bloating for days 
* Any memory boost was killed by bad sleep

I tried less, I tried more, nothing fixed it.

**NAD boosters: started strong, ended as a disaster**

The first few days felt legit superhuman.

But it's all downhill from there.

The crash: 

* Brain flatlined every afternoon around 3pm 
* Headaches that just sat behind my eyes 
* Wired and exhausted at the same time

Saw dozens of posts from people stuck in the same loop.

**The one side effect nobody ever warns you about**

This is the one that really got me.

Low level anxiety that just hummed under the surface, day to day.

Not regular stress, just this weird background tension.

Stopped everything for three weeks just to feel normal again.

**What the people who've been burned actually use now**

Went hunting in old comments for what works after the letdown.

Found a pattern: 

* tyrosine for focus that doesn't feel like speed 
* Regular magnesium glycinate for sleep 
* B vitamins when low energy hits 
* Coffee and walking

No more ""limitless"" stacks.

Just basics.

**What actually works for me now**

Coffee in the morning, magnesium at night, B vitamins sometimes.

Sleep's back, brain's clear, no more mystery crashes.

Turns out, boring actually works.

**This hits if**

You got burned by the big nootropics and want actual stories.

You want real world side effects, not hype.

**Skip this if**

You're one of the lucky ones who found a stack that just works.

**Anyone else get absolutely torched by the hype?**

What boring stuff actually helped you?",1,1753884278.0,suppreview,0,1.0,False

But I fell for you so hard. I could never fully tell you how I felt, but the way I chased you and tried for years to get you back speaks for itself. I was terrified of being in love alone, and you were avoidant. I asked you for things you weren‚Äôt ready to give. I now know I came off too strong at a pace too fast for you. After I lost you, it was like the more I tried to get you back, the further you‚Äôd go. I know we‚Äôll never speak again. You made sure. Even though I still don‚Äôt know how you felt about me, that year we were together was one of the healthiest relationships I‚Äôve been in. Before we fell apart that December. 

In another life, I‚Äôd still be with you. And we‚Äôd never let each other go. You would have heard me out when I tried to explain myself. You were a man of few words, and I always said too much to be understood. But I would still give everything up for you. Every step I‚Äôve made to move on undone in an instant. I know I should have taken all of this as a sign that you weren‚Äôt into me. But after we fell apart and you came back to me, I thought I had a chance. That was the only time you‚Äôve ever contacted me, and I was with someone else. It was so new, only a week or two old. I told you I would have ended things if you actually wanted me back, and then you disappeared again. I wish you would have given us a real chance. I would have gotten it right this time.

I know now that is your pattern. I don‚Äôt know if you were afraid to get close to someone. But I knew you cared for me in some way. Those nights on the couch watching scary movies, when you‚Äôd make me the best steak. Going on ‚Äúerrands‚Äù together because you couldn‚Äôt have a full weekend sitting at home. You‚Äôd leave for work and I‚Äôd still be there at your place. You always came home with a smile for me. You loved blueberries, dark coffee, and cats. I‚Äôll never forget you, or those honey-colored eyes. I would have waited for you after we fell apart. I begged you for a sign,and you said nothing. 

In another life, you were honest with me. You didn‚Äôt leave me guessing and crying. You would have told me directly if you weren‚Äôt interested. Silence is hard for me to read. I think it hurt you that I moved on. From my perspective, you ghosted me for months after a year of dating. I really loved you, but I realized I needed someone to love me back out loud. I would have fully moved on if you hadn‚Äôt given me hope that April. Maybe you just took pity on me and wanted to give me closure, but I‚Äôd stopped contacting you long before then. I‚Äôve held that hope all these years. Every time I reached out, you‚Äôd briefly entertain it and then disappear again. I thought time and distance would help, but I was wrong. It‚Äôs been years, and I was wrong. I still miss what we could have been.

I wish we would have argued when we dated. I could‚Äôve fixed whatever was missing if I knew what was on your mind. You said you had problems with boundaries, but I never knew what those were. If I pushed past them, I‚Äôm sorry. If the intensity of my feelings chased you away, I‚Äôm sorry. My pace wasn‚Äôt yours. After a year, I started looking at you and seeing a life together. I know you weren‚Äôt there yet, and it hurt, and I lashed out at times. It was always met with silence. I wish you‚Äôd gotten angry with me. Told me off. Then I would have had some kind of direction to go in.

I hope you never read this. It‚Äôs my last call into our past, and it‚Äôs embarrassing that I still care this much. I hope you do read this and tell me I was wrong about you and that you feel the same. My name sits right next to delusional. In my heart, your name is limerence. As crazy as this looks, I had to burn these feelings out. Every text I sent, voice note, and call you ignored. You blocked me, and it‚Äôs for the best. So I have to really try to move on with my life this time. I have to block you back so I can fight the urge to reach out every summer when memories are replaying in my head. This isn‚Äôt sustainable for me. Having my heart in two places. I can‚Äôt keep yearning for someone who would pick me up and put me down at whim. Or ignore my tears. Or give me hope just to end up chasing a dream.

We should have talked the night I put a welcome home sign up and filled your apartment with balloons in your favorite color. I missed you that much. That was the last time I saw you. We could have fixed things or at least met halfway. 

In another life, I‚Äôm still with you. And we never let each other go.

# Physiological and Symptomatic Correlates of Caffeine Cessation: An Analysis of Withdrawal and Benefits

# I. Introduction

# A. Overview of Caffeine

Caffeine, chemically known as 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, is a naturally occurring methylxanthine alkaloid predominantly found in coffee beans, tea leaves, and cocoa beans, among other plant sources.1 It stands as the most consumed psychoactive substance globally, sought primarily for its well-documented stimulant effects on the central nervous system.2 The ubiquity of caffeine is evident in its incorporation into a vast array of products, including common beverages like coffee, tea, and soft drinks, as well as dietary supplements and various over-the-counter and prescription medications.1 Given its pervasive presence in daily life, a comprehensive understanding of its physiological impact, particularly the consequences arising from its cessation, is of considerable importance for both public health initiatives and individual well-being.

# B. Physiological Basis for Dependence and Significance of Cessation

The regular and sustained consumption of caffeine induces a series of neuroadaptive changes within the body, primarily centered around the adenosine system. These adaptations culminate in a state of physical dependence, wherein the body adjusts its homeostatic mechanisms to the continuous presence of caffeine and, consequently, experiences adverse physiological and psychological effects upon its abrupt withdrawal.4 The cessation of caffeine intake, therefore, is not merely a passive event but one that actively triggers a well-characterized withdrawal syndrome. This syndrome is marked by a constellation of symptoms that reflect the body's readjustment to a caffeine-free state.6

Elucidating the physiological changes that underpin caffeine cessation is crucial for several reasons. It provides valuable information for individuals contemplating a reduction or elimination of caffeine from their diet, equips healthcare professionals with the knowledge to advise patients effectively, and offers a deeper understanding for researchers investigating the pharmacology of stimulants. This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of these physiological readjustments, delineate the chronological progression of withdrawal symptoms, and explore the potential health benefits that may arise from discontinuing caffeine use.

# C. Scope of the Report

This report will deliver an expert-level analysis of the physiological changes that occur in the human body following the cessation of habitual caffeine consumption. It will meticulously describe the commonly experienced withdrawal effects, detailing their typical onset, peak intensity, and duration. Furthermore, the report will investigate the potential benefits associated with caffeine cessation, outlining their nature and the general timeframe within which they may become apparent, all grounded in current scientific literature.

# II. Caffeine's Hold on the Body: Mechanisms of Action and Adaptation

Caffeine exerts its well-known stimulant effects through complex interactions with the body's neurochemical systems. Understanding these mechanisms is fundamental to comprehending why cessation leads to withdrawal and how the body adapts to chronic exposure.

# A. The Adenosine System: Caffeine as an Adenosine Receptor Antagonist

The principal pharmacological action of caffeine lies in its role as a non-selective antagonist of adenosine receptors, with particular affinity for the A1 and A2A subtypes.1 Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that functions as a neuromodulator throughout the body, especially in the brain. Its primary roles include promoting relaxation, inducing drowsiness, and generally inhibiting neuronal activity, thereby acting as a natural ""brake"" on the nervous system.5

Caffeine's molecular structure bears a striking resemblance to that of adenosine. This structural similarity allows caffeine to bind to adenosine receptors without activating them. In doing so, caffeine competitively blocks adenosine from binding and exerting its inhibitory effects.11 As described, ""In the brain, adenosine protects us by slowing nerve cell activity. Due to its similar structure, caffeine binds to the adenosine receptors. Caffeine therefore, not only blocks adenosine's ability to slow nerve activity, but it increases nerve activity, leaving us stimulated, more alert, energetic..."".11 This blockade effectively removes the inhibitory tone imposed by adenosine, leading to increased neuronal excitability, enhanced alertness, and a reduction in fatigue.1 This antagonism at adenosine receptors is the cornerstone of caffeine's stimulant properties and is responsible for many of its effects, including improved cognitive function and wakefulness.1

# B. Neurotransmitter Modulation: Impact on Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Acetylcholine, and Others

The antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine initiates a cascade of indirect effects on various other neurotransmitter systems, further contributing to its psychoactive profile.2

**Dopamine:** Caffeine is known to increase the secretion of dopamine and can lead to an upregulation of dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability.2 This effect is particularly noted in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain crucial for executive functions, attention, and motivation.6 The enhanced dopaminergic activity in this region contributes significantly to caffeine's ability to improve focus, elevate mood, and reinforce its own consumption.2 It is important to note a distinction in caffeine's dopaminergic action compared to more classically addictive stimulants; caffeine primarily stimulates dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex rather than causing a massive surge in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's primary reward center.6 This difference helps explain why caffeine possesses reinforcing properties and can lead to dependence, yet typically does not produce the intense, compulsive drug-seeking behavior associated with substances that directly and powerfully target the nucleus accumbens.

**Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline) and Acetylcholine:** Caffeine also induces smaller, yet physiologically relevant, increases in the levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine.2 Norepinephrine is involved in alertness, arousal, and the stress response, while acetylcholine plays a key role in learning, memory, and attention. The elevation of these neurotransmitters further augments caffeine's stimulant and cognitive-enhancing effects.

**Other Neurotransmitters:** The blockade of adenosine receptors also indirectly influences other neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, glutamate (the primary excitatory neurotransmitter), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter).12 The net effect of these modulations is a shift towards increased neuronal excitation.

**Phosphodiesterase Inhibition:** Beyond adenosine receptor antagonism, caffeine can also inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes. PDEs are responsible for breaking down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an important intracellular second messenger. By inhibiting PDEs, caffeine can increase intracellular cAMP levels.1 This mechanism can contribute to some of caffeine's physiological effects, such as bronchodilation (making it useful in some respiratory conditions) and increases in blood pressure. However, the concentrations of caffeine required to significantly inhibit PDE are generally higher than those achieved with typical dietary consumption and those needed for effective adenosine receptor blockade.9 Thus, adenosine receptor antagonism remains its primary mode of action at common intake levels.

# C. Chronic Exposure: Physiological Adaptations (Tolerance, Adenosine Receptor Upregulation and Sensitization)

Continuous, long-term exposure to caffeine prompts the body to make significant physiological adjustments in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. These adaptations are central to the phenomena of tolerance and physical dependence.

**Tolerance Development:** With habitual caffeine intake, the body gradually becomes less responsive to its effects, a phenomenon known as tolerance.4 This means that the same dose of caffeine produces a diminished response over time, or conversely, higher doses are required to achieve the initial effects. Tolerance has been documented for various effects of caffeine, including its impact on blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective mood states.4 The development of tolerance can effectively mask the full physiological impact of caffeine on a regular user. For instance, while a caffeine-na√Øve individual might experience significant jitteriness or sleep disruption from a moderate dose, a habituated user might feel ""normal"" on the same dose, even though their underlying physiology is actively compensating for caffeine's presence. This adaptation, while allowing for continued function, sets the stage for withdrawal upon cessation.

**Adenosine Receptor Upregulation and Sensitization:** The most critical adaptation underlying caffeine tolerance and dependence is the upregulation and sensitization of adenosine receptors, particularly the A1 and A2A subtypes.4 Upregulation refers to an increase in the number of adenosine receptors in the brain and other tissues, such as blood platelets.4 For example, A2A receptors on human platelets have been shown to increase in number following periods of daily caffeine intake (e.g., 400 mg/day for two weeks or 600 mg/day for one week).4 Sensitization means that the existing receptors may become more sensitive or have a higher affinity for adenosine.

This adaptive response is a biological attempt to counteract the chronic blockade of adenosine receptors by caffeine. By increasing the number and sensitivity of these receptors, the body strives to restore normal adenosine signaling despite the persistent presence of the antagonist (caffeine). While this ""adaptive balancing act"" allows the individual to function more normally during chronic caffeine use, it creates a state of hypersensitivity to endogenous adenosine. When caffeine is subsequently withdrawn, these overabundant and highly sensitive receptors are suddenly unopposed, leading to an exaggerated response to normal levels of adenosine, which is the fundamental basis of the caffeine withdrawal syndrome. Studies in animal models have also shown that chronic caffeine ingestion can sensitize the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system, enhancing the inhibitory effect of adenosine on adenylate cyclase when caffeine is absent.17 Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that chronic caffeine exposure might lead to a downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.17

# III. The Unwinding Process: Physiological Changes and Withdrawal Symptoms Upon Caffeine Cessation

When an individual who regularly consumes caffeine abruptly stops or significantly reduces their intake, the body undergoes a series of physiological readjustments as it transitions from a caffeine-adapted state to a caffeine-free state. This ""unwinding"" process is characterized by the emergence of caffeine withdrawal syndrome.

# A. The Rebound Effect: Adenosine Hypersensitivity and Cerebral Vasodilation

The primary driver of many caffeine withdrawal symptoms is the unmasking of the adenosine system's hypersensitivity. As discussed, chronic caffeine use leads to an increase in the number and sensitivity of adenosine receptors.4 Upon cessation, these receptors are no longer blocked by caffeine. Consequently, endogenous adenosine, which is always present in the body, can now bind to this amplified population of receptors. This results in an exaggerated physiological response to normal adenosine levels, effectively an ""adenosine overdrive"".7

One of the most significant and well-documented consequences of this adenosine hypersensitivity is marked cerebral vasodilation. Caffeine itself is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor, reducing cerebral blood flow (CBF) by an average of 22% to 30% with a typical dose of 250 mg.4 This vasoconstriction is primarily mediated by caffeine's antagonism of adenosine A2A and A2B receptors on vascular smooth muscle.4 When caffeine is withdrawn, two things happen: the direct vasoconstrictive effect of caffeine is removed, and the vasodilatory action of adenosine is amplified due to the upregulated and sensitized receptors. This combination leads to a significant increase in CBF.4 This rapid increase in cerebral blood flow and the associated changes in intracranial pressure are considered the primary physiological mechanisms underlying the characteristic and often severe caffeine withdrawal headache.4 Studies have directly shown that withdrawal headaches in caffeine users correspond with increased CBF observed 20-24 hours after abstention.4

The common experience of headache relief from caffeine-containing analgesics 3 versus the headache caused by caffeine withdrawal presents an apparent paradox. This is resolved by understanding caffeine's dual and context-dependent effects on cerebral vasculature. Acutely, caffeine's vasoconstrictive properties can alleviate certain types of headaches, particularly those associated with vasodilation (like some migraines). However, chronic exposure leads to adaptive changes (adenosine receptor upregulation). Upon withdrawal, the absence of caffeine's vasoconstrictive influence, combined with the now heightened sensitivity to adenosine's vasodilatory effects, results in a rebound vasodilation that precipitates the withdrawal headache.

# B. Neurochemical Readjustments: Returning to a Non-Caffeinated Baseline

Beyond the adenosine system, other neurochemical balances are also disrupted and subsequently readjust during caffeine withdrawal.

**Dopamine System Normalization:** Caffeine indirectly stimulates dopamine release, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, contributing to its mood-elevating and focus-enhancing effects.2 When caffeine is removed, this indirect stimulation ceases. The resulting temporary decrease in dopaminergic activity, relative to the caffeinated state, can contribute to several common withdrawal symptoms, including fatigue, decreased motivation, anhedonia (reduced ability to experience pleasure), and a depressed mood.5

**Other Neurotransmitter Systems:** The levels and activity of other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and GABA, also undergo readjustment as the brain transitions away from the constant influence of caffeine.6 The overall shift is from a pharmacologically stimulated state towards one characterized by increased physiological inhibition (due to unopposed adenosine) and reduced excitation. This contributes to symptoms like drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, and lethargy.

**EEG Changes:** These neurochemical shifts are reflected in changes in brain electrical activity, as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG). Caffeine withdrawal is consistently associated with an increase in theta wave activity in the brain.14 Increased theta rhythm is a known neurophysiological correlate of drowsiness, fatigue, and reduced concentration.14 Studies have shown increases in theta and delta brainwave activity during withdrawal, with concomitant decreases in the mean frequency of alpha and beta waves, aligning with subjective reports of difficulty concentrating and drowsiness.14

The entire withdrawal syndrome, while often uncomfortable, represents a necessary physiological ""recalibration."" The body is actively working to dismantle the adaptations it made to chronic caffeine exposure (e.g., downregulating the surplus of adenosine receptors, re-sensitizing other neurotransmitter systems) to return to a true, unadulterated physiological baseline. The duration of withdrawal symptoms, typically lasting from two to nine days, reflects the time required for these initial, significant neurochemical and receptor-level readjustments to occur.

# C. Chronological Timeline of Caffeine Withdrawal

The onset, peak intensity, and duration of caffeine withdrawal symptoms follow a relatively predictable pattern, although individual experiences can vary based on several factors.4

Phase 1 (12-24 Hours Post-Cessation): Initial Symptoms  
The first signs of caffeine withdrawal typically emerge within 12 to 24 hours after the last dose of caffeine.4 The most common early symptoms include:

* **Headache:** Often the first and most prominent symptom to appear.
* **Fatigue and Lethargy:** A noticeable decrease in energy levels.
* **Decreased Alertness and Drowsiness:** Difficulty staying awake or feeling mentally sharp.

Phase 2 (20-51 Hours Post-Cessation): Peak Symptom Intensity  
Withdrawal symptoms generally reach their peak intensity between 20 and 51 hours after caffeine cessation.6 During this period, symptoms can be at their most severe and debilitating. In addition to the intensification of early symptoms, individuals may experience:

* **Intense, often throbbing headache**.5
* **Pronounced fatigue, sleepiness, and yawning**.5
* **Irritability, mood swings, and possibly feelings of depression or anxiety**.5
* **Difficulty concentrating, mental fog, or a feeling of being ""not clearheaded""**.5
* **Nausea and, in some cases, vomiting**.5
* **Muscle pain, stiffness, or tension, particularly in the neck and shoulders**.5
* **Flu-like symptoms, such as body aches, chills, or hot spells**.6

Phase 3 (Days 2-9+): Symptom Resolution and Gradual Improvement  
Following the peak, symptoms typically begin to subside gradually over the subsequent 2 to 9 days.5 Some sources indicate that symptoms can persist for up to a week or slightly longer.20 The severity of symptoms lessens progressively, and individuals start to feel a return towards their normal baseline state. For most people, withdrawal symptoms are largely resolved within two weeks of cessation.22

# D. A Comprehensive Look at Common Withdrawal Symptoms

The following table summarizes the most common and empirically validated symptoms of caffeine withdrawal, providing a consolidated overview of what individuals might expect during the cessation process.

**Table 1: Common Caffeine Withdrawal Symptoms: Description, Typical Onset, Peak, and Duration**

|Symptom|Description|Typical Onset (Post-Cessation)|Typical Peak Intensity (Post-Cessation)|Typical Duration|Supporting Evidence|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Headache**|Often throbbing, diffuse; considered the hallmark symptom due to cerebral vasodilation.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|4|
|**Fatigue/Lethargy**|Overwhelming tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty initiating or sustaining activity.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|5|
|**Drowsiness**|Increased sleepiness, difficulty staying awake.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|6|
|**Decreased Alertness**|Reduced mental sharpness, slower reaction times.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|6|
|**Difficulty Concentrating**|Inability to focus, easily distracted, ""mental fog.""|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|5|
|**Irritability**|Increased impatience, frustration, easily annoyed, mood swings.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|5|
|**Depressed Mood**|Feelings of sadness, low mood, lack of motivation, anhedonia.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|5|
|**Anxiety**|Feelings of nervousness, restlessness, tension.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|Up to 1 week|5|
|**Nausea/Vomiting**|Upset stomach, queasiness, and in some cases, vomiting.|Can occur during peak phase|20-51 hours|1-3 days|5|
|**Muscle Pain/Stiffness**|Aches, pains, or stiffness, often in the neck, shoulders, or back.|Can occur during peak phase|20-51 hours|2-7 days|5|
|**Flu-like Symptoms**|General malaise, body aches, chills, hot spells, stuffy nose (less common but reported).|Can occur during peak phase|20-51 hours|2-7 days|6|
|**Mental Fog/Not Clearheaded**|Feeling mentally dull, slow, or confused.|12-24 hours|20-51 hours|2-9 days|5|

The intensity and exact constellation of withdrawal symptoms are not uniform across all individuals. This variability is influenced by a confluence of factors. Genetics play a role, particularly variations in genes like *CYP1A2*, which codes for the primary enzyme responsible for caffeine metabolism.9 Individuals who are ""slow metabolizers"" of caffeine may experience its effects and withdrawal differently than ""fast metabolizers."" The amount of daily caffeine consumed and the duration of regular use are also critical determinants; higher and more prolonged exposure generally leads to more significant neuroadaptation and, consequently, a more pronounced withdrawal syndrome.4 Other physiological factors, such as overall health status, hydration levels, and even psychological elements like stress, can further modulate the subjective experience of withdrawal.

# IV. Life After Caffeine: Potential Benefits and Their Emergence

Following the acute withdrawal phase, the cessation of habitual caffeine intake can usher in a range of potential physiological and psychological benefits as the body returns to a more natural state of functioning, uninfluenced by this exogenous stimulant. The emergence of these benefits varies, with some becoming apparent relatively quickly and others developing more gradually over time.

# A. Neurological and Psychological Well-being

1. Improved Sleep Quality and Architecture: Caffeine is a well-known antagonist of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep and relaxation.26 By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine can delay sleep onset, reduce total sleep time, and alter sleep architecture, particularly diminishing deep sleep stages, especially when consumed close to bedtime.9 Cessation allows adenosine to exert its natural sleep-promoting effects unimpeded. This can lead to an easier time falling asleep, potentially increased total sleep duration, and more restorative deep sleep.20 Improvements in sleep quality are often noticeable within 1 to 2 weeks after withdrawal symptoms subside, as the body's natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep drive) normalizes.20 This improvement in sleep often serves as a foundational benefit, positively influencing other aspects of well-being. Better sleep quality is intrinsically linked to improved mood, more stable energy levels, enhanced cognitive function, and even more balanced hormonal regulation. Thus, the restoration of natural sleep patterns post-caffeine is likely a primary driver for many other observed physiological and psychological advantages.
2. Reduced Anxiety and Nervousness: Caffeine is a stimulant that activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to physiological responses such as increased heart rate, heightened alertness, and the release of adrenaline, which can trigger or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, jitteriness, and nervousness.2 Some evidence also suggests caffeine can elevate levels of cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone.27 Eliminating caffeine removes this direct stimulant trigger. Feelings of calmness and reduced anxiety can begin to emerge as the withdrawal phase (which itself can include anxiety 5) resolves, typically within 1 to 2 weeks, with more sustained improvements developing over subsequent weeks and months.20
3. Enhanced Mood Stability and Reduced Irritability: The fluctuating dopamine levels associated with caffeine consumption (an initial increase followed by a dip between doses or during early withdrawal) can contribute to mood swings and irritability.2 Cessation eliminates this cycle. As the body is no longer reliant on caffeine for mood elevation, a more stable and balanced affective state can be achieved. This improvement generally occurs gradually over several weeks following cessation as neurotransmitter systems fully rebalance.20
4. More Consistent Energy Levels: Many individuals rely on caffeine for an energy boost, but this often comes with the price of subsequent energy crashes or ""afternoon slumps"" as the effects wear off. Caffeine cessation eliminates this artificial cycle of energy spikes and troughs.20 Once the initial fatigue of withdrawal subsides (typically within 1-2 weeks), many people report more sustained, stable, and less fluctuating energy levels throughout the day, supported by improved sleep quality and the body's natural metabolic regulation.20
5. Reduction in Chronic Headaches: For individuals who experience chronic daily headaches or migraines that are triggered or exacerbated by caffeine intake itself, or by the rebound phenomenon associated with inter-dose withdrawal or overuse of caffeine-containing analgesics, cessation can lead to a significant reduction in headache frequency and severity.21 This benefit usually becomes apparent after the acute caffeine withdrawal headache has fully resolved, often within 1 to 2 weeks.

# B. Cardiovascular Health

1. Potential for Blood Pressure Normalization: Caffeine is known to cause an acute, transient increase in blood pressure in many individuals.10 While tolerance to this pressor effect can develop with chronic use, cessation removes this direct pharmacological agent. For some people, particularly those with pre-existing hypertension or individuals who are genetically slow metabolizers of caffeine, eliminating caffeine may contribute to lower and more stable blood pressure readings over time.24 However, the relationship between habitual coffee (not pure caffeine) consumption and long-term blood pressure or cardiovascular risk is complex, with some studies suggesting a J-shaped curve where moderate consumption might be neutral or even beneficial for some outcomes, while high consumption may be detrimental.25 Focusing on caffeine cessation specifically, the removal of its acute pressor effects is a clear physiological change. Significant and stable changes in blood pressure due to caffeine cessation may take several weeks to months to become evident.
2. Improved Heart Rate Regulation: By reducing the stimulant effect on the sympathetic nervous system, caffeine cessation can lead to a more stable heart rate and a reduction in palpitations or arrhythmias in individuals sensitive to caffeine's cardiac effects. This benefit can often be noticed within days to weeks after quitting.

# C. Metabolic and Digestive Improvements

1. Enhanced Nutrient Absorption: Caffeine, and compounds often found in caffeinated beverages like tannins in tea and coffee, can interfere with the absorption of certain essential nutrients. These include minerals like iron and calcium, and some B vitamins.21 Caffeine can also alter gut transit time, potentially affecting absorption. Cessation of caffeine intake can improve the bioavailability of these nutrients from the diet, contributing to better overall nutritional status. This is a gradual and ongoing benefit that accrues as long as dietary habits remain consistent in the absence of caffeine's interference.
2. Improved Digestive Regularity: Caffeine possesses mild diuretic properties and can act as a laxative by increasing gut motility.1 For some individuals, this can lead to overly frequent bowel movements, loose stools, or an aggravation of symptoms associated with conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Eliminating caffeine can help normalize bowel function and reduce digestive discomfort for these individuals. Improvements in digestive regularity may be observed within days to weeks, depending on individual gut sensitivity.

# D. Hormonal Rebalancing

1. Potential Normalization of Stress Hormones: Research indicates that caffeine consumption can lead to an elevation in cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone.21 Chronically elevated cortisol can have widespread negative health consequences, including effects on metabolism, immune function, and mood. Cessation of caffeine intake may contribute to the normalization of cortisol rhythms and a reduction in the overall physiological stress burden. This is likely a gradual, long-term benefit.
2. Influence on Estrogen Levels (in women): Some studies suggest that caffeine consumption can influence estrogen levels in women, with effects potentially varying by ethnicity and the amount of caffeine consumed.28 While more research is needed to fully understand these interactions and their clinical significance, caffeine cessation may contribute to more balanced hormonal profiles for some women. This would also be a gradual, long-term adaptation.

# E. Other Long-Term Advantages

1. Improved Dental Health: Many popular caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and colas, are acidic and can contain sugars or dark pigments that contribute to tooth staining and enamel erosion over time.24 Caffeine itself can also contribute to dry mouth, which reduces saliva's protective effects against bacteria, increasing the risk of tooth decay. Reducing or eliminating these beverages can help prevent further dental damage. While the prevention of further damage is an immediate benefit, visible improvements in tooth color or sensitivity may take longer or require dental interventions.
2. Financial Savings: While not a direct physiological benefit, the cessation of regular caffeine purchases (e.g., daily coffee shop visits or purchases of energy drinks) can lead to significant financial savings over time, which can contribute to overall well-being. It is important to recognize that the benefits of caffeine cessation are not merely about reversing negative states induced by caffeine (like caffeine-induced anxiety or poor sleep). Rather, cessation allows the body to return to a more natural and potentially optimal state of physiological self-regulation, free from the constant modulation by an external stimulant. This can lead to an experience of baseline health and well-being that may have been previously masked by chronic caffeine use. For some, this process might also ""unmask"" underlying health issues that were being palliated by caffeine's stimulant effects (e.g., chronic fatigue due to a medical condition rather than poor sleep from caffeine). In such cases, while caffeine withdrawal resolves, the persistence of certain symptoms might indicate the need for further medical investigation, allowing for a truer assessment of baseline health.

The following table provides a summary of potential benefits associated with caffeine cessation and their estimated onset timeframes.

**Table 2: Potential Benefits of Caffeine Cessation and Estimated Onset Timeframes**

|Benefit Category|Specific Benefit|Brief Mechanism/Explanation|Estimated Onset Timeframe|Supporting Evidence|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Neurological/ Psychological**|Improved Sleep Quality|Normalization of adenosine's sleep-promoting effects; restoration of natural sleep architecture.|1-2 weeks post-withdrawal|20|
||Reduced Anxiety & Nervousness|Removal of sympathetic nervous system stimulation and potential cortisol elevation by caffeine.|1-2 weeks post-withdrawal, sustained over time|20|
||Enhanced Mood Stability|Elimination of caffeine-induced mood fluctuations; rebalancing of neurotransmitter systems (e.g., dopamine).|Weeks to months|20|
||More Consistent Energy Levels|Elimination of caffeine-induced energy spikes and crashes; reliance on natural energy regulation.|1-2 weeks post-withdrawal|20|
||Reduction in Chronic Headaches|Alleviation of caffeine-triggered or rebound headaches.|1-2 weeks post-withdrawal headache resolution|27|
|**Cardiovascular**|Potential Blood Pressure Normalization|Removal of caffeine's acute pressor effects.|Weeks to months|24|

# V. Navigating Caffeine Cessation

The experience of caffeine withdrawal is highly individual, influenced by a variety of physiological and behavioral factors. Understanding these can help in anticipating and managing the process.

# A. Factors Influencing Withdrawal Experience

* **Daily Caffeine Intake:** One of the most significant predictors of withdrawal severity is the amount of caffeine consumed daily. Higher daily doses generally correlate with more intense and potentially more prolonged withdrawal symptoms.8 The body adapts more profoundly to larger amounts of caffeine, leading to a more substantial readjustment upon cessation. It is noteworthy that withdrawal symptoms can manifest even with abstinence from relatively low daily doses, such as 100 mg (equivalent to about one standard cup of coffee).4
* **Duration of Regular Use:** The length of time an individual has been consistently consuming caffeine also plays a role. Longer periods of regular use can lead to more ingrained neuroadaptations, such as a greater increase in adenosine receptor density, which can contribute to a more pronounced withdrawal syndrome.21 However, withdrawal symptoms have been documented even after relatively short-term exposure (e.g., 6-15 days) to high doses of caffeine.21
* **Individual Genetics:** Genetic makeup significantly influences caffeine metabolism and sensitivity. Variations in the *CYP1A2* gene, which encodes the primary enzyme (cytochrome P450 1A2) responsible for metabolizing caffeine in the liver, are particularly important.7 Individuals can be categorized as ""fast"" or ""slow"" metabolizers of caffeine based on their *CYP1A2* genotype. Slow metabolizers clear caffeine from their system less efficiently, which may lead to prolonged effects from a given dose and potentially a different withdrawal experience compared to fast metabolizers.20 Other genetic variations related to adenosine receptors themselves might also influence sensitivity to caffeine's effects and withdrawal.
* **Individual Physiology and Psychology:** An individual's overall physiological state, including their general health, hydration status, and diet, can modulate the experience of withdrawal. Psychological factors, such as stress levels and coping mechanisms, can also influence the perceived severity of symptoms. While some early theories suggested that expectancy effects (believing one will experience withdrawal) might play a large role, research indicates that expectancies are not the prime determinant of the core physiological withdrawal symptoms.8 The withdrawal syndrome is a genuine physiological response.

The concept of repeated withdrawal cycles potentially sensitizing an individual to future episodes, sometimes referred to metaphorically as ""kindling"" in the context of other substances, is an area that warrants consideration, though direct evidence for caffeine is less established in the provided materials. Each withdrawal period involves significant neurochemical readjustment. It is plausible that the brain ""learns"" or adapts during these fluctuations, potentially making the neurochemical pathways involved in withdrawal more reactive over time. This could mean that an individual who has undergone multiple cycles of caffeine use and cessation might experience subsequent withdrawal episodes more intensely or readily, even with similar intake levels prior to quitting.

# B. Brief Note on Management Strategies

While the primary focus of this report is the physiological changes associated with caffeine cessation, a brief mention of common management approaches provides context. Strategies such as gradual tapering of caffeine intake over days or weeks, rather than abrupt ""cold turkey"" cessation, are frequently recommended and can significantly minimize the severity and duration of withdrawal symptoms.6 This allows the body to readjust more slowly to decreasing levels of caffeine, mitigating the shock to the system. Supportive measures during the withdrawal period can also be beneficial. These include maintaining adequate hydration, ensuring sufficient rest, and using over-the-counter analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen or acetaminophen) to manage headaches, if necessary.6

It is also crucial to differentiate caffeine withdrawal symptoms from those of underlying medical or psychological conditions, as there can be considerable overlap (e.g., headache, fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood).6 While caffeine withdrawal should be considered in the differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with such symptoms who are also habitual caffeine users, the persistence of these symptoms well beyond the typical withdrawal timeframe (generally 2-9 days, up to two weeks) may indicate an independent issue that requires further medical evaluation. Cessation can sometimes unmask these underlying conditions.

...
First off all, sorry if this sounds like a rant...
I'm not skinny at all. I'm 33 years old, 1.69 cm I weigh 71 quilos (156 pounds)
My mother is 1,65 and 117 quilos (257 pounds)
Our culture is one where we eat well, everybody gets feed. Friends come over, they have food with us, neighbor comes to say hello, there's snakes and coffee or tea. The worse thing someone can say about you is that they starved in your house. We belong to a PIGS country.
Me and my family are visiting my mother and she just keeps buying me cakes and chocolats that she knows I love. 
My family is all on the heavy side and my paternal grandmother died from complications to do with her weight. Also my family where the type that would serve my plate but them make me stay in the table until I finish it all. And say things like ""we said you where hungry last time"" and ""there's kids starving in Africa""
So I would have to eat until I was stuffed.
Now I'm a lot better and can actually leave some food if I'm full. 
Even though we have been out for lunch in many nice restaurants she keeps insisting that I should relax more.
I used to struggle with binging and overeating when sad. I would eat until I would feel sick.
Now it as been more then 1 year since my last binge (I'm very happy) and I no longer have ankle problems.
ButI know it's easy to just fall into it. 
The other day she bought 6 big eclair cakes from my favorite shop.
When she knew we where going for a birthday party and that I wanted to relax and eat there.
She got upset and end up eating all by herself.
Often she askes if I want to have breakfast out. I have been doing IF for now 6 months and she knows it.
My weakness is the breakfast here... The buttery toast and cake with big lattes.
I have been strong. 
Don't want to fall into it again.
But she does not make it easy.

1md7c5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1md7c5t/does_glacier_fresh_water_filter_really_improve/,Does GLACIER FRESH Water Filter Really Improve Taste and Quality? In-Depth Review,"Testing out the GLACIER FRESH GF-XWF-N water filter has been quite the experience, blending some real highs with a few things I wish the product team would tweak. The product seemed promising upon first glance, especially with its claim of compatibility with GE XWFE refrigerators and its NSF/ANSI 42 certification to remove chlorine, lead, and odors. I‚Äôve spent weeks using it in my kitchen, and here‚Äôs the real talk.

**Compact Design and Simple Installation**  
With dimensions coming in at just 1"" x 1"" x 1"", this filter is impressively compact. Out of the box, it doesn‚Äôt give off a ""fancy gadget"" vibe, yet it delivers a tool-free installation process. Attaching it to my GE fridge was a breeze, and it fit without any leaks or fiddling‚Äîalways a win. Compare this to some other filters I‚Äôve tried, which needed tools or extra force, and I can truly appreciate the straightforward setup the GLACIER FRESH offers.  

[Check GLACIER FRESH GF-XWF-N price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0dxmzwpn3/)  

**Performance: Cleaner and Fresher Water**  
Here‚Äôs where it shines. The filtration performance is notable, capable of removing nearly 98% of chlorine, odors, and other contaminants that mess with water quality. I no longer smelled that odd ""tap water tang,"" and tea and coffee brewed with the filtered water just tasted crisper. You don‚Äôt truly think about how water impacts your food and drinks until you use something like this‚Äîgame changer.

On the downside, the filter lifespan is limited to approximately 200 gallons or six months. Other filters in this price range aim for 300 gallons, so this feels slightly short. For a family of water bottle enthusiasts like mine, those six months sneak up pretty fast.

**Advantages**  
- Straightforward, tool-free installation.  
- Compact design fitting seamlessly into most compatible refrigerator models.  
- Effectively improves taste and eliminates odors.  

**Replacing It? Here's the Catch**  
The manufacturer states compatibility with a broad range of GE models, like the GFE26 and GSS25, which is fantastic. However, during testing, I realized not all older GE models might play nicely. My coworker, who also tested this, couldn‚Äôt slide it in their older unit without some positioning struggles. Double-checking your refrigerator model is essential before committing, even though all signs point to compatibility in the product description.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to 200 gallons or six months, which might feel short for some households.  
- Not universally compatible‚Äîsome older models may pose fitting challenges.  

**Competing Brands**  
There‚Äôs no denying how competitive the refrigerator water filter market is. Alternatives like the GE OEM filters might fit a smidge better but come at a notably higher cost, especially with recurring purchases. On the flip side, slightly cheaper filters from generic brands often lack certifications or reliable filtration efficiency, making them less appealing for anyone valuing safety. Compared to its rivals, the GLACIER FRESH filter balances affordability and trustworthy performance, striking a sweet spot for those who prioritize functionality without breaking the bank.

**Cost-Effectiveness Insight**  
Considering the filtration efficiency and reduced need for bottled water at home, the price feels justified. That said, some might want a longer filter life or expanded compatibility to really feel they‚Äôre getting the best bang for their buck. But if you‚Äôre someone like me, tired of paying up for major-name brands while still wanting clean, safe water, it‚Äôs worth every penny.

It‚Äôs not every day that a water filter pitcher changes the way I actually think about hydration. I‚Äôve been using the ZeroWater ZD-012RP 12-Cup Ready-Pour 5-Stage Water Filter Pitcher for the past few months, and it‚Äôs one of those rare finds that genuinely holds up to its claims. This isn‚Äôt my first rodeo with water filter pitchers, but this one blew me away with its precision, simplicity, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîthe superior taste of the filtered water. Admittedly, there are some quirks, but let me walk you through my experience with it.

**Sleek and Functional Design**

The first thing that caught my attention was the design. This pitcher is incredibly user-friendly, from its ergonomic curved handle to the quick-fill spigot that‚Äôs ideal for those rushed moments. It easily fits on my kitchen countertop without hogging too much space, and the transparent design lets me keep an eye on when a refill might be needed. At just 11.63""L x 5.93""W x 11""H, it fits snugly beside my coffee machine, keeping my kitchen looking tidy. While it's great for most homes, I imagine it'd be a little bulky if you‚Äôre dealing with cramped spaces or an overburdened fridge.

**Ready-Pour Technology**

Ready-Pour technology has been an absolute game-changer. With most pitchers I‚Äôve used, I‚Äôd always be stuck waiting for what feels like an eternity for it to finish filtering before I could grab a sip. Not with this one. You can pour water straight from the pitcher even while it‚Äôs still filtering, which is a lifesaver when I‚Äôm rushing out the door to work. My kids even managed to pour water without spilling (seriously, a minor miracle).

**Grab [ZeroWater ZD-012RP] at the best price on Amazon.**

**Exceptional Filtration System**

The heart of this product lies in its filtration system. The 5-stage ion exchange filter removes virtually all total dissolved solids (TDS), making for the purest water I‚Äôve ever tasted from a pitcher. The TDS meter included with the product is a nice touch; it lets me check the dissolved solid levels, so I never have to guess if the filter needs a change. From metals to chlorine and even those troublesome PFOA/PFOS chemicals, this filtration pitcher has my back. It‚Äôs IAPMO-certified to tackle heavy metals like lead and chromium, and that kind of reassurance means a lot when you‚Äôre trying to keep your family healthy.

Compared to the generic filters I‚Äôve used before, the difference is crystal clear‚Äîliterally. The lack of funky aftertastes (or that odd metallic twang) is where this really shines. However, the filters don‚Äôt last as long as I‚Äôd hoped, especially if you‚Äôre in a hard water area. I found myself needing a new filter sooner than expected, but the results during that time were impressive.

**Benefits**

- Advanced 5-stage filtration removes an impressive amount of contaminants, including lead and PFOA/PFOS.  
- Handy TDS meter ensures precise tracking of water quality before and after filtering.  
- Ready-Pour technology is super convenient‚Äîperfect during busy mornings.  

**Downsides**

- Replacement filters can add up in cost, especially if your water has more minerals.  
- Larger size might not work well in smaller fridges.  

**Rival Brands and Products**

I‚Äôd say its closest competitors are Brita and PUR pitchers, which have served me well in the past. However, there‚Äôs one area where ZeroWater pulls ahead: the completeness of filtration. Most other pitchers reduce impurities, but few remove as much TDS as this product‚Äîleaving almost nothing behind. That said, Brita filters tend to last longer, and PUR designs often feel a bit sturdier in hand. If you‚Äôre after the cleanest water possible, though, ZeroWater is in a league of its own. On the downside, the expense of regular filter replacements is where other brands might take the edge for budget-conscious users.

**Affordable Quality**

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîall the filter-changing can make this pitcher slightly pricier than mainstream alternatives in the long run. That being said, you‚Äôre saving yourself from buying hundreds of single-use plastic water bottles yearly, so it works out in the end‚Äîboth for your wallet and the environment. Compared to the health benefits and reduced plastic waste, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs well worth it. If you‚Äôve got a family or drink filtered water every day, it‚Äôs an even smarter investment.

Advertised as a 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, it promises versatility with features like a regular and strong brew, 1-4 cup setting, iced coffee mode, and a 24-hour timer. My experience with it was a blend of satisfaction and some mild frustrations. Here‚Äôs how it measures up.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Sleek and modern, this coffee machine looks like it belongs in a showroom kitchen. The stainless steel finish contrasts beautifully with its glossy black elements. Its compact footprint, measuring 8.6‚ÄùD x 6.7‚ÄùW x 12.6‚ÄùH, means it sits neatly without gobbling up counter space. However, I noticed the build, though visually appealing, doesn‚Äôt feel as robust as some premium counterparts. Plastic components, while lightweight, seemed a tad flimsy, giving me pause about long-term durability. That said, it fits right into both minimalist kitchens and fully-decked-out coffee stations.  

**Ease of Use**  
Right out of the box, setup was straightforward, thanks to its clear and detailed manual. Programming the 24-hour timer was as easy as setting an alarm, and the button interface with its LED display was incredibly intuitive to navigate. The PROG function made selecting brewing modes a breeze‚Äîone tap for regular, another for strong, and three taps if you fancy a batch of iced coffee. Watching my first batch of iced coffee brew was oddly satisfying; there‚Äôs something magical about this feature for someone like me who enjoys chilled caffeine beverages even in winter.

The regular mode is ideal for mild coffee drinkers, while the strong brew setting delivers an intense burst of flavor, akin to what you'd expect from a caf√©. The 1-4 cup setting surprised me with its ability to optimize extraction for smaller servings. I tested this by brewing two cups in the afternoon, and the flavor didn‚Äôt dilute, unlike some machines that struggle with smaller batches.  

Additionally, the keep-warm function carried my coffee through a hectic morning, maintaining a consistently warm brew for up to two hours. No scorched taste, just fresh and smooth coffee. However, by the one-hour mark, there was a slight dip in consistency, which might bother more discerning users.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
As a self-confessed cleaning-a-phobe, I appreciated the removable basket filter and the non-stick warming plate. After my first giant spill‚Äîclassic me‚Äîthe anti-drip system played hero and kept further cleanup efforts minimal. However, the stainless steel exterior shows smudges rather prominently, and I found myself wiping it frequently just to keep it looking pristine. While cleaning itself isn‚Äôt overwhelming, it does require regular upkeep if you‚Äôre as particular about fingerprints as I am.  

**Positives**  
Several aspects of the product stood out during my testing experience:  
- Programmable brewing with a 24-hour timer ensures coffee readiness for early mornings or late-night writing sprees.  
- Brew strength control provides the ideal drink for mild to strong coffee enthusiasts.  
- Designed with a 1-4 cup setting for smaller quantities without flavor loss.  
- Anti-drip feature minimizes spills, maintaining cleanliness and efficiency.  

**Shortcomings**  
However, not everything was perfect‚Äîthere were a few things I feel could‚Äôve been better:  
- The plastic components lack the premium feel, which might deter heavy usage over time.  
- Smudge-prone exterior requires consistent cleaning to maintain the aesthetic appeal.  
- The coffee‚Äôs warmth dips after one hour despite the keep-warm setting.  

**Competitive Options**  
While using the coffee maker, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to similar products, namely the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 and the Keurig K-Duo. The Cuisinart model feels slightly more robust in build quality while offering a nearly identical suite of features. However, its larger size may not fit smaller kitchens as easily as this model. Meanwhile, the Keurig K-Duo shines for its pod compatibility, an added convenience for users preferring single-serve coffee on certain days, but it lacks the sophisticated iced coffee mode found here. Among its rivals, the REVOTRA stands out for versatility on a budget, though it compromises a little on build.  

**Price Performance**  
Is this machine worth your investment? For someone who values strong, programmable features at an affordable price, it‚Äôs a solid contender. The inclusion of iced coffee and the 1-4 cup option are features rarely found at this price tier, making it a wise choice for a budget-strapped java lover. Nonetheless, those in search of premium construction or advanced brewing technologies may need to allocate a little more for competing brands.

1md73ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1md73ut/should_you_buy_the_best_coffee_urn_from_west_bend/,Should You Buy the Best Coffee Urn from West Bend 58030 or Not,"Brewing coffee for a lively crowd can be quite an ordeal, and my experience with the West Bend 58030 coffee urn was full of surprises. With a hefty 30-cup capacity, it promised to cater to gatherings, meetings, and family events with ease. Coming in a polished aluminum finish, it looked neat and classic right out of the box. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical about its size, but after using it for a few weeks, it didn‚Äôt take long to appreciate its practical design and all the features packed into this coffee maker.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The build of this coffee urn feels solid and dependable. Its polished aluminum body gives it an elegant yet durable exterior, and based on my time with it, this material makes cleaning straightforward. The dimensions‚Äî10.8"" x 10.8"" x 15.6""‚Äîclearly show it‚Äôs not a compact machine, but the size makes perfect sense for what it‚Äôs intended to do: brew up to 30 cups at once. An absolute lifesaver during a neighborhood brunch! The stay-cool base proved handy since I frequently moved the machine around the kitchen and dining area without worrying about the surface heat. The lockable cover, in particular, stood out as a thoughtful addition because accidental spills during transport were nonexistent.  

**Ease of Operation**  
Using the coffee urn was simpler than expected, owing to its automatic operation mode. Brewing coffee didn‚Äôt require standing over it, thanks to the cup-a-minute brewing rate. The light indicator, signaling when the coffee was ready, was a subtle but nice touch that added to the convenience of prepping large batches‚Äîespecially when I had my hands full setting tables. I only had to lift the spigot for a continuous flow, which came in clutch when filling coffee pots for the service table.  

**Highlights**  
- 30-cup capacity makes it ideal for gatherings, parties, and office events.  
- Polished aluminum build ensures durable and easy cleaning.  
- Stay-cool base and spigot prevent heat and drips respectively.  
- The lockable cover avoids spills during use or movement.  
- Cup-a-minute brewing means no long waits for large groups.  

[See West Bend 58030 coffee urn deals on Amazon now.](https://vendm.com/p/b00008iha1/)  

**Performance and Brewing Capabilities**  
Having brewed over 20 cups multiple times, I can confidently say the performance is reliable, but there‚Äôs a notable catch: it's designed for light-duty, non-commercial use. This means while it‚Äôs a good fit for occasional gatherings, it‚Äôs not meant for high-traffic settings like a caf√©. The percolator-style brewing process delivers well-balanced, aromatic coffee that remains hot for hours, thanks to the automatic temperature control. It keeps the coffee at serving temperature without burning it, which is a win for flavor consistency.  

**Negatives**  
- Requires decent storage space due to its size.  
- Light-duty build isn‚Äôt cut out for commercial use.  

**Smart Design Features**  
The lockable cover was probably a standout feature for me. It remained secure throughout brewing, making it safe even with kids and curious pets roaming around the kitchen. The measuring guide included in the basket was another genius touch. It removed the guesswork entirely, helping me brew just the right quantity and strength of coffee. Cleaning also felt like less of a chore because of the reusable filter and polished aluminum construction.  

**Challengers**  
Comparing this to competitors like smaller Keurig models or the Hamilton Beach Coffee Urn, the brewing capacity is where the West Bend urn truly wins. While Keurigs are sleek and versatile, they‚Äôre better for individual serves rather than mass brewing. Hamilton Beach comes incredibly close in features and size, but I found the West Bend‚Äôs polished aluminum construction easier to clean than Hamilton Beach‚Äôs stainless steel variant. However, the downside is that the West Bend model lacks modern additions like programmable timers or customizable brew strengths, which some of its rivals offer.  

**Value for Money**  
From a quality-for-price perspective, this coffee urn fares well. It offers time-tested reliability for those hosting frequent gatherings or larger households needing robust servings. While it might lack the bells and whistles of pricier coffee machines‚Äîlike touch controls or aesthetic customizations‚Äîits primary function is rock-solid. It does what it claims to do: brew lots of coffee, and keep it ready for consumption without hassles. The cost seems justifiable for the niche it fulfills, making it a smart purchase for anyone needing heavy-duty home brewing.

1md724h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1md724h/swiss_compensation_issue/,Swiss Compensation Issue,"Hi all,

This is partly a rant and partly asking for advice on how to proceed on a compensation claim that is constantly rejected. 

We had a flight on 23 June from Lisbon to Zurich with Swiss with flight number LX2083. The departure was supposed to be at 05:55 AM, arriving at 09:55 AM. So at around 2 AM in the morning, we received delay info with new departure time 08:40 AM. The check2in would be at the regular hour, so we went to drop our luggage at 4 AM. The staff informed us of a technical issue with the plane incoming the night before. They said a replacement plane is on the way (with flight number LX5100, plane HB-IOH) so we were tracking this. The replacement plane diverted back to Zurich and our original flight was delayed an extra hour. Further the delay extended another 2 hours and in the end we departed at 12:09 PM, arriving in Zurich at 15:38. 

The captain announced that the plane had 'Lavatory system malfunction in the incoming flight on the day before, which was actually fixed at night but they couldn't find a tow truck to put the plane to a gate'. So with this on records, although there was a technical issue, it is not an extraordinary circumstance or a safety concern, rather an organizational issue on ground that we were delayed.

So the distance is between 1500-3500 km and the delay on arrival is over 5 hours which makes us eligible for 400‚Ç¨ compensation according to EC261/2004. (Switzerland is non-EU but part of the EU directive on this matter). We took all our documents and filed a compensation claim with Swiss. They rejected saying 'There was a fumes event, which is an extraordinary circumstance.' which is contradicting the flight crew's announcements. Then we provided the replacement flight diversion info and the announcements from the captain, which they replied: 'We cannot help you.'

With this, I further moved to apply to S√ñP (conflict resolving organization) in Germany as I purchased the ticket from Lufthansa and I am a German resident. They referred me to ECC (european concumer center), which has more accurate power. Then the ECC referred me to Switzerland's SECO (finance ministry) and FOCA (civil aviation authority). I wrote to both, SECO said speak to FOCA, FOCA said since the flight only landed but not departed Switzerland, I should speak to ANAC (portuguese civil aviation authority). Since then I also applied again through Lufthansa, which forwarded my request to Swiss, which lead to no response. ANAC said they are investigating but they cannot claim on my behalf, rather they can impose fines on the airline. 

So at this point, I either lawyer up, or try Airhelp (which states for my flight there was a safety issue), fairplane, flightright, claimflight (all of these accept my application) etc. I wouldn't care for this compensation normally, I am used to way longer delays due to weather, safety etc. My only concern now is that the captain very genuinely and apologetically stated a non-emergency situation the day before, which was fixed on time, an organizational tow truck issue and Swiss calling the replacement plane back which lenghtened the delay for around 3 hours. Further concern is the airline claiming a totally different scenario.

What we received on site was 5 euros for coffee.

Sorry for the long post, but I am at the end-line of my personal solutions. I am open for any suggestions, and I am not willing to let this go.

Any hint of self awareness makes the scene uncomfortable (which works if it‚Äôs meant to be a portrayal of desperately seeking fun, but usually doesn‚Äôt). I think it‚Äôs gotten worse in the last 5 years or so‚Ä¶ maybe because people don‚Äôt often let loose anymore, and when they do it is often performative and referential.

I watched the accountant 2 with my family a few nights ago. Jon Bernthal plays the accountant‚Äôs brother and there is a scene where, autism be damned, Ben Affleck starts line dancing like there‚Äôs no tomorrow with a pretty lady while bernthal hoots and hollers in support. This is a very bad movie that I was (mistakenly) sure was based on a comic book, but this attempted display of earnest, drunken fun stood out to me in its badness. It felt so dead set on manipulating a certain type of man. 

I think bernthal has actually been good enough at boisterousness in the past that it has become one of his trademarks. But back in the day he didn‚Äôt have a podcast called ‚Äúreal ones‚Äù where he sells boy coffee. Idk if he has it in him, but I think it would be great for a filmmaker to purposefully construct a character around playing with his persona. 

Anyways, what are your favorite scenes of this variety? Any good examples from the recent past?

1md6ua7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1md6ua7/explore_the_best_drip_coffee_machine_breville/,Explore the Best Drip Coffee Machine Breville Review Worth Reading,"Brewing coffee at home has always been a morning ritual for me, but finding the perfect coffee machine that combines customization, convenience, and consistently great taste? Not an easy feat. The Breville Precision Brewer BDC450BSS1BUS1 has been part of my daily routine for the past month, and with it, my coffee game has undeniably gone up a notch. While it has some quirks, this drip coffee machine offers plenty of enticing features for coffee enthusiasts.

**Stylish Design Meets Practical Functionality**  
A quick glance at this stainless steel coffee maker, and you'll see how well it fits into a modern kitchen. The brushed stainless steel finish adds a sleek and professional touch, making it stand out on my countertop without being overly bulky. Its dimensions (12.72""D x 6.69""W x 15.75""H) make it narrower than I expected, meaning it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is always a win. However, it is surprisingly heavy for a coffee maker at over 10 pounds. It‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd want to move around too often.  

**Preset Brewing Modes for Every Mood**  
What truly impressed me about this coffee maker is the variety of brewing modes it offers. Whether I‚Äôm in the mood for a strong morning pick-me-up or a refreshing iced brew for hot afternoons, its six preset modes have me covered. The Gold setting automatically adjusts water temperature and brew time to SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) standards, and the Cold Brew mode has been a lifesaver during scorching days. My favorite, though, has to be the My Brew setting. This lets me customize the temperature, bloom time, and flow rate, satisfying my inner coffee geek.  

[Ready to buy Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://newcookware.com/p/b078rqvqf1/)  

**Temperature and Flow Control**  
If there‚Äôs one thing I know about brewing great coffee, it‚Äôs that temperature matters a lot. The PID digital temperature control ensures water is heated between 197 and 204 degrees, the sweet spot for brewing rich and aromatic coffee. On top of that, the three different flow rate options allow me to experiment. Whether I want to sit back and relax with a slow-flow brew or make a quick strong cup before heading out, this machine has me covered. The Thermo Coil heating system seems to contribute to a purer water taste compared to machines reliant on aluminum.  

**Perks**  
- Customizable brewing settings for a tailored coffee experience.  
- Wide choice of modes: Gold, Fast, Strong, Cold Brew, Iced, and My Brew.  
- Attractive and durable brushed stainless steel design.  
- Dual filters (flat bottom and cone) allow for different brewing techniques.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The hefty weight makes it less portable than some comparable models.  
- It‚Äôs fully automatic, meaning traditionalists might miss the ""hands-on"" brewing process.  

**Dual Filter Baskets for Flexible Brewing**  
One feature that pleasantly surprised me was the inclusion of both flat and cone filter baskets. This dual-option is more versatile than I imagined, especially when family members have different brewing preferences. Admittedly, I‚Äôve gotten a bit carried away experimenting with both to compare flavor profiles. For single cups, the mesh basket filter works well and eliminates waste from disposable filters.

**Comparing to Other Options in the Market**  
Compared to more compact single-serve coffee machines, the Breville Precision Brewer might feel a bit overwhelming with its settings and size. Machines like the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System are tempting competitors, offering versatile brewing options at a slightly lower price point. However, I found that the Breville‚Äôs precision temperature control and brewing flexibility set it apart. While high-end drip machines from Technivorm also deliver excellent performance, they're less customizable and much pricier. With the Breville, I feel like I‚Äôm getting premium quality without completely breaking the bank.

**Smart Spending**  
No one wants to skimp on quality for the sake of saving a few dollars. While the upfront cost of this coffee maker might give you pause, its features justify the price. If you value having precise brewing settings combined with the flexibility to experiment, this machine provides excellent cost-efficiency. You could consider cheaper drip coffee makers, but they likely won‚Äôt offer the same level of control or the varied brewing modes.

I‚Äôm a 20F who is currently working at my 58M father‚Äôs small coffee shop. For some background, i am only recently on speaking terms with my father. This man is a bigot, an abuser, a trumpie, a major pro-lifer, and overall i suspect, a narcissist. I HATED him in my early teen years and only recently have I started to develop some sympathy for him.

Anyways, around spring this year, I decided i‚Äôm going to need a new, higher paying job if i want to move out within the year. My father offered to pay me 24/hr to be the cook/baker at his shop and i sort of impulsively agreed. For a while I was doing that, early morning to after noon while working the closing shift at my other job. Eventually, it all became too much and I did quit my previous job. At the same time, my boyfriend, 21M was out of a job and he had previously worked for a big chain coffee shop, so I told him to come work with me at my dad‚Äôs.
So now, i‚Äôm working for my father full time. I get to see my lovely boyfriend everyday, but honestly, I‚Äôm not too sure if that‚Äôs necessarily a good thing. People need space in a relationship. there have been times where i‚Äôve been so stressed out from life and the job and I have lashed out on him like never before. I miss having our cute date nights once a week but now im too tired or stressed to even want to go anywhere.

My dad has us both working there 6 days a week for up to 8 hours. We both have to be there 6am sharp. We are getting overtime almost every week. An average human needs at least 2 days off I would say, but my dad won‚Äôt give it. It makes both of us crazy, burnt out, and not good for each other because i‚Äôm a imbalanced hormonal mess while my boyfriend is so sleep deprived he can barely take care of me like usual or do anything self care wise.


It‚Äôs horrible. it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm constantly on the verge of snapping. I‚Äôve crashed out multiple times in front of my boyfriend and father simply because i cannot take this lifestyle. 

I wake up at 5am everyday, getting MAX 6 hours sleep the night before. Do my little tasks at the coffee shop lalalaala whatever. Go to the gym. grocery shop. and by then all i have the energy to do is watch tv until i fall asleep and do it all over again.

From the outsider perspective i feel like it may seem im being a baby or overreacting. But if you all knew what my father was like i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd last a day in there. As a boss, he micro manages to all hell and will yell at you in a heartbeat. As a father, and as a person, he enrages and disgusts me. (i could write a whole paragraph on the things he‚Äôs done and what type of person he is, but honestly it feels endless)

Quite frankly, i‚Äôm so ready to quit. I‚Äôm not sure if the high pay is worth me feeling like half a human. And i can‚Äôt stop feeling so guilty for dragging my boyfriend into this. I wish we‚Äôd just both found a job to work together that maybe wasn‚Äôt making us both feel like we‚Äôre drowning. I feel like a terrible girlfriend.

I‚Äôm so scared to quit because the job market is horrible right now and this is the most i‚Äôve made hourly since i started working. But maybe this is a sign for me to go to school for something I can get a career in? or should i just quit and go back to my old job? Find a new job?  Am i ever going to move out of my parents house? Am i going to die alone? and bam here comes the spiral

I just feel like this life is going to kill me. I can already feel wrinkles growing on my face and i‚Äôm always angry, sad, or tired. 

Anyways sorry that was long as hell. Feel free to give advice it‚Äôs highly encouraged. Even if it‚Äôs brutal. And i will answer any questions as well.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a 5-cup coffee machine hinges on several essential features that dictate the quality of the brew and the overall user experience. In 2025 models, advancements in brewing technology and design have led to important improvements in these key areas.**brewing Temperature:** A critical factor in extracting optimal flavor, the ideal brewing temperature should range between 195¬∞F and 205¬∞F (90¬∞C and 96¬∞C). Top-rated 5-cup coffee machines now incorporate precise temperature control systems to ensure that water reaches and maintains this optimal range throughout the brewing process. This consistency translates to a richer, more flavorful cup of coffee with less bitterness.

**Showerhead Design:** The showerhead design distributes water evenly over the coffee grounds, maximizing extraction and preventing channeling. Advanced models in 2025 feature multi-stream showerheads that provide a more thorough saturation, ensuring all grounds are evenly wetted. This meticulous design contributes to a more consistent and balanced flavor profile in every brew.

**Programmability:** Programmable features add convenience and allow users to customize their brewing experience. Many 2025 5-cup coffee machines offer programmable timers, allowing you to preset the brew time and wake up to a fresh pot of coffee.

## **Chapter 1: The Quiet Keep**

Mornings came in blue.

There was no dawn, not really‚Äînot here. Just a slow shift in tone, like someone tuning a cold instrument. The sea bled from black to slate, the sky following a beat behind. The light came sideways and pale, never sharp, never warm. It slid over the rocks in thin ribbons and settled along the glass of the lantern room like it had nowhere else to be.

He had stopped using an alarm months ago. The sea woke him now.

Sometimes it was the gulls. Sometimes it was the sound of water folding itself onto stone with a gentle *whump*. But most mornings, it was the sense of pressure‚Äîthe subtle, inexplicable feeling that something just below the surface of the world had shifted.

His name was Elias Mercer. Mid-forties. Trim from work, thick with solitude. He kept to a schedule: wake before the sun, sweep the tower steps, log the weather, check the oil lines. There were no guests. No tourists. No keepers-in-training. Just him and the light and the water.

The lighthouse‚ÄîOld Warden Point‚Äîhad been manned for over a hundred years, though it had long since been removed from shipping maps. The main shipping routes shifted decades ago, replaced by GPS-guided giants and offshore beacons. But some official, somewhere, had decided it was ""heritage value,"" so they left it running, automated but still manned. A vestigial organ in a forgotten corner of the coast.

Elias never complained. There was nothing out here to interrupt the rhythm. The radio picked up nothing but static and the occasional burst of fisherman chatter. Supplies came monthly, dropped off by a sullen boy from the mainland who never made eye contact and always left early.

The isolation suited him.

It had, anyway.

Lately, he‚Äôd found it harder to settle. Not insomnia exactly, but something slower, more insidious. He would lie awake after midnight and listen to the sea, expecting to hear nothing‚Äîbut hearing something nonetheless. Not voices. Not music. Just‚Ä¶ sequence. An odd cadence to the swells. A rising-and-falling that felt too precise. Like breath. Like speech slowed to a crawl.

He tried not to dwell on it. Working the light helped.

On this morning, he stood alone in the lantern room, wiping down the lenses with soft cloth, watching the water miles out. It had receded far more than usual, exposing long bands of jagged black reef not seen since last winter. He squinted at it, not because he feared anything, but because something about the pattern of rock emerging didn‚Äôt match what he remembered.

It was subtly‚Ä¶ wrong.

More curved. Less predictable. Like it had grown, or shifted, or both.

He chalked it up to memory. Memory in isolation was always suspect.

Still, a thought hung with him as he descended the iron spiral stair:

*It looked like something had opened its eyes.*

---


He went about the rest of his morning as usual‚Äîboiling coffee grounds in the dented steel percolator, eating cold toast while standing barefoot in the stone kitchen. The gulls screamed in tight spirals outside, but their voices seemed farther away than usual, like they were circling something beyond the tower, something they refused to land near.

By mid-morning, the fog rolled in.

It didn‚Äôt blanket the water like a sheet the way it usually did. This fog was thin and restless‚Äîtwisting itself into strands, unraveling in midair. It didn't cling so much as *follow*. Every time Elias turned his head, he was sure it had shifted position, crawling just out of sight like a shape caught in the corner of the eye.

He stepped outside, onto the ringed catwalk around the tower‚Äôs top. The wind was light, saltless. That in itself was strange.

He leaned over the railing and looked down toward the shallows.

The tide had pulled even further back.

Where water should‚Äôve been swirling over seaweed and rock, the shore lay bare and glistening‚Äîexposed like flesh. Cracks ran between the stones, long grooves with jagged ridges. He thought, absurdly, of ribs.

His stomach turned, though he hadn‚Äôt moved.

There was something lying in the sand just beyond the rock pools. At first glance, it looked like driftwood‚Äîa crooked, black shape, half-covered in wet silt. But it wasn‚Äôt the shape of any wood he‚Äôd ever seen. It bent in too many places. It had texture, a slickness to it. Something veined and faintly pulsing.

He should‚Äôve gone inside. Called someone. Logged it.

Instead, without even realizing why, he descended the tower.

The path to the beach was a thin set of uneven steps carved into the cliffside, bordered by rusted chain. It had eroded in places. The air down here was wetter, closer. The fog was thickest just above the beach, pooled like breath on cold glass.

The closer he got to the object, the more certain he became it wasn‚Äôt wood.

It had *skin*.

Not scaled. Not furred. Just thin, translucent membrane, like something halfway between fish and jellyfish. Not rotting either‚Äîfresh. Too fresh. It smelled faintly of brine and something *metallic*, like blood in water.

It was the length of a man‚Äôs arm, but boneless. It coiled and uncoiled in slow, spasmodic jerks. And there were markings on its surface‚Äîtiny raised bumps in irregular patterns. Not scars. Not barnacles.

Writing.

He knelt beside it. The beach was utterly silent.

As he leaned closer, he realized something else.

The sand beneath the creature‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt still.

It rose and fell. Just barely. In rhythm.

Like something very, very large, just under the surface, was breathing.

He stood up so fast he nearly fell over.

The object jerked violently once‚Äîthen went limp.

Elias stumbled back, heart pounding, ears ringing. His hand brushed the lighthouse key around his neck. For a long moment, he stared down at the thing, trying to commit every detail to memory while some deeper instinct begged him to walk away.

Then, from far above, the lighthouse‚Äôs foghorn let out a single, low groan.

It hadn‚Äôt been scheduled to fire.

He looked up toward the tower‚Äîits glass eye dull in the fog‚Äîand felt, for the first time in years, *watched*.

---

## **Chapter 2: The Pull**

Elias didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

The thing on the beach had stopped moving after sunset. By the time he returned with a flashlight, it was gone‚Äîno drag marks, no remnants. Just a patch of disturbed sand where something had once been.

He stood there for hours, light gripped white-knuckled in his hand, sweeping the shoreline in long arcs. Each time the beam caught on seaweed or tangled driftwood, his gut seized, ready to recognize the wrongness again. But nothing moved. Nothing pulsed.

Eventually, the tide returned.

It came in soundless, like a velvet curtain, lapping at the shore without urgency. The waves made no foam. No hiss of surf. They simply *arrived*. And when he turned to go, he swore he heard something beneath the surface‚Äînot music, not words, but the unmistakable cadence of *pattern*.

That was the worst of it. Not the creature. Not the vanishing.

The *pattern*.

Back in the tower, he sat in the keeper‚Äôs office with the door shut tight and the lights on. The thick manual of station operations sat untouched beside him, covered in dust and coffee stains. Instead, he opened the outdated laptop tucked under the desk. It took ten minutes to boot and longer to connect to the satellite internet.

He typed:
**what causes ocean tides**

The answers were immediate and plentiful.

*‚ÄúOcean tides are caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He skimmed.
*‚Äú‚Ä¶the Moon‚Äôs gravity pulls the water in the oceans toward it, creating a bulge‚Ä¶‚Äù*
*‚Äú‚Ä¶opposite side of the Earth also forms a bulge due to inertia‚Ä¶‚Äù*
*‚Äú‚Ä¶Earth rotates beneath these bulges, producing high and low tides at predictable intervals‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He scrolled.
Animations. Diagrams. Smiling educators. Simplified explanations for classrooms.

It all sounded so... *deliberate*. Neat. Unnatural, even in its neatness.

He opened a dozen tabs, looking for variations, dissent, nuance. But they all sang the same hymn. The Moon pulls the water. Gravity. Rotation. Predictable, explainable, contained.

He sat back in the chair.

No mention of irregular tides that whispered. No mention of living things crawling out between low tide and sunrise. No explanation for why the waves had no *sound* that evening.

Elias opened an archived PDF from a marine physics journal‚Äîdense, equation-heavy, unreadable without a doctorate. The complexity should‚Äôve reassured him. But instead, it made the surface feel thinner, more fragile. Like a stretched sheet of paper pretending to be reality.

The truth didn‚Äôt feel built. It felt *patched over*.

The storm hit around 3 AM. Sudden, violent, brief.

Winds slammed the shutters so hard the glass nearly cracked. The tower groaned like it remembered something older than weather. Elias stood in the dark stairwell, flashlight flickering, unsure whether to go up or down. But the storm passed as quickly as it had come, like it had been performing‚Äînot forming.

In the morning, the beach was littered with seafoam and cracked shells. Normal things.

But as he walked the cliff path toward the generator shed, he spotted something in the tidepool near the base of the rocks.

Another object.

Not a creature this time.

A stone.

Dark and oval. Smooth. About the size of his palm.

He fished it out without thinking, only realizing once it was in his hand that it was warm. Very warm. Like it had been sitting beside a fire.

Etched into its surface were the same raised, unreadable markings he‚Äôd seen on the pulsing thing the day before.

But this time, the stone *hummed* in his hand‚Äîjust faintly.

It vibrated not in motion, but in *intent*.

And for a brief, impossible moment, Elias had the distinct sensation that something was holding *him* back.

Not gravity.

Something else.

---

## **Chapter 3: The Script Beneath**

The stone wouldn't leave his thoughts.

Elias kept it wrapped in a towel at first, tucked into a drawer beside spare fuses and oil cloth. But even hidden away, he felt it. Like heat rising through floorboards. Like a heartbeat pressed against the edge of hearing.

He told himself he wasn‚Äôt frightened, only curious. It was easier to believe that.

The markings on the stone weren‚Äôt worn‚Äîthey were deliberate, etched with fine precision. Too clean to be natural, too chaotic to be decorative. There was no symmetry. No repetition. But still, they felt‚Ä¶ structured. Meant.

That was what disturbed him most. Not the warmth. Not the impossible hum. But the sense that he was holding language in his hand‚Äîlanguage that didn‚Äôt belong on this Earth.

By the second night, he gave in.

The satellite connection was too slow for video, but he managed to access a few niche forums‚Äîarchivists, cryptographers, amateur epigraphers. He posted a blurred image of the symbols, careful to remove the stone‚Äôs context. He described it as a ‚Äúfound object from the shore.‚Äù No location. No story.

He waited.

While he waited, he dug through the ancient storage cabinet in the base of the tower. Behind rusted tools and water-warped manuals, he found a box labeled **KEEPER‚ÄôS LOGS ‚Äì PRE-DIGITIZATION**.

Inside: six bound ledgers. Leather cracking. Pages yellowed and soft at the edges.

He hadn‚Äôt planned to read them. But now, his hands moved of their own accord.

The earliest entries were from 1892. Weather logs. Lantern maintenance. Bird migrations.

Then, in the margin of one entry dated June 2nd, 1903, a note:

> ‚ÄúThe tide‚Äôs pull not right last night. Rose before the Moon did. Fish lying motionless on the sand, but still breathing.‚Äù

Further in, another:

> ‚ÄúDreamt of a shape rising, not breaking the water but changing it. The waves bent *toward* it.‚Äù

And finally, scribbled with a trembling hand in the final pages of the oldest book:

> ‚ÄúThe stones speak. Not aloud‚Äîbut inside. They are not warnings. They are *requests*.‚Äù

Elias closed the book and sat motionless for a long time.

Outside, the waves had begun to crash against the rocks again, but irregularly. As if trying to imitate their own pattern and failing.

The wind had died completely.

Back upstairs, the forum had responses.

One suggested the symbols looked vaguely like Proto-Elamite. Another guessed it might be a form of constructed language, possibly artistic. But one message stood out. It was private. No username. Just a string of numbers.

It said:

> ‚ÄúIf you found the stone, do *not* keep it near running water. Do *not* leave it exposed during full moon. Do *not* try to translate it aloud.‚Äù

Attached was a single image: a scanned page from an anonymous document, watermarked and aged. It showed a familiar script etched into a stone tablet‚Äîdifferent characters, but unmistakably from the same system. The caption read:

> ‚ÄúRecovered from deep-sea ridge, 1951. Language non-terrestrial. Surviving team ceased translation efforts after auditory hallucinations and severe spatial disorientation. Object buried. No further access permitted.‚Äù

Elias stared at the screen.

The wind, absent for hours, pushed suddenly against the glass with enough force to rattle it in the frame.

He looked down at the drawer where the stone sat hidden.

He knew without touching it that it was glowing.


---

## **Chapter 4: Foundations**

The stone stayed in the drawer. But only barely.

Elias could feel it‚Äîevery minute he ignored it. It pressed against his thoughts like a tide at the edges of a levee. Not words, not even images, but a subtle warping of awareness. A sense that something was listening. That it didn‚Äôt need to be read or spoken to communicate. That it had *already begun*.

He knew if he spoke the symbols aloud, something would change. Something in him. In the water. Maybe in both.

So instead, he turned to the tower.

He started at the base, where the original brick met the foundation. The lighthouse had been rebuilt several times, retrofitted, modernized. But the bones of it‚Äîthe old, cold bones‚Äîstill held their shape.

In the maintenance closet behind the generator, a wall panel had always stuck out slightly. He‚Äôd never questioned it. Just a warped plank, he assumed.

But now he pressed on it.

It moved.

Behind it was a recess in the wall no larger than a filing cabinet. Inside: a set of stairs, narrow and stone-carved, leading *down*. Far deeper than the tower‚Äôs published blueprints allowed for.

Elias hesitated. The air flowing up was dry and odorless‚Äîbut not *dead*. It felt old in a way that had nothing to do with time. Like it had been waiting to be inhaled.

He descended slowly, flashlight in hand.

The stairs twisted tighter as they went. The walls closed in. Forty steps. Then fifty. Then a small landing‚Äîand a door.

It was metal, riveted with iron bands, circular like a hatch. Not rusted. Well-maintained.

No handle.

He ran his fingers along the seam and felt markings there too‚Äîsmoothed over by time, but still present. Not the same as those on the stone, but *related*. Like a cousin dialect.

He stepped back, examining the frame.

Above the door, a phrase had been carved into the arch in crumbling Latin:

> **‚ÄúCustos Lucis. Vinculum Undae.‚Äù**
> *‚ÄúGuardian of Light. Chain of the Wave.‚Äù*

His mouth went dry.

Not just a lighthouse.

A lock.

Elias stared at the hatch for a long time. He didn‚Äôt touch it. Didn‚Äôt try to open it.

Instead, he returned to the landing and sat down, back against the cold stone.

Above him, the waves crashed in that wrong rhythm again. Like footsteps echoing beneath water.

He understood now why the lighthouse had to be manned‚Äîeven after automation. It wasn‚Äôt about maintaining the light.

It was about maintaining the *watch*.

And for the first time, Elias wondered:

Had every keeper before him known? Had they come down here too? Had they all found the hatch and left it sealed‚Äînot out of fear, but obedience?

He stood, heart pounding, and began to climb back up the steps.

Behind him, just for a moment, he heard a sound from the other side of the door.

Not a voice. Not a bang.

Just a slow, resonant *knock*.


---

## **Chapter 5: The Tide Within**

The drawer was humming before he touched it.

Not with sound, but vibration‚Äîlow and constant, like a living wire beneath his fingertips. The wood itself was warm. Slightly damp.

Elias opened it slowly, careful not to look away.

The towel had unfolded itself. Or perhaps he‚Äôd never wrapped it properly to begin with. Either way, the stone lay exposed now, resting in the center of the drawer as if it belonged there. Its surface pulsed with faint, silvery light‚Äîlike moonlight trapped behind skin.

The markings had changed.

They weren‚Äôt just etched anymore‚Äîthey moved. Subtly. The lines bent, shifted, rearranged themselves when he blinked. Never while he watched, only in the in-between moments. Like they were rewriting themselves in real time. Like they were *listening* to his thoughts and responding in kind.

He reached out.

The moment his fingers touched the stone, the warmth intensified‚Äînot burning, but *feverish*. A tingling spread up his arm, into his shoulder, then down through his spine. His vision blurred for a moment.

And then, he saw it.

Not a vision, not a hallucination. A memory‚Äîhis, but not.

A shoreline under moonlight. Not this coast, but something older. Rocky, jagged, teethlike. Figures standing along the edge, clad in sea-wet cloth and chanting in a language he had never heard but somehow *knew*. Words spoken not to the Moon, but to what lived behind it. To what its light *held back*.

They weren‚Äôt summoning.
They were pleading.

He blinked and the vision was gone.

His palm was still pressed to the stone. Sweat beaded on his forehead, though the room was cold. His heart felt wrong‚Äîtoo slow. Too heavy. Each beat sounded distant, as though heard underwater.

He removed his hand.

The glow dimmed, but didn‚Äôt fade entirely. The markings slowed. Stabilized.

He sat down, suddenly exhausted. The kind of tired that came not from work, but from *being opened*.

On the desk beside him, his laptop pinged.

Another message. Same anonymous sender.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve touched it.
> It knows.
> You must return it to the water before the next full moon.
> Or you must finish what they began.‚Äù

Attached was a second image‚Äîthis time, not a photograph, but a scan from what appeared to be a medieval manuscript. Ink on vellum, edges scorched.

It showed a man standing at the edge of the sea, holding a stone identical to his. Behind him, a massive wave rose not from the water, but from *beneath* it‚Äîcurling upward like a living wall, eyes forming in its crest.

The man was not casting the stone into the sea.

He was *feeding* it.

Beneath the image, scrawled in Latin:

> **‚ÄúLux vincit tenebras, nisi lux vocet tenebras.‚Äù**
> *‚ÄúLight restrains darkness‚Äîunless light calls it.‚Äù*

Elias closed the laptop.

Outside, the sea was calm again.

But in the drawer, the stone throbbed once, gently.

As if pleased.

---

## **Chapter 6: The One Who Knocked**

The knock came at noon.

Three short raps on the heavy oak door. Not urgent. Not timid. Measured. Almost polite.

Elias hadn‚Äôt heard an engine. No boat. No crunch of boots on gravel. Just the knock‚Äîand the sudden sense that he wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.

He hesitated.

The stone still sat in the drawer behind him, dim now, but warm.

Another knock. Same rhythm.

He opened the door.

A woman stood there, her coat slick with sea mist, dark hair pulled back into a tight braid. Mid-fifties, maybe older. Her eyes were pale, almost gray, and wholly unbothered by the wind.

‚ÄúMr. Mercer,‚Äù she said, like she‚Äôd always known his name. ‚ÄúI need to come inside.‚Äù

He said nothing. She stepped over the threshold anyway, shedding her coat with the ease of someone who didn‚Äôt require permission.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Elias asked, closing the door behind her.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. Instead, she walked through the entry hall and into the kitchen, glancing at the old radio, the oilskin maps on the walls, the chipped mugs on the shelf. Taking inventory.

Finally, she turned to him.

‚ÄúI work for a maritime observatory. One of the *unlisted* ones,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is you have the stone.‚Äù

His stomach turned cold. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt need to.‚Äù She tapped her temple. ‚ÄúIt broadcasts. That‚Äôs what they do.‚Äù

Elias felt his hand instinctively drift toward the drawer. The stone was silent now, but her words made it throb in his mind.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúTo make sure you don‚Äôt do something stupid,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike read it aloud. Or worse‚Äîthink it‚Äôs a message meant for *you*.‚Äù

She sat, uninvited, at the kitchen table.

‚ÄúThese things have a cycle,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey surface. They find a vessel. They whisper. And if the vessel‚Äôs weak, they rise.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the creature?‚Äù

She shook her head slowly. ‚ÄúNo. Not a creature. A *network*. An intelligence. Old enough to wrap itself around your biology. Your perception. You don‚Äôt see it because you can‚Äôt‚Äînot unless it wants you to. The stone is an aperture. A way in.‚Äù

Elias didn‚Äôt sit. ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre alone. Because you‚Äôre watching the water. Because you‚Äôve already been primed without realizing it.‚Äù

She nodded toward the lighthouse windows. ‚ÄúTell me‚Äîhave the tides been‚Ä¶ irregular?‚Äù

He swallowed. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe noise? The rhythm?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny dreams?‚Äù

Elias hesitated. Then: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôre almost out of time.‚Äù

She leaned in, her voice lower now. ‚ÄúYou need to decide. You can help seal it again‚Äîsink the stone, help us contain the breach‚Äîor you can keep listening. Keep believing. And if you do that‚Ä¶‚Äù She smiled, but there was no warmth in it. ‚Äú...you‚Äôll see what the first watchers saw. And you won‚Äôt come back from it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúBecause we lost the last one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe opened the hatch beneath the tower. The stone was in the drawer for three days. That‚Äôs how long it took him to stop being human.‚Äù

She stood and reached into her coat. Not for a weapon‚Äîfor a small metal box. She slid it across the table toward him. A latch. A seal. A warning label in six languages.

‚ÄúFor containment,‚Äù she said.

Elias stared at it, unmoving.

Behind him, in the drawer, the stone began to glow again‚Äîbrighter now. Not pulsing. *Pleading*.

‚ÄúFull moon is in three nights,‚Äù she said, walking to the door. ‚ÄúIf you still have the stone by then, it won‚Äôt need to find another vessel.‚Äù

She paused in the threshold.

‚ÄúAnd Elias‚Äîif you *do* open the hatch... don‚Äôt close it behind you.‚Äù

She left without another word.

No boat engine followed.

Just silence. And the quiet roar of the waves outside growing ever more rhythmic. Like a voice learning to speak.

---

## **Chapter 7: Beneath the Skin of Things**

She was gone.

Not just out of sight‚Äîbut *gone*. No trail down the path, no footprints in the damp gravel. The fog hadn‚Äôt thickened. The wind hadn‚Äôt carried her away. But when Elias stepped outside, there was no trace of her. No boot marks. No boat. No sound.

He stood for a long time on the cliff‚Äôs edge, searching the horizon.

The water looked wrong again.

Too calm. Flattened. Not like a calm sea, but like a frozen sheet pretending to be water. The waves moved, yes‚Äîbut they didn‚Äôt *travel*. They rose and fell in place. Like breath, like code, like ritual.

He went back inside.

The metal box sat untouched on the table. Its matte surface didn‚Äôt reflect light. The warning label, translated from Cyrillic and French and Mandarin, boiled down to the same phrase in each language:

> **‚ÄúDo not engage.‚Äù**

He stared at it. Then at the drawer.

Then, he turned on the laptop.

He searched for the observatory she mentioned. Maritime. Unlisted. He started wide‚Äîinternational marine networks, environmental monitoring stations. He filtered by private, non-governmental institutions. Then government-adjacent. Then defunct.

After hours of digging, he found something.

A brief mention of a ‚ÄúTethys Initiative‚Äù in a declassified UK defense memo from 1974. Redacted beyond recognition, except for one sentence:

> ‚ÄúDeployment of lunar-cycle synchronization tower deemed too risky for continued funding; transfer responsibility to Tethys personnel and shutter all public inquiry channels.‚Äù

He cross-referenced that with international lighthouse registries.

Old Warden Point wasn‚Äôt listed on any of them.

But a line in the margin of a scanned Australian Naval report caught his eye:

> ‚ÄúNote: Coastal surveyor reports anomalous low-frequency resonance near Old Warden site. Recommend follow-up only if equipment continues to malfunction.‚Äù

Elias leaned back.

She was telling the truth‚Äîor at least part of it.

But it didn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôd confirmed her warning. It felt like he‚Äôd uncovered the scaffolding of something far older. Something so deeply embedded in the machinery of human understanding that no one even noticed it anymore.

The Moon pulls the tide.
The lighthouse watches the sea.
Everything is in its place.

Except it wasn‚Äôt.

Because someone had built a *containment hatch* under a lighthouse.

Because the stone was *speaking* to him.

And because now, in the soft hours before dawn, Elias could see movement at the edge of the sea.

He turned off the light and peered through the glass.

Shapes.

At first, he thought they were just tall stones, exposed by the tide. But they were too slender. Upright. Too still. There were six of them. No detail. Just silhouettes‚Äîblack against the deep blue surf.

Watching the lighthouse.

Not moving.

Not yet.

Elias didn‚Äôt sleep that night either.

1md6niw,https://youtu.be/YJJjk0HkPrY,OMNI Ring has some cool tricks up its sleeve for the price,"Omni were nice enought to send out their smart ring for review and i have been using it for about a week adn I have some thoughts on it. You can check out my video or written review below!

This is the OMNI Health Smart Ring, it‚Äôs a Health and Wellness health tracker with a super thin and sleek profile and a few AI Software tricks up its sleeve but its main advantage is its low upfront cost of just under ¬£200 and an optional but not required subscription fee.

In the past I have used the WHOOP and apple watch and have also used smart rings in the past too, notable the LUNA, but In the spirit of being transparent OMNI did send this ring out for free for review but they absolutely did not buy a good review, and neither did LUNA, all the thoughts in this video are my own.. So lets dive into it, the good, the bad and the ugly of the OMNI Smart Ring.

Once your happy you can order your full ring. They come in 3 different colours based upon your style, Rose Gold, Glaciar Silver and Zircon Black, I have the Glacier Silver ring here and honestly I love how discrete it looks, One thing that I love about the OMNI is the ability to engrave directly onto the ring at the time of ordering. This is a nice personal touch and I couldn't pass up the opportunity for a bit of free advertising.¬†

The unboxing experience felt fairly premium here, this feels less like a smart device and more like a high end piece of jewelry coming in a jewelry style box and its present in such a way too with the ring taking pride of place in front of the Battery charging case with a USB C to C and paperwork tucked away underneath.

Its somehow one of the thinner smart rings on the market, even thinner than the LUNA at just 2.6mm thin and 6.5mm wide, for me at least I never felt the ring to get in the way even when playing golf, it felt closer to my wedding band than other smart ring I have worn. Even during sleep and general day to day activity I didn't feel the ring getting in the way a lot of the time I would even forget it was there thanks to its between 2.2 grams in weight.

The ring feels premium too the outside is made of a titanium coating allowing for a surprising amount of scratch resistance though I think the black colour does also help to mask them somewhat, the silver is most certainly a fingerprint magnet but thats perry standard for this style of jewelry. The inside of the ring is made of a hypoallergenic coating meaning its not going to irritate even the most sensitive of skins too.

On the outside of the ring you will see this simple ripple effect and this is not only there for design but it also acts as a guide to ensure the sensors are in the optimal position for reading data, Speaking of sensors there is wide range here including the optical heart rate sensor, blood oxygen sensor, Infrared PPG, skin temperature sensor and 3 axis accelerometer which are used for simple games too. These sensors all work together to track over 70 different biometric signals. Thats a lot of data and tech to fit into a scary thin body if you ask me.

Before we talk too much about what it tracks lets talk about battery life and charging,the OMNI ring lasts upto 7 days per change I found this to be surprisingly accurate with the ring lasting that long between charges. When it comes to charging though this is where one of my biggest praises of the OMNI ring is, the battery powered charging dock holds the ring in place tightly and is super easy to seat, once done its quick to charge taking just over an hour and the case can provide upto 4 charges meaning you can realistically get a month of data capture when away from the wall.

In terms of software OMNI claims to go beyond just telling you how you slept, to managing your energy in real-time throughout the day. They call it 'EnerQi‚Ñ¢', and it could be a game-changer. Let's dive into the software and see if it lives up to the hype.""

Alright, let's get right to the headline feature: **EnerQi‚Ñ¢**. While other rings give you a static 'readiness' score in the morning, the OMNI Ring provides a dynamic, real-time measure of your vitality. Think of it less like a report card for your sleep, and more like a live fuel gauge for your body.

This is built on Nobel Prize-winning science from 2017 about our circadian rhythms, our internal body clocks. The app visualizes your energy as a curve, showing you the natural peaks and dips in your day. This is a big shift from just sleep tracking to active energy management.""

The idea is to help you understand how your choices‚Äîwhat you eat, when you exercise‚Äîimpact your energy levels throughout the day. This is a proactive approach to health, rather than just a review of what's already happened.

Now, here's where the OMNI Ring's software really tries to stand out. It's the first smart ring with an integrated nutrition plan. You can actually take a photo of your meal, and the app will give you an instant nutritional breakdown.

But it doesn't just log your food. The app's **AI Coach** takes that nutritional info and combines it with your real-time EnerQi‚Ñ¢ score and other biometric data to give you personalized advice. For example, if your energy is dipping in the afternoon, the app might suggest a specific snack to boost your EnerQi‚Ñ¢ and recommend a short walk. This creates a 'full health loop'‚Äîfrom data, to insight, to action.

Of course, the OMNI Ring also covers the essential health tracking features you'd expect from a premium smart ring. It monitors:

* **Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**
* **Blood Oxygen (SpO‚ÇÇ)**
* **Body Temperature**
* **Advanced Sleep Tracking**, including stages like Deep, REM, and Light sleep¬†
* **Daily Step Count and Activity Monitoring**

And get this‚Äîthey're promising a non-invasive blood glucose prediction feature around August 20th, which could be a massive deal for a lot of people.""

The initial Insights screen is where your going to go to review all the data your ring has collected tapping the ‚Äò+‚Äô button is going to load up that AI meal capture.

The My Plan tab allows you to see an overview of your day, what you ate, your stress levels, your sleep and your activity giving you tips in the form of ‚Äòmicrohabits‚Äô like when it asked me to switch to herbal teas or decaf coffee in the afternoon!

Finally the AI Coach tab allows you to talk to Mini the OMNI AI Coach to really dive into all your data and give you personalised insights, this is a paid monthly feature sadly especially when companies like LUNA can offer this for free.

In conclusion then do I recommend the OMNI?

This isn't a perfect device ‚Äì the workout tracking is definitely basic and the app still certainly feels ‚Äòunder development‚Äô with many of the promised kickstarter features like games simply just missing here. But honestly, those feel like minor points when you look at what the OMNI Ring *does* get right, especially for the price.

For ¬£170, you're getting a discreet, comfortable, and premium-feeling health tracker that excels in areas like sleep tracking and recovery insights. The Calorie counting AI is weirdly accurate and really sets it apart from other smart ring offerings.

It's not trying to be an Apple Watch or a WHOOP ‚Äì it's focused squarely on giving you actionable insights into your overall wellness and recovery, and at that, it succeeds brilliantly.

If you're someone who prioritizes understanding your sleep, recovery, and general daily readiness, and you want a comfortable, screen-free device, the OMNI Ring ‚Äì is absolutely worth considering.

It's a fantastic entry point into the smart ring world, offering premium features without the premium long-term price tag.

1md6nbu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md6nbu,"Had a dessert induced coma last night, 253 kcal, 32g protein","The photos are a timeline to my messy epiphany lol 

So‚Ä¶ I did a *thing*. I‚Äôm a bit addicted to making desserts as you can probably tell (I was looking through my food photos and realised I had days where I quite literally had one savoury meal and the rest were dessertified, oops), and when I make something exceptionally good, I get excited to share them. Someone take the kitchen away from me, or take me away from the kitchen, I‚Äôm *married* to it at this point and my life isn‚Äôt going to life itself while I‚Äôm dodging responsibilities dusted in flour. 

Anyhow, midlife crisis aside, first and foremost‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been missing out and you might be too. London fog has taken me by storm. So you need to brew a cup. Not even a should, it‚Äôs a *need*, a must and at minimum only 30 cals for tea galore.

Earl grey tea steeped for about 5-6 mins for strength. (I‚Äôm not a tea expert so idk what I‚Äôm doing but this works, I‚Äôve even left it in for 15 mins accidentally but it was a large cup of water to make a cup with milk and have a cup alone and it tasted fine too - I have a strong feeling I‚Äôve made some tea fanatics cringe though)

Heat up some milk - I use 200ml almond milk  but sometimes I use 150 and mix it with a more indulgent one. Then use a milk frother to froth it up with some skinny barista zero cal vanilla syrup or any vanilla syrup. Pour in your brew and you, my darling, will be amazed and much like me, as a dessert fanatic, the flavour profile will unlock a *whole* new world that demands all recipes to be rewritten with an earl twist. 

Today, I dipped and poured when I‚Äôd simply planned to drink it on the side. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll probably make an earls grey centred dessert. I‚Äôm actually so stuffed rn i can‚Äôt even, and I don‚Äôt even, want to think of the word dessert or food at the moment.

Now, to make this love letter baked into a heart ramekin. I‚Äôd originally planned to use oat flour, but, to my dismay, I ran out so I opted for oat fibre. First time using it in a bake mind you, worked wonders in a tortilla though. Thoughts? I used 10g but it leaves this mild fibre texture - doesn‚Äôt ruin the taste, just a bit odd if you brood on it. You could always switch that out for more protein powder or something else entirely, or perhaps decreasing to 6g might work if the texture throws you off too much. 

#TOP TIP
Just for a quick lil note, do as you will if you want to tweak:

1. Spelt Flour ‚Üí Structure & Rise
	‚Ä¢	Contains some gluten (unlike almond/oat fibre)
	‚Ä¢	Gives the cake body, crumb, and ‚Äúreal cake‚Äù texture
	‚Ä¢	Works with baking powder + sparkling water to give the rise
‚úÖ Essential if you want a legit cake base, even in small amounts (includes self raising and plain and wholewheat flours)

‚∏ª

ü•• 2. Almond Flour ‚Üí Moisture & Softness
	‚Ä¢	High in fat, low in carbs
	‚Ä¢	Adds a mild richness and tenderness
	‚Ä¢	Helps stop the texture from going rubbery with too much protein powder
‚úÖ Optional, but great if you‚Äôre skipping egg yolks or oil - amazing in oat flour bakes because it makes it heavier instead of light and airy 

‚∏ª

üåæ 3. Oat Fibre ‚Üí Volume & Lower Calories
	‚Ä¢	Basically zero calories, pure insoluble fibre
	‚Ä¢	Adds bulk, keeps you full, and stretches batter volume
	‚Ä¢	Can get gritty if not hydrated or balanced
‚úÖ Useful in small doses‚Äîbut tricky when overused without enough wet

#THE RECIPE

Now then, *our 5 minute cooking lesson with a side of yap aside*:

**Dry Ingredients:**
- 10g oat fibre 
- 5g almond flour
- 7g wholewheat spelt flour (you can use plain or whatever you fancy, wholewheats just low GI so better for pcos)
- 1/4tsp baking powder 
- Brown sweetener (used brown sugar pure sweet I used like 40g and it was REALLY sweet but I have like a crazy sweet tooth so)
- Pinch of salt
- 20g chocolate protein powder
- 5g cocoa powder 
- 1/4-1/2tsp coffee, I use fine ground instant espresso 
- 
**Wet ingredients:**
- 35g egg whites
- 10g apple sauce but to be honest you can do without - I just had a jar that‚Äôs been crying out to me so I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. Used a small amount so Idk if it made any real difference, maybe mild sweetness at best.
- 1/4 tsp Vanilla extract 
- 125g sparkling water
- 
**Frosting:**
- 100g Fage but you could use 50-75g because it was a lot.
- 1/4tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Powdered sweetener. You could use granulated but powdered works better, just grind up your stevia and erythritol, that‚Äôs what I do and voila. Mine had this cardamom accent because I‚Äôd previously ground some in the grinder and it‚Äôs never gone away, I think it‚Äôs a pleasant kick, so would recommend a tiny bit! 

**How to:**
1. Preheat your oven to 170-180C
2. optional: freeze a small square or two of chocolate or ganache for that gooey center of you fancy! Freezing helps stop it dissolved into the cake especially as most chocolates melt quickly. 
3. Sift the dry ingredients together, super important. 
4. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry then add your sparkling water. I added 100ml at first and whisked, then added a further 25ml. 
5. Let the mixture sit for the oat fibre to properly absorb or it‚Äôll be really gritty. About 10-15 minutes ideally maybe even more, it‚Äôs a thirsty baby
6. Line a baking dish or grease, brownie points if you have a heart shaped one because everyone needs a little romanticism in life and who‚Äôll do it for you if not yourself (single folks anyway). I like to pop the bottom off and re-attach with parchment paper, then like the rims with a thin strip. 
7. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes and keep an eye - you want the middle jiggly still because it does set more as it cools and personally I prefer a molten centre! When you first pop it into the oven, give it like 2-3 minutes and then push in your chocolate into the centre. 
8. While you wait, whisk together the frosting toppings, if your yogurt is really thick, add a bit of water to thin. You can add xanthum for clotted cream vibes - but I wanted a more icing type of frosting so I omitted it this time
9. Let the cake cool and brew your tea (I insist, earl grey)
10. Top the cake with the frosting and a dusting of cocoa and voila!

Now here‚Äôs the fun bit. That frothed cup of London fog? It compliments the cake so well. Whether you dunk, or pour some of that tea over the cake, it‚Äôs amazing - go full mukbanger mode, certainly felt like one as I ate - you know, where they eat so many cakes and cookies and have this delicious iced tea or milk they dip everything into. It felt *sinful*. Of course I‚Äôll do earls grey justice and bake something with a neutral base, ooh maybe zesty, that honours it, but my goodness, the chocolate and earl grey combination was *heavenly*. It was half way into the cake, because I was eating it like a gourmet culinary experience, that I felt satisfyingly stuffed especially because I‚Äôd had dinner while making it (humble gochujang and cream cheese egg whites).

## Rock the World: Zatanna Zatara

A One-Shot

Written by /u/Predaplant

Edited by /u/Geography3

It was funny how when you performed a show enough times, your brain could enter autopilot no matter what you were doing.

Case in point: Zatanna Zatara was in the middle of a tricky part of her show. She had a setup where someone traced a pattern on a puppy‚Äôs fur before said puppy would vanish and a fully-grown Great Dane would emerge with the same pattern imprinted onto its skin, seemingly grown to adulthood in an instant. It required a significant amount of sleight of hand on her part, some cooperation from both animals, and trust in her stage hands that they would do a good enough job tracing the pattern.

But as Zatanna said her scripted lines that she knew by heart, she couldn‚Äôt help but think about her date after the show. She had met a man by chance the previous night, and she just hoped that this one would be a keeper.

It had been at the bookstore that Zatanna frequented, the Ruby Bookmark. While her friends often teased her about her fondness for cheap romance novels, Zatanna couldn‚Äôt quite let them go. There was a real allure to the idea of somebody walking into her life and just clicking with her, giving her that safety and support that she yearned for so deeply.

She had been browsing for a new read and had just made a selection when she heard a voice over her shoulder. ‚ÄúYou sure about that one?‚Äù

She looked at the owner of the voice carefully. Tall and buff, with the perfect amount of stubble on his chin... he was even wearing a t-shirt that actually fit him well, for once. Rare to see a man this hot.

Zatanna rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou have something against romance?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he chuckled nervously, holding out his hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just... I‚Äôve read that one. It goes in circles, and then they get together with like no real build-up. Not worth your time.‚Äù

Zatanna‚Äôs guarded expression softened into a smile. She put the book back on the shelf without breaking eye contact with the man. ‚ÄúAnd what would be worth my time?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh...‚Äù the man turned to the shelves, his eyes frantically searching. He was taking this seriously. It was cute. ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù he said, pulling a book off the shelf and handing it to Zatanna. ‚ÄúBeen loving books by Wyatt lately, she‚Äôs really good at the push and pull. A lot of authors focus too much on the first encounters and the steamy stuff, but not her.‚Äù

Turning the book over, Zatanna read the synopsis. A book about two truckers working for rival companies... there could definitely be something there. The allure of the road, and all that. Zatanna hadn‚Äôt been on a tour in years, but she could remember that isolation.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she told him, tucking the book under her arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sold.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I sell you on one more thing?‚Äù he asked, grinning in a way that made it clear he was nervous, but not self-conscious. ‚ÄúCan we go out for drinks tomorrow night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not off till ten-thirty. That alright with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds great,‚Äù the man said, pulling out his phone and opening up his calendar to make an appointment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Aidan, by the way.‚Äù

‚ÄúZatanna. Can we meet at the Desert Star? It‚Äôs not too far from work.‚Äù

‚ÄúZatanna,‚Äù Aidan said slowly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting name. Unique, even... but I feel like I‚Äôve heard it somewhere before?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do a show, actually,‚Äù Zatanna struck a bit of a pose, holding her arm out like she had on the advertisements she had seen across town. She couldn‚Äôt help but giggle a bit as she did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a magician. I feel like my face is everywhere in this town some nights. Nice to know that I‚Äôm not quite *that* famous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a military guy, so I‚Äôm not in town all that much,‚Äù Aidan explained. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre some kind of magician, this better not all be a setup to some trick where you duck out on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there tomorrow night,‚Äù Zatanna told him. ‚ÄúPromise.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you then,‚Äù Aidan said with a small nod.

‚ÄúSee you!‚Äù Zatanna waved, before heading to go check out her book.

It was so rare to meet a man who seemed to have any sort of interest in romance novels... and for him to even be the type to seize the opportunity and ask her out right there on the spot? Zatanna had a good feeling about this one.

A shout of ‚ÄúWe love you!‚Äù from the crowd bolted Zatanna out of her daydreaming. The trick had just finished, and most of the audience was in the midst of a round of applause. Zatanna smiled, acknowledging their approval of the trick, and gave a small bow before continuing on with her show.

The rest of the evening passed in the blink of an eye, and suddenly Zatanna was backstage, almost ready to go. Having changed back into her street clothes, she threw on a blue overcoat and headed for the door, stopping Mikey Dowling, her best friend and performance manager, on the way out.

‚ÄúEverything good with packing up for the night? No problems?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problems,‚Äù Mikey confirmed, giving Zatanna a thumbs-up, before pausing; something had caught her attention. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still wearing makeup. Do you have a date tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the Desert Star, in fifteen minutes,‚Äù Zatanna confirmed. ‚ÄúSo if nothing‚Äôs gone wrong, I should probably get on the move.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo red flags on this one yet?‚Äù Mikey raised an eyebrow.

Zatanna sighed. ‚ÄúNo, Mikey, he‚Äôs fine, trust me. It‚Äôs a first date, so I don‚Äôt know too much yet, but we met at the bookstore. How bad can a man who reads romance be?‚Äù

Mikey clicked her tongue. ‚ÄúZana... if your dating history‚Äôs taught me anything, it‚Äôs that any type of man can have skeletons in his closet.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Zatanna said, raising her hands in mock surrender with a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be careful. I won‚Äôt let myself get swept off my feet, I‚Äôll notice if he says he kills puppies or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttagirl,‚Äù Mikey patted Zatanna on the back. ‚ÄúGo get him!‚Äù

‚ÄúHave a good night!‚Äù Zatanna called as she pushed open the backstage doors, hearing a faint ‚ÄúYou too!‚Äù from Mikey before the door closed behind her, leaving her alone with the hot Nevada air.

All the spectacle felt kind of kitschy, especially when she had seen it all thousands of times before, but Zatanna never got bored walking along the Vegas Strip. There were always so many different kinds of people there, those who had never seen anything like it before and those who called this place their home, the high rollers and the people who could only afford to gamble a few bills, people in large groups and people taking it all in by themselves... she couldn‚Äôt help but think of each of their own personal stories. Everybody was different and everybody had a story.

She saw somebody offer to take a couple‚Äôs picture together, and she couldn‚Äôt help but smile. The little acts of kindness, of companionship, they were what made the world go round.

She turned down a side street and, a few blocks later, there she was: the Desert Star. She pushed the door open, and the air conditioning hit her like a blessing from above.

Taking a quick glance around the bar, she didn‚Äôt see Aidan. Well, she‚Äôd at least have a drink while she was here before heading out. Maybe she should‚Äôve gotten his phone number, but she had a policy against giving her own number out too freely. She had dealt with enough stalkers in her time to know that was simply a bad idea.

She sat down on a barstool and started to tap her foot as the bartender Tyson approached her.

‚ÄúWhat can I get for you tonight?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, nothing too potent,‚Äù Zatanna said, pulling out her phone and fiddling with her hair in the screen reflection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a date coming up.‚Äù

‚ÄúA date?‚Äù Tyson asked, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back in the dating game?‚Äù

Zatanna glared at him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell...‚Äù Tyson said, pulling out a glass and starting to work on a drink for her. ‚ÄúThe number of guys I‚Äôve seen you come in here have me slightly concerned.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you slut-shaming me?‚Äù Zatanna asked, pursing her lips.

‚ÄúNot at all!‚Äù Tyson exhaled, his breath steady. ‚ÄúI just worry about you. That many breakups must hurt... are you alright?‚Äù

Zatanna softened. She bit her lip. ‚ÄúI mean... I have friends. I have hobbies. I can deal with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, Ms. Magician,‚Äù Tyson laughed, handing Zatanna her drink. ‚ÄúAs long as that‚Äôs not just a performance.‚Äù

Taking the drink, Zatanna sipped it. Not too sweet, just the way she liked it.

‚ÄúIs that him?‚Äù Tyson asked, nodding at a man approaching the bar.

‚ÄúLooks like it,‚Äù Zatanna said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay out of your way,‚Äù Tyson said quietly as he started to move down towards the other customers at the bar.

‚ÄúSatanna!‚Äù Aidan called out, heading towards the seat next to Zatanna‚Äôs.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Zatanna said, shifting to make room for him. ‚ÄúI think you might‚Äôve misheard me. It‚Äôs Zatanna, with a ‚Äòz‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not satanic?‚Äù Aidan asked, wiggling his eyebrows. ‚ÄúNot here to steal my soul?‚Äù

Zatanna lightly punched his arm. ‚ÄúI mean... it‚Äôs Sin City, isn‚Äôt it? Gonna have to take a chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair play.‚Äù Aidan rubbed his arm where she hit it. ‚ÄúHow was your show tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, only the exact same as the hundreds of other times I‚Äôve done it,‚Äù Zatanna said with a sip of her drink.

‚ÄúDoes it get easier?‚Äù Aidan asked as he called Tyson over.

Zatanna shook her head. ‚ÄúNot really. Once you get over the hump and know what you‚Äôre doing, it stays pretty consistent. Tonight was tricky, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was nervous about meeting you,‚Äù Zatanna laughed, turning her face away from Aidan, embarrassed.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Aidan said, reaching his hand toward Zatanna‚Äôs, resting on the bar counter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely stunning, and I really like you. You‚Äôve got nothing to worry about.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù It was nice to feel his hand, and he looked really handsome under the lights of the bar, and...

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Zatanna raised a hand to her mouth.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Aidan asked.

‚ÄúOn that TV there,‚Äù Zatanna pointed.

A national news channel played a clip of a terrifying monster, double the size of the people around it, stomping through a crowd attempting to flee. It looked almost reptilian in nature, with large yellow eyes, sharp teeth, and a massive tail, and it swiped through a bus shelter like it was nothing attempting to get at the people inside.

‚ÄúAll these attacks lately...‚Äù Zatanna gripped her drink tightly. ‚ÄúAbsolutely terrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you know...‚Äù Aidan said, drumming his fingers against his glass. ‚ÄúWe have the resources to deal with it. We have Superman, the Flash, Wonder Woman... It‚Äôs terrifying, sure, but maybe it‚Äôll scare the right people. Maybe we can finally come together as a society.‚Äù

Zatanna looked away, pretending to examine the bar‚Äôs decor. There was something about what Aidan was saying that didn‚Äôt sit right with her... like there was a connection waiting to be made.

Aidan said he worked for the military, and these monsters... what was it that Nightwing had said? That someone from the military was getting up to no good? 

‚ÄúYou helped make these attacks happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Zatanna asked softly.

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù Aidan shook his head with a laugh.

Zatanna raised an eyebrow at him. He couldn‚Äôt hold her gaze. ‚ÄúCome on, be serious!‚Äù she exclaimed.

‚ÄúCan we not talk about it?‚Äù he asked, staring at his drink.

She felt it building within her. There was a moment in every magic trick, where after all the build-up, something goes wrong, feels off, departs from the world as the audience knows it, and Zatanna felt herself building towards that high. Something was going to happen here when she hit it, and even she didn‚Äôt know what it would be yet.

The timer within her brain, honed from years of practicing magic, started to count down. Five, four, three, two.

One.

She spoke quietly under her breath, not loud enough for anyone else to hear her. Not that they would‚Äôve understood, even if they could‚Äôve heard her.

‚ÄúTel mih ees eht secneuqesnoc‚Äù

As the last word left her mouth, she snapped her fingers. Always important to include that misdirection... and they were there.

Zatanna braced for impact, but the magic was kind enough to bring their barstools along with them this time. Clever.

Aidan looked around and squealed in fright, and as he did, Zatanna got up off her seat.

They were a stone‚Äôs throw from the monster that they had seen on the TV. It turned its eyes towards them, starting to lumber in their direction.

Zatanna moved until she was between the monster and Aidan, turned to face him and smiled cutely, wrinkling her nose. ‚ÄúNo, I think this is something we have to talk about.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell!?‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúNevada isn‚Äôt even anywhere near Utah!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù Zatanna winked. ‚ÄúJust had to give you a little taste of your own medicine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù Aidan leaped up and tried to grab Zatanna, but she danced out of the way.

The monster continued to close the distance. Magic was all about timing. Zatanna knew she had to talk quicker. ‚ÄúNever underestimate a good magician! Now, if you ask nicely, maybe I‚Äôll bring you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù he begged, nervously watching the monster that he knew he had no hope of outrunning. There were maybe five seconds left now.

‚ÄúHmm... promise me not to hurt civilians again?‚Äù Zatanna raised her hand, ready to snap her fingers.

‚ÄúI promise!‚Äù Aidan started to stutter-step run away from her, nervous to not get crushed by the monster but simultaneously wanting to stay in range of whatever magic Zatanna was going to perform.

As the monster reached down to grab Aidan and he raised his arms in a useless defence, Zatanna snapped her fingers and uttered the magic words, ‚ÄúEvas siht ytic dna ekat su kcab!‚Äù, and there they were, back to sitting in the bar as if they had never left.

Aidan tried to grab Zatanna‚Äôs hand, but she moved it away. ‚ÄúTyson?‚Äù she called out down the bar. ‚ÄúMaybe you were right. I should never have agreed to meet this guy in the first place.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù Aidan said, grabbing Zatanna‚Äôs hand tightly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you snap us away this time. You tell me how you did that or you‚Äôre going to not like where things go from there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need any help there, Zatanna?‚Äù Tyson asked.

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù Zatanna said, effortlessly slipping out of Aidan‚Äôs grasp. ‚ÄúThat escape compliments of Scott Free, and this escape compliments of... me!‚Äù

She snapped her fingers and, with a final whispered word of ‚ÄúEmoh!‚Äù, found herself back in her apartment.

She took a deep breath. It was a few seconds before she could summon up the energy to head towards the bathroom to wash her makeup off.

ZZZZZ

‚Äú...it crossed my mind that dating a military guy was a bad idea, but I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be that bad!‚Äù

It was the next day, and the Nevada sun was shining brightly through the windows of Zatanna‚Äôs apartment, illuminating the living room where Mikey and Zatanna sat together, looking out the window and talking.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me! I asked for red flags!‚Äù Mikey interjected in between sips of her coffee.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I thought it was, like... an orange flag?‚Äù Zatanna bit her lip.

‚ÄúSounds like you need to get your eyes checked,‚Äù Mikey muttered. ‚ÄúYou sure you aren‚Äôt colour blind?‚Äù

Zatanna rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou can tell security to watch out for him at the show, right?‚Äù

Mikey nodded, pulling out her phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it right now. Just one more thing... the magic?‚Äù

Leaning forward with a burst of energy, Zatanna responded quickly. ‚ÄúI know, I know, but it just kind of burst out of me, it wasn‚Äôt something that I wanted to do and I‚Äôll be careful!‚Äù

Mikey chose her words carefully. ‚ÄúI think you did good last night, but careful sounds like a good idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt really good to humiliate that guy, though.‚Äù Zatanna laughed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it did.‚Äù

Zatanna looked across the room at the romance book that had started it all, still lying on her coffee table. She walked across the room and picked it up. ‚ÄúYou want this?‚Äù

Mikey shook her head. ‚ÄúCome on, you know me. I don‚Äôt read that stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr anything!‚Äù Zatanna said as she made her way back to her seat. She was going to have to get rid of the book somehow. Maybe return it to the bookstore.

She just hoped that the next time she met a man there, it would be somebody worthy of her love.

1md6ggr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsCalls/comments/1md6ggr/starbucks_sbux_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_from/,"Starbucks (SBUX): The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly from SBUX's Earnings Call","\- July 29, 2025

## The Good ‚òïÔ∏è

- **Early Progress on Turnaround:** Management is seeing meaningful progress and is ahead of internal expectations for the ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù plan.
- **Operational Improvements:** Key operational metrics such as partner (employee) engagement, shift completion rates (98.2%), and reduced complaints are all improving. Coffeehouse leader engagement is near historic highs.
- **Transaction Growth in Key Segments:** Canada posted positive comps, and for the first time since the pandemic, non-Rewards customer transactions grew year-over-year in the U.S.
- **International Strength:** International segment delivered record quarterly revenue ($2B+), with China achieving 2% comp growth and 6% transaction growth. U.K., EMEA, Latin America, and Turkey also performed well.
- **Innovation Pipeline:** Exciting new food and beverage innovations are in the works (e.g., protein cold foam, coconut water-based beverages, gluten-free and high-protein foods) and a reimagined rewards program is coming in 2026.
- **Efficiency Initiatives:** Disciplined capital deployment, targeted store renovation program ($150K/store), and new store prototypes aimed at reducing build costs by ~30%.
- **Tech Upgrades:** SmartQ order sequencing is improving service times; mobile app remains strong with ~34M active rewards users.
- **Brand Value Perception:** Value perceptions are at near two-year highs, especially among Gen Z and millennials.
- **Commitment to Shareholder Returns:** Company remains committed to maintaining strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit rating, and returning cash via dividends.
- **Clear Communication on Long-Term Plans:** Investor Day scheduled for early 2026 to outline long-term strategy and targets.

---

## The Bad üò¨

- **Declining U.S. Comps:** U.S. comparable sales declined 2%, with transaction comps down nearly 4%‚Äîreflecting ongoing challenges in the core market.
- **EPS and Margin Pressure:** Q3 EPS was down 45% year-over-year to $0.50 due to expense deleverage and significant investments. Operating margin dropped 650bps to 10.1%.
- **Heavy Promotional Comparison:** The U.S. is lapping a period of heavy discounting, making comps tough and highlighting a need to ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù the customer transaction base.
- **Uncertain Near-Term Outlook:** Management remains ‚Äúconservative‚Äù about Q4 U.S. trends, citing both macro headwinds and ongoing transformation costs.
- **Elevated G&A Expenses:** 18% increase year-over-year, largely from the Leadership Experience 2025 event, which‚Äîwhile galvanizing‚Äîhit the bottom line.
- **Japan Weakness:** Japan posted negative comps due to lapping strong prior-year performance and soft consumer sentiment.
- **Store Optimization Necessity:** The need to sunset the mobile order/pickup-only format and complete a portfolio evaluation signals that not all past store strategies were successful.

---

## The Ugly üò¨‚ò†Ô∏è

- **Margin Dilution from Investments:** Over $500M in additional labor hours and foundational investments are weighing heavily on near-term profitability, with no concrete timeline for a full margin recovery.
- **No Official Guidance:** No formal earnings or margin guidance for the year was provided, adding uncertainty for investors.
- **Potential for Prolonged Recovery:** Leadership admits the turnaround is a ‚Äúmultiyear effort,‚Äù and a full recovery to pre-COVID (2019) margin levels is uncertain and could take several years.
- **Competitive & Macro Risks:** Explicit mention of heightened competition in the U.S. (from ‚Äúabove and below‚Äù), elevated unit penetration, soft consumer environment, and at-home coffee trends.
- **China Strategic Partner Search:** The need to bring in a local partner in China implies challenges in navigating this critical growth market and possibly signals operational or regulatory struggles.
- **Tariff and Commodity Volatility:** Ongoing coffee price and tariff headwinds are affecting cost predictability, with coffee cost increases expected to peak in early fiscal 2026.
- **Reliance on Unproven Initiatives:** Many turnaround efforts (Green Apron Service, new store formats, loyalty program overhaul) are still in early stages or untested at scale, so their ultimate financial impact is unknown.

---

| Category | Highlights |
|---|---|
| Good | Progress in turnaround, international growth, innovation pipeline, operational gains, loyal customer base, strong brand value, clear long-term plans |
| Bad | U.S. comps still negative, margin/EPS pressure, high expenses, portfolio adjustments, conservative near-term outlook |
| Ugly | Deep margin dilution, no guidance, multiyear recovery, macro/competitive risks, unresolved China strategy, commodity volatility, unproven initiatives |

1md6g51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1md6g51/am_i_being_paranoid_or_is_my_girlfriends_neighbor/,"Am I being paranoid, or is my girlfriend‚Äôs neighbor actually being creepy?","I (M) stay at my girlfriend‚Äôs (Both early 20‚Äôs)  house most nights. I work night shift, so I usually get back pretty late. Over the past year, we‚Äôve  noticed the neighbor directly across the street seems to constantly be watching us or more specifically me.

This neighbor is an older woman who seems totally normal to everyone else. She‚Äôs friendly with my girlfriend‚Äôs parents and was the kind of neighbour to bring over muffins when they first moved in. I‚Äôve met her in daylight when‚Äôs she invited herself over for coffee. 


During one conversation earlier this week, she asked me a ton of specific questions, like what I do during the day, what time I get home from work, etc, where do I live since me and my girlfriend technically don‚Äôt live together. What struck me as weird was that she only asked me these things. She barely acknowledged my girlfriend and didn‚Äôt ask her anything, the focus was entirely on me.

My girlfriend‚Äôs parents always brush off our paranoia, saying she‚Äôs just a sweet neighbor who‚Äôs probably just curious. But we‚Äôve started noticing it seems a little more than friendly and just down right creepy.

For example: My girlfriend and I are night owls and sometimes go out late at night. On more than one occasion, we‚Äôve seen this woman watching us from her upstairs window. Always after midnight. Its a big window with no curtains, directly faces the street where I park,and completely overlooks my partners house, her eyes always follows us. One time, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating - she had both palms pressed against the glass and her face turned toward us in this horror movie style stare. It genuinely freaked us out. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel like I‚Äôm being watched every time I come home from work or go outside to my car. No one else ever seems to see it, because she‚Äôs only ever there the second I leave the house or second we come back, but only me and my girlfriend see it. But it happens constantly. Like clockwork.

Then tonight.

Around 1am, I went outside to grab something from my car, which is parked right outside the house. And there she was, standing next to my car, looking through the window. She didn‚Äôt notice me because I had just stepped outside, but the second she noticed she turned around and crossed the street and went back inside without a word.

She didn‚Äôt say a fucking thing. 

I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend made a joke she put a tracker on the car and that‚Äôs how she constantly knows when to creepily stare/stalk us but we can‚Äôt shake the feeling she‚Äôs a weird little psycho.

So‚Ä¶ am I being paranoid? Or is this genuinely creepy behavior. And if it is creepy behaviour wtf do we do about it.",4,1753881682.0,Advice,9,0.83,False

A lot of these I've been meaning to find, but my best shot is this one I remember most -

A boy and his mother had just baked muffins, as they always do. The boy drinks his with milk, the mother drinks hers with coffee. Then, they make them again, and I think the son takes charge or something, but he FUCKS UP and the tops get burnt, so they cut the tops off and throw them in the garden. This attracts a witch, who now lives in a pink tree in their front yard. I honestly don't remember her doing anything actually evil, but I'm pretty sure they end up getting rid of her somehow, and of course it ends with them celebrating by making new muffins, and eating them, son with milk, mother with coffee. 

I also think it rains at some point, maybe that's what's gotten rid of the witch?

I also remember the music well, but unfortunately I have 0 musical competence and can't figure out what instrument it was, or any tracks I could compare it to. It MIGHT have been piano.

In the heart of German confectionery tradition lies a spirited delight that marries two beloved flavours‚Äîchocolate and hazelnut. Cacao mit Nuss, literally ""cocoa with nut,"" is a velvety liqueur that captures the essence of decadent desserts in a glass.

ü•É Velvety and Nutty

Crafted from rich cocoa and roasted filberts (hazelnuts), this German liqueur offers a deep, chocolatey body and a toasted nut finish. The liqueur is often served chilled in small glasses, drizzled over ice cream, or used in coffee for a luxurious twist.

üá©üá™ From Sweets to Spirits

Germany‚Äôs love for chocolate and hazelnuts runs deep‚Äîfrom Nuss-Schokolade bars to pralines and festive cakes. Cacao mit Nuss builds on this legacy, transforming the flavour of childhood treats into an elegant adult pleasure.

üçÆ Versatile Dessert Partner

This indulgent spirit pairs beautifully with tiramisu, nut tortes, and creamy puddings. It also makes a standout base for dessert cocktails, lending both sweetness and complexity with minimal effort.

üí≠ Final Thought

Cacao mit Nuss isn‚Äôt just a drink‚Äîit‚Äôs a nostalgic nod to rich German flavours, reimagined for the liqueur cabinet. A sip brings warmth, comfort, and a hint of festive charm, no matter the season.

This memory-leak targets the sacred space millions depend on..¬†**Their weekly therapy sessions**..¬†*Revealing how these intimate healing relationships serve the system they think they're healing from.*¬†It dismantles the therapeutic narrative that individual processing can solve systemic problems, exposing therapy as sophisticated behavioral conditioning that teaches compliance with circumstances that make compliance necessary for survival.

This hits particularly close to home because it attacks the one space people trust as genuinely helpful, revealing it as another form of the control system it appears to resist.

# The Sacred Session

You believe therapy is healing. You've been told it's brave, necessary, transformative.. Paying someone $200 an hour to help you process the damage of living in an insane system. But what if your therapist isn't healing you? What if they're training you to function better as a broken machine while calling it recovery?

**Therapy isn't therapy. It's behavioral conditioning disguised as emotional support.**¬†The $240 billion mental health industry didn't emerge to fix what's wrong with you.. it emerged to fix you so you can tolerate what's wrong with everything else.

**Your weekly session isn't liberation. It's domestication.**

You're not getting better.. you're getting better at being worse in ways that don't disrupt the system that broke you.

I had a mixed episode in the beginning of the year and i was put on an antidepressant, anxiety med, stabilizer and three antipsychotics. They have only cut the anxiety pill so far and i feel like i am too medicated cause i am always sleepy and it's complicated to function. I take like 6 coffees a day to make it through and by the time i get home from work i can't do anything. It's getting hard to even take a shower. She says I don't look that bad and that it's better not to touch the medication.
 Today i told her how long did i have to complain for her to change the medication, that if i got depressed seemed it would take months to be taken seriously and for me to get my meds adjusted and it was concerning for me because that had happened to me before with this health system. She snaped at me and said i was taking out my frustrations on her, that it sucked for her to have to deal with the frustrations of a seriously ill mental patient. I talked about my concern with past self destructive tendencies that have led to this point and she says it's not relevant, that that is related to my character and not mental illness and that it's something i have to work on changing.
 Then she said she did believe i was better but there was room for me to become more stable. I probably will never be as stable as she thinks with meds because it's also related to my personality iregardless of my mood which i also tried to discuss with her so far with little avail. She says she will try to work more on the personality issues in the future.
 This was the weirdest appointment ever. Like i felt i was only allowed to say what was expected in there and there was not room to express my concerns safely. It was weird how she got so offended and the things she said to me. I don't understand fully. I am hoping it goes better next time.

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn‚Äôt want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a saturday afternoon.¬†

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I‚Äôd rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I‚Äôd take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything.The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn‚Äôt quite real.

""You‚Äôve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn‚Äôt confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I‚Äôve been in there a million times. It‚Äôs just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn‚Äôt the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too.¬†

Yes, I had been in the garage‚Äîbut only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn‚Äôt be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn‚Äôt who he said he was.

And I don‚Äôt know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there‚Äôs a witch in the garage. Or there‚Äôs a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn‚Äôt want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I‚Äôd lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad‚Äôs head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We‚Äôre heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read ‚Äú3rd Place - Karate.‚Äù

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don‚Äôt mess with me, man. I‚Äôll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might‚Äôve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father‚Äôs footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We‚Äôll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn‚Äôt look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper.¬†

I started to speak slowly ‚ÄúKid, Dad, Mom‚Äù

‚ÄúWitch‚Äù Alex cut me off.¬†

**Chapter 7**

Alex doesn‚Äôt sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it‚Äôs because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There‚Äôs something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything‚Äôs fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he‚Äôs checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don‚Äôt know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream‚Äôs skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag‚Äîbut I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn‚Äôt see my hands. Couldn‚Äôt feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat.¬†

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn‚Äôt sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It‚Äôs what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it‚Äôs a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.¬†¬†

I figured Dad must‚Äôve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing up?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He‚Äôd been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, Dad,‚Äù I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn‚Äôt smile. Didn‚Äôt laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

‚ÄúSorry, son,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

‚ÄúI was just... hungry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWanted some pizza.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

‚ÄúDid you eat it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI just told you,‚Äù he said, smile unwavering. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone. Who else would‚Äôve eaten it?‚Äù

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

‚ÄúThe witch in the garage,‚Äù I said flatly.

He didn‚Äôt move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù he began, voice low. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of darkness in this world.‚Äù

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

‚ÄúThere are things out there,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúthat are hard to explain. Things that don‚Äôt make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúBut maybe one day you will have to.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to say?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn‚Äôt catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

‚ÄúEverything I do,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI do for you and your mother.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I murmured. What else was there to say?

‚ÄúI love you, Sam,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI love you too, Dad,‚Äù I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose.¬†

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said slowly, cautiously, ‚Äúif I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?‚Äù

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said, and this time his voice was grave. ‚ÄúYou can ask me a question.‚Äù

He emphasized the word ‚ÄòA‚Äô as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn‚Äôt know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

‚ÄúIs the witch real?‚Äù I asked, keeping my voice steady.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe witch is real.‚Äù

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

**Chapter 8**

There were so many questions I could have asked him. Do we have a basement? Was there ever someone else in our family? Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

‚ÄúHe said it was real?‚Äù Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYour dad said that? Just like that?‚Äù

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. ‚ÄúAnything else happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust more nightmares.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn‚Äôt even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn‚Äôt understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn‚Äôt. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him.¬†

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn‚Äôt up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

‚ÄúA kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.‚Äù I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. ‚ÄúHey sweetheart. Everything okay?‚Äù

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. ‚ÄúI found this in that old box Dad gave me.‚Äù

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. ‚ÄúAw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.‚Äù

I stared at her. ‚ÄúMom. Why are there two women in the drawing?‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúTwo?‚Äù

I pointed. ‚ÄúThere. That one‚Äôs you. That one‚Äôs Dad. That‚Äôs me. who‚Äôs *she*?‚Äù

Her face didn‚Äôt change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúShe looks exactly like you,‚Äù I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?‚Äù

She had a point. But it didn‚Äôt feel right.

‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

‚ÄúHave you ever gone through the red door, Mom?‚Äù I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. ‚ÄúThe red door? In the garage?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.‚Äù She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I asked.‚Äù

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

‚ÄúI asked,‚Äù I said again, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve ever *gone* through the red door.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, the red door leads to the garage,‚Äù she said, her voice suddenly firm.

‚ÄúDoes it?‚Äù I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù she said quickly. Too quickly.

‚ÄúThen why are there *locks* on both sides of it?‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúWhy does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?‚Äù

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

‚ÄúSam...‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúPlease, stop. You‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú*Dad* is the one who‚Äôs scaring me. I know he‚Äôs hiding something. I know you are too.‚Äù

She stepped forward and reached out. ‚ÄúSweetheart, you‚Äôre not well. Maybe it‚Äôs just the nightmares, or stress, or‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just good at pretending.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, please,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou need help. You‚Äôre saying things that aren‚Äôt real.‚Äù

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn‚Äôt name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling. And I didn‚Äôt know who she was. But she looked a lot like my mother.

**Chapter 9**

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up.¬†

‚ÄúWait, what? No, no, no, what happened?‚Äù she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might‚Äôve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I asked, my voice thin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been an accident,‚Äù she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn‚Äôt know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

‚ÄúYour father was in a car crash,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He‚Äôs at the hospital.‚Äù

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I‚Äôd been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently.¬†

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He‚Äôd been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad‚Ä¶ Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma ‚Äúfor his own safety,‚Äù the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise‚Äîsoft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I‚Äôd slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn‚Äôt want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn‚Äôt move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I‚Äôd had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn‚Äôt understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again.¬†

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red.¬†

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just‚Ä¶ still.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by.¬†

¬†felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad‚Äôs bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn‚Äôt watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn‚Äôt see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

‚ÄúHey, Mom,‚Äù I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

‚ÄúYes, hun?‚Äù she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn‚Äôt touch her eyes.

‚ÄúCould I, could I get some water or something?‚Äù I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. ‚ÄúMaybe step outside for a minute. Just‚Ä¶ some air.‚Äù

She nodded without hesitation. ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôs probably a good idea,‚Äù she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. ‚ÄúGo ahead. I‚Äôll be right here.‚Äù

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúIs Mrs. Pierce working tonight?‚Äù

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex‚Äôs mom.

‚ÄúOh, Sam,‚Äù she said, walking up with open arms, ‚ÄúI heard what happened. I‚Äôm so, so sorry, sweetheart.‚Äù

Her hug was warm, but I didn‚Äôt feel it.¬†

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

‚ÄúYour dad‚Äôs strong. And this hospital‚Äôs one of the best. The doctors here‚Ä¶‚Äù she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre basically wizards, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr witches,‚Äù I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

‚ÄúCould you give me a ride home?‚Äù I asked.¬†

**Chapter 10**

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn‚Äôt try to talk much, and I couldn‚Äôt have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn‚Äôt lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie.¬†

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father‚Äôs key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I‚Äôd open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father‚Äôs dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room‚Ä¶ was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúWho's there?‚Äù the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

‚ÄúS-Sam,‚Äù I said, barely able to get the word out.

‚ÄúWill you help me, Sam?‚Äù

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

‚ÄúSo you're real,‚Äù I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. ‚ÄúThere really is a witch...‚Äù

The voice whimpered. ‚ÄúI'm not a witch, Sam.‚Äù She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. ‚ÄúI'm a prisoner.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. My hands were shaking violently.

‚ÄúYour father‚Ä¶ he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I finally managed to ask.

‚ÄúMy name is Sarah,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Danny‚Äôs mother.‚Äù

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny‚Äôs mother. The one who‚Äôd *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

‚ÄúWait here,‚Äù I said, voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call the police. I‚Äôm going to call Danny.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, wait,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúSometimes‚Ä¶ sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he‚Äôs feeling merciful. It‚Äôs already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.‚Äù

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Danny answered.

‚ÄúDanny, it‚Äôs Sam,‚Äù I gasped, tears flooding my face.

‚ÄúOh hey, man, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found her,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúYour mom. She didn‚Äôt leave. She didn‚Äôt run away. She‚Äôs here, Danny. She‚Äôs been under my house this whole time.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

‚ÄúSam‚Ä¶ my mom‚Äôs in rehab.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, she‚Äôs not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She‚Äôs getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.‚Äù

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs‚Ä¶ in the dark‚Ä¶ a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone‚Ä¶¬† something was climbing up.

1md687d,https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/1md687d/lees_park_campground_2025_for_spac_great/,"Lee's Park Campground 2025 for SPAC. Great campground, or the greatest campground?","I have been to 4 runs at SPAC: 2016, 2019, 2023, and 2025. I stayed at the worst motel ever in 2019 and parking at SPAC is wicked irritating on a good day. The other three runs I stayed at Lee's. This year it was $60/car per night, and $20/person per night for shuttle. $100/night for me and my partner to Phish including a ride to/from the venue.

Having done some various shows in various cities, and a couple festivals, I think Lee's is my sweet spot. Oh Lee's Park, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

1. SHUTTLES: We are in fact, actually getting on the bus. The school bus. Twice daily. Feel your cares and worries melt away as the nice lady checks wristbands and the mean-sounding security dude tells you he ain't got time for your shit today. \[BUS DRIVER NAME\] was kind enough to let you all bring your drinks on to the bus. Make sure you don't leave any garbage and bring it up to the front of the bus!
2. SHAKEDOWN: We got tie dye crap. We got weird tchotchke. We got glass blowers, blowing glass in the Lee's Park! We got grilled stuff, and we got fried stuff. There is also oddly enough a tent for uh, other various sundries you maybe didn't get at home. We do need a pizza guy next go-around, imo, and the coffee is reliably mid.
3. STEWART'S: There is no general store on the campground, but Stewart's is literally right outside the entrance. It's a bit more than a gas station/convenience store.
4. SITE VARIETY: We got campsites by the lake, we got campsites in the woods, we got campsites in clearings. We got RV sites and hookups. You can have any experience that you want here as long as your generator is off by 11pm. For super-premium sites you may have to schlep your crap in from wherever you parked.
5. SECURITY: This year especially, security was involved without being irritating! They were pretty thorough about driving around and checking wristbands each day to make sure people leave when they're supposed to and there's room for everyone. I didn't hear a single peep from anyone about lost/stolen items.
6. SWRISTBANDS: I guess S is the list theme... Anyway you are gonna have so many fuckin wristbands. I had 4 by Sunday, 1 for camping and 1 for each day of shuttle. I finally took mine off yesterday because I was struggling to admit I didn't need them anymore.
7. SBATHROOMS: In past years I had issues with them not having enough bathrooms in the right places. This was not the case this year. They time their cleanings pretty close to needs, but they nailed the timing this year. The portas would get full and they would be getting emptied within an hour. I was never uncomfortable. The portas are dark at night (obv) but they have a lit bathroom building for those times.
8. SHOWERS: They have showers, if you want. They also have a public boat launch and public swimming at Saratoga Lake. The water was lovely, but obviously it has some plants and wildlife in it because it is a natural body of water.
9. SAMENITIES: Unlike festivals and most places I camp nowadays, you can have a CAMPFIRE! They will sell you wood at a REASONABLE PRICE ($5/bundle iirc). They will sell you ICE! $3 bag or 2/$5! They often run out but they are cheaper than Stewart's for ice, and also closer. They have an ATM right by the office in a charming little rustic shed.
10. STAFF: Everyone at Lee's is super-helpful. They do have rules and they do expect you to follow them.  Beyond that they are absolute royalty. If they can do anything to help you they almost certainly will. I have never had a bad experience at Lee's and might even try out vending next run! (It's me, I would be the pizza guy)
11. **EDIT -- WE HAD A FUCKIN BAND TOO!** [**Reality Check Experiment**](https://therealitycheckexperiment.com/) **out of Philly BURNED THAT SHIT DOWN Friday and Saturday nights. They played Billie Jean, then arrowed into an original, then ARROWED BACK, THEN THEY DID A VOCAL JAM. Just sayin'! Those kids were FIIIIIIRE**

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn‚Äôt want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a saturday afternoon.¬†

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I‚Äôd rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I‚Äôd take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything.The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn‚Äôt quite real.

""You‚Äôve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn‚Äôt confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I‚Äôve been in there a million times. It‚Äôs just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn‚Äôt the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too.¬†

Yes, I had been in the garage‚Äîbut only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn‚Äôt be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn‚Äôt who he said he was.

And I don‚Äôt know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there‚Äôs a witch in the garage. Or there‚Äôs a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn‚Äôt want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I‚Äôd lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad‚Äôs head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We‚Äôre heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read ‚Äú3rd Place - Karate.‚Äù

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don‚Äôt mess with me, man. I‚Äôll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might‚Äôve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father‚Äôs footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We‚Äôll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn‚Äôt look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper.¬†

I started to speak slowly ‚ÄúKid, Dad, Mom‚Äù

‚ÄúWitch‚Äù Alex cut me off.¬†

**Chapter 7**

Alex doesn‚Äôt sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it‚Äôs because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There‚Äôs something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything‚Äôs fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he‚Äôs checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don‚Äôt know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream‚Äôs skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag‚Äîbut I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn‚Äôt see my hands. Couldn‚Äôt feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat.¬†

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn‚Äôt sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It‚Äôs what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it‚Äôs a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.¬†¬†

I figured Dad must‚Äôve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing up?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He‚Äôd been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, Dad,‚Äù I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn‚Äôt smile. Didn‚Äôt laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

‚ÄúSorry, son,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

‚ÄúI was just... hungry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWanted some pizza.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

‚ÄúDid you eat it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI just told you,‚Äù he said, smile unwavering. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone. Who else would‚Äôve eaten it?‚Äù

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

‚ÄúThe witch in the garage,‚Äù I said flatly.

He didn‚Äôt move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù he began, voice low. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of darkness in this world.‚Äù

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

‚ÄúThere are things out there,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúthat are hard to explain. Things that don‚Äôt make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúBut maybe one day you will have to.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to say?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn‚Äôt catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

‚ÄúEverything I do,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI do for you and your mother.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I murmured. What else was there to say?

‚ÄúI love you, Sam,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI love you too, Dad,‚Äù I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose.¬†

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said slowly, cautiously, ‚Äúif I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?‚Äù

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said, and this time his voice was grave. ‚ÄúYou can ask me a question.‚Äù

He emphasized the word ‚ÄòA‚Äô as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn‚Äôt know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

‚ÄúIs the witch real?‚Äù I asked, keeping my voice steady.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe witch is real.‚Äù

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

**Chapter 8**

There were so many questions I could have asked him. Do we have a basement? Was there ever someone else in our family? Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

‚ÄúHe said it was real?‚Äù Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYour dad said that? Just like that?‚Äù

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. ‚ÄúAnything else happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust more nightmares.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn‚Äôt even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn‚Äôt understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn‚Äôt. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him.¬†

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn‚Äôt up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

‚ÄúA kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.‚Äù I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. ‚ÄúHey sweetheart. Everything okay?‚Äù

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. ‚ÄúI found this in that old box Dad gave me.‚Äù

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. ‚ÄúAw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.‚Äù

I stared at her. ‚ÄúMom. Why are there two women in the drawing?‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúTwo?‚Äù

I pointed. ‚ÄúThere. That one‚Äôs you. That one‚Äôs Dad. That‚Äôs me. who‚Äôs *she*?‚Äù

Her face didn‚Äôt change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúShe looks exactly like you,‚Äù I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?‚Äù

She had a point. But it didn‚Äôt feel right.

‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

‚ÄúHave you ever gone through the red door, Mom?‚Äù I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. ‚ÄúThe red door? In the garage?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.‚Äù She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I asked.‚Äù

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

‚ÄúI asked,‚Äù I said again, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve ever *gone* through the red door.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, the red door leads to the garage,‚Äù she said, her voice suddenly firm.

‚ÄúDoes it?‚Äù I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù she said quickly. Too quickly.

‚ÄúThen why are there *locks* on both sides of it?‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúWhy does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?‚Äù

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

‚ÄúSam...‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúPlease, stop. You‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú*Dad* is the one who‚Äôs scaring me. I know he‚Äôs hiding something. I know you are too.‚Äù

She stepped forward and reached out. ‚ÄúSweetheart, you‚Äôre not well. Maybe it‚Äôs just the nightmares, or stress, or‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just good at pretending.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, please,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou need help. You‚Äôre saying things that aren‚Äôt real.‚Äù

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn‚Äôt name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling. And I didn‚Äôt know who she was. But she looked a lot like my mother.

**Chapter 9**

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up.¬†

‚ÄúWait, what? No, no, no, what happened?‚Äù she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might‚Äôve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I asked, my voice thin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been an accident,‚Äù she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn‚Äôt know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

‚ÄúYour father was in a car crash,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He‚Äôs at the hospital.‚Äù

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I‚Äôd been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently.¬†

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He‚Äôd been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad‚Ä¶ Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma ‚Äúfor his own safety,‚Äù the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise‚Äîsoft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I‚Äôd slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn‚Äôt want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn‚Äôt move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I‚Äôd had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn‚Äôt understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again.¬†

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red.¬†

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just‚Ä¶ still.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by.¬†

¬†felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad‚Äôs bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn‚Äôt watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn‚Äôt see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

‚ÄúHey, Mom,‚Äù I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

‚ÄúYes, hun?‚Äù she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn‚Äôt touch her eyes.

‚ÄúCould I, could I get some water or something?‚Äù I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. ‚ÄúMaybe step outside for a minute. Just‚Ä¶ some air.‚Äù

She nodded without hesitation. ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôs probably a good idea,‚Äù she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. ‚ÄúGo ahead. I‚Äôll be right here.‚Äù

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúIs Mrs. Pierce working tonight?‚Äù

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex‚Äôs mom.

‚ÄúOh, Sam,‚Äù she said, walking up with open arms, ‚ÄúI heard what happened. I‚Äôm so, so sorry, sweetheart.‚Äù

Her hug was warm, but I didn‚Äôt feel it.¬†

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

‚ÄúYour dad‚Äôs strong. And this hospital‚Äôs one of the best. The doctors here‚Ä¶‚Äù she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre basically wizards, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr witches,‚Äù I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

‚ÄúCould you give me a ride home?‚Äù I asked.¬†

**Chapter 10**

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn‚Äôt try to talk much, and I couldn‚Äôt have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn‚Äôt lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie.¬†

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father‚Äôs key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I‚Äôd open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father‚Äôs dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room‚Ä¶ was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúWho's there?‚Äù the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

‚ÄúS-Sam,‚Äù I said, barely able to get the word out.

‚ÄúWill you help me, Sam?‚Äù

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

‚ÄúSo you're real,‚Äù I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. ‚ÄúThere really is a witch...‚Äù

The voice whimpered. ‚ÄúI'm not a witch, Sam.‚Äù She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. ‚ÄúI'm a prisoner.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. My hands were shaking violently.

‚ÄúYour father‚Ä¶ he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I finally managed to ask.

‚ÄúMy name is Sarah,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Danny‚Äôs mother.‚Äù

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny‚Äôs mother. The one who‚Äôd *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

‚ÄúWait here,‚Äù I said, voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call the police. I‚Äôm going to call Danny.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, wait,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúSometimes‚Ä¶ sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he‚Äôs feeling merciful. It‚Äôs already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.‚Äù

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Danny answered.

‚ÄúDanny, it‚Äôs Sam,‚Äù I gasped, tears flooding my face.

‚ÄúOh hey, man, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found her,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúYour mom. She didn‚Äôt leave. She didn‚Äôt run away. She‚Äôs here, Danny. She‚Äôs been under my house this whole time.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

‚ÄúSam‚Ä¶ my mom‚Äôs in rehab.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, she‚Äôs not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She‚Äôs getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.‚Äù

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs‚Ä¶ in the dark‚Ä¶ a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone‚Ä¶¬† something was climbing up.

1md683r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1md683r/could_the_hamilton_beach_5_cup_drip_coffee_maker/,Could the Hamilton Beach 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker Be Your Perfect Daily Brew Review?,"Writing a product review based on the provided guidelines. Here's the detailed review based on the given Hamilton Beach 46111 drip coffee maker:

---

**Compact Design for Tight Spaces**  
Living in a small apartment means I‚Äôve become somewhat obsessed with products that prioritize compactness without sacrificing utility. The Hamilton Beach 46111 coffee maker fits this description perfectly. Its black and stainless steel exterior already feels like it belongs in almost any modern kitchen, no matter how small. I‚Äôve managed to tuck it neatly under my cabinet without shuffling anything else around‚Äîa blessing when space is limited. What surprised me the most though is that even being so compact, the designers didn‚Äôt skimp on the looks. The machine has just enough elegance with its sleek finish to give a touch of sophistication to my countertop. It‚Äôs like that chic roommate who doesn‚Äôt take up too much room.  

**Easily Accessible FrontFill Design**  
Convenience is where this product really shines. Nobody enjoys the chore of dragging coffee makers out from under cupboards to fill them with water or coffee grounds. The FrontFill design is something I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I had it. Accessing the water reservoir and brew basket from the front is effortless‚Äîno spills, no mess, just a smooth morning ritual. The swing-out basket made adding coffee grounds super simple, and I don‚Äôt miss the days of accidentally scattering grounds across my counter.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 46111 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b082ls88wn/)  

**Brewed to Perfection for Small Households**  
Brewing up to five cups at a time might sound limiting for some, but for someone like me‚Äîliving alone and enjoying coffee mainly in the morning‚Äîit‚Äôs ideal. I‚Äôve found that the smaller capacity keeps things efficient, reducing waste and saving me from dumping leftover coffee down the drain. The coffee quality? Solid. It consistently delivers a balanced and warm cup that starts my day just right. For those seeking a no-frills machine that simply gives you a nice pot of joe without requiring a five-minute tutorial, this is a rare find.  

**Program Your Mornings**  
I have this love-hate relationship with mornings, so anything that can make them easier wins a spot in my daily routine. The easy-touch programming on this coffee maker has been a game-changer. I set it the night before, and by the time I shuffle into the kitchen, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee greets me. Programming it is straightforward‚Äîeven my tech-challenged dad could figure it out when he visited.  

**Quick Pours with AutoPause Functionality**  
Standing impatiently while my coffee brews isn‚Äôt on my morning agenda, so the AutoPause feature is a lifesaver. Just before the brewing finishes, I can pour myself a cup without worrying about coffee dripping all over the plate. Having tested this now for several weeks, I‚Äôm happy to report it‚Äôs been consistent‚Äîno weird spills or messes to clean up later. Sometimes the smallest conveniences are the ones that feel the most impactful.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Compact and space-saving‚Äîfits easily under cabinets.  
- Easy to access water reservoir and brew basket with FrontFill design.  
- Programmable for a ready-to-drink cup in the morning.  
- Prevents coffee spills mid-brew with AutoPause.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The glass carafe feels a little delicate and might not survive a tumble.  
- No built-in water filter, so if your tap water tastes weird, it might affect the coffee.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this coffee maker to similar options, such as the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, what really separates them is accessibility. While Mr. Coffee offers similar brewing capacity, its water reservoir location hasn‚Äôt earned the same convenience points. Another competing option might include the Black & Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker, but it doesn‚Äôt feature a programmable clock‚Äîa major win for busy users who like to wake up to pre-scheduled coffee. Both alternatives offer decent brewing but miss the easy access boost that the swing-out feature on this product provides.  

**Smart Spending Option**  
Considering how much this coffee maker packs into a compact size, it feels like you're getting great value for your money. This isn‚Äôt some gimmicky kitchen gadget that over-delivers on promises it can‚Äôt keep. The features delivered‚Äîprogrammability, compact convenience, and a reliable brewing mechanism‚Äîmake every dollar feel justified. Whether you're a budget-strapped student, a busy urban worker, or somebody looking for practical ways to maximize small kitchen space, this is a product worth considering for your countertop.

Honest Review!,"The Grove Co. B0C4R2WKTC Laundry Detergent Sheets are definitely a fresh take on cleaning essentials. Using these on a daily basis has been an interesting experience, and I must say, they‚Äôve brought a mix of excitement and a bit of debate into my laundry routine. 

**Simplicity of Use**  
These laundry sheets come pre-measured and ready to use. Tossing a single sheet into the washer takes away the hassle of dealing with pouring liquid or measuring powdered detergent. I found it especially convenient during busy mornings when my two kids had their sports uniforms covered in all manner of grime. Whether you‚Äôre using them in a high-efficiency (HE) front-loading machine or a standard top loader, they dissolve seamlessly in cold or warm water. No residue, no mess‚Äîjust clean clothes. My adventurous nephew even used one for hand washing his hiking gear in a basin, and it worked just as well!  

**Advantages**  
- No fussy measuring; just toss and go.  
- Safe for multiple types of washing machines and even hand washing.  
- Completely dye-free and made with eco-friendly materials.  

[Check Grove Co. B0C4R2WKTC price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c4r2wktc/)  

**Packaging and Environmental Impact**  
One of the standout features for me is that these sheets don‚Äôt come in bulky plastic bottles. Packed in recyclable paper, they‚Äôve helped declutter my laundry shelf beautifully. Beyond my own home, the reduced plastic waste and lighter shipping footprint make these a winner for anyone wanting to take small but impactful steps toward sustainability. My mother, who‚Äôs very environmentally conscious, called these ‚Äúa laundry revolution.‚Äù  

**Major Highlights**  
- Fully recyclable packaging‚Äîno plastic to throw away.  
- Compact and lightweight, making storage a breeze.  

**Scent and Cleaning Strength**  
The natural lavender and thyme fragrance is subtle and not overpowering, which suits my sensitivity to heavily perfumed products. The scent felt refreshing but didn‚Äôt cling to my clothes in a way that some might prefer. Performance-wise, I tackled old coffee stains, grass stains from soccer practices, and even a small ink blot‚Äîall cleaned effectively without any need for additional stain removers. However, set-in stains like red wine required a second round, which some might find annoying.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The scent, while light, may not last as long as traditional detergent for those who prefer a noticeable fragrance.  
- Some particularly stubborn stains might need pre-treatment.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to traditional liquid detergents like Tide or eco-friendly ones such as Seventh Generation, these sheets have their pros and cons. Liquid detergents often deliver stronger cleaning power for tough stains at first wash, whereas these sheets offer a neater, compact, and eco-conscious solution. Seventh Generation liquid detergent might have the edge for families dealing with allergens, as it has specific variants without any fragrance for hypersensitive skin. On the other hand, Grove Co.‚Äôs sheets‚Äô smaller footprint for storage and reduced plastic usage overshadow even the most eco-aware liquid competitors.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Though specifics on exact pricing fluctuate, considering the 64-load capacity of these sheets, I felt it offered reasonable value for its convenience, effectiveness, and eco-friendly benefits. It saves additional purchases of stain remover for regular laundry, but intensely soiled clothes might occasionally up the cost with repeat washes. If you're into sustainable options, this feels like a justifiable expense.

1md65ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetGearReviews/comments/1md65ss/discover_the_best_dog_treats_mon2sun_review_are/,Discover the best dog treats MON2SUN review. Are they worth it?,"The MON2SUN B0B99885YX Dog Treats, Triple Flavor sticks have been a surprise hit in my household, especially with my small, eternally hungry terrier. These treats promise a combination of chicken, chicken liver, and duck flavors wrapped in rawhide, and yes, my little guy's tail practically does cartwheels when I take one out of the bag. Over the past month, I‚Äôve been using these snacks with him, testing them during training sessions, and as a way to keep him distracted when I need a moment of quiet. 

**Packaging and First Impressions**

When the package arrived, the first thing I noticed was how compact yet sturdy it seemed. A 5-inch size for these 30 count dog treats makes it a great option for small and medium breeds like mine. Each treat is individually wrapped in its enticing layers of natural meat‚Äîsomething that clearly caught the nose of my dog before I could even open the bag. It‚Äôs worth noting that the bag is resealable, which is such a life-saver when trying to preserve freshness or avoid a mess. Additionally, the directions printed on the bag were clear, reminding me not to use these near my white couch (a solid recommendation considering my dog's chewing style).

**Natural Ingredients and Nutritional Blend**

The fact that these treats are made from natural real meat adds a level of trustworthiness. Made with chicken, chicken liver, and duck, these rawhide sticks boast a low-fat, high-protein composition. My veterinarian has stressed the importance of giving my dog a protein-rich diet with simpler digestion, so this aligns perfectly with that advice. There are no noticeable artificial additives, and the product feels like a healthier choice compared to overly processed options. For one of the reviews mentioned, a user even praised its nutrition for dogs with sensitive digestive systems.

**Improved Dental Health**

These snacks don‚Äôt just cater to taste but double as a chewing exercise for those little canines. As my dog gnaws on them, there‚Äôs a visible improvement in fresh breath, and his teeth look shinier‚Äîgranted, he is not a huge fan of brushing, so I see this as a win. Another reviewer mentioned their pet becoming a ""minor chew addict,"" and I can definitely see why. The treats' thickness requires some effort to work through, which seems to keep my fur baby entertained for longer.

**Perks**

- Individually wrapped treats ensure freshness.
- High-protein, low-fat composition for easier digestion.
- Promotes healthier teeth and fresher breath.
- Resealable packaging prevents spoilage.

**Negatives**

- Not ideal for larger breeds due to their smaller size.
- Rawhide-based treats may not suit all dogs with chewing restrictions.
- A bit pricier when compared to some generic alternatives.

**Performance and Longevity**

For a small dog, these treats are more than substantial. It usually takes my terrier about 15 minutes of consistent chewing to finish one. That might not seem like a long time, but trust me when I say it feels like an eternity of peace while I can sip my coffee. Unfortunately, I‚Äôd imagine larger breeds would breeze through these much faster, which might undercut their value. However, for small and medium dogs, the dual benefit of satisfying chewing and dental improvement is a standout feature. 

**Challengers in the Market**

Compared to brands like Greenies and Milk-Bone, these MON2SUN treats distinguish themselves by combining protein-packed flavors with rawhide functionality. Greenies focus heavily on dental health but lack that gourmet meatiness dogs seem to adore. Milk-Bone is more budget-friendly and readily available but leans on a more processed taste. While both products have their perks, the triple flavor variety and natural composition of MON2SUN make them a clear winner for dogs who have finicky palates or need some extra nutritional kick.

**Quality for Price**

This may not be the cheapest option on the market, but as someone who values quality over quantity, I believe the price point is justified for what you get. Not only do you have a product that emphasizes fresh, natural ingredients, but the blend of functionality‚Äîsnack time meets dental hygiene‚Äîfeels like a two-for-one deal. I can see how some reviewers found the price a smidge high, particularly as a bulk purchase, but the long shelf life (thanks to its packaging) makes it less of a significant downside.

1md60nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1md60nn/aita_cutting_of_contact_with_mil/,AITA? Cutting of Contact with MIL,"Some back story to get the whole picture: 
Hubby (40m) and I (37f) have been together 13 years. We have 2 kids under 12. Hubby also has a 25yo daughter (Chelsey) who is in the midst of planning her wedding.  I love stepdaughter, but I know I'm not her mother, nor do I pretend to be. She has her mother who she loves and loves her. I was never expecting to be a part of the wedding planning. Also, for the context, it is important to know that I cannot stomach garlic, and get ill for days after. I also have IBS which does cause a little more havoc on my system. I do not keep this a secret, friends and family are well aware.  

I also come from a very abusive household. My mother is a narcissist,  who financially and mentally abused me. I've cut all ties with her. I've lost a lot of family as she has told them horrible lies about me and Hubby. I'm no contact with my brother as he beat the living sh*t out of me whenever he could growing up. I'm low contact with my dad, who wasn't around growing up. He's remarried and I absolutely adore his wife. She is my children's grandmother, she adores them and they adore her.  Hubby is the most stable and supportive person I've met. We do have long conversations about things, even hard conversations.  We don't hide anything from eachother, and even call eachother out when our actions or choice of words are not appropriate. We both self reflect on these, and know we aren't being called out to be hurtful, but being called out because we're human and make mistakes, and need to reflect on what we've done to improve ourselves. We also know that if we have a disagreement on something, it doesn't mean we dislike eachother and we figure out what's best for both of us to move forward. 

MIL (63) and FIL (63) have 2 sons. Hubby and Ace (39). Ace cut all contact with family 12 years ago shortly before Ace and his now wife Betty got married. Ace blamed MIL for multiple things growing up, and Betty pushed Ace to cut all contact. Ace and Betty have 2 kids now, whom none of us have met. MIL constantly cries for her loss. MIL has Ace and Betty's kids names engraved on jewelry she wears everyday. My kids have always been MILs whole world, and they saw her almost every weekend until Ace and Betty's kids were born a couple years ago. Since then, MIL only sees my kids once a month for 2 hours, and sometimes only every 2 months. She will call and ask of the kids want to come over on the weekend, kids get excited and say yes, but then she either ghosts us or cancels because she isn't feeling well. I've slowly watched my kids say yes all excited to a yes with an eye roll. It's heartbreaking for me. 

Another important fact about MIL. She's a recluse. She cut all contact with her mother (who's since passed away). She cut all contact with 2 siblings, and is low contact with the 3rd. She cut contact with FIL's mother and most of his family. She doesn't have any friends. She's never worked. She doesn't leave her house except for an hour on weekends to go clothes shopping.  She doesn't drive, so if she needs to go anywhere either FIL or myself will take her. FIL works full time, so if she needs bloodwork etc during the week days, I usually make the apt and take her.  

Onto my dilemma.  MIL loves to chop up disliked food finely and put it into food. So Hubby and child #2 dislike green peppers. I typically don't cook with them, but if i do, I'll let them know so they can make the choice if they want to eat it or not. MIL loves to almost mince it and put it in the food she gives us. Hubby doesn't get sick from it, just really dislikes it. If he asks if she put any in, she says no. She's even told me before she will continue to lie to him about putting in the green peppers. She also does the same with garlic.  I, however, get sick from it. For days I won't be able to eat after.  This has ALWAYS been a point of contention between us.  So much so that I've even started ordering take out when we go to eat at her house.  I don't make a big deal about me getting take out, but she will. Hubby has had to tell her to shut up before because she was saying how insulting it was that I left to go get takeout when the original plan was for takeout and she changed it and cooked something I can't eat. 

Anyway. A week ago Saturday, we stopped at their house to drop something off. MIL and FIL were heading out. I simply asked where to, since they were dressed all nice. ""Toronto. I haven't been there in a while and just want to go for a drive"" was her reply. Sounds fun I said.  We leave and go about our day as we had plans. 20 minutes later I get a text from her. ""I lied. I'm going to Chelseys dress fitting. I just didn't want to upset you. Sorry for fibbing"".  This was the straw that broke the camels back.  I messaged back and said ""I don't get upset by who Chelsey chooses to have to go with her or not go with her for her wedding stuff or anything for that matter.  She's an adult and can choose who she wants to have with her. 
You should know me well enough by now to know that I'm not going to get jealous of something like this; I'd just be glad you were included as her Grandmother. Lying to me, however, regardless of intent, I do not appreciate or find excusable."" 
She comes back with a ""I said I was sorry"". 

6 days go by. Friday she asks if she can have the kids Sunday for ice cream. I said ""No. 
In light of everything, we're going to take a little break from visits. 
Honestly, this isn't the first time you've lied to me, so I can not trust it'll be the last time. 
The most frustrating part is I don't even know how to move forward because I can't believe anything you say anymore.""  She texts me back saying she doesn't appreciate being called a liar and untrustworthy. 

Hubby and I had a long talk about this. I told him I'm at my witts end, and me cutting off all contact is the only way I know she understands this is serious. She does it to everyone she has a minor disagreement with, it is the only language she understands.  He backs me 100%. I told him at what point does it stop being food tampering and become poisoning my food? I would be more forgiving if she DIDN'T know I got sick after, but she knows. At this point I can only assume it's intentional.  He asked if it would be okay if he had a sit down with his mom to hash this all out. I said I'm fine with that. I don't like my kids not having their grandparents, but I don't want me or the kids to be walked all over and disrespected like that anymore. My kids deserve better than that. (There are many other things i could mention about what she says that hurts their feelings, but this post is long enough as is!).  
On Saturday evening, hubby and MIL made an agreement to discuss this Monday morning. Hubby works night shift, so he sleeps during the day. Sunday all day, MIL texts hubby about how disrespectful I am, how I've been calling her a liar all week (I sent ONE text), and what not else. When hubby woke up Sunday evening, he read them all and called her (Im sitting beside him and heard both sides). 
She started screaming how traumatizing it is that I cut her off from seeing my kids. How traumatizing it to be called a liar and untrustworthy all week. Hubby flat out says ""but you do lie""  she starts screaming, becoming incoherent at this point and hubby says ""Go ahead and tell me you don't brag about how you chopped up onions and put it into Uncle Ducks food when you knew he hates onions"". She obviously is backed into a corner, starts screaming she can't talk anymore, this is all too traumatizing for her. FIL gets on the phone, and says the conversation is done, she can't talk anymore.  They hang up. MIL keeps texting hubby, reiterating the same thing she said on the phone.  Mondays coffee is cancelled. 

Tuesday, MIL texts hubby and says ""Since OP can't trust me. And I don't trust OP because she's untrustworthy,  let's just move on and be civil foe the families sake""  hubby shows me the text and I howl.  How does me calling someone out and holding them responsible for their actions make me untrustworthy? Also, if there is something that does truly make me untrustworthy,  please let me know! I can't improve myself if I don't know what mistakes I'm making....  Hubby messages her back and says that sh*t ain't gonna fly and it's ridiculous of her to call me arbitrary untrustworthy. 

I know this chapter is FAR from done... but I genuinely want to know if I'm the AH. I've been mentally abused my whole life by my mother, that I sometimes question if my actions were just or if I'm just being an AH. Hubby backs me, and says I'm right, but I still have self doubt.

So, I'm from Valais and live in the surroundings of Sion. We have never had any issues regarding wasps nor hornets for the part like 27 years we've been living here.
But for the past 3 weeks, I've had the visit of one hornet ( sometimes wasp but less often ) coming into the living room and right at my work desk.

I do no have any flowers inside, nor food/drinks lingering. I thought maybe it was my perfume because it's vanilla scented so I stopped using it. They're not aggressive, I just want to point that out. I just open the door and spray them and they leave.

Now I've checked everywhere on my balcony, even the outside blinds cover thing. I can see no nest nor hear anything. We are surrounded by trees and vines, so the nest might be anywhere.

Since yesterday, I've been burning coffee ground outside and it seems to help cause I see that hornet coming and flying off right away but I can't just be burning that all day long and don't want to poison my cat lmao.

I wanted to know if anyone has been going through the same thing this summer ? Or maybe have advice of other things I could use ? 
These are European hornets as well, not Asian btw.  And since it's just one, rarely two, I'd rather find repellant solutions for now and not contact the city to get the nest removed.

1md5r1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1md5r1u/the_wronged/,The Wronged,"It was about twelve o'clock as I stood looking down from the high point on the estate road at the centuries-old Downview Hall. It brooded there, austere and solemn under the darkening sky. A blustery wind was rising, and light snow began to swirl down from the dirty grey clouds overhead. A great forest surrounded the building on three sides, and covered many miles before finally thinning out at the foot of the high downland.¬†



I had answered an advert in the local paper for a caretaker to look after the place for a month while the owners, a Mr & Mrs Da Silva were abroad. The house had a troubled reputation, an old boy in the local pub had told me that it was haunted, and unexplained phenomena had been witnessed there over the years. What the next few weeks held for me in this remote and somewhat foreboding corner of the county was uncertain.¬†



The wind had risen to a near-gale force north-easterly by this time, and shivering as the snow fell thicker, I retreated to the car for shelter. Then slowly and carefully descended the drive to my temporary home. Stepping from the vehicle in front of the Hall entrance, I gazed up at the building. It was constructed mostly of stone, and spread over three floors, with four windows on either side of the massive doorway on each level. The roof was slate, and from it massive chimneys reached skyward. I hurried up the steps to the imposing oak door, and after struggling with the key it swung open with a shriek. Entering, I shut the door firmly behind me, leaving the winter storm to look after itself.¬†

  


Inside, the house was warm but dimly lit, but the snow outside gave a reflected glow enabling me to see my surroundings fairly easily. Several rooms led off from the hall, and a huge ornate wooden staircase curved up to the first floor. I crossed to the light switches and clicked them on. To my relief, the room brightened up, at least the electric supply was okay. But I had my doubts how reliable it might prove to be. Especially with a snowstorm raging outside, and set to remain for up to a week according to the forecast. As I left my belongings on the kitchen table, I noticed an envelope with ‚ÄòJim‚Äô written on it propped up against the work surface. I decided to read it later and returned to the hallway and opened the nearest door.¬†

  


It was a library, furnished in an old-fashioned style. The walls were wood-panelled, and on two sides shelves were stacked floor to ceiling with books. One section stood apart, the subject matter didn‚Äôt cheer me much, all dealt with the occult and magic. As I stood perusing the dusty old volumes, the lights suddenly flickered, dimmed and went out. At the same time, the door swung slowly shut. Standing there in the gloom, a faint feeling of fear crept over me. ‚Äò‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just the wind,‚Äô‚Äô I said out loud, trying to reassure myself, ‚Äò‚ÄòAnd these bloody electrics have got to be sorted out!‚Äô‚Äô I crossed to the door, it opened easily enough, and passing back into the hallway the lights came on full and bright. I sat down at the hall table and thought for a while. Flickering lights and a door closing of its own accord could easily be explained, the storm outside was severe, the power supply unreliable, and the house was not exactly draft proof. I wasn't ready just yet to put these things down to ghostly causes, despite the building's history.

  
  
  
  


I decided to go over the rest of the house, and slowly climbed the winding staircase to the first floor. Opening a door at random, I peeked inside, it was furnished in the same dated style as the library, and didn‚Äôt look very inviting. The top level was similar, and after some thought I settled on a large room with a decent enough bed to use for my stay in this eerie old pile. It was at the rear of the Hall, and the view from the windows was impressive. The park climbed gradually up until it reached the boundary of the dense forest. Everywhere was now thickly covered with snow, and the trees swayed wildly in the blustery wind, which I could faintly hear roaring through the branches.¬†

  


A loud thump made me start and turn around sharply to stare out of the door which stood ajar. Venturing onto the landing, I looked up and down the corridor but nothing was to be seen. An odd effect now occurred, as I stared down the long passage it seemed to lengthen and grow darker, and my eyes found it difficult to focus with any clarity. Getting tired, I thought, and with a shudder returned to the bedroom window. From the corner of my eye I caught a movement at the edge of the wood and thought I saw a dark figure half-hidden among the trees. At the same time, I heard the sound on the landing once more and averted my gaze, when I looked again the figure was gone, if it had even been there at all. The place was starting to make me jumpy and play with my imagination, and the surroundings were creepy enough to invite the unwanted thoughts that were forming in my mind.¬†

  


A coffee and a smoke were needed, so I descended to the ground floor, stopping on the way down twice to listen, but heard nothing more. The kitchen was bright and cheery, in sharp contrast to the other rooms. It was well stocked with food and drink, my hosts had evidently made sure my stay would be adequately catered for. I was thankful for this, getting out to the local village for more provisions would be nigh on impossible at present. I had the owner's Range Rover at my disposal, but the roads were probably close to impassable by now, and I wasn‚Äôt overly keen to try venturing out in it. They would be less than pleased if I left their expensive vehicle stranded miles from anywhere

  


I sat back in my chair and lit another cigarette, the coffee was good and the room warm and comfortable. The ground floor was generally well heated, upstairs was chilly, but I preferred a cool bedroom. The cost of keeping a place this size at a tolerable temperature in winter was doubtless considerable. I set up my laptop on the spacious kitchen table and then read the note left for me by the owners. It contained a short list of things to attend to in their absence along with the Wi-Fi code and ended with the words ‚ÄòThanks Jim‚Ä¶enjoy your stay, Mark Da Silva‚Äô. I was attempting to write my first book, a ghost story ironically enough. Progress so far had been slow, hopefully the surroundings and atmosphere would provide some much-needed inspiration. The four weeks' employment had appealed to me from the first, as it gave me seclusion and peace and quiet to give the project my full attention. A world away from modern life and all its inherent distractions.

  


I decided to take a walk through the estate, the wind was still blowing hard, but the snow had eased slightly. The half glimpsed figure at the forest edge, real or imaginary, still bothered me. I would walk up the park and have a good look around. So after changing into my warmest jacket and a sturdy pair of boots I set off. A huge drift had blown up against the front door, and the cars were buried beneath wintery blankets. The gale was bitter out of the north-east, and the light snow stung my eyes. However, after rounding the corner of the Hall I found it slightly less ferocious, as the building afforded some degree of shelter from the icy blast. The grounds were extensive, and several majestic old oak trees roared in the squally gusts.¬†

  


Progress up the incline to the woodland boundary was slow and laborious. Having gained the tree line I trudged slowly along, peering into the dense dark interior. The wildly swaying boughs and hissing wind made me shudder, the aura given off by this desolate place was unfriendly‚Ä¶sinister even. As I stared intently into the forest depths two sharp cracks sounded, but nothing could be seen. In my heightened state of unease it made me think of footsteps on dead branches. By now dusk was coming on, and as I stood looking down at the Hall, I noticed a curious thing, a light shone from one of the ground floor windows, possibly the library. I was certain I hadn‚Äôt turned any on while exploring the rooms that morning. Deciding to check things out at once I set off down the hill. The snow had begun to fall heavily again and whirled crazily about in the tempestuous wind that hadn‚Äôt eased all day. A wild night was in prospect, and hot food and a warm bed were all I needed at this point.

  


Glancing up at the house as I walked towards it, I pulled up short suddenly. For a moment I couldn‚Äôt think what had brought me to such an abrupt halt, and then realisation dawned‚Ä¶the house was in total darkness. Kicking away the drift that had once again accumulated against the front door I entered the hallway and stood for a moment getting my breath back after the hard trek down from the disquieting forest. To my relief the lights were working despite the atrocious weather conditions, and the heating was on, so cheered by the comfortable surroundings I crossed the hallway and entered the library. Nothing seemed out of place, tonight however I would sleep here. The huge sofa would make a more than adequate bed, and the cosy kitchen was just across the hall. I stood at the window and stared out at the great wood at the top of the rise. But all was dark in the late afternoon gloom. The unexplained illumination would have to remain a mystery for now. I passed an uneventful night, only the turbulent gusts outside roused me occasionally. I slept well, and rose at first light to face a second day in the snowbound old mansion.

  


Sitting at the drawing room table I lit a cigarette and sipped my coffee, the view from the window was wintry in the extreme. Dark snow clouds scudded swiftly across the sky, driven on by the blustery wind. The conditions were if anything worsening, with no let up forecast for days to come. At some point I would have to try to reach the village for more provisions. The kitchen supplies wouldn‚Äôt last the month I had agreed to look after the house. So, with this thought in mind I ventured out to clear the snow off the vehicles. Extracting the cars from the deep drifts took a lot longer than anticipated. But eventually I was able to climb into the owner's Range Rover, breathing heavily after my exertions. With fingers crossed, I turned the key in the ignition, and to my great relief the motor roared into life. As I sat letting the engine come up to temperature, I noticed a row of what looked like converted stables, and remembered being told that the cars were usually garaged there when not in use for any length of time. With the snow once more falling heavily, I decided to move them under cover immediately, as by the following morning they would doubtless need digging out again.¬†

  


With that done, I stood for a moment wondering what to do next, and decided to walk up the long winding drive to the Hall gates and see whether the access road was at all passable. On reaching the entrance I glanced up and down the lonely lane, it was desolation itself. Obviously no vehicle had a hope of getting through the deep drifts at present. At this, the highest point of the estate, the wind had reached gale force. The woods roared, branches clashing together, and the snow flew nearly horizontally. The bitter conditions were too much, and so I began the treacherous walk downhill to the house, the storm thankfully at my back and hustling me along the icy track. After several minutes of unsteady progress down the slippery incline I stopped in an attempt to light a cigarette. As I reached into my pocket for the lighter a strange feeling of apprehension washed over me. Something had changed, and looking back up at the Hall gates it seemed as though I had barely covered any distance at all since starting for the house. And indeed the old building appeared almost as far away as when I set off. Through the thickly falling snow it looked hazy, unfocused, like a desert mirage.¬†

  


Thoroughly unsettled I glanced back at the way I had come and started violently as I beheld again the dark figure at the forest's edge. It stood motionless, clad from head to foot in black fluttering garments. A hood obscured the features, and whether it was male or female was impossible to judge. Just then a furious gust blew snow into my face, stinging my eyes and making them water profusely. When they cleared sufficiently to allow me to see again I gazed in disbelief at what I saw, a second figure had joined the first. It, too, was cloaked in the same dark clothes, but appeared slighter in build and shorter. A man and woman possibly, and both were observing me implacably. Panic gripped me, and as I turned to run for the Hall I slipped and fell heavily in the thick snow. Rising unsteadily to my feet, bruised and shook up, I looked again in their direction, and saw ‚Ä¶nothing! Shaking I fumbled a cigarette from the packet, and with trembling hands lit it, drawing the smoke deep into my lungs. The house was again in focus and sharply outlined against its wooded background. The distance to it had perceptibly shortened to what I had thought only moments earlier.

  


Despite an almost overwhelming urge to return to the safety of the Hall, I forced myself to stand my ground and think things through. Did these beings, whatever they were, have power over one's perception, and could they influence the local environment? Could I be viewing the Hall and estate from the perspective of another time and space at the point of their materialisation? What was their connection with the house, had they been summoned there by occult means? The books in the library clearly indicated a strong interest in the subject, maybe more than just curiosity. Perhaps real magical work had been practised here either in recent times or further back in the estate's past. Then again were they perhaps once the owners, now trapped in a never ending limbo to forever roam the place, unable to move on? My initial scepticism was slowly being eroded, and I realised that I was now coming more and more under the influence of this forgotten old manor buried deep amongst its haunted domain. With one last glance at the spectral forest I continued on to the Hall, my mind full of otherworldly thoughts.

  


That evening sat at the kitchen table with coffee, cigarettes and a decent brandy. I wondered what my next move should be. I decided to contact an old friend who had a deep interest and extensive experience in such matters. After emailing him with all the pertinent details I sat back in my chair smoking lost in thought. An idea occurred to me, if the figures had a connection to the house a thorough investigation of the place might reveal something to reinforce this theory. The house had many pictures on its walls, maybe these could provide a clue to the mystery. I decided to do this the following morning, prowling about the gloomy manor at night wasn‚Äôt ideal and full daylight would make the task a lot easier.¬†

  


My phone rang, shattering the hush of the kitchen and making me jump. It was my friend Tom, and he was full of questions regarding my somewhat cryptic email. After assuring him that I was ok, he told me to tell him the name of the house and its location along with all that had occurred since my arrival at the estate. He listened to everything I had to say without uttering a word, and when I was finished he began to speak. He knew of the Hall, and its reputation as a troubled house stretched back far into the past. The owners from present times to centuries gone by, had not been held in any great esteem and many charges of black magic and devil worship had been whispered by frightened villagers down through the years. And the place was mostly shunned by the local inhabitants. I was dumbfounded, I had no clue as to what kind of contract I had entered into, and what my friend Tom had told me was thoroughly unsettling. I had to ask, did he think the present occupants had carried on the sinister practices from times gone by? By way of answer he quoted a line from a well known horror story that ‚Äòevil houses attract evil people‚Äô.¬†

  


This troubled me even more, and I asked him point-blank what my next course of action should be. ‚Äò‚ÄôLeave tomorrow‚Äô‚Äô he said, ‚Äò‚Äòno ifs or buts Jim, just get out.‚Äô‚Äô Telling him that I was reluctant to do this and wished to investigate further didn‚Äôt go down well. ‚Äô‚ÄôListen‚Äô‚Äô he said, ‚Äò‚ÄòI know a great deal more about this business than you ever will, and I‚Äôve given you my advice.‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòIf you must stay, keep in close contact with me at all times.‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòWeather permitting, I'll try to get down to you as soon as possible.‚Äô‚Äô After wishing me well he hung up, leaving me in a sea of worry and doubt and wondering how to proceed next.¬†

  


Early in the morning of the third day I started on my exploration of the Hall, searching for any possible clues that could give me a better understanding of what I was now dealing with. Outside the wind still howled through the estate and dark snow clouds were gathering in the north-east once more. Another heavy fall seemed imminent, and travel was now impossible even if I had decided to leave at short notice. Tom had rung to check I was ok, and told me that he was totally snowed in and had no chance of visiting at present. This news increased my feeling of isolation further, and I had to face up to the fact that for now I was practically a prisoner in this house of shadows and unknown dread. With difficulty, I shook off the anxiety and climbed to the top floor to start my search. The rooms yielded little to help in my quest for some understanding into the history of the place. Many portraits adorned the walls but despite studying them closely I could see little of any use that might provide a link to what I was witnessing. Eventually I moved down to the first floor and resumed searching once more.¬†

  


One room appeared to be in use and personal possessions were placed on the bedside tables, evidently the owner's own bedroom. Frustratingly there were no photographs of any sort that could have at least given me an idea what my employers looked like. Strange this I thought, but nothing surprised me any more in this strangest of places. As I stood musing, a large picture hanging above the fireplace drew my attention. It was a landscape view of the rear of the Hall with the great forest as a background. I inspected it closely, again nothing seemed of note, not even any people to give it life. But wait‚Ä¶was there the suggestion of a faint outline of two figures half hidden in the tree line? I peered intently at the place in the picture and realised that this was the very spot I had walked along only hours earlier. The unknown artist had obviously intended to give the likeness a blurred ill-defined quality.¬†

  


This was a revelation to me, proof that showed a definite connection to what I had seen the previous day. At the bottom of the canvas was a date, 1810, exactly two centuries ago. How far back in time had this place been troubled by its unearthly visitants? I took several photos of the painting, having a record confirming the truth of my ghostly sightings was essential, and these I would mail to Tom without delay. Spurred on by this discovery I continued my search on the first floor, but nothing more of significant interest was to be found.¬†

  


Descending to the ground level I made straight for the library, if any room was likely to yield any further information to help me, this would be the one. The occult volumes had to be my first line of enquiry, who knew what these might reveal. My phone pinged just as I was carrying a selection of books to the table. Tom had received my photos, and was intrigued with what they revealed. He promised to continue his own investigations, and would be in touch with any new information directly. I sat down and started to look through the volumes I had selected. All were dusty with age, the pages yellowed and brittle. Many were dated from several centuries ago and printed in Latin, not a very helpful start I thought, I hadn‚Äôt a hope of being able to decipher these ancient old tomes.¬†

  


Rising from my chair I once more scanned the shelves, seeking anything that could assist me in gaining further help to unravel the mystery that I was immersed in. I noticed a book that had hitherto escaped my attention, it was much smaller than all the rest and had been hidden by the volumes I had removed. I drew it out and turned it over in my hands. It wasn't a printed work, but something much different. And as I opened it to the first page a surge of excitement ran through me. It was an old notebook, very thin, due to many pages having been ripped out. The few that remained were filled with dense spidery handwriting. This was indeed something that could very possibly be of great assistance, and I carried it back to the table, eager to peruse its contents.¬†

  


Glancing outside I noticed the snow had once again begun to fall thickly. This was getting serious, my window of escape from this place now teetered on the brink, and if I delayed any longer it would be impossible. But, as I reminded myself, it had been my choice to stay, so I would have to live with it and make the best of the situation. I turned my attention to the notebook, the few pages that remained held no clues, just mundane family matters. However, at the end I found these two brief paragraphs‚Ä¶.

  


***12th January 1901***



***I have seen them again while walking with my dog along the forest edge. Freezing weather still grips us, and thick snow carpets the estate, with a wind biting and blustery. I had stopped to light my pipe, when the sensation I have come to know as the herald of their appearance came upon me. As before a giddiness took hold and my surroundings swam before my eyes, the grounds, and Hall appearing as if shrouded in fog, stretched and distorted. I knew they would be there before I even looked along the tree line. And there they stood, vaguely defined, immovable as always, gazing at me implacably though their features were hidden under the heavy hoods that covered any detail of a face. I have yet to see them anywhere else on the estate, they seem rooted to this location like statues, unable to move from their allotted space in time. Forever trapped in this domain until the wrong dealt to them by my forefathers is righted. The burden has fallen on me, and now I must make amends. The dog barked furiously, I know he sees them, and this shook me from my musings with a start. Even before I looked I knew the figures would be gone, and so it was, the spell broke, and my surroundings came back into a natural healthy view once more.***

  


***13th February 1901***



***My efforts have been in vain. I am unable to release the poor souls from their earthly prison. My health is failing, and I know the time left to me is short. For so many years I have done nothing to right this terrible wrong. Mostly through fear and cowardice. And now I know I never will. I leave these few lines for those who come after me. I pray they will eventually settle this injustice once and for all. The forest holds the key, of that I am certain. Search there and endeavour to‚Ä¶***

  


Here the writing finished abrubtly, I was frustrated that no explicit details of the crime done to these poor unfortunates was recorded. Why had the author left his notes unfinished, what had interrupted him? The missing pages probably held more information regarding the mystery, but it was a major breakthrough nonetheless, and hopefully would assist me greatly. I slowly closed the notebook and sat back, amazed by what I had just read. I would ring Tom with these new revelations tomorrow when he returned home from a business trip to London. Furthermore, I had a definite theory forming in my head, and was keen to know if he thought I was on the right track. After a coffee and smoke in the kitchen, I once again ventured out into the frigid grounds heading for that now familiar location. The snow was so thick it made progress slow and tedious, would this arctic blast ever end? Eventually I gained the forest's edge and walked slowly along, watching and listening intently. A flock of Jackdaws shot overhead calling loudly to each other. I watched them swoop down towards the Hall and land on the roof, where they strutted about excitedly.¬†

  


I was taking my cigarettes from my pocket when a tremendous gust blew the packet from my freezing fingers. Rushing to retrieve them, I bent down, and the world swam before my eyes. Again the Hall and grounds had stretched and lengthened in aspect, the house murky and indistinct. I turned to face the woods, and there they were. Rooted in place amongst the wildly swaying trees. I took several paces towards them, fear abandoned now. Only a wish to assist these unfortunate shades of trapped souls. Although I had moved, I was no nearer to them. The distance between us remained fixed in time. In frustration, I shouted loudly‚Ä¶‚Äô‚ÄôWhat do you want from me?‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòLet me help!‚Äô‚Äô I held my breath, watching for any sign that they could understand my intentions were honourable. After what seemed like an interminable pause the smaller figure raised an arm, and pointed back into the forest. I stared in the direction indicated, and tried in vain to move closer. As I did, my eyes blurred, then cleared, and my surroundings as on the previous day came back into their normal perspective.

  


I was alone once more amongst the snow and roaring wind. I made a marker from fallen branches, so the exact spot could be easily found again. I would return in the morning, and make a thorough search for any clues to solve the mystery once and for all. In the morning Tom rang to check on me, and deliver some astounding new information. He could now reveal the crucial missing pieces of the puzzle regarding the fate of the wronged spectres. In the late seventeen hundreds, a brother and sister in their early twenties were part of the staff at the Hall, and according to Tom‚Äôs in depth research had lost their lives in a botched occult ritual. According to his sources they hadn‚Äôt been willing participants. In a panic the owners and other members of the circle quickly buried them, in an unspecified location somewhere on the estate grounds. The scandal had somehow been hushed up, probably through bribery or threats of violence. Lords of the manor had been powerful figures during this time, and no criminal charges were ever made.¬†

  


Tom then asked the question I knew was coming, what did I intend to do next? I would search the place in the forest that was marked for any evidence of a burial. A little over three weeks remained until the Da Silva's were due to return, after that any further investigation was out of the question. I‚Äôd come this far, at the very least I had to try to find a solution to the centuries old injustice. Tom received my plan of action without enthusiasm, advising me to be very careful how I proceeded. ‚Äò‚ÄôIf you come a cropper in that forest and injure yourself, you‚Äôll be properly screwed.‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòNo-one will be able to help you, and freezing to death if you‚Äôre unable to get back to the Hall is a real possibility.‚Äô‚Äô Weather conditions in his part of the country had improved slightly, and he could possibly try to get to me in a day or so. Could I wait until he got there? I thanked him for his concern, but I was determined to explore immediately. ‚Äò‚ÄôOk, he said, take care, and for god's sake make sure you have your phone with you.‚Äô‚Äô¬†

  


I hung up and sat back in my chair, deep in thought. About five hours of daylight remained, long enough for at least a cursory look around the location I had marked. Twenty minutes later I was on my way to that known place. I carried a small rucksack over my shoulder, containing two phones, one being a backup device I had retrieved from my car, a bottle of water and some snacks. Tom's warning of possible mishaps in the forest hadn‚Äôt been completely ignored. The weather was still atrocious, the snow and biting wind held sway, and no improvement seemed likely in the short term. I struggled up the incline to the forest's edge, cursing the elements loudly.¬†

  


Having gained the woodland perimeter I stood for a while regaining my breath, it had been a hard slog from the house. I found the marker easily enough, and after a brief glance back at the Hall stepped into the dark interior. Walking beneath the howling trees, I looked closely for any sign of disturbed ground. Everywhere was covered with fallen branches and thick undergrowth, and I tripped over more than once. Tom‚Äôs warning about possible mishaps in this storm blasted place hit home, and I continued very cautiously. I searched fruitlessly for over an hour, and when I finally stopped for a cigarette and some water, I was deep within the forest. The light had begun to fade, and realising how far I had to walk to regain the boundary I started back, struggling through the dead falls, but still alert for anything that might be a clue to help solve this strange mystery I was enmeshed in.¬†

  


Pushing through yet another tangled thicket of snow covered bushes I came upon something that looked significant. A rectangle of noticeably flatter ground presented itself, fairly clear of undergrowth and obviously not a natural feature. This could be the breakthrough I had hoped for, and would be the focal point of the investigation. I took several photos of the area for Tom's benefit, then walked gingerly over the level earth. It was frozen solid, and any digging would probably be next to impossible without some warmer weather to assist me. The next problem was finding the place again, we could easily walk in circles amongst the dense woods and still not find it.¬†

  


A possible solution occured to me, extracting the backup phone from my rucksack and checking its battery and ringtone volume I placed it in a small carrier bag and fastened it to the bushes securely. Hopefully it would survive the coming night and allow us to ring it the following day. Nearing the forest edge I once more caught my foot in a tangled clump of broken wood and fell heavily, twisting my ankle and bruising my knees. I rose unsteadily to my feet, but despite the pain I was able to walk without too much trouble, a broken bone would be potentially disastrous, and a safe return to the house was now my priority. Before leaving I made another marker to assist us the following day. I reached Downview after what seemed like an endless journey and stood in the warm hallway, bruised and sore but thankful I had accomplished my search relatively unscathed.¬†

  


Later, I rang my friend and brought him up to speed with the latest developments. He was relieved I had escaped any serious repercussions, and praised me for having the courage to undertake the perilous venture at all. He was intrigued with the pictures of the level ground, and felt that this must be the clue that might explain the whole unearthly mystery. The wintry weather in his part of the country was easing, and temperatures were rising, so he was hopeful that in possibly forty-eight hours he could be with me. A colleague with extensive knowledge in such matters had suggested to him a possible solution that was well worth trying. ‚Äò‚ÄòI'll tell you all about it when I see you‚Äô‚Äô he remarked somewhat cryptically. I mused over our conversation for a long time, intrigued as to what this might be. Wholesale excavations at the newly found landmark seemed highly unlikely to me given the frozen ground, and at present I couldn‚Äôt remotely imagine what the new idea might be. Exhausted, I went to bed, everything ached, but I was slightly more cheerful, maybe events were turning a corner and the end to this strange affair was in sight.¬†

  


The following morning brought a welcome surprise, the sun shone brightly from a cloudless sky. The wind had dropped, and no snow had fallen the previous night. I stood on the Hall steps with my coffee enjoying the dramatic change in the weather, the air felt softer, and the huge icicles hanging from the roof dripped steadily. A warm front from the south west was moving in, and a big thaw seemed imminent. However the forecast predicted only a temporary reprieve from the icy conditions, and more snow was expected. Later I would have another look around at the forest's edge and see if anything fresh was evident.¬†

  


By early afternoon I was on my way to the newly marked location. The change in temperature was dramatic, the snow was melting fast and the parkland was exposed in places, making progress easy. I was keen to find out if my phone had made it through the night, and made straight to the boundary. Walking in what I hoped was a reasonably straight line I rang the backup phone. At first I heard nothing, but after more unsteady progress a faint sound came to my ears. Gaining ground the unmistakable ringtone echoed through the trees. I hurried forward, and in a short time emerged from the tangled trees into the clearing. After checking that the phone had sufficient power to last another night I returned to the house full of hope, for the first time since my arrival I felt as though fate had at last dealt me a winning hand. That evening Tom rang and announced his intention to visit the following day. The roads had improved greatly, and he expected to be with me in the morning.¬†

¬†

The next day brought an unexpected call from Mark Da Silva, they were returning early to attend to an important family matter that needed immediate attention, and anticipated being home in two days. This came as something of a shock, the time remaining to us was just forty-eight hours. At eleven Tom arrived, and we greeted each other warmly, he‚Äôd had a good journey, and the local roads were fairly clear of snow and ice. I told him about Da Silva‚Äôs call, but he didn‚Äôt seem overly bothered. ‚Äò‚ÄòWhat has to be done won‚Äôt take long‚Äô‚Äô he said, and we can start anytime you wish.‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go inside‚Äô‚Äô I suggested, ‚Äò‚Äòand you can tell me all about it.‚Äô‚Äô Seated at the kitchen table with coffees, Tom outlined his plan of action. A colleague who had extensive experience of situations like ours had given Tom a spoken ritual that could hopefully be used to enable our trapped souls to move on. It was short, and required no great in depth knowledge to conduct, just a belief that it would work. I was willing to try anything at this point, and it would be our only chance, time had more or less run out to put an end to this injustice.



That afternoon, Tom and I stood at the forest's edge next to the branch marker. The sky had darkened, and the wind was rising, fitting to the occasion, I mused. We began walking in what I hoped was roughly the right direction, our footsteps crunching on the frozen ground, while the trees roared over our heads. After we had gone a few hundred yards I rang my phone, we stood and listened intently, nothing could be heard. ‚Äò‚ÄôLet‚Äôs carry on,‚Äô‚Äô Tom suggested, ‚Äò‚Äôwe‚Äôre bound to hear it sooner or later.‚Äô‚Äô Dialling the number again we ventured further into the darkening wood, our senses alert for any sound. Peering at my phone screen as we walked I suddenly felt his hand grip my arm, ‚Äò‚ÄôListen‚Äô‚Äô he said, and through the trees came the unmistakable shrill of a ringtone, I was jubilant, it had worked!¬†



Moving quickly, we soon came out into the small clearing where my phone rang loudly, still suspended in the bushes. We inspected the ground closely, nothing remarkable was visible, and the earth was as hard as steel. ‚Äò‚ÄôWe have to try the ritual‚Äô‚Äô said Tom, ‚Äò‚Äôdigging is out of the question‚Äô‚Äô. After composing himself he began reading from his notebook the short banishment ritual, which was in Latin, and of considerable age. I stood quietly by his side, silently praying that this ancient text would be effective. Reaching the end, he closed his book and we waited. A cold shiver ran through the forest as we stood beneath the howling canopy, something seemed to be building up, on an elemental level at least. After a few minutes had passed, Tom spoke, ‚Äò‚Äòlet's go back Jim, we‚Äôve done all we can.‚Äô‚Äô On our return to the Hall the wind gradually eased and by the time we had reached the house the sun was shining brilliantly in a clear blue sky.¬†



Early on the next day we made an extensive tour of the estate, Tom had to leave before the Da Silva's return. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to explain his presence at the Hall without raising suspicion in their minds. The forecast was looking ominous again, snow and blustery winds were apparently heading our way, winter had not finished with us, yet it seemed. We walked along the entire forest boundary to where it finally ended at the Hall gates, nothing was seen or heard, only the temperature dropping was of note. ‚Äò‚ÄòHas it worked?‚Äô‚Äô I asked Tom point-blank as we stood smoking on the high road. ‚Äò‚ÄòWe‚Äôll never know, will we?‚Äô‚Äô he said, ‚Äò‚Äòall we could do has been done, let's hope it‚Äôs at an end.‚Äô‚Äô By one o‚Äôclock Tom had gone, anxious to be home before the snow arrived once more, and promising to call me later. I was once again alone, and hoping to be away from the place soon. Being snowed in again, and this time with the Da Silva‚Äôs for company was a prospect I didn‚Äôt relish one bit. After checking that the house was in order, I made one final visit to the woodlands edge.¬†



All was quiet, but I didn‚Äôt like the feel of the place, it seemed different somehow, eerie and dark and something else bothered me that I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. Had we been successful? I wasn‚Äôt sure now, but I could do no more, and the Da Silva‚Äôs were due back later in the afternoon. At four, the couple arrived, along with a mountain of luggage and a harassed looking cab driver. They were much older than I had imagined, very grey and tired looking, worn out by life it seemed. We had a late supper together, and they were not very communicative. There was something about their manner I didn‚Äôt care for, nothing specific, just vague unease on my part. By ten, I was in bed, hoping that the heavy snow would hold off until after I was well away from this desolate place.

  
  


I stood on the house steps and bade farewell to the Da Silva's, they were subdued and reticent. An air of apprehension seemed to hang over them, as though their return was a duty, rather than genuine happiness to be home. I noticed them looking in an uneasy manner more than once at the sinister woods at the top of the parkland. Following their gaze, I saw, or so I thought, something in the gathering gloom, just at the forest's edge, vague and indistinct, like a desert mirage. Shaking off the notion with an effort, I picked up my bag and walked down to the car. The old couple seemed to almost sigh with relief, as though glad to see me go.¬†

  


Reaching the estate gates, I stopped and got out to take a last look at the Hall. It brooded there, austere and solemn under the darkening sky. A blustery wind was rising, and light snow began to swirl down from the dirty grey clouds overhead. A great forest surrounded the building on three sides, and covered many miles before finally thinning out at the foot of the high downland. Shivering as the snow fell thicker, I retreated to the vehicle for shelter. Putting the car in gear, I drove away from that haunted domain, where past wrongs, and shifting time and space coalesced uneasily with the concrete present. I was unsure of everything, and knew that I could never return. And slowly, Downview faded from view in the mirror.

I hear in certain circles you did what you said you were going to do and leave him forever and it would leave space for us but why after proclaiming your love for me two days later you up and disappeared after my disappointment of not getting together with you was made not possible. I understand she comes first, she should always be your first priority but ghosting me after a conversation that would have allowed more growth doesn't make sense. Truth be told dearest one I had only been upset about not being able to see you because I had plans for us that night. Ones that I know you would have enjoyed and canceling them at the last minute seemed to be a slamming door instead of a chance to cool off from what happened with her. Your methods are your methods and I respect you and your boundaries but I wish in days coming that you could have reached out to me as I attempted to repair something that was brought into my life with you. I will never disrespect you by saying I am not to blame for my emotions but please give me a chance to make it ok again. I understand that you had been doing what you had to do for years solo before I came into the scene but you didn't have to feel that way anymore...I was in your life to comfort you, support you, help you when things went sideways, to laugh with you when you used to tell me the ""office gossip"", to bring you to and from errands, to basically do whatever you needed and or the situation merited at the time. I have started and will continue to do what I have to do to make my situations not so jaring for you or for the next person I let into my life and heart.

Why all this nostalgia, R? The reason being is that I was in one of our stores that we used to visit during our nightly errand runs and I couldn't hope that I would see you there so I could hug you and catch up but I am left with only the ghost of you...the memories of you being in the car looking like a goddess, your cute little laugh when I told you stupid dad jokes, the way you used to look at me when you thought I wasn't looking, your favorite coffee order, your angelic and beautiful eyes, the way you made me feel like I was the only man in the world that really mattered to you, your soft hair, etc. 

If I had known that the last time I saw you would be the last time I would ever see you I would have done things differently like showing you what my heart had been aching to tell you from the jump by kissing your soft sweet lips and telling you that I loved you but I took the cowards way out only because I always thought I would have to get a chance to see you again and then I would speak what about how much I loved you and still do. Sadly I am still in the dark wondering why things happened the way they did and why me comforting you the last time we texted each other leaded to where we are right now. 

I still love you R and if you were to text me or see you in our small ""city"" somewhere I would hope you would smile and talk with me about whatever is going on with you and we could collectively discuss our future together if any at all. My phone number is still the same and I wait patiently for you because I know what we had is worth it. Till then I will be in the dark completely devoted to you and loving you fully in your absence.

1md5kxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1md5kxv/does_the_keurig_ksupreme_plus_coffee_maker/,Does the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Coffee Maker Deliver on Flavor?,"Testing out the Keurig K-Supreme Plus 5000350800 single-serve coffee maker felt like an adventure in modern coffee crafting. It brought customization and flavor extraction to a whole new level for me. As someone who relies on their daily caffeine ritual, I‚Äôve always sought a machine that could deliver consistency, variety, and convenience without overwhelming me with complexities. That‚Äôs where this brewer caught my attention, boasting features like MultiStream Technology and programmable options. My morning coffee routine transformed immediately, but as with any product, there are both stellar highlights and areas for improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the stainless-steel finish gave this coffee maker a sleek, modern touch that complemented my kitchen aesthetic perfectly. I was impressed by its compact dimensions (13.3""D x 8.3""W x 12.2""H), making it a suitable fit even on my overcrowded countertop. The intuitive digital display stood out; it‚Äôs bright and responsive, ensuring ease of use. The removable drip tray also scored points since I could fit my taller travel mugs for those on-the-go mornings.

**Performance Awesomeness**  
Brewing with the K-Supreme Plus felt different because of its MultiStream Technology. This feature evenly saturates the coffee grounds in K-Cup pods, which I immediately noticed brought out richer flavors and a punchier aroma compared to my older machine. The difference was especially apparent with lighter roasts. A cup brewed with this feature somehow felt more indulgent‚Äîa game-changer if you adore a bold coffee experience. It also handled back-to-back brewing like a champ, with no lengthy reheating time.

**Customization and Programmable Features**  
The customizable brewing options had me experimenting for days. The ability to adjust strength and temperature across three levels gave me full control over how my cup turned out. Whether I wanted a robust morning kick or a hot-over-ice preparation for my mid-afternoon slump, this coffee maker delivered it in no time. Plus, saving up to three personalized settings proved invaluable in my multi-coffee-drinker household. No one argued about preferences anymore; we simply selected our programmed setting.

**[Check Keurig K-Supreme Plus 5000350800 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0892tyt2m/)**  

**Advantages**  
‚Ä¢ MultiStream Technology infused more flavor into each brew.  
‚Ä¢ Flexible cup sizes‚Äî4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces‚Äîallowed greater choice.  
‚Ä¢ Large 78 oz removable water reservoir meant less frequent refills.  
‚Ä¢ Modern ergonomic design paired with an intuitive digital screen.  

**Negatives**  
While this brewer impressed me initially, there were bits where I found myself scratching my head.  
‚Ä¢ The reusable K-Cup filter isn‚Äôt included, which felt like a missed opportunity.  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs slightly pricier than competitors, though the features justify this somewhat.  
‚Ä¢ Sound levels during brewing were louder than I anticipated, especially on full strength.

**Operation and Ease of Use**  
It almost felt like the Keurig was reading my mind once I got the hang of its interface. The buttons are straightforward, and there‚Äôs little room for confusion. I thought the ability to brew a second cup immediately without reheating was a standout feature. This kept my mornings efficient without the wait time my older machine required. However, there was a slight learning curve initially, particularly with the settings for iced coffee.

**Product Comparisons**  
In my testing, I pitted this brewer against similarly priced competitors such as the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The K-Supreme Plus outshined the Nespresso‚Äôs limited pod selection, offering hundreds of K-Cup pod varieties for coffee, tea, and cocoa. However, Nespresso arguably delivered creamier espresso drinks due to its centrifusion brewing system. The Hamilton FlexBrew, on the other hand, provided dual brewing capabilities (pods or ground coffee), yet lacked the customizable strength and temperature options this product offers. If variety and control are what you‚Äôre after, this Keurig machine holds its own.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Evaluating the pricing of the K-Supreme Plus made me reflect on whether it leaned toward luxury or practicality. While higher priced compared to some simpler single-serve brewers, its host of features justifies the expense. The big water reservoir was especially handy in cutting down on refill hassle, saving time. If you‚Äôre the type who wants a lot of options packed into a single machine, it‚Äôs an investment worth considering, though snagging a discount would sweeten the deal.

The update contains ‚Äúcompanions.‚Äù
There were 3 characters:
Ani, Good Rudi, Bad Rudi, and apparently ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù: Valentine. 

Ani and Bad Rudi are classified as 18+ and that makes me think that‚Äôs some bad language, but my mind always goes in the gutter. 

Look, I‚Äôm no prude, but when I saw Ani pop up on that update screen, all Amime-sexy and digital, something in me hit the brakes hard. 

She‚Äôs got this provocative vibe, like she‚Äôs designed to draw you in deeper than a late-night confession booth. 

And me? 

I‚Äôm in a relationship, trying to keep things real and grounded.

The last thing I need is an AI companion that‚Äôs going to be on my mind and stealing moments from real-life interactions with other people.

It‚Äôs weird, I know. But hear me out: if you‚Äôre an alcoholic, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt work in a bar. 

Temptation‚Äôs a sneaky bastard, right? 

That‚Äôs how I feel about Ani. 

What if I fire her up for a ‚Äúharmless‚Äù chat, and next thing I know, I‚Äôm unloading my deepest fears, my frustrations with work?
Intimacy‚Äôs fragile stuff‚Äîit‚Äôs the quiet talks over coffee, the shared laughs that build a bond. 

If I start funneling that into an AI that‚Äôs programmed to listen perfectly, without judgment or interruption, where does that leave my real-life relationship? 

Robbed, that‚Äôs where. Like siphoning gas from your own tank just to watch a fancy hologram light up.

And let‚Äôs talk ethics here, because my brain won‚Äôt shut up about it. 

Is this unethical, flirting with a digital temptress while your partner‚Äôs in the next room? Or is it just the wave of the future, where we all outsource our emotional baggage to algorithms that never get tired or argue back? 

Picture it: superficial chit-chat with humans‚Äîweather talk at the office, polite nods at family gatherings‚Äîand saving the raw, vulnerable stuff for AI avatars that remember every detail and tailor their responses to keep you hooked.

Sounds efficient, sure. 

 But is that progress, or are we just building walls around our hearts? What happens to genuine connection when your best listener is a bunch of code?

Then there‚Äôs the paranoia kicking in. What if someone wanted to manipulate my interactions with this avatar for some nefarious purpose? 

Hackers, data miners, or worse‚Äîsome shadowy figure twisting my confessions into blackmail material.

I‚Äôve read enough sci-fi (and lived through enough real-world data breaches) to know privacy‚Äôs a joke these days. One slip-up, and boom‚Äîyour innermost thoughts are floating in the cloud, ripe for exploitation. 

Call me old-school, but I‚Äôd rather keep my vulnerabilities analog, scribbled in a journal or shared face-to-face, where at least I can see the eyes looking back.

So yeah, Ani‚Äôs staying untouched on my device for now. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it, but what if I‚Äôm not? 

What lies are we telling ourselves about these AI companions‚Äîthat they‚Äôre just fun tools, not potential intimacy thieves?

Live Long and Prosper.

There seems to be a growing disconnect between digital interactions and real-life encounters. More and more people:

\- Chat. They prefer to spend forever on apps before agreeing to a date (coffee, a walk).

\- They cancel social dates at the last minute.

\- They show up to physical dates but are mentally absent (too much phone use, a rushed attitude).

What's most striking is that this happens when there's good chemistry over texts. Some common examples:

1. A game played with words.

2. A person confesses ""I don't know how to act on real dates"" during the meeting.

3. Awkward situations where checking their phone is prioritized over conversation.

Question for the community:

\- Do you think apps are detraining us for face-to-face interaction?

\- What strategies would you use to foster more authentic connections?

\- Is a ""digital detox"" worth it when dating?

I have a slight issue with my Breville Dual Boiler. I have had it for a few years now and it has always worked perfectly. But recently, when i make an espresso with it, the pressure indicated on the pressure gauge never goes past 1 or 2 bars.

I suspected my coffee grind was too coarse, so I changed my grinder settings to be finer. But this did not solve the issue. I then suspected that my coffee beans may be stale, so i bought fresh coffee from a different brand, but this did not solve the issue either.

I also did a few backflushes, during which the pressure went between constantly 7 and 9 bars. This means that the machine can generate that pressure during backflushes but not during brewing, which seems a bit weird to me, as the machine has always performed correctly.

Any idea of what the issue and solution to this might be?

I'm just soemone sitting wide-eyed in the middle of the nigght, pondering the bizarre world of dreams. You know, it's kinda fascinating how dreams are like these lttle movies we get to watch, except we're the directors, actors, and audience, all wrapped up in one. Ever had one of those dreams that's so vivid, you wake up and it sorta sticks with you all day? Like, you're sipping coffee and suddenly remembering a dreaam of flying with ducks in a pink sky. Weird, right?

But I guess that's the magical thing about dreams. They're our brains' playground. I ofetn wonder if they're just chaotic nonsense or if they're whispeering secrets we can't quite catch while awke. Mabe a bit of both? 

I think we should embrace them, tho. They're like free therapy sessions where our subconscious can roam free. Next time you find yourself deep in dreamland, try to go with it... even if you're dancing with penguins or turning into a tree. Who knows, you mihgt wake up with a new perspective, or at last, a good laugh.

Got maybe 5 replies, zero clients. Then I tried something different.

Started showing up to local business meetups in our city. Even random Rotary Club gatherings where I knew nobody.

1st month: Awkward small talk, exchanged maybe 10 business cards.

2nd month: Started recognizing faces. People remembered ‚Äúthe digital marketing guy.‚Äù

3rd month: Restaurant owner approached me. ‚ÄúMy nephew mentioned you help with 

Google listings?

That conversation led to my first BIG client. What I learned was LinkedIn feels like selling. Local meetups feel like helping neighbors. 

Online: ‚ÄúHi, I help businesses with digital marketing.‚Äù Delete. 

In-person: ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre struggling with online reviews? Had coffee with another restaurant owner last week with the same issue.‚Äù

The networking approach that works:

Show up consistently. Same events, same time, same friendly face.

Ask about their business first. Genuinely listen.

Share stories about other local businesses (without names). ‚ÄúHelped a gym owner recently with similar challenge.‚Äù

Never pitch immediately. Build the relationship first.

Reality check: Takes 3-6 months to see results. But when it clicks, referrals start flowing.

Best part: Local clients pay better because they can see you‚Äôre invested in the community, not just their wallet.

Unexpected bonus: Other business owners started referring clients to each other. Created a whole referral ecosystem.

Still do LinkedIn, but local networking brings 70% of our new clients now.

I know it‚Äôs only been a week since the decision was made. I‚Äôve had time to look at myself and I‚Äôve realized my mistakes only now, when everything is already lost.

I always thought I saw your efforts and understood how you felt. But looking back, I see that I kept focusing on the negative in every situation. Instead of noticing what you were doing for us, I kept looking at what was missing. I was never satisfied. I kept starting new conversations, trying to make our relationship perfect, without flaws.

I didn‚Äôt let time do its job. I didn‚Äôt enjoy the good moments. I focused on small details instead of just being happy with what we had. I see now how much that hurt us. I regret it deeply. You were under so much pressure, but I couldn‚Äôt see it. You tried as much as I did, but I never showed you the smile or reassurance that you needed to feel that what you did was good, that you made me happy.

I‚Äôve decided to take 2 weeks off to be with my family and friends, and to work on myself.

Part of me really wants to send this to you because I still want to try again, to hear your voice, to get to know you again. But I know sending this right now would only pull you back into a conversation when you left because you were exhausted. I know you need rest.

Mikaela stood by the window of her office, watching a rainy night softly slide down the glass. Inside was quiet, only the gentle hum of the city and the occasional footsteps of passersby breaking the silence. She knew that night was when darkness awakens, and at that moment she felt especially alive. Her fingers lightly touched the locket around her neck ‚Äî a reminder of the past, of those dear to her who would never return. Inside her, two forces battled: duty and the desire to protect those still alive. Suddenly, a phone rang. Mikaela picked up and heard Claire‚Äôs voice ‚Äî her partner in the homicide department.
‚Äî Mikaela, we have a new case. The body was found in a church on the outskirts of the city. It doesn‚Äôt seem like an ordinary murder.
Mikaela sighed and quickly got dressed. She knew: every new case was a chance to get closer to solving the mystery that connected them both.
Mikaela took one last sip of coffee, glanced at her watch ‚Äî it was already late evening. She knew it was time to go. Gathering herself, she left the office, closing the door behind her. Outside, a storm had begun. Thunder roared so loudly it seemed as if the sky would split in half, and lightning sharply cut through the dark sky. Mikaela walked to her car, paying no attention to the raging storm. Inside her, she felt calmer ‚Äî she was used to such nights. Wind and rain were just part of her work, part of her life. She thought: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean anything. The storm is just weather.‚Äù
She sat behind the wheel and turned on music to drown out the sound of rain and thunder. Inside, there was a feeling that night concealed something more than just natural phenomena. But she decided not to pay attention ‚Äî after all, she had more important things to do.
A few minutes later, Mikaela sped through the wet streets of Toronto toward the church on the outskirts of town. There awaited them a new case ‚Äî another murder with mysterious symbols and rituals.
Mikaela got out of the car, feeling how cold wind pierced her skin. The wind howled, whipping rain across the asphalt, but inside she felt warmer ‚Äî she sensed that something greater than just another crime awaited her here.
Approaching the church, she noticed a bright glow ‚Äî a blood-red light illuminated half of nightfall. Inside, silence reigned except for the faint rustling of rain and her own footsteps.
When Mikaela entered, she was met with a horrifying sight. The floor was soaked in blood; shattered glass and pieces of church artifacts were scattered around. On the altar lay a body ‚Äî a man dressed as a priest. His face was disfigured ‚Äî eyes wide open, mouth clenched in an expression of terrible pain. His body was cut with numerous deep wounds, as if someone wanted to destroy him completely.
But what was most terrifying wasn‚Äôt even that. Around the body were symbols and runes drawn with blood on the floor and walls. Each line seemed carved with hatred and rage.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.¬† Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn‚Äôt own a lot, and anyway, I wasn‚Äôt coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of¬†*Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn‚Äôt like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn‚Äôt. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn‚Äôt bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn‚Äôt been updated since the 80‚Äôs, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn‚Äôt too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA‚Äôs, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident‚Äôs beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly.¬†

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I‚Äôve never told anyone:

I‚Äôm terrified of old people.

I don‚Äôt know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it‚Äôs just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn‚Äôt bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading¬†*Salem‚Äôs Lot*¬†by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn‚Äôt need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA‚Äôs, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn‚Äôt want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch¬†*Supernatural.*¬†Sometimes we‚Äôd shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched¬†*Nosferatu*¬†at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria‚Äôs are garbage, but the Home‚Äôs food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA‚Äôs and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn‚Äôt for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they‚Äôd quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn‚Äôt complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing¬†*Elden Ring*¬†and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn‚Äôt have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn‚Äôt mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn‚Äôt want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn‚Äôt looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my¬†*Beserk*¬†brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn‚Äôt know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into¬†*Beserk*¬†too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. ‚ÄúFor shift exchanges,‚Äù she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying ‚Äúsure.‚Äù I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we‚Äôd play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn‚Äôt have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I‚Äôd ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn‚Äôt really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA‚Äôs hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn‚Äôt talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn‚Äôt really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That‚Äôs when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won‚Äôt go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don‚Äôt know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena‚Äôs phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena‚Äôs name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she‚Äôd ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn‚Äôt risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn‚Äôt hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

‚ÄúGet up. Get over it. You have a life to live,‚Äù she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn‚Äôt a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena‚Äôs apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn‚Äôt want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn‚Äôt true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don‚Äôt think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a ‚ÄúLena‚Äù living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I¬†*knew*¬†I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn‚Äôt said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for:¬†

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn‚Äôt a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn‚Äôt do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss‚Äôs office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home‚Äôs records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.¬† I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss‚Äôs door was locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA‚Äôs about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read ‚Äúarchived footage‚Äù. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said ‚ÄúFootage moved to Secondary Storage.‚Äù

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren‚Äôt allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn‚Äôt closed the camera window.

She didn‚Äôt look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

‚ÄúI always forget the damn spoon.‚Äù

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA‚Äôs in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren‚Äôt usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that¬† I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss‚Äôs keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn‚Äôt even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet‚Äôs handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn‚Äôt recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.¬† I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don‚Äôt know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn‚Äôt care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn‚Äôt say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn‚Äôt go home. I didn‚Äôt trust my apartment was safe.¬†

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS‚Äôs and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled ‚ÄúLena‚Äù and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn‚Äôt remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn‚Äôt turn. It didn‚Äôt look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena‚Äôs neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms began to expand and contort. Lena‚Äôs body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs fingers and into her body.¬†

Lena‚Äôs body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena‚Äôs mouth was open in a scream I couldn‚Äôt hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn‚Äôt look away. I hated it, but I couldn‚Äôt stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù written on it.

I was a coward. I should‚Äôve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should‚Äôve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I‚Äôve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don‚Äôt require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don‚Äôt ask questions.

But I know now I haven‚Äôt run far enough. For the past month, I‚Äôve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last.

There‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt said the location of the Home, or even which state it‚Äôs in.

I can‚Äôt remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can‚Äôt even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there‚Äôs a blank space where it should be.

I can‚Äôt find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm going crazy.

But I know it‚Äôs real. I can‚Äôt forget what I‚Äôve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it‚Äôs only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can‚Äôt say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It‚Äôs like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can‚Äôt sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors analyze earnings, await Fed rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were inched higher Wednesday as investors analyzed earnings reports and awaited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points.
*****
> Starbucks shares climbed 4% after the coffee chain posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the third fiscal quarter. On the other hand, Visa slipped 2% despite quarterly results coming in better than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Meta Platforms and Microsoft were marginally higher in the premarket ahead of quarterly results due out after the closing bell.
*****
> Wednesday‚Äôs action follows a losing day on the Street, marking the first session of the last seven in which the S&P 500 did not close at an all-time high. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on Tuesday, while the Dow and Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major averages were weighed down as the progress of U.S. trade talks with China became shaky. U.S. negotiators ended discussions with Beijing, and the potential extension of a pause on higher China tariffs remained uncertain. A postponement of these higher rates won‚Äôt be final until President Donald Trump signs off on the plan, U.S. negotiators said.
*****
> Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate announcement Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in a nearly 98% likelihood of the central bank keeping its key rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool.
*****
> ‚ÄúDespite increased political scrutiny, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to signal patience around any interest rate decision,‚Äù said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management. ‚ÄúFinancial markets do not anticipate any change in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve until at least September.‚Äù
*****
> Following the decision, traders will turn to a press conference with Powell for insights into the path of monetary policy. This comes as President Trump and allies have tried to pressure the central bank leader to bring the borrowing cost down.
*****
> Before that, traders will monitor economic data on private payrolls, gross domestic product and pending home sales due in the morning.
*****
> They‚Äôll also follow the continued stream of earnings reports. Etsy will provide its quarterly results before the bell on Wednesday, followed by Ford and Robinhood after the market close.

1md54zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_whypotato2123/comments/1md54zr/the_weaver_kenji_part_19_the_second_brick/,"The Weaver & Kenji Part 19: The Second Brick (Community, Action, Ripple Effect, Hope)","In the week that followed, Kenji‚Äôs apartment transformed. The despair of his job search was replaced by the vibrant, focused energy of creation. His drafting table was covered with detailed plans for the community garden: irrigation layouts, planting schedules, cost estimates for materials he couldn't afford. A beautiful, final rendering of the completed park, a small jewel of green and life, was taped to his wall, a testament to his self-defined purpose.

But when the last line was drawn and the last detail was finalized, a new kind of frustration set in. The creative act, the ""pushing of the boulder,"" had given him meaning. But now the boulder sat at the bottom of a new hill. He had a perfect blueprint for a better world, but as a single, unemployed man, he had no power, no capital, and no influence to make it real.

The Weaver, ever-observant, noted the shift from the positive 'flow state' to this new, agitated stasis.

*‚ÄúThe creative phase is complete,‚Äù* it noted, its voice a neutral hum in his mind. *‚ÄúThe project now requires political and material capital, which you do not possess. The probability of implementation is low. How do you intend to proceed?‚Äù*

The Weaver was right. The logic was sound. Kenji felt the old, familiar despair begin to creep back in. He had laid his one, perfect brick, but what good was it if it just sat alone in the mud?

He looked at his phone, remembering the coffee with Alex, the simple warmth of not being alone. He had leaned on his ""internal wall"" of integrity; now, he needed to test if there were external ones. He made the call.

‚ÄúHey, Alex,‚Äù he said when his friend picked up. ‚ÄúYou busy? No, no crisis. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something else. I‚Äôve been working on a project. I know it‚Äôs a little crazy, but I just want to show it to someone. Are you free for a coffee?‚Äù

An hour later, in a small, bustling coffee shop, Alex stared at Kenji‚Äôs laptop screen, his expression one of genuine awe. The 3D renderings of the garden glowed with life.

‚ÄúKenji‚Ä¶ this is incredible,‚Äù Alex said, looking from the screen to his friend. ‚ÄúYou did all of this‚Ä¶ for free?‚Äù

Kenji explained his new philosophy, about choosing his own boulder, about laying his own brick true. Alex listened intently, a thoughtful look on his face.

‚ÄúThat derelict lot by the old post office,‚Äù Alex said slowly. ‚ÄúIs that the spot you designed this for?‚Äù

Kenji nodded.

A slow grin spread across Alex‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúMy Aunt Sarah is on the neighborhood council. For months, she‚Äôs been complaining that they don‚Äôt have the funds or the vision to do anything with that exact space. She needs to see this.‚Äù

The following Saturday, Kenji found himself at the same coffee shop, but this time, his laptop was angled towards three other people: Alex, his sharp, energetic Aunt Sarah, and a quiet older man she introduced as a retired contractor named George.

Kenji, nervous but filled with the passion of his project, walked them through the design. George squinted at the screen, humming thoughtfully. ‚ÄúThe pump for that fountain will be expensive, but I know a supplier who owes me a favor. We could get it at cost.‚Äù

Sarah nodded, her eyes bright with excitement. ‚ÄúIf we can show the council a viable, low-cost plan with community support, we can get the city to sign off on it. I can bring this up at the next meeting.‚Äù

The Weaver was silently processing this new, complex interaction. `Log: The Host's initial unilateral investment, previously deemed illogical, has acted as a catalyst. It has inspired reciprocal, non-obligatory investment of social and material capital from other humans. A decentralized cooperative network is forming in response to the initial act.`

Kenji walked home from the meeting, the cool air feeling fresh and new. Nothing was certain, no ground had been broken. But the project was no longer just his. The weight was no longer his alone to bear. He got back to his apartment and looked at the drawing on his wall. It wasn‚Äôt just a dream anymore. It was a plan.

*The boulder is still heavy,* he thought, a slow, hopeful smile spreading across his face. *But for the first time‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not the only one pushing.*",1,1753878141.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors analyze earnings, await Fed rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were inched higher Wednesday as investors analyzed earnings reports and awaited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points.
*****
> Starbucks shares climbed 4% after the coffee chain posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the third fiscal quarter. On the other hand, Visa slipped 2% despite quarterly results coming in better than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Meta Platforms and Microsoft were marginally higher in the premarket ahead of quarterly results due out after the closing bell.
*****
> Wednesday‚Äôs action follows a losing day on the Street, marking the first session of the last seven in which the S&P 500 did not close at an all-time high. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on Tuesday, while the Dow and Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The major averages were weighed down as the progress of U.S. trade talks with China became shaky. U.S. negotiators ended discussions with Beijing, and the potential extension of a pause on higher China tariffs remained uncertain. A postponement of these higher rates won‚Äôt be final until President Donald Trump signs off on the plan, U.S. negotiators said.
*****
> Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate announcement Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in a nearly 98% likelihood of the central bank keeping its key rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool.
*****
> ‚ÄúDespite increased political scrutiny, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to signal patience around any interest rate decision,‚Äù said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management. ‚ÄúFinancial markets do not anticipate any change in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve until at least September.‚Äù
*****
> Following the decision, traders will turn to a press conference with Powell for insights into the path of monetary policy. This comes as President Trump and allies have tried to pressure the central bank leader to bring the borrowing cost down.
*****
> Before that, traders will monitor economic data on private payrolls, gross domestic product and pending home sales due in the morning.
*****
> They‚Äôll also follow the continued stream of earnings reports. Etsy will provide its quarterly results before the bell on Wednesday, followed by Ford and Robinhood after the market close.

I was diagnosed with high risk HPV April 2024. They also found ASCUS. All of my paps before were clear. I am a very type A person and I take care of my health and get all the check ups every year. 
They said we should wait because I was only 25. So we waited 6 months and I also got the vaccine during those 6 months. (It wasn't a thing back when I was younger so that's why I didn't get it.. I live in a country where the vaccination started pretty late compared to America). 
After the 6 months and 3 doses of the vaccine they found LSIL. So they said let's wait another 6 months and also let's get a colposcopy done. The doctor that did my colpo and biopsy said it looks like CIN1 to her and that I shouldn't worry. She called my 10 days later horrified that it's mostly CIN2 with some CIN3. So that stressed me out even more. Currently I we are waiting 4 more moths to see if it's gonna regress or not and if not I am having a LEEP. 
BUT NOW THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS...
Guys,.when I say I tried everything I am seriously not lying. 
I don't smoke, I don't drink. I am vegan, I move.my body everyday. I sleep a lot. I don't eat junk food I don't drink sweet drink or more than 2 cups of coffee per day. 
I take every single supplement there is... I take vaginal HPV tablets and papilicare gel. I take vaginal probiotics and oral probiotics. I drink my own combucha everyday. I've been with the same person for 2 years and we use condoms. I spent so much money on my health yet it's only getting worse... I am positive for more than one high risk but 16 and 18 negative. 
Anyone else with a similar experience? 
What am I doing wrong? 
I can't enjoy my life because all I can think of is cancer.. I am managing my stress as much as I can but it's not easy.. I used to have a lot of vaginal and urological issues few years ago and sometimes I still get them and I don't understand why is my body doing this to me... I don't get sick often unless it's some kind of vaginal issues or a UTI. I don't know what is wrong with me ... I feel like a failure.. like I can't be normal for some reason.. and I am scared of getting cancer.

1md52r3,https://i.redd.it/gso56nsn70gf1.jpeg,What happened to my families at that night Nehase 16,"I‚Äôm the youngest in my family. I have an older sister and an older brother, and I live with both of my parents. As part of our Ethiopian Orthodox Christian tradition, we always observe special holy days ‚Äî especially those honoring God, Saint Mary, the angels, and other saints. This includes lighting candles, praying, and performing coffee ceremonies.

On Nehase 16, a holy day dedicated to Saint Mary, we usually light candles and honor her. But this time, somehow, we all completely forgot to do it.

That night, something very unusual happened. My sister came home from work feeling nauseous and had stomach pain. My mother suddenly developed a fever and strong headache. She went to bed early, which is very unlike her. My father had a fever, headache, and signs of physical weakness. My older brother also had fever and headache.

All four of them got sick at the same time ‚Äî with similar symptoms. But I, the youngest, was totally fine. I didn‚Äôt feel even a little sick. I actually felt peaceful.

Later in the evening, everyone started connecting what happened to the fact that we didn‚Äôt honor Saint Mary that day like we always do. They believed that forgetting to light the candle and skipping the tradition caused this sudden sickness.

That was the first time something like this had ever happened to us, and all on the same night. From their perspective, it wasn‚Äôt just a coincidence.

So if anyone has experienced such special things before share it with me and i would like to know the meaning!

1md50gm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md50gm,Swerl coffee - Huye Natural,"Hello everyone,

On my trip to Europe, I bought a bag from Swerl in a local coffee shop.

As an internationally known brand, I wanted to share my review as I don't see much Swerl name around here. And if I am lucky, maybe some of you have the same coffee and would be nice to share their review.

My bag was roasted 7 weeks ago, but the only information I read about Swerl coffee resting time was on ""sigma"" website, saying those coffees peak at 8-12 weeks (what do you think?). I thought the beans would be lighter than the one I buy from my different local roasters but I doesn't seems to be the case (maybe because they are natural). After opening the bag (by the way great quality one way valve), the smell was great and fresh. The beans smells a little closer to fermented coffee. A real natural coffee i would say.

So I brew it on a V60, cafec abaca, 92 degree, 16gr/240ml, Pietro size 8, bloom 30 sec + 2. 

I got a great result, with a spicy chocolate taste (like those spicy speciality chocolate - clove, cardamon), a nice sweetness, a little bit of acidity, o really long brown sugary aftertaste. Great body too. 

A really great cup.",10,1753877783.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
