1i70mt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i70mt2/the_waffle_house_at_the_edge_of_the_woods/,The Waffle House at the Edge of the Woods,"Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

It's all I have been reading on Reddit over the last 6 months and got tired of it.**

Me: I completely understand why you feel that way. We have been shilling Kendu non stop over the past few months. But trust me this is not just another update- a transformation has unfolded in Kendu, one that I believe is a game-changer, not just for Kendu but for the entire memecoin space.

**You: Okay. So what is the latest buzz about Kendu?**  
Me: Kendu just had its “phoenix moment.” It’s risen from the ashes of developer drama, betrayal and is now 100% community-driven. Finally after months of chaos and challenges, the community has taken full control

**You: Wait, Chaos, Drama? Betrayal? What happened?!**  
Me: Picture this: for months, the Kendu community is working tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into building something extraordinary. But there was one little problem: the dev. Yes, the dev—the person who was supposed to lead the charge—decided to moonwalk in the opposite direction. Sabotage? Check. Ignoring community desires? Double-check. Trying to bury Kendu six feet under? Triple-check *(The reason Kendu market cap was going down over the past few months)*. But guess what? The dev underestimated the power of the community. Spoiler alert: the community won.

*Basically we had our Batman moment. Dev is Ra al Ghul and Kendu community is Batman :)*

**You: How did the community manage to pull this off and what happened to Dev?**  
Me: With sheer determination, some serious grit, and probably a lot of Kendu energy drinks, the community rallied together, took control, and staged a takeover that would be worth of a Netflix documentary. It wasn’t easy, but the got the dev to send back the remaining tokens to the donations wallet. Translation? The dev is out, the community is in, and those tokens are now ammunition for listings, marketing, and spreading the Kendu gospel.

**You: That sounds intense. What’s next for Kendu?**  
Me: Oh, just a clean slate, a fresh start, and a chance to rewrite history. No big deal. The community is embracing a decentralized, transparent, and adaptable approach. Imagine a Kendu that’s not tied to any one person but is instead a movement fueled by belief and true conviction.

**You: Has this brought back old supporters and how is crypto world reacting to this?**  
Me: Absolutely. It’s like a reunion. Hundreds of old faces have returned to the Telegram group. And the whales who had been waiting on the sidelines and everyone is ready to push Kendu to new heights. And the result -*you can see for yourself*

**You: I understand that Kendu is turning a new chapter, But what makes Kendu different from other memecoins?**  
Me: Where do I even start? For starters, Kendu is the second memecoin ever to complete a Certik audit organically besides Pepe. It’s also the second to have its own Stocktwits page and has been featured in top-tier CEX campaigns and advertisements (Coinbase). Add to that a thriving community with real-world products (energy drinks, coffee, jewellery etc), members rocking Kendu tattoos, and one of the healthiest token distributions in DeFi. Oh, and did I mention the SOL wormhole? Yes, Kendu is available both on ETH and SOL

**You: What’s the ultimate goal for Kendu?**  
Me: Billions, baby.

1i70fbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i70fbd/struggling_with_insecurity_in_friendships/,Struggling with insecurity in friendships,"Sorry for the title, which might seem clickbaity—well, it is a little, to be honest. I’ve been dealing with something for a while, and I’d like to find the tools to bring myself some psychological peace. It’s nothing serious, but it weighs on me a bit.  
I’m surrounded by friends who never check in, who almost never write to me. It might sound strange to put it that way, but all my friends are like this. I see them whenever I can, we have amazing times together, we really know each other well. I have several friend groups, and when I say none of them ever write, I’m exaggerating. Most of them write often. But the ones I’m closest to almost never do so on their own.

I’ve gotten used to this dynamic, to their way of being and seeing the world, and I love them for it too. I know they don’t do it on purpose, and I see them behave the same way with everyone else, so I don’t feel cheated or insulted or less loved. It’s just a fact: my closest friends never check in, they take two weeks to reply to a text (for those who don’t live in the same city), when they reply at all. This aligns with my worldview—I value the freedom to act, the idea of not spending your life on your phone, and especially the belief that we owe no one explanations. We are free to respond to whomever we want, whenever we want, contrary to the constant messaging of our era. We have the right to be unavailable.

That said, there’s one particular friend, let’s call him F, who I’ve been very close to for ten years. He’s an amazing person in every way. We get along so well, we have the same sense of humor, we’re always by each other’s side at parties, we tell each other everything, we make music together, and do so many things. But for the past two months or so, he’s been upsetting me.

Long story short, he’s exactly the type of person who never replies. He’s infamous for it in our group of friends, everyone calls him out on it, he knows it, and he laughs about it. His response patterns are more erratic than anyone I’ve ever seen. I’ve lost count of how many times he’s been talking to me, seen his phone buzz, glanced at it, and flipped it over. Or opened a message, read it, and never replied.  
He’s very socially confident. Everyone likes him, he has a lot of friends and is constantly invited to drinks, outings, and events. Over the past year, his responsiveness towards me had improved significantly. He almost always replied, and we saw each other a lot.

But over the past two months, he’s barely replied to me. And, in this case, it feels very targeted and incomprehensible to me. The other day, I ran into a mutual friend on the street, and we stopped for a coffee near F’s place. We thought, “Hey, let’s call him.” I called him; he didn’t pick up. My friend called him five minutes later, and he answered.  
Another time, I tried calling him to grab a beer; he didn’t answer. Two minutes later, I ran into his girlfriend, who for an unrelated reason called him—and he answered immediately.  
He hasn’t replied to several of my messages in a row, even though he’s active in our group chat.

I feel like he’s avoiding me, even though nothing happened. I went to one of our friend’s birthday parties recently, and he was there. The first thing he said to me—without me even bringing it up because I wouldn’t, since it’s not in my values to guilt someone over their response habits—was, “Oh, wow, sorry, I haven’t replied to you in weeks... I don’t even know why.”  
Then, later that night, he came to talk to me, suggested we hang out soon, and all that. So, everything’s probably fine, I guess.

But the fact is, I realize this kind of behavior affects my mood, a little hold over me that I’d like to break free from. The issue isn’t his behavior—he’s free to act as he wants. The issue is the insecurity it stirs in me. I don’t want to make him change. What I want is to work on myself so I don’t feel insecure when a friend, for no apparent reason, stops responding to me. I always end up thinking it’s my fault, that I must have done something wrong—even though I never actually do. I’m careful with others. Or I fear the person will stop loving me—yada yada—all those things we inherit from a childhood where we were taught that love must be earned, with an absent father, left to fend for oneself early on.

Ultimately, I’d like to work on myself to respond to such situations with love for myself rather than doubts, to feel a surge of kindness toward myself instead of self-reproach.

1i70awt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1i70awt/i_need_advice/,I need advice.,"Today marks the six month anniversary I have with my girlfriend. She hasn't texted or called in 6 days (which is not new). I guess I'm looking for some sort of advice or opinion on my current situation. 

Here's a little backstory:

When we first met, we both fell for each other immediately. I wasn't working due to an injury and she was out of school (currently in her 4th year now of university as of Jan. '25) for the summer and working at a restaurant as a bartender. She would invite me to the bar during her shifts to keep her company, and I did. So right off the bat we were spending a lot of time together within the first couple weeks. Then, less than a month in, we became inseparable after I basically moved in with her (as I had no work at the time and would see her down the street when she was working). She'd leave the apartment for work, I'd wake up, clean the apartment, then shower and head down to see her and hang out for her whole shift. She was always so excited to see me and would stop someone mid-conversation to come out and hug me. It was a wonderful time. We spent almost the whole summer together. 

Just before the school year began, the lease to her apartment was up and she had to move in with her Dad, and I had to go back to my parents'. We agreed that since she had a vehicle that the priority would be for me to find a place to rent once I started work as opposed to getting my licence renewed which would be a lengthy process and a financial drain. No problems there, though, and I currently have a tour with a nice apartment booked for this Saturday. 

The first semester was a little rocky for her in terms of grades and meeting deadlines as we were still tapering off of our summer party mode. And I'm guilty of not declining nights of drinking with her when I should have. I think reality finally set in this December when she had to study for and complete \~8 assignments/exams which is when she went radio silent for approximately three weeks (with proper warning, though, and I respected the fact that she was going to buckle down and pass the first semester regardless of our extra curricular behaviour + I trusted her). 

In the beginning, she was never a huge texter and would take her time to respond, but she always ended up responding regardless of the subject matter. Perhaps it was just the initial getting-to-know-each-other period where she thought it'd be beneficial for me to know her opinion on simple things like cheeses and new releases on Netflix, because throughout getting to know her it has become quite evident that she is more of a bigger-picture person when it comes to conversation, meanwhile I can dabble in both. She has even said that I'm more of a ""micro"" person and she is ""macro"" in terms of personality. I still disagree somewhat, but I do admit that I'm guilty of delivering ""nothing texts"" while I'm at work and bored just for the sake of texting. She, however, isn't. Which leads to many texts left on read and many days without a single text.

I've brought this up to her in the past and have said that I know it's meaningless conversation to her, but just a simple ""hey"" daily would suffice just to acknowledge my... existence... y'know? She's admitted that she's bad in that department and has tried to check-in a few times. I was having a rough night once and told her I had called a friend instead to go to a pool hall instead of calling her first, yet she tried to assure me I could call her about anything in the nicest voice I've ever heard. 

Now she's onto her 2nd semester of this fourth year and I'm back to working full-time. She has made it very clear that school is the priority for her - and I have absolutely zero issues with that as work is a priority for me, as well. It's just that in the past three weeks I've seen her only three times, talked on the phone three times and maybe texted 6 times. **Am I overreacting here or am I just not used to the status quo that was once our schedule of continuous fun and debauchery with little to no repercussions and that now since we have much more stable lives I'm experiencing some sort of detachment issue or love withdrawal?** I try not to let it bug me and I am getting better at the ruminating and negative thought spirals trying to decipher her lack of communication, because I know she's got a lot on her plate with school and family problems, but it still bugs me a little bit. I don't think I'm crazy for wanting a text daily or even every other day... and feeling disrespected when all I've ever texted her lately about was if she's doing okay (due to family and school scheduling issues) in addition to lending an ear the little time we have in person over dinner or coffee so she can vent about the aforementioned problems. 

I've really been biting my tongue lately as I feel any sort of subtle approach via text may just push her further away. It also doesn't help that even though she has thanked me for checking in daily via a text (regardless if she responds or not), it looks like I'm unhinged because the conversation is flooded with blue chat bubbles coming from my side only most of the time. I'm also very sentimental and don't think she shares the same view on the whole 6 month milestone as me. In the beginning, we said we'd never do gifts on our anniversaries, just quality time. She told me over coffee last Tuesday that she'd be busy today (which is fine, because I work and her schooling is important to me), and that we'd celebrate this coming weekend.

So I stole the idea. It didn’t do too badly.

**1. Georgetown**  
A historic, cobblestone wonderland where everything costs double because it looks *vintage*. Good luck finding parking without a trust fund or navigating the crowds of influencers taking selfies by the canal. Everyone here is either a college student or pretending they still are.  

**2. Adams Morgan**  
Your quintessential frat party neighborhood—beer pong in the basement, rooftop margs, and a pizza slice the size of your head at 2 AM. It’s quirky until you realize the quirk is just drunken chaos on a nightly basis.   

**3. Dupont Circle**  
Where old money liberals sip overpriced lattes while complaining about capitalism. Don’t be fooled by the charm—it’s where “networking” is just a euphemism for self-congratulation. Bonus points if you own a dog you refer to as your “child.”  

**4. Capitol Hill**  
A neighborhood full of power suits and backroom deals. Everyone is “working on the Hill” (read: fetching coffee for someone who actually has power). The homes are beautiful but cost more than a senator’s salary, ironically purchased with the lobbyist money you claim to disdain.  

**5. U Street**  
You can’t throw a rock here without hitting a “restored” speakeasy or a mural someone will tell you is *iconic*. It’s where history meets gentrification in the form of $18 cocktails and a two-hour wait for brunch.  

**6. Foggy Bottom**  
This is where tourists mistake George Washington University’s campus for a trendy neighborhood. It’s like someone built a city block for corporate interns who haven’t figured out where the cool parts of DC actually are.  

**7. Navy Yard**  
A shiny, new urban playground for people who think “going out” means taking a selfie by Nationals Park. The vibe screams, “I pay $4,000 a month for a studio and tell myself it’s worth it because there’s a Whole Foods downstairs.”  

**8. Shaw**  
This once-vibrant cultural hub is now where tech bros and artisanal coffee shops have come to die. They call it “up-and-coming,” but it’s really just been fully “come-and-gone” by gentrification.  

**9. Columbia Heights**  
The place where Target is the biggest cultural landmark. A mix of longtime residents and newcomers pretending they’re not the reason rent is unaffordable. It’s diverse, but the tension is palpable, especially at the Trader Joe’s checkout line.  

**10. Anacostia**  
The city’s forgotten stepchild—praised for its potential, yet somehow always left out of the investment that other neighborhoods get. People talk about “revitalization,” but they really just mean displacing locals for overpriced condos.  

**11. Logan Circle**  
The kingdom of yuppies where everyone pretends to be laid-back while obsessively comparing property values. Expect immaculate brownstones and equally immaculate egos.  

**12. Chevy Chase**  
Not quite DC, but its residents will die before admitting they live in Maryland. It’s essentially a suburb dressed up in city taxes—good schools, big lawns, and zero nightlife.

Early I went to Mr. Crew's, and having given Mr. Edward money to give the servants, I took him into the coach that waited for us and carried him to my house, where the coach waited for me while I and the child went to Westminster Hall, and bought him some pictures. In the Hall I met Mr. Woodfine, and took him to Will's and drank with him. Thence the child and I to the coach, where my wife was ready, and so we went towards Twickenham. In our way, at Kensington we understood how that my Lord Chesterfield had killed another gentleman about half an hour before, and was fled. We went forward and came about one of the clock to Mr. Fuller's, but he was out of town, so we had a dinner there, and I gave the child 40s. to give to the two ushers. After that we parted and went homewards, it being market day at Brainford. I set my wife down and went with the coach to Mr. Crew's, thinking to have spoke with Mr. Moore and Mrs. Jem, he having told me the reason of his melancholy was some unkindness from her after so great expressions of love, and how he had spoke to her friends and had their consent, and that he would desire me to take an occasion of speaking with her, but by no means not to heighten her discontent or distaste whatever it be, but to make it up if I can. But he being out of doors, I went away and went to see Mrs. Jem, who was now very well again, and after a game or two at cards, I left her. So I went to the Coffee Club, and heard very good discourse; it was in answer to Mr. Harrington's answer, who said that the state of the Roman government was not a settled government, and so it was no wonder that the balance of propriety was in one hand, and the command in another, it being therefore always in a posture of war; but it was carried by ballot, that it was a steady government, though it is true by the voices it had been carried before that it was an unsteady government; so to-morrow it is to be proved by the opponents that the balance lay in one hand, and the government in another. Thence I went to Westminster, and met Shaw and Washington, who told me how this day Sydenham was voted out of the House for sitting any more this Parliament, and that Salloway was voted out likewise and sent to the Tower, during the pleasure of the House. Home and wrote by the Post, and carried to Whitehall, and coming back turned in at Harper-'s, where Jack Price was, and I drank with him and he told me, among other, things, how much the Protector is altered, though he would seem to bear out his trouble very well, yet he is scarce able to talk sense with a man; and how he will say that ""Who should a man trust, if he may not trust to a brother and an uncle;"" and ""how much those men have to answer before God Almighty, for their playing the knave with him as they did."" He told me also, that there was; L100,000 offered, and would have been taken for his restitution, had not the Parliament come in as they did again; and that he do believe that the Protector will live to give a testimony of his valour and revenge yet before he dies, and that the Protector will say so himself sometimes.

You sit down at your desk, armed with a coffee and just enough optimism to get through the day. First task: load the customer dataset into MySQL. Easy, right? Wrong. The LOAD DATA INFILE query immediately spits out:

Error Code: 1292. Incorrect date value: '12/31/2022' for column 'date' at row 1

Great. The dataset has dates in three different formats, random “N/A” entries, and customer names that look like they were typed by someone on their fifth drink. After spending the morning wrangling this mess into something MySQL will tolerate, you finally have clean data. It’s not glamorous, but at least now it won’t blow up your queries.

You decide to focus on churn rates, figuring it’s a safe bet. It’s fine, but you’re still second-guessing yourself. Should you be looking at spending patterns? Maybe demographic insights? You save the results and move on, hoping your manager will magically confirm your instincts during the next check-in.

**12:30 PM**

After lunch, marketing hits you up with a new request: they want campaign insights with all the bells and whistles—filters for regions, product categories, and date ranges. You try to tweak your earlier queries, but things quickly spiral into chaos. It works, technically, but they keep asking for more tweaks. “Can we add weekly breakdowns? Can we exclude specific categories?” By the time you’re done, it’s clear your SQL skills aren’t the problem—figuring out exactly what they want is.

**3:00 PM**

You throw together some charts in Excel showing retention trends and campaign data, thinking they look pretty solid. When you show your manager, though, they just stare at you.

“Okay, but what’s the takeaway?”

And there it is—you’ve got clean data, accurate numbers, and a bunch of graphs, but no real story. Your analysis isn’t actionable, and it shows. You scramble to add some quick suggestions, but you know you’re fumbling. Turns out the data can’t speak for itself unless you tell it what to say.

**5:00 PM**

The marketing team asks for regional sales data, which should be simple because you’ve already cleaned that part of the dataset. Should be. But when you run your query, the totals look way off. The numbers are suspiciously high. After a frustrating debugging session, you find the problem: duplicate rows caused by bad test data. Classic. You fix it, but it’s a painful reminder that data cleaning is never really over.

**6:15 PM**

Just as you’re shutting down for the day, your manager drops by with a parting gift:

“We’ll need a churn analysis for tomorrow morning’s meeting.”

You suppress the urge to scream. You already did a basic churn analysis earlier, but it’s nowhere near polished, and now you’ll need to stay late refining it. Still, at least you’ve learned one thing today: bad data and unclear goals are the gift that keeps on giving.

You fire up your laptop again, muttering to yourself, “Maybe tomorrow I’ll finally have a day where everything just works.” But deep down, you know better.",1,1737512001.0,mysql,0,1.0,False

I have a modest De'Longhi Dedica EC885M at home, and I use a good quality ground barista coffee to make my daily lattes. The flavour is decent, but I find myself wishing it could be better. I don't have a coffee grinder but will have one in the future $$.



I would like your opinion about the below: 

I got a coffee knock box to empty the coffee filter basket easily and to collect the used coffee for my garden. I noticed that the coffee in the cup after being used is too muddy that it I need to knock the coffee handle around 10 times to get the coffee out and I still need to use a spoon to scoop the remaining..

Is that expected? If not, what does that tell about my coffee or the process? am I tamping the coffee too much? does it have anything to do with the water pressure? is the coffee ground is too fine although its was grinned for the espresso machines?

I assume im at least somewhat his type if weve talked on the apps before. i likely didnt go for it as hes not my normal type and his pics do not do him justice either! from what ive heard from mutual colleagues he is super smart and a nice guy.

anyway... since then i saw him outside work w a group of ppl and was looking at him i guess just thinking about this situation. he stared back as well when he saw me. the next time i saw him he was on the phone outside the building and i went to get coffee. when i got back he was still there and heading in so would be the perfect time to say hello, but he turned back as he was still on the phone. so i was like maybe hes avoiding me. or just coincidence.

After that I saw him and he fully held eye contact with me when we passed eachother on the street he was with a female colleague. the next time i saw him i was fully zoned out (i took ativan for a medical procedure after work) and i totally zoned out in his direction and he caught me starting (at least i think it was him. not entirely sure). anyway..were basically having a staring contest. but im not gonna lie, i started it. should i try and talk to him or does he think im weird as hell and just trying to figure out why im looking at him? im leaning towards the latter. pls dont judge me... i know im socially awkward!

I found Muddiman a good scholar, an arch rogue; and owns that though he writes new books for the Parliament, yet he did declare that he did it only to get money; and did talk very basely of many of them. Among other things, W. Simons told me how his uncle Scobel was on Saturday last called to the bar, for entering in the journal of the House, for the year 1653, these words: ""This day his Excellence the Lord General Cromwell dissolved this House;"" which words the Parliament voted a forgery, and demanded of him how they came to be entered. He answered that they were his own handwriting, and that he did it by virtue of his office, and the practice of his predecessor; and that the intent of the practice was to--let posterity know how such and such a Parliament was dissolved, whether by the command of the King, or by their own neglect, as the last House of Lords was; and that to this end, he had said and writ that it was dissolved by his Excellence the Lord G\[eneral\]; and that for the word dissolved, he never at the time did hear of any other term; and desired pardon if he would not dare to make a word himself when it was six years after, before they came themselves to call it an interruption; but they were so little satisfied with this answer, that they did chuse a committee to report to the House, whether this crime of Mr. Scobell's did come within the act of indemnity or no. Thence I went with Muddiman to the Coffee-House, and gave 18d. to be entered of the Club. Thence into the Hall, where I heard for certain that Monk was coming to London, and that Bradshaw's 2 lodgings were preparing for him. Thence to Mrs. Jem's, and found her in bed, and she was afraid that it would prove the small-pox. Thence back to Westminster Hall, where I heard how Sir H. Vane was this day voted out of the House, and to sit no more there; and that he would retire himself to his house at Raby, as also all the rest of the nine officers that had their commissions formerly taken away from them, were commanded to their farthest houses from London during the pleasure of the Parliament. Here I met with the Quarter Master of my Lord's troop, and his clerk Mr. Jenings, and took them home, and gave them a bottle of wine, and the remainder of my collar of brawn; and so good night. After that came in Mr. Hawly, who told me that I was mist this day at my office, and that to-morrow I must pay all the money that I have, at which I was put to a great loss how I should get money to make up my cash, and so went to bed in great trouble.",1,1737511154.0,Pepys,0,1.0,False

When I looked it up to learn more, I found out that it also crosses the placenta and goes into the brain of the fetus. 90% of Americans use caffeine daily (and there are fairly similar statistics in other countries), so very few of us have been born without some exposure to it.

And of course medical providers are saying this is totally fine. Here's one brief quote: 'Good news for pregnant coffee lovers: Consuming a low amount of caffeine during pregnancy could help to reduce gestational diabetes risk...'

Never mind that the fetus is being exposed to a PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG, and their developing brain is becoming habituated to it, which may set them up for a future addiction once they start consuming it after birth. (Likely very young, in the form of soda and chocolate.)

The further away I get from consuming caffeine, the more appalled I become at how it's possible for a drug to be so socially accepted and unquestioned. Especially one that actually impacts people's health. I had such severe anxiety before quitting that I tried one anti-anxiety med (with bad side effects), and was considering a second one. Now, at two months caffeine free, my anxiety has decreased enough that taking a med for it wouldn't even cross my mind. But not a single health care provider I saw suggested quitting, probably because they're also addicted.

It took about 3 hours to get from DPS to Amed. Our group of 8 stayed in a 4 bedroom villa that was beautiful!

Our villa included driving services, massages, scuba, and daily breakfast. 

We got really lucky with the weather and only had serious downpours twice. It was pretty gloomy most of the time, but we also had two beautiful sunny days and got to see the volcano.

Restaurants I’d recommend:

Sunset Point - get there before 3-4pm if you want to get loungers by the pool. Beautiful views, great drinks, and nice music.

La Cocina Mexicana - cute little spot to stop and enjoy margs while walking around the town

Trattoria - a beautiful Italian restaurant with amazing gnocchi. Warning, it’s very rich and cheesy! The tagliatelle is also amazing. We cleaned out their supply of strawberry daiquiri.

Warung Agung - the owner does indeed play guitar and sing every night from 7-9. The corn fritters are also fantastic and we had great service.

Safka - an amazing restaurant with a beautiful interior and very pleasant atmosphere. We were the only people there but the food and service was excellent! 

Places/activities I’d recommend:

Scuba/snorkel - did scuba for the first time and had an amazing experience. The water was warm and we saw tons of fish.

Lipah Beach - beautiful place to spend an afternoon. Beware of the ladies that like to sell jewelry and massages, they’re pretty relentless and will ask you, even if you declined a dozen times.

Rice farms & coffee farms - these were a bit farther from the Amed area, but were nearly empty and we had a great time learning about the agriculture. The rice field also had a giant swing some of us took turns on.

Water Temple & Gates of Heaven - these were very cool experiences and cool to walk around at for a bit. We didn’t have to wait long for pictures at either place because winter is the low season.

Live music bars - ask your driver about live music bars to check out. Everything is usually shut down at 11. The bands that perform are super talented and the energy is great! We had a lot of fun listening to bands.

What I would buy

- Bug spray. 1 can per person per week is about what we went through.

- Charcoal tabs. We popped these like candy when our stomachs started feeling a bit upset.

- Diapet. This definitely helped with the tummy trouble if it was too late for charcoal.

- A handheld fan. This came in surprisingly handy, it got quite hot.

1i6zrq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i6zrq5/did_i_make_a_mistake_breaking_up_with_her/,Did I make a mistake breaking up with her?,"I'm 30F and she's 31F. We broke up last spring and I'm still thinking about it.

We were together for 5 years. We shared similar values, in ways that are hard to find. I thought she was an amazing person and she said similar things about me. We had fun together, joking around. It was a good fit with each other's friends and family. I felt like we respected each other and treated each other as equals.

That was 95% of the time. But she had an anger problem. She would completely blow up and become a different person. Yelling, making fun of me, calling me names, wouldn't listen to my side. Sometimes she would throw things. Every place we moved out of had damage to the walls from her.

The things she got mad about were typically: if I wasn't eating enough, if I was exercising too much, or sometimes if I wanted to spend time with other people. The first two, I have a history of an eating disorder so that's why it came up. I've been physically stable during our time together, but definitely not perfect.

The fights would only end one of two ways. Either I'd promise to do whatever she wanted (for example, forcing myself to eat a particular thing that she was insisting on). Or I'd ignore her for hours - usually one of us physically leaving - until she calmed down.

At first, I listened to what she said and worked harder on my mental health. I made progress, which she acknowledged, but she'd still blow up. I wasn't OK with always doing exactly what she wanted, either. I started to feel like it was impossible.

I ended up in this shitty compromise where I'd lie to her, to keep her calm. For example, I'd purposefully bring more food for lunch, get rid of some of it, and tell her I ate everything. I'd sneak in workouts in the middle of my workday. I started sneaking coffee with a friend once a week, I'd tell her I was at the library.

I felt bad about lying to her. But I felt like lying was what I had to do to make it work. Sometimes I'd try to be truthful, but then I had to take her anger and/or allow her to make all these daily decisions for me. She'd accuse me of lying too, and she'd tell me it was a symptom of my eating disorder. She said if I'd lie about this, then I'd cheat on her too.

At this point, I didn't even know where I was at with my own mental health. I know that lying is an eating disorder symptom and I felt like she might be right. But I thought I was healthy. I didn't spend any time thinking about my body image or food. I just thought about how to avoid making her angry.

This also all made me so angry because she'd blow up and say I was overexerting myself, if I did physical activities when I wanted to, but she'd drag me on these strenuous hikes that actually did wear me out.

The fights didn't happen every day or every week. But I felt like this started to ruin everything. Even when we had a good day, there was always the possibility of a fight looming over my head. I didn't want to plan fun activities because there was a good chance it would be ruined. I didn't want to share my thoughts and emotions with her anymore, even if it wasn't the type of thing that she'd get mad about.

Two years in, she slapped me in the face during one of these fights. I told her that if she ever hit me again, I'd break up with her. Five years in, she threw something at me and hit me, hard, on purpose. I felt like if I don't follow through, I'll just let anything happen to me. She had gotten kinda scary with a knife recently and I didn't like that.

A month after that, I broke up with her. I didn't really think it through carefully. I just felt like I couldn't do this anymore, I just needed to get away from her.

After the breakup, she had a mental crisis and got institutionalized. I think she's out now, but I don't know the details.

I don't know. I mean. When I write it out like this. Maybe it's obvious that we shouldn't be together. It's hard. I still feel so tied to her. I really thought she was amazing. In a lot of ways, being together really did improve my life. She was absolutely there for me, always had my back, I trusted her to have my best interest at heart.

I think about nice moments together. But then I think about how those nice moments didn't feel nice anymore, because it was always hanging over my head. I spent a lot of time thinking about other things, being somewhere else mentally. I think I started to view her differently because of how she acted when she was angry. I couldn't see her as intelligent, loving, mature, etc.",1,1737510788.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Looking to create a living room that feels grounded, stylish, and connected to nature? Organic Modern Living Room Ideas blend the beauty of natural materials with sleek, contemporary design, making it the perfect aesthetic for anyone seeking a calm and inviting space. By incorporating earthy tones, organic textures, and clean lines, this style effortlessly combines the best of both worlds.

Start by choosing natural materials like wood, stone, and linen for your furniture and accents. Opt for light wood finishes, stone coffee tables, and woven textiles to introduce a warm, organic feel. Don’t forget to add houseplants to purify the air and introduce lush greenery that enhances the peaceful ambiance of the room. Neutral tones like beige, light gray, and soft whites act as a backdrop, allowing the natural elements to shine.

Lighting plays a key role too! Soft, ambient lighting from minimalistic lamps and sconces can help set the mood. For a finishing touch, add subtle metallic or ceramic accents that bring sophistication without overpowering the space.

Well, I finally found a scientific source that delves into that. Here it is!

* **Title:** [Mentalizing Deficits Constrain Belief in a Personal God](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3364254/)
* **Type of study:** Quantitative research, corellational research, case-control study, observational study (don't quote me entirely on this. I am not sure.)
* **Authors:** [Ara Norenzayan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Norenzayan%20A%22%5BAuthor%5D), [Will M Gervais](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Gervais%20WM%22%5BAuthor%5D), [Kali H Trzesniewski](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Trzesniewski%20KH%22%5BAuthor%5D)
* **Field:** Psychology
* **Date:** May 30th 2012
* **Important caveat about the study:** This study posits that autism may explain the gender gap in religiosity (men are more likely to be areligious than woman), but it is now more widely known that **not** that many more men are autistic than women (currently it is know that for every autistic woman, there are between 2 and 4 autistic men. In the past, this ratio was believed to be 1 autistic women for 16 autistic men).

# TL;DR (oversimplified)

Autistic people are less likely to believe in God (likely) because they cannot understand God's reason behind his behaviour very well.

# Highlights

Wikipedia links have been added for help. Note that I've taken away source reference links to simplify reading.

**From the abstract:**

>Religious believers intuitively conceptualize deities as intentional agents with mental states who anticipate and respond to human beliefs, desires and concerns. It follows that [mentalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalization) deficits, associated with the [autistic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) and also commonly found in men more than in women, may undermine this intuitive support and reduce belief in a personal God.  **Autistic adolescents expressed less belief in God than did matched neuro-typical controls \[...\].** In a Canadian student sample \[...\], and two American national samples \[...\], **the autism spectrum predicted reduced belief in God**, and mentalizing mediated this relationship. Systemizing \[...\] and two personality dimensions related to religious belief, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness \[...\], failed as mediators. \[read: [Big 5 personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\]

**From the introduction:**

>\[...\] If [mentalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalization) supports the mental representation of supernatural agents, then mentalizing deficits associated with the autistic spectrum \[...\] may undermine intuitive support for supernatural agent concepts and reduce belief in God \[...\]. \[...\] Here we examine the hypothesis-long predicted, though currently untested- that mentalizing deficits constrain belief in God.

# So, why am I sharing this study?

I have noticed many members of this community have an autism diagnosis (myself included), and I am suspecting that many of you might be autistic without knowing. Myself I got my autism diagnosis this year at 27 years old, and my dad is seeking a diagnosis at 59.

Additionally, not many people realise what light autism looks like. People with level 1 autism look outwardly typical, but may come as ""off"" in social interactions.

# What mild autism may look like:

* You fidget, rock your body, twirly your hair, walk tiptoe, crack your knuckles or tap your foot without apparent reasons or to relax.
* Your senses are either make weak or more sensitive than average. You are clumsy or don't realise your strenght, smell disgust you or you can't smell much, you notice small sounds or you have issues making out words,  you hate or really love hugs, etc.
* You feel like you take more time to process information in general.
* Social situations drain you.
* Small things make you upset. You're known to be sensitive, or to not be expressive enough.
* You imitate other people in order to fit in.
* You burn out easily.
* You like when you don't have to think about choices you make. You like doing things your way, or the same way (like you always make coffee or dress up the same way).
* You have issues understanding social conventions and have made people shocked without meaning to.
* You prefer working alone or communicating through writing.

# You think that sounds a bit too much like you?

I can help you redirect you to an appropriate resource depending of what your concern might be!

# Parting words

Please feel free to ask about my experience as someone autistic person (and how it relates to my relates to my religious beliefs).

Please also feel free to ask about the study and comment on it. I'll answer your questions to the best of my ability!",6,1737509117.0,Deconstruction,1,1.0,False
1i6z6t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i6z6t8/feeling_really_bad_about_an_argument_my/,"Feeling really bad about an argument my Girlfriend and I had, I need neutral perspectives m28 f33","So my girlfriend and I have been dating for three years.

She is currently on a work trip in Hawaii, and we were calling to discuss our day. She told me that she had a really interesting conversation with a man she met while on a break. At first I was happy to hear that because she has struggled to make friends in the city we moved to two years ago and feels like she doesn't have enough meaningful conversations with people aside from me. However as she gave more details I became uncomfortable.

Apparently they talked for two hours until the guy had to return to work. They talked about how the human brain works, AI and life. All was good until she told me that the guy described himself as a hedonist who said that basically all he wanted from life was sex, and that his dream was to become a porn star. I thought, that's a really weird thing to talk about, but hey, people are weird. I was ready to laugh it off, saying that she probably wouldn't see him again, when my girlfriend told me that she had given this guy her number after the conversation. 

At that point I started to feel pretty weird about the situation. I told my girlfriend that I didn't feel great about that because basically all men would take that as a sign of interest, which my girlfriend said wasn't true. I asked my girlfriend if he had texted her afterwards, and she told me that he had invited her to a rave he was throwing at his beach shack that night, and that she had declined, realizing that going to a beach rave with strangers in a strange place was not a good idea. 

I told her that I didn't really feel comfortable with her handing out her phone numbers to guys and my girlfriend got upset. She told me that there were plenty of perfectly fine reasons to hand out her phone number to guys, and I agreed. I understand swapping phone numbers if you have a work project together, or share some interest like being on the same sports team. My girlfriend told me that she has guy friends and talking to them is a shared interest, (which I thing is fair) so I need to deal with her handing out her phone number to men, so I clarified that maybe I feel uncomfortable with her handing out her number to guys clearly trying to have sex with her.  
  
She says that she had no way of knowing that the guy was hitting on her during their conversation, and that it wasn't until afterwards when he texted her about the rave she felt like the guy reminder her of a manipulative ex. She told me that she probably would have texted the guy to get coffee and talk the next day had he not texted her first, and I was like ""hold up a minute, what?"" That's a date. Going to get coffee with a guy is a date, right?   
  
People of Reddit, if you talked with someone for two hours, asked for their number and got it, then the next day they ask you to go out and get coffee with them, would you believe that you were on a date? I certainly would. 

My girlfriend got more upset, telling me that getting coffee with a guy is not a date, and that I'm unreasonably suspicions of people's motivations. I told her that I felt like that plan, and the fact that she felt that plan was okay, made me feel disrespected and disrespectful to our relationship. She asked if I would feel that way if she met a girl and got coffee with her. I thought about it and said that if the girl was lesbian I might. My girlfriend asked my why, and I told her that lesbian women and men are the two demographics interested in having sex with her. My girlfriend challenged me to find the difference between a date and coffee with a friend, which I struggled to really define a solid line. So, my girlfriend told me that, until she knew the guy was trying to sleep with her, she was just getting coffee with a friend and not going on a date.

I still wasn't really feeling good about the situation, and I think my girlfriend was trying to reassure me, so she told me that she wasn't attracted to the guy at all, she just really enjoyed the conversation. Having deep talks is her favorite thing in the world so she would never pass an opportunity up. She told me she would never physically cheat on me, which I believe. If she ever cheated on me, she said, it would be an emotional cheating situation. I don't know why she thought that would help the situation, but it didn't. 

My girlfriend told me that I need to work on my trust issues, and that she hadn't done anything wrong. It's true that I have a hard time trusting people. I've gotten upset with her twice when I felt like she ignored me to talk to men we don't know at bars. But I've also had a mutual acquaintance tell my girlfriend she wasn't doing me right by talking and dancing with other guys at a bar that I wasn't there with them, and once during a mushroom trip my girlfriend told me that she and my best friend had a ""will-they-wont-they"" dynamic which I've had a had time getting over. 

My girlfriend says that she has a flirty personality and never intends to come across the way she does. She told me that we need our relationship to be based on trust, and I want to trust her, but these situations keep coming up and making me suspicious, which makes my girlfriend mad because she ""didn't do anything wrong."" I don't want to live my life being suspicious and expecting her to cheat, but I also don't want to be a sucker. 

My girlfriend told me that she felt like her personality was being crushed because talking her natural way, meeting and spending time with strangers and going to events like dancing would upset me. I've never tried to stop her from going dancing, or meetup events or things like that, I've actually encouraged her to try and make friends. I'd love to dance with her, but we are interested in different types (I like organized dances like ballroom, she like improv like drum circles ecstatic dance and contact dance) Even though I never try to stop her, she feels like she forces herself to stop and resents me for it. I told her that I never want her to stop being her or doing the things that interest her for me.

She said that if that was the case I needed to accept her doing things like giving her phone number to guys and getting coffee with them to talk and work on my trust issues. I was kinda done with the conversation so I just nodded until we said our ""I love yous"" and hung up.

She later called me and apologized because she felt like she ""bullied me into agreeing with her."" but I was kinda just done. I thought maybe we resolved things, but I think I was actually just trying not to feel.

Today I felt sick, I kept replaying parts of the conversation over and over trying to figure out if I am being unreasonable or if she is, I've played some parts over so many times I can't remember if its how it actually went down or if its just a memory of a memory. I'm having a hard time focusing at work and just feel this solid pit in my stomach. I'm rethinking our entire relationship and terrified that this is the end.

So, neutral parties out there, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the situation and other perspectives because I just feel lost.",3,1737509081.0,relationship_advice,10,0.8,False

Just wondering if someone has similar experiences as me and has gotten some clarity on diagnosis for themselves. 
So to begin with a little background info, I was put on birth control when I was 13 (I’m now 24) due to painful periods. Like so painful that I was in a fetal position and felt like throwing up. I’ve been on birth control ever since then, however, about a month and a half ago I stopped my birth control to see what I’m like without it. On birth control, I didn’t experience any cramping or heaviness with my periods. However, now that I’m off of birth control, my periods are back to being horrible. Back in feb of 2023 I started experiencing an achy feeling in my pelvis. It got so bad that I went to the ER and they found nothing on the CT scan or ultrasound. They found some leukocytes in my urine, gave me some antibiotics, and sent me home. The antibiotics helped for a few days but then I noticed that the pain was there again. That pain lasted for months. I tried to focus on my health and calming my nervous system. I found some relief. Then in September of 2023, I had a kidney stone which led to a horrible UTI. After passing the kidney stone, I continued to feel urinary urgency, pelvic pressure/ache, and a general discomfort in my bladder. At this point I had an xray of my kidneys which showed that there were no more kidney stones and I had urine cultures which shows that I no longer had a uti infection. After countless doctors and negative urine cultures, I found a urogynecologist who told me that I have interstitial cystitis. He put me on hydroxyzine and told me all about the IC diet. For a while my hydroxyzine was working. It was like a reset that prevented huge flares. I also found that coffee and carbonated drinks cause my symptoms to be worse. I also noticed that while on my period, it seemed as if my urinary issues completely disappeared. This past December of 2024, I had a positive uti test. Since then I’ve felt urinary frequency, achy in my back, bladder, and pelvis, and a burning sensation. I have negative urine cultures yet again. I’m not sure if the uti set off my bladder inflammation or going off of hormonal birth control or maybe a combination of both. My first period off of birth control this past month was painful, heavy, and had many clots. Could this be bladder endometriosis? My urogynecologist said that endo and IC were “evil twins.” Sorry for the long post, it’s just that living with this on a daily basis for almost 2 years has been exhausting and I just want some validation and clarity.

Vintage Radio - My favorite of the group, I now know plum is my favorite note in fragrances. My signature has always been 1 million lucky but it is about to runout. I haven’t saw any reviews about good lucky clones. Reviews I’ve saw said al shuyukh doesn’t have hazelnut in it which I love. (Recommendations?) Anyway. Amazing yummy cologne which smells like a very mature candy. 9/10 

Qahwah- after maceration (literally 2 weeks and I’m sure it will get better) the synthetic smell went down a ton! Coffee at first like everyone else says dies out soon, yummy smell as well but you have to like this type of scent. (I’m learning what I do and don’t like more and more, all I do is blind buy lol) 7.9/10

Jasoor- sweet/ dark? Pretty good scent 7.5/10

Cremo- spice and vanilla bomb! 6.5/10

Oud for glory- first cologne with oud in it (I think) smells woody and clean! Nothing too complex but smells like a mature clean guys scent. 7/10

Kayaan classic- never smelled Dior homme intense but I’m sure this is what it smells like idk why 😂I apparently don’t like Iris and this is way too powdery for me. One of the few scents I don’t like because I don’t dislike much. Don’t regret buying it because I just like having a collection but if I were getting essentials only this is a no go 4/10

Maison Alhambra Winsome- great smell, weren’t sure what patchouli is but I like it! Green and sweet! I would even say it’s a versatile scent and could be someone’s signature. 7.3/10

Afnan 9pm- close to ultra male. Great for the price. When I want to be loud and sweet I’ll throw this on 8/10

Qaed Al fursan- pineapple, that’s all. Not a bad scent but very linear to me. Smells good, just pineapple. 6.9/10

Iconic- great blue scent. Wish I knew what Bleu da Chanel smelled like but I think this is a bit cheaper smelling if I had to guess. I like it so easy to wear. 8.2/10

Untold- wow wow wow. So close to br540. If you want to smell like money, unique and a safe scent (imo) buy this. Probably top 3 in my collection and almost a must buy. Can be special event or everyday wear. 9/10

Mandarin sky- yummy orange mature candy. Great scent good performance. 8/10

Also a pic of my whole collection, photo of my watch list as well. If you could please tell me which colognes would be redundant to own and which you would say get. Thanks!

Take these with a grain of salt. Still learning fragrances. Enjoying growing my
Collection. Thanks

Looking to refresh your living space with a timeless aesthetic? Neutral living room ideas offer the perfect blend of elegance and comfort, creating a soothing sanctuary that never goes out of style. 

By incorporating a palette of soft greys, creamy whites, and muted beiges, you can craft a space that feels both airy and inviting.

Start with a plush, neutral-toned sofa as the centerpiece, then layer in textured throws and cushions for added warmth. A statement rug in subtle hues can tie the room together while adding a touch of sophistication. 

Don’t forget to play with different materials—wooden coffee tables, metal accents, and woven baskets all contribute to a balanced, harmonious look.

Lighting plays a crucial role in enhancing a neutral living room. Opt for soft, ambient lighting with floor lamps or pendant lights that cast a warm glow, perfect for unwinding after a long day. 

To add a personal touch, incorporate minimalist artwork or a gallery wall in black and white to keep the vibe cohesive.

I had a recent crush on someone that only lead to stress and left me wondering.

This past weekend I went on a date with a new person. I really wasn't expecting much. We had only planned lunch. We met up and she is absolutely amazing. Engaging with her was like reconnecting with an old friend. We ended up going to get dessert afterwards and chatted for a while longer followed by just driving around, talking, and ended up at a coffee shop.

I made sure to open the car door for her, walk on the street side of the sidewalk, and made sure to keep eye contact within a comfortable means. 

We have already planned a second date. But I mentioned that I, as a man, usually put effort into planning everything, she stated that not one person should shoulder the weight of planning a day together. I then expressed how much I appreciate her for that and that I like how we are working together. That it will help us create a healthy habit of planning and problem solving together.

I still have a long way to go, but this has been the best experience that I have had in a while. I don't feel the need to constantly text her. I don't feel anxious. I only feel at ease. 

But I know I am looking at things with rose colored glasses. I would like some outside opinions and advice. Is her wanting to help a significant green flag? What are things I can do to help

I just want to rant and vent what I’ve been holding inside. I currently a day job work in retail. In a small grocery store in this small shopping area. The only other few stores are a coffee shop, a small indie book store, a brunch restaurant. 

I don’t know where to begin, it started off nice but it progressively gotten worse. I’ve asked a few times at least twice have I told hr and the store director. I’ve expressed interest in being moved to a different department. The assistant manager got a person from bakery pregnant. Then they both left their job sometime in July. We’ve been short a manager for our department

There’s a coworker who’s been working there for over 6 years. I don’t really get along with her all that well. She can be over bearing and micromanaging. Asking me personal questions like where I go for lunch and what I eat for lunch. I have severe anxiety and an eating problem. She seems to invade my personal space. Stays longer than she needs to, clocked on or off. Brings her shopping cart and parks in the walk way, and or between the kitchen doors, or even inside the kitchen. 

Literally as she’s about to leave she finds things for me or someone else to do. I was going to print out labels for the sandwiches I was making. She intervened and printed them out for me. The wrong labels. On the days where she works a later shift, she Tells me it’s time to leave and that I can go home now. She also keeps tabs on my schedule like which days i have off and when I leave. She takes a copy of the schedule and writes me name and days off in thick black sharpie. Also highlights it too. I don’t like it. 

It seems I’m not doing awful nor am I doing too good. I can see the signs that they don’t really want me there. The different uniform and the work. I’m the only other person wearing a different uniform besides the chef who burns the food. I’m try really hard to make it at this job but my efforts don’t seem to be enough. 

I’ve expressed interest in learning how to make some of the more challenging foods. This one meal in particular, they literally make that meal when I’m not there or on my days off. I was told that I would learn how to make a pasta salad from a different coworker. She was making it when I wasn’t in the kitchen. 

I use to make sandwiches until the bakery manager’s mother-in-law wanted her old job. So I only make sandwiches on the weekends. We’re currently understaffed so I quite literally the only person behind the counter on sandwiches. From morning and I don’t really her more help until 1 or 2 or 3 in the afternoon. There are two other people in the morning but they have to go to the kitchen to finish what they’re doing. 

There was a boy who was single at the time and I really liked him but another girl didn’t like the attention he was giving me. It seems she drove a wedge. He has since moved departments last summer and he works as a cashier now. I’ve been trying to avoid him. It’s hard for me to buy my lunch when I don’t really know when he’ll come in. He literally works different hours and different days. 

One of my best friends in my department is dating someone and he got her a job where we work. she works in another department. People around me are in relationships while I’m alone. No friends or family to talk to. Now, my best friend had just put in his two weeks this month and now works at a hotel downtown. 


I mean the job offers decent benefits and I like hanging out with some of the people that work there. I don’t really want to leave but it seems to be getting to that point. I don’t really see any major changes to my current schedule or tasks. To make me want to get quit. Idk if I should continue to stick it out or leave now while I still can. This job is close by and walking distance since I don’t have a car. Midwest 23f

Sooooo dating apps really suck. Like really. And maybe Reddit is better. Maayyybeee??
I have made a post on here a while ago and I did have some semi success. With the occasional catfish -but I shall get to that later. Well, texting success. But I really enjoy talking to people and on top of that, I'm a kink friendly hopeless romantic. A hopless romantic that is always open for connections, whether platonic or romantic. Don't get me wrong, short-term fun is, well....fun. But I am at a stage where I much rather prefer quality, a genuine connection and similar (kinky) interests. Like, lets actually like each other.

Me, myself and I: 
I'm a 29 South European living in Western Europe. I'm petite, curvy-slim, brown hair, brown eyes. I got arms and legs too. 
I turn into a hermit homebody in the winter since I hate the cold and my Vitamin D supplements keeps me alive anyways. I do like to play games (playing Link's Awakening atm), watch my fill of true crime shows, Netflix shows and honestly, whatever is good. I do have a guilty pleasure for reality TV... don't judge me!!
Now in the summer, I still need to take Vitamin D supplements but I love being outside, swim wherever possible, have picnics with friends and go to local food and wine festivals. Ohh! And I almost forgot! I love food. Big foodie! And coffee. Black coffee. 

You, yourself and you:
You're a 27-38 years old human and DDF (as am I). And yes, I do have a preference for Asian Males. Why? I have my theories. Feel free to psychoanalyse me.

And my official anti-catfish advocacy. Please only message me if you have the intention to verify, whether by photo or video. We both deserve to be talking to a real person, not an imaginary one. And also don't steal pictures from other people, people!! 

What I am looking for: 
A genuine connection. Ideally in a perfect world I would like to meet if we get along. Does distance matter? Kindaaa? But also not really. I'm okay with it, if you're okay with it. Mental, emotional and sexual chemistry are very important to me, and in my opinion it makes or breaks a relationship. Ohh, but if you make me laugh, you got me. You cook? I'll be your forever dishwasher <3
And yes, attraction also plays a role, so let's see if we find each other attractive and send me a pic of you? You'll get one back! Promise!

I write too much. I shall stop. If you made it this far come and say hi!

I'm pretty analytical and love data in general. I used ""Forest"" as a time-tracking app to help me stay on track. There are tons of alternative apps like ""Flora"" that use the Pomodoro technique to help you stay focused when studying. While it was difficult at times, I was able to work full-time (40 hours/week) while completing J1. However, my job allowed me a little bit of downtime some days when I could sneak in a bit of studying.

In case you're unfamiliar with the structure of the program, there are 4 semesters - J1, J2, S1, and S2. For J1, there are 3 classes: Clinical Nursing Foundations, Holistic Health Assessment, and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles.

**Promoting Healthy Lifestyles:**

This class was incredibly easy. There weren't any exams and the biggest time commitment was the project where you choose a positive habit to add to your schedule. I recommend putting in the work to add the habit. The point of this class is to help you manage the stress of nursing school. This course didn't have any exams and ended early. In total, I spent 11 hours completing work for this class throughout the entire semester - averaging 1 hour and 54 minutes per week.

**Clinical Nursing Foundations**

This was the most challenging course for me. I don't have a medical background and struggled with some of the nuances they expect you to already know. This is the course that is connected to your clinical but I split up the tracking of time spent studying for the course and time spent completing assignments for clinical. I enjoyed clinical and highly recommend getting to know your cohort. I spent by far the most amount of time on this course. I found it helpful to thoroughly fill out the study blueprint using lectures and the textbook. However, if I were to do it again, I would have spent more time trying to teach the information and having more study sessions with my cohort. Student Success is also a great resource for practice questions. I spent a total of 190 hours and 47 minutes on the course - averaging 14 hours and 23 minutes per week. 

For clinical, I tracked the amount of time completing assignments, not the amount of time at clinical. In J1, you spend most of clinical filling out paperwork and getting to know the systems since you have such little medical knowledge. I spent a total of 37 hours doing the assignments - averaging 3 hours and 42 minutes a week. 

**Holistic Health Assessment**

This class and Clinical Nursing Foundations are very similar and people often either struggle with Holistic or with Foundations. I enjoyed this course but it's a big time commitment. Focus on the charts in the textbook - that's the basis of the entire class. The office hours are great and Student Success has fantastic resources. I spent a total of 144 hours and 49 minutes studying for this class - averaging 12 hours and 3 minutes a week. 

**Overall Time Commitment**

For J1 I studied an average of 32 hours and 2 minutes a week. There is a lot of content to go over but if you stay ahead of assignments and start studying early you can feel confident when taking the exams. I tried to have all my blueprints completed a minimum of 3 days before the exam and spent the rest of the time doing practice problems and working on my memory aid. 

I wish you all the best of luck in Nursing School and hope this information helped. I don't think I could have stayed motivated without my study buddy so I recommend finding someone willing to spend hours at a coffee shop studying with you.",4,1737507215.0,utarlington,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

1i6ydia,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1i6ydia/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible.

I am currently in my early 20s living with my sister while I work a job at a coffee shop and at a retail place. I have an undergrad degree in envsci and I’m trying to look for jobs that will help support me living on my own as I’ve lived with her for a long time now. I really need to keep searching and applying but I have very little motivation to do anything and I really dislike the city I’m living in. Being in nature really helps my mental state but I’m living in a California city with no rain and no nature. All I feel like I’m capable of is eating and sleeping, I eat way too much sugar and I am tired all of the time. My depression isn’t bad where I’m feeling down about myself, I almost feel like a robot toy with low batteries if that makes sense. When I was in school I loved to read and do work and I would have energy during the day but now I literally can’t get myself to do anything but sleep during my free time that I have to be searching for new jobs. I workout twice a week, take walks everyday and eat healthy for the most part ( esp healthy meals but I eat a lot of candy at night). I feel like I’m doing everything I’m supposed to and it’s still not working. ",1,1737506621.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

It's completely free I remember that, I also remember it being pixels. Each world was like a different website or something. They had like coffee shops, places to change you avatar, you could even design your own place and stuff. Course there was nsfw stuff on there too. It's kinda like pony town except without ponies.
