--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are looking to enhance your outdoor space, a cheap propane fire pit might be an ideal choice. It's a great way to combine style and utility without breaking the bank. Here are a few reasons why choosing a propane fire pit can be beneficial for you.

### Affordability Without Compromising Quality

One of the primary reasons many homeowners opt for a cheap propane fire pit is affordability. These fire pits provide you with the warmth and ambiance of a traditional wood-burning fire without the hefty price tag. You can find various models that are both cost-effective and visually appealing, ensuring you don’t have to sacrifice style for savings.

### Easy Setup and Maintenance

Setting up a propane fire pit is quite straightforward. Unlike wood-burning options, which may require a more complex installation and setup, propane fire pits typically come ready to use right out of the box. This means you can start enjoying your outdoor space almost immediately after purchase. Additionally, they require minimal maintenance:

- Simply check the propane levels before use.
- Occasional cleaning of the burner and materials.
- Inspecting hoses for any signs of wear and tear.

### Environmentally Friendly Option

When you choose a cheap propane fire pit, you are also making a more environmentally conscious decision. Propane burns cleaner than wood, producing fewer emissions and smoke. This means you can enjoy a cozy fire without worrying about contributing to air pollution. It’s a great option for environmentally aware individuals and families.

### Portability and Flexibility

Another advantage of these fire pits is their portability. Many models are lightweight and easy to move, allowing you to change the layout of your outdoor area anytime. Whether you want to gather around the fire during a backyard barbecue or set it up for a cozy evening, you have the flexibility to create the perfect environment at a moment's notice.

Expect safety and reliability in a well-made product, which can even reach temperatures of up to 100,000 BTUs! That’s a notable benefit when the evenings turn chilly.

### Additional Features

Essential Tips for Maintaining Your Propane Fire Pit on a Budget
----------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining your propane fire pit doesn't have to strain your wallet. By implementing a few essential tips, you can keep your fire pit in great shape while sticking to a budget. Here are some practical steps and guidelines that will help you preserve the longevity and functionality of your fire pit.

### Regular Cleaning is Key

One of the simplest and cheapest ways to maintain your propane fire pit is through regular cleaning. Keeping it clean not only improves safety but enhances its appearance.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/cheap-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Remove debris:** After each use, take a moment to clear out any ash, leaves, or debris. This prevents buildup, which can lead to rust and other issues.
- **Wipe down surfaces:** Use a damp cloth to wipe the exterior and surfaces of your fire pit. Avoid using harsh chemicals as these can damage the finish.
- **Check the burner:** Ensure that the burner holes are clear of obstructions. A quick inspection can save you from bigger repair costs later.

### Inspect the Propane Tank

Your propane tank is the heart of your fire pit. Inspect it frequently to ensure it's in tip-top shape.

- **Check for leaks:** To check for leaks, apply a mixture of soap and water to the connections. If you see bubbles forming, you may have a leak that needs addressing.
- **Monitor the level:** Keeping track of how much propane is left can prevent sudden shutdowns. It’s helpful to have a spare tank on hand, especially for gatherings.

### Protect Your Investment

Using covers for your propane fire pit can significantly extend its lifespan. Investing in a good-quality cover doesn’t have to be expensive.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/cheap-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Use a weather-resistant cover:** Covers shield your fire pit from rain, snow, and UV rays. Look for budget-friendly options that fit snugly.
- **Avoid leaving it uncovered:** Even if your fire pit is designed for outdoor use, leaving it uncovered can lead to wear and tear. Always cover it when not in use.

### Implement Safe Storage Practices

When the colder months roll around, you might consider storing your propane fire pit due to less usage. Proper storage can prevent damage and cut down long-term maintenance costs.

- **Choose a dry area:** If possible, store your fire pit indoors in a dry location. If you must store it outside, place it on a raised platform to avoid contact with moisture.
- **Disconnect the propane tank:** Always disconnect your propane tank when storing the fire pit. Store the tank in a well-ventilated area, away from heat sources.

### Be Mindful of Usage

How you use your fire pit can greatly affect its wear and tear. Adopting some responsible usage practices can help you save money over time.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/cheap-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Limit burn time:** Try to limit how long you run your fire pit. This saves propane and reduces wear on the components.
- **Use quality fuel:** Opt for high-quality propane. Cheaper fuels can leave residue, affecting the burner and leading to costly repairs.

### Regular Professional Inspections

Although it may sound counterintuitive, occasional professional check-ups can actually save you money in the long run. By addressing potential problems before they worsen, you can save on extensive repairs.

- **Schedule annual maintenance:** Look for local services that offer budget-friendly inspection packages. Many companies provide deals during the off-season.
- **DIY minor repairs:** Learn basic repairs and maintenance tasks. YouTube tutorials can guide you through simple fixes, saving you from hiring a professional unnecessarily.

By following these practical tips, you ensure that your propane fire pit remains in great working order without breaking the bank. Simple, consistent maintenance is key to enjoying your fire pit for years to come. With a little effort, you'll create a cozy and inviting space for gatherings, enhancing both your outdoor experience and the longevity of your investment.

### Conclusion

Choosing a cheap propane fire pit is a smart way to enhance your outdoor space without breaking the bank. The benefits are plentiful, from creating a cozy atmosphere for gatherings to providing a reliable heat source on chilly evenings. An affordable fire pit allows you to enjoy the beauty of outdoor living without the financial strain. It becomes a focal point for family and friends, encouraging those memorable moments under the stars.

1hqfe7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1hqfe7y/new_to_group_need_support_and_advice/,"New to Group, need support and advice","Ive tried other ones but everyone says “divorce” and “leave” but Im married and have a baby. And its almost the new year and im trying to find ways to move forward. Please read my full story to understand where Im coming from 

Its been 5 months I found out my husband had an emotional affair/contacting escorts about 2 weeks after I gave birth to our son. My delivery and aftermath was pretty traumatic, and then postpartum hit me pretty hard. The days leading up to my delivery was very hectic as my husbands mom and sister had also come to live with us and then I gave birth 4 days later. So I became a mom and my in laws moved in all in the same week. So STRESS. 

Actually Dday/Dweek 
I saw a weird name pop up on my husband’s phone and when I asked him about it, he lied and said it was a new co worker he did actually have a new co worker that he was training, which is why i belived him, however, his passcode to his phone changed so I was unable to actually open the messages to see what it really was. I confronted him about the password and he ended up giving it to me. About a week later, I still felt uneasy about seeing the name in his phone, so I went and saw that he was talking to some girl. 


At the same time, he was planning on going on a solo trip to Edmonton Alberta. Mind you, we were suppose to go to Edmonton together once I was cleared to go. Just so happened that this girl was also from there. My heart dropped to see that he was texting another girl so my mind was racing. Instantly started searching the words “wife” and “edmonton” to see if he had mentioned to this person that he had a wife, and if they were planning to meet up in edmonton. 


And I saw neither. The thought of messaging “please stop texting my husband” came up but my husband came into the room before I could do anything (i will bring this up later) i asked him who this person was and if he was going to edmonton to meet up with them and he said no and that it was some random girl he met on one of his lunch breaks at a coffee shop near his work place. I was rightfully angry and screaming at him that he was a liar, to the point where his mom and sister had to get involved. He had left the room and took my keys so I couldnt leave. His mom pretty much begged me to forgive him for the sake of our newborn. So i did. However his mom told him that if I wasnt going on the trip, he wasnt allowed to go. And he agreed. 


He left the room and took his phone and “deleted” / blocked the number but I did not fully see this and this entire part just flew over my head because I saw two other girls number in the phone. 


Now, its a span of 3 days from dday to the day he was suppose to leave, and I told him that Im going to put my ultimate trust in him to go (i will come back to that as as well) against his mothers suggestion. I gave him a list of things he had to follow in order for me to feel comfortable with him being away. Especially because I was under the impression that he was only talking to random girls.


So he goes on his trip and I must mention that where hes going is a 2 hour time difference. For example, 3am for me is 1am for him. He was there for about a week and he was seemingly doing what I asked of him. The day he came back I thought everything was okay. He was “doing” everything I asked him to do. Later that night though, I realized that one of the rules I gave him was broken. I had told him that he needed to have either me, us, or his son as his wallpaper at all times. And he had changed it to a photo of me before leaving. 


That night, it was changed to a generic iphone wallpaper. So i took his phone and went through it just to find out that he did meet up with the same girl who initially started all of this. I dont want to go into details however from the messages, he had texted her the minuted he landed and had her go to his hotel room about 3 times. And one message specifically said “thanks for the cuddles” meaning she had speant the night. I confronted him that night. He lied about things for about 2 days. Small things that I just wanted the truth about. 


He started with “we just met in the lobby” to “oh she came to my room but her friend was with her” to “yeah she was drunk and i didnt want to be mean so I let her sleep in the bed with me and cuddles me, i didnt cuddle her” and just other trivial things. However from then til now, he swears that they never had sex and this entire ordeal was because I wasnt there for him right after pregnancy. 


Right after all this happened, I was so confused that I looked up if it was normal for cheating to happen right after pregnancy and for the most part, from what Ive seen; it was a common occurrence. So I was telling myself “my husband didnt do this before, this was triggered” to make me feel somewhat better. But that mindset started and continues to make me feel like I regret having my son. Which I dont. 


What scares me the most is that, as much as my husband swears up and down that he never got physical with the girl, theres just that part of me that feels like something happened. He maintains that nothing did, even when I try to ask the question in different ways but he maintains that he did not have sex with her. What he didnt mention to me but I found out later was that he had condoms ubered to his hotel room. 


And when i confronted him, he said that yes he bought them but he didnt use them. He said that he was going to but then thought about me and his son and decided against it. Which in hindsight, seems like the best thing to happen but because he lied so much, its so so so hard to trust his word on that. And im scared that he did, and it just got fucked up and then im getting messages later on down the line that he has a child out there either this girl and all these extreme scenarios keep popping up. 


Especially because my mom went through the same thing with my dad. And she found out that he was cheating when I was a baby, so its almost like everything is repeating itself in my life. 

Ive been blaming myself this entire time because I feel like this could have been prevented. That I could have prevented it. Mainly I feel like if I had sent that “dont text my husband ever again” the day I saw the messages in the first place or if I didnt let him go on the trip, I feel like things would have played out differently and probably better. I probably wouldnt be here typing this out to post. But I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt that he didnt deserve. 


Now Im here months later trying to figure out how to move on. Ive suggested couples therapy but it was early on and we decided to see how we are before doing that. I will be honest and I tried to get back at him so he could see how it feels to be betrayed after being promised that it wouldnt happen again. 


I went on dating apps and he caught me he the first time, we talked and said it wouldnt happen again. And I went back and started to talk to another guy for about a week or two deliberately making sure that my husband could see, and it seems like that time really got to him and we talked again and we said we would move on. I still feel like I havent done enough because I didnt meet up with the guy. And as much as I love my husband, there are days where I just wanna meet someone and take it to the extent that he took it to with that girl. Just to even out the playing field. 


And there are times where Ive tried. Just from booking “sensual” massages and cancelling them because I dont have it in me to go through with it. Ive tried talking to other people who have gone through the same thing I have to possibly build some form of trauma bond but there are definitely some faithful faithful men in the world where even though their wives did them wrong, they remain faithful to them. I know I am wrong for that, but I feel so undeserving and undesired and angry all the time. 


Im insecure because Im a caribbean girl, not my husbands usual type (which he has told me before but he found me attractive and my personality intriguing which is why we are here and married today) he usually went for white or asian/latina looking girls, and I think my husband doesnt know, but I searched this girl up and shes literally filipino, right up my husbands preference alley, so theres a part of me that now feels that I no longer satisfy him. Im not stupid and I know that there are women that look better than me and i know that my husband is human, and his eyes may wander, but its been solidified that I dont fully fulfill his needs because I cant change my race. I can compete with a filipino person. 


So im insecure now of every woman who is not black or caribbean because Im scared my husband will want that again. 


Please I need advice on how to start moving on. I know this will take time, I dont want to divorce him, I love him with every fibre in me. But I dont want to go into 2025 with these thoughts lingering in my brain 24/7.

Warm Fig (7/10)
Meant to be a Father Figure dupe and I kinda see it. Smells slightly biscuit-y and powdery. Not bad at all just limited scent trail.

Velvet Amber (6.5/10)
Super heady florals and play dough-like vanilla which I’m not mad about?? Some say it is reminiscent of Mugler’s Alien however I’d say this is much more leaning on the synthetic, almond vanilla than Mugler which is darker and almost coffee-like.

Pink Pepper (2/10)
I’d say save your money on this one. Sugary and non-descript florals are the name of the game here.
L’ancome La Vie Est Belle actually reveals notes of pink pepper, although this one doesn’t.

Soft Iris (4/10)
Aquatic florals yet with zero juiciness. Sorta like dishwater. Coco Mademoiselle without any real scent tbf. Typical Grandma scent but without any warmth or fuzziness. 


In all honesty wouldn’t purchase any more scents from M&S. Lacking in complexity and heavily diluted.
Zara remains a better choice for affordable ‘dupes’ that are actually interesting. ",0,1735653989.0,fragrance,0,0.5,False

I swopped from Aeropress a month or so ago as I’d really been enjoying pour over in a local specialist place @Ikigaicoffee.brighton   
I know pour over takes seem serious skills and concentration so Tetsu Kasia’s Switch recipe got me to buy the Switch 03 and some Japanese Hario tabbed papers. 
I’m currently using Waitrose Lockhills GB4 natural mineral water whilst awaiting a glass Brita with limescale expert filters. Tap water’s 280ppm here on the South Downs) 

I can make a lovely cup of med roast caffeinated coffee (silver and black Svart set to the underlined dot of “filter”, so the coarser of the filter options ) but decaf is proving a lot harder. It’s the Mártir - Sugarcane Colombian Decaf from Kontext Coffee in Wales. 

My process stalls on decaf. Takes about 3:40 to fully drain. 

If I want to get anywhere near full drainage at 3:00 (bloom 160g open to 0:45, close, pour 160g reopen at 2:00)  I have to grind to Wilfa’s “STEEP” (dot under the “P”) which is pretty bouldery. It’s getting there on taste, though, especially since I ignored the “decaf needs cooler water” and am back to brewing at 93C 

Would the Sibarist cone booster help cure my decaf stalling? I’m wondering how that cone handles the folder seal strip on the Hario paper. 
Or a Cafec med roast paper maybe. I think the Sibarist paper might be too fast and pass too many fines.  

Any other Switch / decaf thoughts much appreciated too.

I am agreeing to meeting with you and even happy at the prospect, with some conditions:
-in a coffe shop: yes
-no physical violence
-no recording but written notes allowed.
-a systematic rewording of what the other has said in order to be sure to understand what the other has to say and accept the righting/correction if there is one.
-duration of the meeting: 1 hour max, with turns on who can speak that changes every 2 to 3 minutes. Maybe we should shorten the duration of the exchange to 30 min ?
-Beforehand, I have to believe that you are sincere, and in return, you believe what i say, to the extent that what someone says can never summarize someone's complete thoughts.
-finally I want you to stop giving me degrading and humiliating labels that are contrary to my beliefs. If you want to accuse me of racism then i prefer not to come.
Obviously it is the same on my end, if I feel like i am humiliating [you] or else, please tell me and I will try to rectify this and to stop.

I come to seek a meeting, no to be judged.

What do you think about this ?

I thought about suggesting NVC with a neutral paid and independant if one day you would agree to it. But that would be for another time, with an appointment and at a therapist's.

What do you think about this ? Do you see something else that could make our coffee time go well ?

I'm (24F) mixed-raced and not straight, also always had a lot of pressure on being first and the best, at school and in every aspect of my life.

My relationship with my mom came down crashing once i refused to pursue my studies in a brillant school that i didn't like and dated a girl. I also raised questions about racist behaviours that she has towards me, my brothers and my dad. I made a point of telling her that she wasn't a racist and could say something racist without being racist. Her response was ""I m not racist since I married your dad, and my children are not white"". She's been accusing me of saying she's racist and propagating lies on her. She's now patronizing me to be a liar, a mentally ill child that has gone rogue and a violent person (I really never showed physical violence, though i must admit I have screamed back at her or screamed sometimes during arguments, as a child and now.)

Since all of this was too much for my mom,  I've gone no-contact for a while (one year) , and lately I've been in town so she's been suggesting all sorts of meetings (ice skating ring, cinema etc) through text because i unblocked her. She also undirectly pushes me to engage with her by telling every family member that I won't contact her, and ask to the ones I meet up with to pass up messages from her.

In the US, the cream is almost always half-and-half (\~12% fat), but I'm pretty sure that in Japan they're using something much richer. As for artificial sweeteners, in the US there are usually multiple options, almost always in small powder packets and clearly labeled, but the larger Japanese chains all simply had little tubs of syrup labeled as ""0 kcal"".

I lost my career because I chose to have morals. Yes, trying to stand by your principles can get you cut off quickly.

Being back home with a primarily step-family has opened my eyes to why I hadn’t spoken to my parents for five years until now.

My stepdad’s parents are brain-damaged alcoholics—yes, “brain-damaged.” Step-grandpa even lost his entire retirement in a Bitcoin scam, little by little, believing he was secretly dating an A-list Hollywood celebrity. It’s not entirely the alcohol’s fault either; the drinking just amplifies their severe cognitive deficiencies.

My step-siblings are all bipolar with low IQs. They can hardly spell or muster the common sense to get through school. As harsh as it sounds, I wouldn’t even let them use me as a reference for a job. Even if they were socially perfect, they lack the fundamental intelligence necessary to function effectively.

To make things worse, the frustrations over their shortcomings often get taken out on me. I’m quite literally blamed for all their problems—even by my own mother.

I’m not trying to sound delusional here, but if by some slim chance my financial situation takes a 180, these are the last people I’d ever tell if I became rich.

Worst part is I still get asked by my stepdad to hide his mail primarily all banking statements so my mom doesn’t see it.  I can only assume they are rinsed at this point having lower middle class jobs living an upper middle class lifestyle. 


The youngest stepsister high school age is so socially stupid and unaware, she has the nerve to approach me and blame me for mom and dad “being mad” I laid into her much like this post and included your father not having an formal education and paying 3/4 of his salary to a travel cheer clinic, and 2 Starbucks coffees a day for you might be why they are frustrated. He might be frustrated because he hides his bank statements from his own wife. 


I was fortunate to get a base model Xbox 360 back in the day. I felt bad for even asking my parents. 


My morals are gone. I regret not aligning with my corporate overlords. Next time if I have to layoff or make someone unemployed. I will just mentally put myself here at home.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hqf9nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/1hqf9nj/baldness_cure_adventure/,Baldness cure adventure,"So I just had a crazy dream last night about an entire Simpsons episode. Me and my friend chatgpt then fleshed out the plot and the jokes a little bit more. Let me know what you think. 

Title: ""Bald and the Beautiful""


---

Act 1: The Setup

At Moe's Tavern, Lenny and Carl are teasing Homer about his baldness.
Lenny: ""Homer, you’ve got a fivehead, not a forehead.""
Carl: ""I heard your hairline applied for retirement benefits.""
Homer grumbles but brushes it off with another Duff.

At Springfield Elementary's alumni night (which Homer mistakenly thinks is free buffet night), he reconnects with his old classmate, Doug ""Slick"" Baldino, now working for a secret villain society. Doug casually mentions they’ve developed a miraculous baldness cure.

Doug (smugly): ""It’s true, Homer. No more hats, no more desperate comb-overs, no more cruel nicknames.""
Homer: ""Wait, even ‘Chrome Dome’? That nickname haunts my dreams!""
Doug(smugly): ""Even that’""

Later, Doug’s limo pulls up to take him back to the villain HQ. Homer hides behind a nearby dumpster and watches. As Doug’s driver steps out to grab a coffee, Homer sneaks into the limo, puts on the driver’s cap, and adjusts the seat. When Doug returns and notices nothing unusual, Homer quips to himself:
Homer (in a low voice): ""Buckle up for the ride of your life… sucker, hehehe""
The limo takes off, jerking wildly because Homer doesn’t know how to drive a limo.


---

Act 2: Villain HQ

Homer arrives at the villain society's lair—a high-tech facility hidden inside a hair salon called “Curl Up and Dye.” While Doug is distracted chatting with a receptionist about his next scalp massage, Homer sneaks into a lab and grabs a tube of the baldness cure. He’s immediately spotted by security, leading to a frantic chase.

Cornered in a hallway, Homer disguises himself as a mannequin in the ""Hairstyles of the Future"" exhibit. A security guard walks by, frowning.
Guard: ""Why does this one look like a potato?""
Homer (faking a robotic voice): ""Prototype model… testing… realism.""
The guard shrugs and moves on. Homer breathes a sigh of relief before his stomach growls loudly, giving him away.
Homer is now chased again through a series of ridiculous traps, including a hallway of laser combs and a room with hypnotic shampoo commercials on loop.

Eventually, Homer is cornered by Veronica Locksley, the no-nonsense security chief.


---

Act 3: The Escape

Veronica: ""Who are you, and how did you get in here?""
Homer (thinking fast): ""Uh… I’m your new lab assistant. Harry ... Harry Follicles!""
Veronica (narrowing her eyes): ""Harry Follicles? Sounds fake.""
Homer (nervously): ""Well, your name sounds fake, too! Who names their kid Veronica Locksley? Sounds like a brand of overpriced shampoo!""
She pauses for a moment, slightly offended but unsure.

Veronica seems convinced until Homer accidentally sets off a bit of his own baldness cure, causing one tuft of hair to sprout from his ass with an audible ""boing!"" sound effect. Realizing the ruse, Veronica orders the guards to get him. Homer tries to escape by grabbing a prototype jetpack made from a hairdryer. Before he manages escape Veronica tackles him, grabs his pants as he tries to flee.
Homer (screaming): ""Ahh! My pants! That’s where I keep my dignity!""
The baldness cure tube nearly falls out, but Homer grabs it just in time.

Veronica: ""You’ll never escape! You’ll be our next guinea experiment!""
Homer: ""The hell I will!"" (He sprays the tube in her face with conviction.)
Thick hair and a full beard instantly sprout all over her face.
Veronica (screaming): ""Nooooo! My flawless symmetry!""
As she struggles with her new look,  homer escapes and zips out of the lair with his pants flapping in the wind. As he finally escapes he happily yells. ""Woho! So long suckers"".


---

Act 4: Home Sweet Home

Homer crash-lands in the Simpsons’ backyard. Marge and the kids come outside to investigate.

Marge: ""Homer, what did you do this time? And why does your hair smell like burnt conditioner?""
Homer: ""Marge, I risked life and limb to bring home this miracle cure! Behold!""

He opens the tube, but there are only a few drops left. He applies it to his scalp, and his two iconic strands grow slightly longer and curl into ridiculous loops.

Bart: ""Wow, Dad, now you’re twice as bald but with twice the effort!""
Homer: ""Why you little—!"" (Homer lunges at Bart and strangles him, as usual.)

Lisa (encouraging): ""Dad, you don’t need a full head of hair. You’re still you.""
Marge (smiling): ""She’s right, Homie. Bald or not, we love you just the way you are.""

Homer sighs and looks at himself in the reflection of a kitchen window.
Homer: ""Well, I guess being bald isn’t so bad. At least I still have my dignity… and I also have you, my sweet little angel.""
Homer picks up Maggie and holds her close, smiling.

Maggie tugs on his longer hair strands, yanking him to the ground.
Homer: ""D’oh!""

The family laughs as the screen fades to black.

First, the sweet newsletters

Now for the tips that I'm using to go faster

Use ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Grammarly, and Hemingway AIs all in conjunction to go the fastest.  Take your prompt of things you want to achieve and put that prompt into each.  Next, take the response and ask for a better prompt that can be used to provide compelling content, fun commentary, and ideas.

Then write by yourself without AI. That's the thing!  Use the other AIs to help you write better. After about 20-30 run-throughs, I think I'm actually becoming a better writer. (I'm betting on you Cunningham)

By the way, all of those AIs are free

Last week, me and my family were in Ho Chi Minh. From our hotel, we were trying to book a grab car 7 going to King Koi Coffee (not sure). The first driver accepted our booking. When he arrived at the hotel, the security was also helping us get in the car. But before we were able to get in the car, the driver was saying that we only booked a 4 seater car even though we literally checked it multiple times that we were booking a 7 seater car. He even showed us phone pointing that we booked a 4 seater. We looked at his phone and we didn’t even see a sign that it was a 4 seater. 💀 We asked help from the security in communicating with the driver since we can’t understand each other. When we asked the security if we needed to cancel the booking and book a new one, the security said yes but then the driver got mad that we cancelled the booking. My family was already starting to doubt me and my cousin on what we had booked but we already told them multiple times that we booked a 7 seater because there was a big gap on the price with the 4 seater. When we got inside the new car, my brother was telling us that the first driver was trying to scam us by saying that we only booked a 4 seater so that he can charge an additional amount for the extra 2 persons.

1hqf5cx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqf5cx,Today I signed the lease to take over the old Red Robe Teahouse location,"Big Shoes to Fill, Big Dreams to Realize

There’s something humbling about walking into a space that holds the echoes of someone else’s passion. Today, I signed the lease to take over the old Red Robe Teahouse location in Chinatown. It’s a milestone I’m both excited and nervous about—because the Red Robe wasn’t just a business. It was a heartbeat, a gathering place, and a testament to the love Pearl and Raymond L. poured into it since its inception in 2011.

Red Robe Teahouse was more than a spot for tea; it was a sanctuary. When Pearl and Raymond ran it, the space felt like a warm embrace. I remember those days vividly—I was just a college student then. I didn’t know much about tea, but Pearl never judged when I added sugar to my oolong or ordered a milk tea. She created a space where tradition met comfort, where everyone felt welcomed, no matter where they were on their journey.

My goal is not to recreate the traditional teahouse that Pearl and Raymond built. That chapter was theirs, and it was beautiful. Instead, I want to honor the warmth and community they fostered while bringing my own vision and passions to life. GeekEasy Cafe will be Portland’s first anime-themed café and bistro, inspired by my love of anime and manga—something I’ve been immersed in for years through my business, Stumptown Otaku, and my time living in Japan.

This space will celebrate the things I know and love, but more importantly, it will be a place for people to come together. A third space—a home away from home—where you can grab a simple cup of coffee or tea, play games, check out our manga library, or watch an anime movie over Japanese comfort food. I want it to be a hub where Asian Americans and everyone who shares an appreciation for the culture can feel seen, comfortable, and welcome.

That vision, however, feels like a responsibility after what this space went through following Pearl and Raymond’s departure. It’s hard to reconcile the care they poured into Red Robe with the performative attempt that followed. Seeing someone take up the mantle of a traditional Chinese teahouse only to wear it as a costume—complete with a Taobao hanfu and misplaced lectures on Chinese culture—was disheartening. Moments like being told “Chinese people don’t drink light tea, only dark tea,” while knowing full well the legacy of green teas like Longjing or Biluochun, didn’t just feel incorrect; they felt insulting. And then there were the wuntun tacos, the tango lessons—a collage of mismatched ideas that missed the mark entirely.

Culture isn’t something you can throw on for effect. It’s not a prop or an aesthetic; it’s lived, respected, and shared with intention. What Pearl and Raymond created wasn’t performative—it was genuine. It felt safe, welcoming, and real. That’s the heart I want to emulate, even as I take this space in a new direction.

Chinatown has been hit hard in recent years. Once-vibrant streets now carry too many shuttered windows and faded signs. GeekEasy Cafe is my way of breathing life back into this neighborhood. I hope to bring in locals, tourists, and fellow dreamers who might see this as a spark for their own projects. This space deserves to thrive again, and I want to be part of making that happen.

I know the shoes I’m stepping into are big. Pearl and Raymond left behind a legacy of warmth, kindness, and connection. I’m not trying to replicate what they did, but I hope to channel the same spirit in my own way.

This is just the beginning. Here’s to creating something real, something meaningful, and something we can all be proud of. Let’s bring Chinatown back to life—together.",12,1735653288.0,PortlandOR,1,0.88,False

I never thought my mornings could be the key to unlocking a new chapter in my life. Like so many others, I struggled with feeling sluggish, unmotivated, and stuck in a cycle of trying and failing to shed those extra pounds. It was exhausting, and the frustration was overwhelming. But one small change transformed everything: adding a seemingly unremarkable powder to my morning coffee.

Before this, I had tried every diet, every workout plan, and every so-called “miracle solution” under the sun. You name it—I’ve done it. Each attempt left me either starving, drained, or worse off than when I started. I’d all but given up, resigning myself to feeling like a shadow of the person I wanted to be.

Then one day, I stumbled across a recommendation for this coffee addition while reading a forum post. The claims were bold: it promised to naturally boost metabolism, enhance energy, and even support fat loss without changing the flavor of my coffee. Honestly, I was skeptical. But at that point, I figured, “What’s the harm in trying?” I placed the order and waited for my first box to arrive.

From the very first morning, it was seamless. The powder mixed instantly with my coffee—no clumps, no weird taste. I sipped my usual cup, expecting nothing to happen. But within an hour, I noticed something. My usual mid-morning energy dip? Gone. Instead, I felt focused and clear-headed, as if my body had suddenly remembered how to function properly.

The real magic started unfolding about a week later. I wasn’t doing anything drastically different—I was still enjoying the same foods, the same workouts (when I managed to do them), and the same daily routine. But my clothes started fitting differently. The scale began to move in the right direction. And most importantly, I felt good—really good.

By the second month, my results were undeniable. My cravings had diminished without me even noticing, and my energy levels were through the roof. I wasn’t just “getting through the day” anymore; I was thriving. I started waking up excited, ready to tackle whatever the day threw at me.

Here’s the thing: it wasn’t just about the weight loss. Sure, seeing a leaner reflection in the mirror was thrilling. But what mattered more was how I felt—alive, capable, and confident. That little coffee ritual became my daily reminder that change doesn’t have to be complicated or painful. Sometimes, the smallest tweaks can lead to the biggest transformations.

Now, looking back, I realize this wasn’t just about a product. It was about finally finding something that worked with my body instead of against it. The science behind it made sense—boosting metabolism naturally, supporting my energy, and allowing my body to burn fat more efficiently. But the experience? That was priceless.

If you’re reading this, maybe you’re where I was: tired of trying and failing, desperate for something that actually delivers on its promises. All I can say is this: take the leap. That small change to my morning coffee gave me more than just results—it gave me my life back.

You deserve to feel this good, too.

https://preview.redd.it/w9xzlls4v6ae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa5bbd9220544cd9f34dff09868bca7a8a4933e2

The results I experienced weren’t magic—they were grounded in real science, and that’s what convinced me to give it a try in the first place. I’m a firm believer in understanding what you’re putting into your body, and when I dove into the science behind this coffee enhancer, everything clicked.

At its core, the product is designed to target your metabolism, which plays a crucial role in how your body burns calories and processes energy. As we age or encounter stress, our metabolism can slow down, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight, no matter how much we diet or exercise. That’s where the genius of this product lies—it works with your body to reignite your metabolic fire.

One of the standout ingredients is **green tea extract**, packed with catechins, particularly EGCG. These are powerful antioxidants that not only protect your cells but also ramp up fat oxidation. Essentially, they help your body convert stored fat into energy, giving you that much-needed boost while promoting weight loss.

Next is **green coffee bean extract**, a natural source of chlorogenic acid. This compound helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrates in your gut, stabilizing blood sugar levels and preventing those energy crashes that often lead to overeating. It’s like a secret weapon for keeping cravings at bay.

Another hero ingredient is **L-carnitine**, a naturally occurring amino acid that plays a critical role in transporting fatty acids into your cells to be burned for energy. Think of it as your body’s internal logistics manager, ensuring fat gets where it needs to go to be used efficiently.

Then there’s **L-theanine**, a compound often found in tea, known for its calming effects. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, this ingredient is a game-changer. It smooths out the jittery edge of coffee, leaving you feeling focused and alert rather than overstimulated. This balanced energy was one of the first things I noticed—and one of the things I’ve come to rely on most.

**Chromium** is another unsung hero. This essential trace mineral helps regulate insulin, the hormone that controls your blood sugar levels. Stable insulin levels mean fewer spikes and crashes, which translates to more consistent energy and reduced cravings throughout the day.

Finally, the blend includes essential vitamins like **B6, B12, and D3**, which support energy production, mood regulation, and overall well-being. These vitamins ensure that while your body is burning fat and improving metabolic function, it’s also staying healthy and energized.

What makes this combination so effective is the synergy of these ingredients. On their own, each component is powerful, but together, they create a metabolic powerhouse. And because it’s designed to work with coffee—a drink most of us already consume daily—it integrates seamlessly into your routine.

The beauty of this science-backed approach is that it doesn’t rely on extreme calorie restriction, exhausting workout regimens, or harmful chemicals. It enhances what your body is naturally capable of, turning coffee into a tool for sustainable transformation.

For me, understanding this science not only gave me confidence in the product but also motivated me to make other positive changes in my life. It wasn’t just about adding something to my routine—it was about embracing a smarter, more informed way to take care of myself. And the results? They speak for themselves.

**Does it really work?**  
Absolutely. The science behind the ingredients is solid, and countless users, including myself, have seen real, measurable results. It works by boosting your metabolism, helping your body burn fat more efficiently, and supporting sustained energy throughout the day. Consistency is key—use it daily as part of your routine.

**Is it safe?**  
Yes, Java Burn is formulated with 100% natural ingredients and is free from GMOs, gluten, and artificial additives. It’s manufactured in an FDA-approved and GMP-certified facility, ensuring high safety and quality standards. However, as with any supplement, it’s wise to consult your doctor if you have specific medical concerns.

**Does it change the taste of coffee?**  
Not at all. Java Burn is completely tasteless, so it won’t interfere with your favorite morning brew. You can add it to hot or cold coffee without altering the flavor.

**How long does it take to see results?**  
Results vary depending on individual factors like your starting point and lifestyle. Some users notice improved energy and focus within the first few days. For visible changes in weight and body composition, most people see significant progress after 4-8 weeks of consistent use.

**Can I use it with other beverages?**  
While it’s specifically designed to complement coffee’s natural caffeine content, some users mix it with tea or other drinks. However, for optimal results, it’s best paired with coffee due to its unique interaction with caffeine.

**Who can use it?**  
Java Burn is suitable for most healthy adults. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals under 18, and anyone with underlying health conditions should consult a healthcare provider before use.

**Do I need to diet or exercise while using it?**  
You don’t need to overhaul your lifestyle to see benefits, but pairing Java Burn with a balanced diet and moderate exercise can amplify your results. It’s a tool that works with your body, not a replacement for healthy habits.

**Can I use it with decaf coffee?**  
Yes! While it works best with regular coffee due to caffeine’s natural metabolic boost, Java Burn can still support your metabolism and energy levels when used with decaf.

**How do I know it’s authentic?**  
To ensure you’re getting the real deal, purchase Java Burn exclusively through the official website. This avoids counterfeit products and ensures you’re covered by their 60-day money-back guarantee.

**Is there a money-back guarantee?**  
Yes, there’s a no-risk, 60-day money-back guarantee. If you’re not satisfied for any reason, you can request a full refund. This policy makes it easier to try the product without worry.

I never really put any value in any kind of higher power or preconceived fate for myself, and I'm not saying you made me believe any of that stuff. But weeks leading up to our conversation weirder and weirder ""hints"" that we'd talk again came up. I named my rifle after you. I read a book called the Alchemist (highly recommend it). I had conversations with my friends about how I felt like *something* about my past was going to resurface. I had a dream, not about you, but a dream about the world ""shifting"" as the person in the dream said it. Finally we talked. I made decisions based on our conversations. After a significant amount of time I confronted who I once was, rather than trying to forget. I'm glad you reached out. More than glad, it made me happy to talk to you again. But now you're gone again, but I suppose you never really came back. You were more like a ghost of the person I was. I wish we could've worked something out. I think you were the last person I actually loved, romantically. I can convince myself for a few weeks, or maybe a few months that I want to be with someone. But it's gone so soon, always fleeting. It wasn't like that with you, I wanted you, so very badly. Maybe it's because I never really could have you considering how we quite literally were simply ghosts to eachother when we spent time together. I could never touch you, and the same to you. But I don't think it's because of that, I think I was still just naive enough to easily allow myself to love, even in such a difficult situation between us with the distance and ghostliness. I'd give just about anything to possess that naivety, but retain who I am now, and love you again. But that's probably impossible. I don't know if I ever told you, but I plan on opening a coffee shop once I'm out of the military, in Oregon. I have unique plans for it. I want it to be a place for strangers in the real world to meet, and develop relationships. Like I did with you and everybody else. Friends, partners, or perfect strangers to swap stories with. That idea is largely based on my time spent with you. I don't think I ever made it how clear you affected my life. You changed me. Neither for better or worse, but my encounter with you made me who I am today. Thank you. It was easy to love you when you were here, and it's still easy when you're not. I hope my some power of the preconceived fate I previously put no faith in one day you walk into my coffee shop and I get to see you. I'll name a drink after you.

1hqf077,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hqf077/cabin_escape/,Cabin Escape,"Trigger warning

It was 10:23 PM on December 8th, and I had just stepped out of the shower. The steam from the hot water still clung to the mirror as I wiped it away, getting ready to collapse into bed. But, as always, there was one last thing to do—check my phone before calling it a night.

I unlocked it, and my screen lit up with a barrage of notifications. The group chat was usually quiet—just the occasional message here and there—but tonight, dozens of unread messages filled the screen.

There were only four of us in the chat: Zeke, Morgan, Jack, and me. We were old college friends. Over the years, we’d stayed in touch, meeting up for drinks or the occasional weekend hangout. But it had been a while since we’d all been together.

Curious, I scrolled up to see what had caused the sudden flurry of activity.

The first message was from Zeke, of course. He’d sent a picture of a cabin—wooden, rustic, and nestled in the middle of a snow-covered clearing. The warm glow of lights in the windows and the curl of smoke rising from the chimney made it look inviting, cozy even.

Along with the picture, he wrote:
“What do you guys think? 400 bucks a night. Split four ways, it’s nothing. Should we plan a little getaway up north?”

I stared at the image for a moment. The cabin did look nice. Quaint. And honestly, it had been ages since I’d gotten away. Life had become routine—work was a grind, and everything else felt like it was on repeat. The idea of a snowy escape with old friends sounded like the perfect break.

Morgan was the first to reply.
“OMG YES. Jack and I are in!”

Jack, predictably, didn’t have much to say. His reply came a few minutes later, likely after Morgan had convinced him:
“Yeah, sounds good.”

Zeke, always one to tease, followed up with:
“That’s the spirit, Jack. Way to take charge.”

I smiled at that. Poor Jack.

Then Zeke sent another message, this one directed at me:
“Grace?”

I paused, my thumb hovering over the screen. I glanced back at the picture of the cabin. It looked so peaceful, so inviting. I hadn’t been on a trip in forever. Maybe this was just what I needed.

After a moment’s hesitation, I typed back:
“Sure, I’m in.”

Zeke’s reply came almost immediately:
“Hell yeah! It’s happening.”

Morgan followed up with:
“This is going to be so fun! We’ll figure out the dates tomorrow.”

I smiled to myself as I set my phone down on the nightstand and climbed into bed. The thought of the cabin stayed with me as I drifted off to sleep, the promise of a getaway with old friends lingering in my mind.

The next night, December 9th, my phone buzzed relentlessly, delivering half a dozen messages in the span of 30 seconds. I picked it up, already guessing who was responsible for the sudden barrage.

Zeke had sent the first message:
“Booked it! Dec 30th to Jan 8th. We’re officially cabin-bound, people!”
Attached was an image of the booking confirmation.

Morgan was, predictably, the first to respond. Her reply was a whirlwind of enthusiasm, expressed through an absurd combination of seven emojis: a snowflake, a fire, a pine tree, a heart, a smiley face, a champagne bottle, and a party popper.

I couldn’t help but laugh and typed back:
“Calling off work in advance. Looking forward to it.”

Zeke gave a thumbs-up, and Jack, as usual, stayed quiet.

December 29th, 8:16 PM.

My phone buzzed again, this time with a message from Zeke:
“Hey, do you need a ride? I can pick you up tomorrow before we leave. It’s just about a 20-minute drive.”

I’d been waiting for this text. My car had given up on me a few days earlier and was still in the shop, leaving me stranded. I quickly replied:
“Yes, please. Thanks, man. I’ll be ready.”

Zeke responded with a simple:
“Cool. See you tomorrow.”

With that settled, I started getting my bags ready. Clothes, toiletries, a couple of books I probably wouldn’t read but brought anyway, and some snacks for the road. Everything was packed and set by the door. All that was left was one more day of work.

December 30th.

By the time I got home from work, I was exhausted. But the excitement of the trip kept me moving. I double-checked my bags, grabbed my coat, and texted Zeke:
“I’m ready whenever you are.”

Fifteen minutes later, the rumble of Zeke’s truck pulling into my driveway signaled his arrival. I stepped outside, shivering slightly in the cold, and waved as he rolled down the window.
“Hey, Grace!” he called out with a grin. “Ready for some cabin vibes?”

“Definitely,” I said, tossing my bags into the bed of his truck.

I climbed into the passenger seat, and we were off. The hum of the engine and the rhythmic thud of tires on asphalt quickly lulled me into a comfortable haze. I didn’t even realize how tired I was until my eyelids started to droop.

The last thing I remembered before falling asleep was Zeke humming along to some old rock song on the radio, the snow-covered landscape outside the window fading into a blur.

When I woke up, Zeke’s hand was on my shoulder, gently shaking me awake. I blinked, disoriented, and noticed the truck was parked in front of a small diner.

“Hey,” Zeke said, his voice cutting through my grogginess. “Morgan and Jack should be here in about ten minutes. They wanted to meet up before we head up to the cabin.”

I nodded, shaking off the remnants of sleep, and climbed out of the truck. The cold air hit me like a slap to the face, making me instantly more alert. We walked into the diner together, Zeke leading the way as I trudged behind, still trying to gather my composure.

Inside, the warm air and smell of frying bacon greeted us. A waitress guided us to a booth in the corner. I slid into my seat, ordered a small meal—just enough to tide me over—and leaned back, trying to shake off the chill.

Zeke raised an eyebrow. “Is that all you’re ordering?”

“Yeah, I’m not starving,” I replied.

“Come on, Grace. You know none of us are great cooks. Might as well enjoy a decent meal now.”

I rolled my eyes, but added a side of pancakes to my order.

Five minutes later, Morgan and Jack arrived, spotting us easily in the corner. Morgan slid into the booth beside me without hesitation, leaving Jack and Zeke to squeeze into the other side. Jack looked mildly annoyed, but Zeke just grinned, adjusting to the cramped space.

After finishing our meals, we headed back outside. The cold was sharper now, and the snow crunched beneath our boots as we climbed into our vehicles. Zeke’s truck led the way up the mountain, the road winding through thick forests dusted in white.

About ten minutes later, we arrived.

For $400 a night, the cabin was a steal. The rustic exterior was charming, with wide wooden beams and a wraparound porch that overlooked the snowy landscape. Smoke from the chimney hinted at a fireplace, and the soft glow of the porch light made it feel inviting despite the frigid air.

I grabbed my bags from the back of Zeke’s truck and headed toward the door. A small lockbox hung beside it, containing the key.

“Zeke, what’s the code for the key?” I yelled over my shoulder.

“6278!” he shouted back from where he was unloading bags.

My fingers were half-frozen by the time I punched in the code and retrieved the key. The relief of stepping inside and feeling the warm air wash over me was almost euphoric.

The first thing I did was turn on the heat to make sure the cabin stayed warm. Before long, everyone had shuffled inside, their arms full of bags and supplies.

I ran upstairs, eager to claim a room, and chose the one farthest down the hall. It was cozy, with a window overlooking the snowy forest and just enough space for a bed and a small dresser.

Leaning over the banister that overlooked the living room, I called down to Zeke, who was still near the door. “Come on and get unpacked already!”

He waved me off with a laugh, and I returned to my room to unpack my things.

Once everyone had settled in, we gathered in the living room and broke out a game of Monopoly. It was fun, something I needed to help wind down.

By the time we finished, it was late, and everyone was ready to crash. One by one, we retreated to our rooms, the cabin growing quiet as we drifted off to sleep.

Here’s a cleaned-up version of Part Four, keeping it concise and smooth:

Night 2, December 31st.

The cabin had been everything I needed—fun, relaxing, and a perfect escape from the grind of everyday life. But as it turned out, this was the last night things would feel normal.

I had just finished dinner and was waiting for my turn to take a shower. Everyone had been arguing earlier about who should go first, so I volunteered to go last. It wasn’t a big deal; I preferred a quiet shower anyway.

“Grace! I’m out of the shower!” Morgan’s voice called from upstairs.

I grabbed my towel and headed up, stepping into the bathroom. The air was thick and humid, the mirror fogged from the heat of everyone else’s showers. I shut the door behind me, stripped off my clothes, and stepped into the warm water.

The shower was everything I needed. I stayed in longer than I probably should have, letting the water soothe my muscles and steam away the stress of the day. By the time my fingers had pruned, I finally forced myself to get out, grabbing a towel to dry off.

It wasn’t until I was ready to head back to my room that I noticed something odd—my dirty clothes were gone.

At first, I thought maybe I’d misplaced them. But as I looked around, a flicker of unease crept into my mind. My thoughts jumped to all sorts of irrational conclusions.

I stepped out into the hallway, still clutching my towel, and nearly ran into Zeke. He was standing there with a small laundry basket in his hands.

“You scared the shit out of me!” I blurted, startled. “I thought someone stole my clothes.”

Zeke chuckled, though it sounded a little forced. “No, just keeping up on laundry.”

I stared at him, my heart still racing. “Maybe you could’ve waited until I was finished! Asshole!”

His expression shifted. The easygoing demeanor he usually wore disappeared, replaced by something colder, more serious.

“I was waiting,” he said flatly. “But someone decided to take an hour in the shower. I want to go to bed, and I promised I’d do the laundry.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but nothing came out. His tone was sharp, and I felt a little embarrassed for snapping at him.

“Fine,” I muttered, brushing past him and heading to my room.

Once inside, I closed the door and let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. I checked the time—11:15 PM.

“Maybe I was a little hard on him,” I thought, trying to shake off the lingering discomfort.

I turned off the light and climbed into bed, ready to let the day end.

Here’s a cleaned-up version of Part Five, keeping the tension and flow intact:

Night 3, January 1st.

The day had started like any other. After breakfast, we bundled up in layers and decided to take on the ambitious challenge of building the biggest snowman we could. It was harder than it looked, but the effort was half the fun. Between snowball fights, laughter, and Morgan insisting on giving the snowman a “fashionable scarf,” the day flew by.

By the time we got back inside, I was exhausted but looking forward to a hot shower. As usual, I took the last turn, leaving my clothes just outside the bathroom door before stepping into the steamy sanctuary.

The water was soothing, washing away the chill of the day, and as always, I let my mind wander. I stayed in longer than I probably should have, lost in thought.

But then something pulled me back to reality.

I glanced up, and my heart stopped.

In the ceiling above the shower was a small hole, no bigger than a quarter. At first, I thought maybe it was just a random imperfection in the wood. But then I saw it—an eye.

Someone was watching me.

A scream tore from my throat as I bolted out of the bathroom, barely managing to wrap a towel around myself. In my panic, I tripped over the pile of clothes I’d left outside the door, hitting the floor hard.

Before I could gather myself, the others came running.

Morgan and Jack rushed up the stairs, their faces etched with concern. Zeke appeared from his room, his expression unreadable.

“W-what happened?” Morgan asked, kneeling to help me up.

“I-uh-I…” I stuttered, still trying to catch my breath.

“C’mon,” she said gently, guiding me toward my room. “We can talk about this later.”

Once inside, Morgan stayed with me while I dried off and got dressed. I could barely form a coherent thought, let alone speak, but eventually, I managed to get the words out.

“I—there was a hole in the ceiling of the shower,” I stammered, my voice trembling. “I swear I saw an eye looking at me.”

Morgan’s face darkened, but she kept her voice calm. “I believe you,” she said, placing a reassuring hand on my shoulder. “We’ll get to the bottom of this.”

I wanted to leave. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to get out of that cabin, but I didn’t have a ride home. I was stuck.

Later, we all gathered in the living room. Morgan explained what had happened, her tone serious as she recounted my story. I stayed silent, my hands clenched into fists as I stared at the floor.

Morgan had taken a picture of the hole in the shower, and when she showed it to us, we saw that it was now covered by something. The sight sent a fresh wave of unease through me.

For a long time, no one said anything. The room was heavy with tension, the crackling fire the only sound.

But slowly, doubt began to creep into the conversation.

“You ran out of there pretty quick,” Zeke said, his voice calm but firm. “Are you sure you didn’t just imagine it?”

Jack nodded, though he looked uncomfortable. “Yeah, I mean… it was just a quick peek, right? It could’ve been anything.”

Morgan shot them both a glare but didn’t argue. I could see the doubt creeping into her expression too.

I wanted to fight back, to insist that I wasn’t imagining things, but I didn’t. Maybe I was just too tired. Maybe I didn’t want to believe what I’d seen either.

The room eventually fell quiet, and the conversation shifted to lighter topics. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as I forced myself to smile and nod along.

Night 4, January 2nd.

The day dragged on in a haze of unease. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, and every creak of the cabin made my skin crawl. We’d all agreed no one would step foot in the upstairs bathroom again, opting for the cramped and less appealing downstairs one. It wasn’t ideal, but it felt safer somehow.

I spent most of the day curled up in the living room, trying to distract myself with games or small talk, but my mind kept circling back to the night before. The others tried to lighten the mood, but I could see the tension in their faces too.

By nightfall, I had loosened up a bit. The fire was warm, and the company helped dull the edge of my fear. But as bedtime approached, the anxiety crept back in.

When I got to my room, I turned on every light and started searching. I wasn’t going to let myself sleep without making sure there were no more surprises.

It didn’t take long.

Right above my bed, there was another hole, about the size of a quarter. It had been covered up, but not well enough to hide the faint outline.

My heart pounded in my chest as I bolted out of the room. I ran down the hall and started knocking frantically on Morgan’s door.

She opened it, looking startled. “What’s wrong?”

“Another hole,” I said breathlessly. “Above my bed.”

Morgan didn’t hesitate. She grabbed her phone and followed me back to my room.

Soon, all four of us were crowded in there, staring up at the ceiling. Zeke held a flashlight, illuminating the faintly covered hole.

“The listing never mentioned an attic,” Zeke said, his voice calm but thoughtful. “But it did say there’s a basement.”

“A basement?” Morgan asked, frowning.

Zeke nodded. “I looked last night. I couldn’t find an entrance. It must be hidden somewhere.”

His words didn’t comfort me. If anything, they made my skin crawl.

I opened my mouth, ready to say I wanted to leave, but Morgan cut me off.

“Grace, you can sleep with me tonight,” she said, her voice firm but kind.

I nodded, relieved for the moment but unable to shake the feeling that this wasn’t over.

As we all filed out of the room, I glanced back at the hole one last time. It felt like it was staring back at me.

Got it! Here’s a cleaner, slightly expanded version of the first part of Part Seven to help build tension and make the scene feel more natural:

Night 6, January 4th.

The day had been eerily quiet. After everything that had happened, the absence of tension felt almost unnatural. Jack and Morgan had gone out to grab supplies for the final two days, leaving me alone with Zeke. I sat on the couch, trying to distract myself with the TV, but it felt like my mind was working overtime. The unease gnawed at me, never quite letting go.

Zeke was in the kitchen, busy making coffee. The quiet buzz of his phone on the coffee table caught my attention. Without thinking, I reached over to check the time, but my thumb accidentally swiped left. The camera app opened.

That’s when I saw it.

In the corner of the screen, the preview of the last picture taken—my picture—was displayed. I froze. It was a shot of me, lying in bed. The angle, the lighting, the unmistakable perspective—it had been taken through the hole above my bed.

A cold wave of dread washed over me. My stomach dropped, and my heart pounded so loudly I thought Zeke might hear it. My body went stiff, but I forced myself to stay calm, carefully placing the phone back on the table. I couldn’t let him know I’d seen it. Not yet.

I grabbed my own phone, my fingers shaking as I quickly created a group chat with Jack and Morgan. My mind raced as I typed a single message: “SOS it’s Zeke.” I set my phone to silent, praying they’d see it in time.

“Coffee’s ready,” Zeke called from the kitchen, his voice casual, too calm.

I turned around, forcing a smile as he approached with two steaming mugs. “Thanks,” I said, taking the cup from him. I wanted to scream, to run, but I knew that would only make things worse. The best plan was to play along.

I took a sip, pretending to relax, but every fiber of my being was on high alert. “Oh, I think I left my phone in Morgan’s room. Be right back!”

I stood up, my legs feeling like jelly beneath me. I moved quickly, but quietly, heading upstairs. Once I was out of sight, I peeked over the banister. Zeke was back in the living room, his eyes glued to the TV, unaware of my movements.

I slipped into his room.

I needed to confirm it was him.

I started with his bag, my hands trembling as I dug through it. My stomach churned when I found them—my panties from the second night, hidden deep inside, buried among his things. I snapped a picture with my phone, my fingers shaking as I fought back the rising nausea. The room felt like it was closing in on me, and I could barely breathe.

Then my eyes landed on the closet. There, tucked away behind a stack of clothes, I noticed something—a small hatch, almost imperceptible unless you were looking for it. My heart skipped a beat. I reached for it, my hands slick with sweat, and pulled it open just a crack. A faint, musty smell hit me, but I didn’t have time to investigate. The briefest glimpse inside revealed nothing more than shadows and an old, forgotten tool kit.

But I didn’t need to see more. I knew what it meant. This was where he had been watching me.

Before I could process the implications, my head began to spin. My vision blurred, and my limbs grew heavy. I staggered backward, my knees buckling beneath me, but just before I collapsed, I heard Zeke’s voice from the doorway.

“That coffee hit you, huh?”

I turned to see him standing there, leaning against the doorframe, his expression a mixture of amusement and something darker. He didn’t look surprised—he’d been waiting for this moment.

“So, I guess you figured it out,” he said, stepping closer, his voice low and calm. “Shame it’s at the expense of your life.”

I tried to move, tried to run, but my body wouldn’t respond. The darkness took over, and everything went black.

When I woke up, my head was throbbing, and my mouth was dry. Panic surged through me as I realized I couldn’t move. My wrists were tied tightly to the bedframe, and a gag was shoved into my mouth, choking off any sound I tried to make. I struggled against the restraints, my mind racing with thoughts of what might have happened while I was unconscious. The fear of not knowing what he’d done to me was almost worse than the pain.

Zeke was sitting nearby, casually zipping up his bag. The sight of him was almost surreal—he looked so calm, so detached, as though what was happening wasn’t a big deal. He turned to me with a soft, almost affectionate smile, as if we were having some quiet, intimate conversation.

“Grace,” he said, his voice surprisingly tender. “I loved you. I really did. But you were too stupid to see that.”

I screamed against the gag, tears streaming down my face. My chest ached with the effort, and I thrashed against the ropes, my body desperate to break free.

“I hate to do this to you,” he continued, his voice low, almost regretful. “But I’m not going to get another chance.”

He climbed onto the bed, his weight pressing down on me. I froze, my body going stiff with terror. His hands brushed against my skin, and I wanted to scream, to fight, but I couldn’t. The restraints were too tight, and my limbs felt like they were made of lead.

“You remember that night we got drunk?” he asked, his voice dropping to a whisper, like we were sharing a secret. “You lifted your shirt for me. This isn’t so different, is it?”

I shook my head violently, my heart racing in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. All I could feel was his presence closing in on me, suffocating me.

“You’re beautiful, you know that?” he whispered, his hands moving to the hem of my shirt. “We won’t be needing this.”

His fingers brushed against the fabric, and I shuddered, my body reacting against him even though I couldn’t move. I could feel his breath on my neck, his hands too close, and I knew what was coming. I couldn’t stop it.

Just as his hand reached under my shirt, I saw movement from the corner of my eye.

Jack and Morgan.

Jack was holding the heavy prop gun from the fireplace mantel. He swung it with all his strength, hitting Zeke square in the back of the head. The impact was sickening, and Zeke collapsed onto the bed, unconscious before he even hit the mattress.

Morgan was there in an instant, her hands shaking as she worked to untie me. She fumbled with the ropes, but within moments, I was free. She ripped the gag from my mouth, and I gasped for air, my throat raw from the pressure.

“We need to go,” Jack said urgently, his voice tight with fear.

I nodded, barely able to think, as they helped me out of the cabin and into their car. I could barely process what had just happened—my mind was still reeling from the terror, the helplessness. I kept seeing Zeke’s face, his twisted smile, his hands on me. It was like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from.

The drive to the authorities was a blur. Between sobs, I told them everything—about the hole, the pictures, the attic, the things Zeke had said. I showed them the evidence on my phone, desperate for them to believe me. But I knew, deep down, that it might be too late.

By the time we reached the cabin, Zeke was gone.

A manhunt is still underway, but deep down, I doubt they’ll find him. Zeke is smart—too smart. He knows how to disappear.

Now, days later, under the protection of the authorities, I still can’t shake the feeling of being watched. Every creak, every shadow, every fleeting sound sends a chill down my spine.

Because I know he’s still out there.

January 16th.

I thought I had seen the last of Zeke. But today, while I was cooking dinner, I heard the doorbell ring. When I opened the door, there was no one in sight. I scanned the yard, expecting to see a group of kids running off, but all I saw was a faint snow trail leading toward the road. At my feet, there was a post-it note. The corner was torn, and it had been crumpled slightly. The letters were jagged, almost unrecognizable, and the ink—no, the red stain—was unmistakably blood.

It read: “I’m sorry, Grace. I love you.”

I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The world seemed to tilt as I backed inside, slamming the door shut behind me. My hands were shaking as I dialed the cops, but I already knew—this was far from over.

Now, as I write this in May of 2015, nothing has come up. No sign of him. No answers. I don’t know where that monster is, but I know one thing for sure: until they find him—dead or alive—I don’t think I’ll ever be able to sleep without that lingering feeling. The feeling that he’s still out there, watching, waiting.

I've had full blown social anxiety disorder since 14 but symptoms earlier and GAD and major depression diagnosis. I've always had symptoms of ADHD that went unnoticed. Inability to organize. I mean my room was an absolute mess which is strange for a girl usually though I'm sure isn't unheard of. Didn't do homework, never did projects, didn't do school really after before 9th grade even. Would miss 98 days by March in the 9th grade when I was developing anxiety. Even my bag for school was a mess. I failed every class for inability to do homework and I'd fail the tests because I never went or could pay attention. I dropped out and got my GED. Things that are long term investment and no reward like that were always a no for me. Didn't go to college because fear and anxiety of debt and severe severe social anxiety where I couldn't even work or speak on the phone at the time but now I'm stuck in cashier and receptionist/ clerical jobs because of my failure to better myself. Even now working full time exhausts me in a way that it shouldn't but other times I've worked two jobs and wouldn't have minded working 24/7. I get burnt out and anxious way too easily. I have to take 2-3 hour long baths to calm my nervous system. I used to be addicted to drinking to calm the anxiety and thoughts in my head and as a child there was hyper activity but I'm more of the quiet type now. I have constant thoughts and to do lists in my head. Some don't get accomplished for months and years. I'm always stressed. I have social anxiety but forcing myself into social situations must release dopamine because it's the only thing that helps where as anxiety meds do NOT help me. I'm addicted to coffee and even foods that release dopamine lol. At this point after trauma and everything it's getting worse. Sometimes I feel so burnt out from regular everyday activity that I go into freeze mode and dissociate. As well as when I worked part time I would sleep until 11 and literally not eat until 4 pm or something besides a coffee because of the food indecision people with ADHD get. When I was 17 and I would stay up until 8 am and then sleep until 5 pm. Plus other various symptoms. Anyone ever get diagnosed with ADHD after a long time of being diagnosed just with anxiety? I also can't focus on anything or make eye contact anymore. I also am NEVER on time for work unless forced. It's extremely difficult for me to be on time and actually makes me anxious. I used to work retail where they cared but let me get away with slot being late and I'd be a half hour late
Almost every shift. Last Job I was late a lot but started making it on time because of write ups. This current job I'm in I was literally late everyday because they had a problem with putting me on the time clock. Now I'm anywhere from 5 min- 30 min late still but it's an early shift. Not that it's any fucking excuse whatsoever especially given my age but I can hardly control it and IDK why. I used to wake up at 4-5 am for a job, wake up an hour before have coffee and get more things done. I had adhd then too but lately it's like I just get out of bed and go and get stressed out because I'm already late by 6:30 am. Idk why I can't do the get up an hour before thing anymore which was so helpful. I'm depressed and go to sleep at 8-9 pm or else I'm even more tired than I already am waking up at that time. I used to work a 6-5 shift so idk why 7-4 exhausts me....",1,1735652741.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

I never really put any value in any kind of higher power or preconceived fate for myself, and I'm not saying you made me believe any of that stuff. But weeks leading up to our conversation weirder and weirder ""hints"" that we'd talk again came up. I named my rifle after you. I read a book called the Alchemist (highly recommend it). I had conversations with my friends about how I felt like *something* about my past was going to resurface. I had a dream, not about you, but a dream about the world ""shifting"" as the person in the dream said it. Finally we talked. I made decisions based on our conversations. After a significant amount of time I confronted who I once was, rather than trying to forget. I'm glad you reached out. More than glad, it made me happy to talk to you again. But now you're gone again, but I suppose you never really came back. You were more like a ghost of the person I was. I wish we could've worked something out. I think you were the last person I actually loved, romantically. I can convince myself for a few weeks, or maybe a few months that I want to be with someone. But it's gone so soon, always fleeting. It wasn't like that with you, I wanted you, so very badly. Maybe it's because I never really could have you considering how we quite literally were simply ghosts to eachother when we spent time together. I could never touch you, and the same to you. But I don't think it's because of that, I think I was still just naive enough to easily allow myself to love, even in such a difficult situation between us with the distance and ghostliness. I'd give just about anything to possess that naivety, but retain who I am now, and love you again. But that's probably impossible. I don't know if I ever told you, but I plan on opening a coffee shop once I'm out of the military, in Oregon. I have unique plans for it. I want it to be a place for strangers in the real world to meet, and develop relationships. Like I did with you and everybody else. Friends, partners, or perfect strangers to swap stories with. That idea is largely based on my time spent with you. I don't think I ever made it how clear you affected my life. You changed me. Neither for better or worse, but my encounter with you made me who I am today. Thank you. It was easy to love you when you were here, and it's still easy when you're not. I hope my some power of the preconceived fate I previously put no faith in one day you walk into my coffee shop and I get to see you. I'll name a drink after you.

For Context, in in my early 40s, like my gaming, but given all those in my social circle have all moved away with our respective partners etc, we are generally restricted to online games for our gaming sessions.

I have been lurking in Reddit and online for solo boardgames, or solo with optional other players as I fancy some physical games to play and pass my time, but my partner isn't into these things.

I fear I have jumped into the deepend and bought myself Frost Punk, I've had a quick look and can't wait to sink some time into it, but I think it will be a rather interesting learning curve...

Anyway, there is a boardgame/cafe shop very close to me and I'm thinking I need to suss it out and possibly get chatting to people in this space. On that note, can anyone recommend a good solo game that doesn't take up much space (basically a small coffee table space) and a game would be somewhere in the 30-60min time region?

I have seen people talk about Final Girl a lot, but can't decide if that's one for me or not. I do like a bit of strategy, economy and/or deck building. Basically happy with a bit of anything.

Any suggestions appreciated, sorry for the long winded question! ",6,1735652633.0,soloboardgaming,4,1.0,False

Use to have the odd coffee for when I got bunged up and couldn't go the loo, but that makes my bloating and reflux worse.

I'm finding it difficult to work out which supplements will be good for the bloating/reflux without affecting my IBS and vice-versa.

Magnesium for example seems to make my bloating better but my IBS worse.

Was hoping anyone with similar conditions to myself may give me some advice?

  
Thanks.

Here’s My Story,"[ElectroSlim Review](https://preview.redd.it/gvy6uc0lr6ae1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a75eb3150a2d82a6106f847b94b08b4cb5bf9cb5)

It started when I caught a glimpse of myself in a window reflection during my morning commute. What I saw wasn’t just my reflection—it was the weight of years spent ignoring my health, letting my energy levels plummet, and resigning myself to the idea that losing weight was impossible without sacrificing my lifestyle. I felt trapped in my own body, frustrated and hopeless. That’s when everything changed.

I came across a solution that promised to transform how my body worked at its core. It wasn’t a magic pill, a brutal workout routine, or some obscure diet I had to force myself to stick to. It was simple, practical, and backed by science. It was the moment I decided to stop being a bystander in my own life.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d heard it all before—“Lose weight fast!” “Get fit without effort!” But this approach spoke to something deeper. It wasn’t just about shedding pounds; it was about rewiring how my body processed food and burned fat. Within days, I noticed a difference. My energy levels shot up, and I wasn’t constantly craving the sugary snacks that used to rule my afternoons. It felt like my body was finally working with me instead of against me.

The real transformation, though, wasn’t just in my body. Sure, the numbers on the scale dropped faster than I’d dared to hope. I lost 15 pounds in the first two weeks, and by the end of the month, I had shed 28 pounds of stubborn fat from my belly, thighs, and arms. But the bigger victory was how I felt—unstoppable, confident, and full of life.

For years, I’d struggled with energy dips that made afternoons unbearable. I was tired of being tired. This new approach gave me sustained energy that kept me going from sunrise to sunset. My productivity skyrocketed. I wasn’t just more active; I was more present. Family gatherings, work deadlines, even casual coffee dates—I showed up as the best version of myself every single time.

What made this journey even more incredible was how effortless it felt. I didn’t have to give up my favorite foods or commit to a workout routine that felt like punishment. Instead, my body naturally adjusted to a healthier rhythm. Meals became more enjoyable, cravings less frequent, and workouts felt empowering rather than draining.

This wasn’t just a short-term fix. It was a sustainable transformation. As I write this, I’ve maintained my weight loss for months without feeling like I’m “on a diet.” My clothes fit better, my confidence is through the roof, and for the first time in years, I feel like I’m living, not just existing.

It’s funny to think how one small decision changed everything. Looking back, it wasn’t just about the weight loss—it was about rediscovering who I am and reclaiming my life. If you’ve ever felt stuck, tired, or overwhelmed by all the noise out there about what works and what doesn’t, let me tell you this: the right solution is out there. You just have to take that first step.

Today, I don’t just feel lighter physically—I feel lighter emotionally and mentally. My body, mind, and spirit are aligned in a way I never thought possible. And it all started with a single choice to believe in something new, something different, and most importantly, something that worked.

If you’re ready to make a change, there’s no better time than now. I’m living proof that transformation isn’t just a dream—it’s a decision away. The results speak for themselves. My only regret? Not starting sooner.

What sets this journey apart from every other “miracle” solution I’ve tried is the science behind the transformation. When I started, I wasn’t just curious about how well it would work—I wanted to understand *why* it worked. That’s where ElectroSlim’s unique approach blew me away.

The foundation of its effectiveness lies in its ability to boost GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that governs blood sugar regulation, appetite control, and fat metabolism. Think of GLP-1 as your body’s internal traffic controller for energy. When it’s operating at optimal levels, your cravings decrease, your metabolism revs up, and your body burns fat like a finely tuned machine.

ElectroSlim includes CapsiMax®, a powerful capsicum extract derived from red chili peppers. Studies show that CapsiMax has a thermogenic effect—meaning it helps your body produce heat and burn calories more effectively. This isn’t just marketing fluff; it’s backed by peer-reviewed science. CapsiMax works to increase GLP-1 levels, creating a natural metabolic boost that doesn’t leave you jittery or crashing like some other supplements do.

Another key player in the formula is Metabolyte™, a proprietary compound designed to support enzymes that break down stored fat and inhibit the absorption of excess calories. Instead of relying on deprivation or extreme measures, this ingredient helps your body do what it was always meant to do: process food efficiently and burn fat for energy.

Then there’s Sukre™, a natural appetite suppressant that helped me overcome my biggest nemesis—late-night cravings. For years, I was trapped in a cycle of eating after dinner, sabotaging my progress with sugary snacks that left me feeling sluggish the next day. Sukre broke that cycle by promoting a feeling of fullness and satisfaction that lasted longer than I ever thought possible.

ElectroSlim also includes L-Taurine, an amino acid known for its role in energy production and metabolism. It’s like fuel for your cells, helping your body tap into stored fat reserves while maintaining high energy levels throughout the day. Unlike other products that leave you feeling drained, L-Taurine ensures you have the stamina to tackle whatever life throws at you.

Magnesium Citrate and Chromium Picolinate round out the formula, addressing two crucial factors in weight loss and overall health: blood sugar regulation and digestion. Magnesium supports healthy digestion and detoxification, while Chromium helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing those intense cravings for carbs and sweets.

What struck me the most about this combination of ingredients is how they work synergistically. It’s not just one element doing all the heavy lifting—it’s a carefully calibrated blend that targets weight loss and metabolic health from multiple angles. This holistic approach is what makes ElectroSlim stand out in a crowded market of “quick fixes.”

I dug deeper into the research behind each ingredient, and the findings were clear: these aren’t just trendy buzzwords slapped onto a label. They’re proven, science-backed components with decades of studies to support their effectiveness. More importantly, they’re combined in a way that amplifies their individual benefits, creating a product that’s greater than the sum of its parts.

ElectroSlim doesn’t just treat the symptoms of weight gain—it addresses the root causes. It’s like giving your body the reset button it desperately needs. By boosting GLP-1, improving energy metabolism, and balancing blood sugar, it helps your body transition into a state where fat loss becomes effortless and sustainable.

Science made the difference for me. Understanding how these ingredients worked gave me confidence in the process, and seeing the results solidified my belief that ElectroSlim is a game-changer. It’s not magic—it’s biology, optimized. And when you give your body the right tools, the transformation is nothing short of extraordinary.

This isn’t just about losing weight—it’s about regaining control, boosting your health, and unlocking a better version of yourself. The science of ElectroSlim doesn’t just make that possible; it makes it inevitable. And I’m living proof.

**Does ElectroSlim really work?**  
Yes, and here’s why: the ingredients in ElectroSlim are backed by science to naturally enhance your body’s fat-burning processes. From boosting GLP-1 levels to improving energy metabolism, the formula works synergistically to help you lose weight effectively and sustainably. I saw real results—losing 28 pounds in just a month—and felt energized throughout the process.

**Is ElectroSlim safe?**  
ElectroSlim uses natural, scientifically supported ingredients like CapsiMax, L-Taurine, Magnesium Citrate, and Chromium Picolinate. These compounds are generally safe for most people when taken as directed. However, as with any supplement, consult your doctor if you have pre-existing health conditions or take medication.

**How long does it take to see results?**  
For me, the results started within the first week. I noticed increased energy levels and reduced cravings almost immediately. Significant weight loss followed within the first two weeks. Individual results may vary, but consistency is key.

**Do I need to exercise while taking ElectroSlim?**  
While exercise is always a great addition to any health regimen, ElectroSlim doesn’t require you to follow an intense workout routine. I kept my usual activity levels and still experienced incredible results. That said, staying active will only enhance your progress and overall well-being.

**Are there any side effects?**  
I personally didn’t experience any negative side effects. The formula is designed to be gentle on the body while delivering effective results. However, those with sensitivities to any ingredients should read the label carefully and consult a healthcare professional before starting.

**How do you take ElectroSlim?**  
ElectroSlim is a lemon-lime flavored powder you mix with water. I took it first thing in the morning, and it became an easy, enjoyable part of my routine. The refreshing taste was an added bonus that made sticking to it effortless.

**What if it doesn’t work for me?**  
One of the things I appreciated about ElectroSlim is its 365-day money-back guarantee. If you don’t see results, you can return it, no questions asked. This gave me peace of mind when I first tried it.

**Who is ElectroSlim for?**  
ElectroSlim is ideal for anyone looking to lose weight naturally, boost energy levels, and regain control of their metabolism. Whether you’ve struggled with weight loss for years or are just looking for a jumpstart, it’s a great option to consider.

**Can ElectroSlim help with stubborn fat areas?**  
Absolutely. One of the standout features of ElectroSlim is how effectively it targets stubborn fat in areas like the belly, thighs, and arms. I personally noticed the difference in these areas within weeks.

**Where can I buy ElectroSlim?**  
ElectroSlim is available online through its official website. Buying directly ensures you get the authentic product and access to any promotional offers or guarantees they provide.

1hqetku,https://www.reddit.com/r/FindLaura/comments/1hqetku/two_lauras/,Two Lauras,"I was going to write the below in a reply under another thread, but it got so long and it took so long to write that I thought it would be a waste to lose it in a sea of other replies, so thought I'd create a topic here instead. This is a bit rambling because I didn't intend it to be a thread. These are a handful of observations on what I think are some of the core plot elements of FWWM:

I go back and forth on how much is ""real"" in FWWM. Sometimes I think we're being shown something closer to reality than anything else in the series, but that none of it is objective reality - more like an unreliable memory than the surreal abstractions of the series.

There are a few reasons I think that. For one, the scene between Leland and Laura in the car seems to me to be replaying the scene in bed where she realises Bob is her father (eg instead of Bob turning into her father, Mike drives up and screams it at her). The Mike element itself echoes the scene with Doc Hayward. 

And then there's the issue of Theresa Banks - I believe Theresa Banks is entirely a figment of Laura's imagination. She's the detective part of Laura, the one who figures out Leland's true identity. And her killing is symbolic of the repression of that knowledge (I believe that Bowie's Jeffries is a kind of resurrection and re-killing of Theresa Banks - in the script, I believe Jeffries comes back after being missing for a year, and Theresa had been dead for a year, but I think it's changed in the final film so that her death happens the same year that Jeffries reappears, obscuring the link. Jeffries is scared to talk about what he learned about a certain person, and Theresa was murdered for knowing too much. His scream before he disappears is an echo of the way Laura screams and blacks out in bed after learning about Leland, and his empty chair is an echo of her empty school chair). But Theresa Banks is spoken about by other characters, including Laura. Leland speaks to Theresa Banks and has flash backs to her without Laura being present.

The other problem is Sarah. It seems to me that Sarah in FWWM is portrayed as Laura's alter ego. Eg the thing of Laura wearing Sarah's clothes, which is echoed by Cooper taking Dougie's identity by wearing his shoes. I think a central idea in FWWM which carries over into the series is the idea of there being two or more Lauras who are in conflict with each other, demonstrated when Laura #1 gets out of bed and enters the magic door, leaving Laura #2 behind in bed. I think that image is repeated by the way that Laura and Sarah take two opposing white substances: the upper cocaine and the sedative milk. I think it's symbolic of that split - that the ""Sarah"" part of Laura sleeps, but there's another part that stays awake, the part which is aware of what happens but via the fantasy of Bob. 

I sometimes wonder if the idea is that Leland actually gives the drugged milk to Laura (a more fitting drink for a child) and the scene we see on screen is just a symbolic portrayal of how she still subconsciously knows what happens to her despite being asleep (ie the conscious mind sleeps but the body is still subconsciously aware. There's a part in the Secret Diary where she questions how someone could break into her room every night without her parents noticing, for example).

That thing of the cocaine being an upper, the milk being a downer - I think that's another pattern throughout the film. Eg Laura shouts at Donna ""What a downer you are!"" (Maybe as opposed to Judy being ""positive about this."") Donna is the innocent, naive counterpart. She sleeps through her own sexual abuse in the Pink Room. Again, I think that scene is another echo of the bedroom scene with Leland and Bob but rejigged - Donna is the sleeping Sarah (notice Laura drugs Donna's beer), Laura is the subconscious awareness of what's happening. (By the way, as a side note: Laura screams at Donna when she runs over to her. When Laura #2 gets out of bed and looks around in the magic door sequence, if you listen closely, I'm sure you hear Sarah shout ""Laura,"" the same clip as the one used at the end of part 18, but more heavily disguised with reverb etc. I think it even describes it in the script, iirc. Which makes me think that the cry of ""Laura"" could be about Sarah walking in on Laura in bed with Leland, similar to Laura's recognition of what's happening to Donna).

As a semi-relevant side note, if you watch the Q2 edit with TMP added back in, I think you see the same pattern with the dynamic of Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley. Chet is an upper, Sam is a downer. Something you'd probably only notice with TMP added back in is that Chet Desmond refuses to go to sleep - they stay awake for at least 24 hours, if not longer (been a while since I watched it). Sam Stanley gets progressively sleepier as the scenes progress, but stays awake with Chet to impress him (similar to Donna. I also wonder if the mean trick Chet plays on Sam with his watch is meant to echo Laura's trick with the drugged beer). Sam mentions the time a couple of times and hints they should go to sleep, eg when they finish the autopsy, but Chet manipulates Sam into staying up. Even at the end of their sequence, Sam leaves town but Chet continues investigating, going back for the ring. Chet refuses to rest, ie refuses to go home and sleep. (Laura to Bobby, sarcastically: ""I'm going home... to my nice warm bed.""

And there's a parallel there with what they learn about Theresa Banks: Theresa worked nights (stayed awake all night) but she was ""never on time."" They say this three times I think, the same way. The waitress blames it on her cocaine use; Sam compares it to coffee and cigarettes (I think emphasis on coffee - uppers). While they're investigating, there's at least two times where Sam makes a point about the subjectivity of time: first when they're outside Carl Rodd's trailer, he says they're either early or late; and he says something similar when they finish the autopsy, but I forget exactly what. They walk outside in the morning and the moon is out against the blue sky. I think the sequence is a kind of riddle - the moon in the morning sky is like Theresa Banks, it works nights but it's not ""on time."" If you look closely later on, when Laura takes the diary out of her desk, we see she keeps it by an art book with a moon on the cover. So the moon becomes linked to the diary, the secret keeper, like Theresa. (I have a pet peeve with the Q2 edit choosing to still leave a few TMP scenes out and this part of the film is a perfect example: the Chet and Sam portion is all about this confusion over time. The Q2 edit leaves out the introductory scene of Cooper talking to Diane which is meant to come immediately after Chet disappears, and what is Cooper talking about? He's talking about how Diane moved the clock).

I think it's all about that schism of the two Lauras: the awake one and the sleeping one; the one who knows and the Donna part of her that stays blissfully ignorant and innocent. And I think Lynch may be implying that this schism and these different personalities are created through the severe mental damage she does to herself through the drugs she takes to manage her life. Maybe she sneaks out all night to avoid being at home while her father is there. But then she has to stay awake at school. But then other times, maybe she drugs herself to sleep through what Leland does; or maybe Leland gives her sedatives while she has cocaine in her system. So I think that manifests symbolically as this confusion over time (eg the blurry POV shot of the school clock; which becomes this theme of split timelines and so on;  ""What year is this?""). Her brain is fried to the point that she becomes catatonic - Annie Blackburn wheeled into hospital in one of the last scenes, immediately after Laura floats down the river. And I think FWWM has a cyclical structure like Lost Highway, where the Theresa Banks / Chet Desmond sequence begins after the end of the film (Chet holding the two prostitutes by the arms in front of the school bus echoing Leland with Laura and Ronette at the train car). I think that scene where Chet stares at the photo of Theresa on the fridge is meant to show us that he is Theresa's ""reincarnation"" - the camera shows both of their green eyes in close up, as if they're a match, and both Theresa and Chet are punished for investigating too far (like Jeffries and James' Laura, the knowledge makes them disappear). In other words, I think that cyclical nature and confusion over timelines / chronology is partly to reinforce that theme of the dreamer's confusion over time, a scrambled internal clock brought about by trying to avoid the sexual abuse, and in turn, a brain unable to distinguish between dream and reality.

(Another note on the script - the film was originally subtitled ""the last seven days of Laura Palmer."" But the version of the script available online omits an entire day. I mean it literally says something like ""Day missing"" or ""day omitted."" I'm still unsure if that was part of the story - Laura / the dreamer literally blanks on an entire day. It would make sense with the way that only three of the four missing diary pages are recovered and how the rumoured Twin Peaks project with Netflix was called Unrecorded Night. This makes me wonder - if Lynch deliberately withholds an entire day from us, does he try to communicate what happened that day cryptically through the abstractions?)

That schism is I think later represented by Diane and Janey E, the ""half sisters;"" and Dougie and Mr. C etc. I think Dougie and Mr. C in particular are an exaggerated form of that Donna / Laura relationship and a more literal metaphor for dissociation, being a body / heart without a brain, and a brain without a heart. I think of the Laura who enters the magic door as the brain / conscious mind leaving a mindless ""body"" behind to suffer the abuse. Victims of sexual abuse frequently say that they feel like they're watching themselves from the outside. And maybe season 3 is this conflict between the two halves that hate each other, represented as doppelgangers etc. I think maybe the failure of the dreamer is in killing Mr. C, rather than reconciling the two halves.

Sorry, I went really off topic there but I just meant to make the point that I see Donna and Sarah's roles in FWWM as part of that symbolic pattern, which makes me wonder if it's more like Lost Highway, a series of highly subjective memories looking back after the fact. Maybe the dreamer is really some catatonic person closer to Sarah's age, looking back several decades, hence the 50's / 80's hybrid aesthetic in the original series, ""What year is this?"" Etc.

Another theory I had is that maybe Freddie's killing of Bob is a dressed up heroic fantasy version of Laura killing Leland. And that Sarah's cry of ""Laura"" is her walking in on a murder scene. I think there are a few hints to that, one being the scene in part 11 where the boy shoots a bullet through the window and the mother (Carrie) chastises the husband for leaving a gun around because their son ""could have killed all of us."" But that's really off topic.

Again, sorry for an unstructured rambling post, but TL;DR is that I think this thing of the two Lauras being in conflict is key: the Arm and its doppelganger; the 119 woman and child being a mirror Janey E and Sonny Jim living across the road from Dougie's car; the rivalry between Diane and Tammy, between Ed and Walter, etc. ""We're half sisters. We're estranged. We hate each other."" Sarah's stabbing of the photo in part 17 seems to me to be some sort of rejection of the two halves reuniting, hence Cooper and Carrie's inability to get into the house in part 18. Tremond provides the door for Laura #1 to leave ""home"" via the painting, and Tremond blocks that same door back into the house in part 18. The two Lauras are forever kept apart... maybe.",4,1735652173.0,FindLaura,0,1.0,False

When there I colored and cut Jennifer hair. I had made dinner. I cleaned up the kitchen. The next day I made coffee in the morning as I was a early bird and got ready for the day because we was having a party with the wedding party. During the party as we was outside drinking and Jennifer was not around her partner was drinking and blurted out that she bought the ring and forced the engagement because I had gotten engaged. *Second red flag* 

That night after everyone left. Jennifer and her partner got in a fight. He was yelling at her about being a crappy host because I was making myself at home and cooking and cleaning. Being a good house guest. My man said if I ever treat you that way slap me. Jennifer heard that. 

The next day my man and I left. We of course said our good byes I hugged Jennifer and my man shock her man's hand. Everything was fine but then bam 5 mins into the drive home I was getting text messages. That she hates my man. That I'm no longer welcome to stay at her house when we come in. That she don't want me in the wedding. At this point I didn't have anything to say I was heart broken and I was mad and I just blocked her on everything... so I thought. 

5 months later of no connection. I logged into a old email and saw there was messages from Jennifer on my old Pinterest that I never use. I never really cared for that App but I wanted to see what she had to say. 

Jennifer was telling me she was Sorry and that she missed me. And said like she went to far and that she isn't going to give up trying to get me back as a friend. 

I at this point. *this was dumb* I forgave her and let her back in my life. My man said that's fine but he don't like that decision and don't want to go around her. *fair* he was smart. 

Fast forward 2 months the relationship we had isn't the same we only text but she watches her mouth because she don't want to lose me. And she asked me to be in her wedding again. I said I accept. *again Dumb* 

She sent me the dress she wanted me to wear. I ordered it cheaper via a third party resale. She told me I can not have no funky hair color it has to be natural. At this time I had like a strawberry red hair. She didn't agree to it and wanted me blonde. I used purple and blue shampoos for months that took out the red pigment in my hair so it would be blonde. She made me attend the bridal shower and put me on games and prizes, drinks, and then sent me the gift she wanted me to get her. And made me pay for all that and said it was my duty too. She scheduled all us bridesmaids to get our nails done and then the day we got our nails done told us we had to pay for our own service. Same with the next day of the wedding. Scheduled us for hair and makeup professionally and made us all pay our part with out warning. 

Before the wedding I caught Jennifer talking to her maid of honor we will name her Stacy. BTW Stacy was late to the nail appointment, didn't show up to the bachelorette party the night before, and was late to the hair appointment and came with purple hair and didn't get no repercussions for her actions. Jennifer told Stacy that the only reason I am in this wedding is because her cousin she asked to be in her wedding didn't like the dress choice she picked out and refused to wear it and she knew I would easily step in. 

LIVID I was. I wasn't going to ruin the wedding. I did my part and then after the serving of the food I ate and acted like I didn't feel good. So I can get the heck out of there and cut her off again. 

I went up to Jennifer and told her. I didn't feel good, congratulated her and said I was leaving. She said oh before you go. We are doing this again next year out. The reception part because since it was 2020 she didn't get to have a big party reception and that I'm going to have to get my hair, nails, make up done again keep my hair blonde and wear the same dress a year later. I said okay.

Got in my car and reblocked her on everything so fast. And I then realized I should of listened to my now husband when he said this was a bad idea. ",2,1735652162.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1hqesun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hqesun/ghosted/,Ghosted,"Hey guys, I need some advice as I struggle with reading in between the lines. I have a feeling I was used for sex but I got so many mixed signals i can't tell. Any suggestions on what's going in inside this man's head is much appreciated.

I matched with this guy on bumble back in August, he then followed my Instagram and we'd occasionally talk, he'd reply to my stories and like them. 

Early October we exchanged numbers would iMessage each-other, playing iMessage games and him just being sweet, getting to know me, and things like telling me he'd bring me soup if I was sick, or wanting to meet. I told him I wasn't comfortable meeting at my place, and he reassured me, telling me he doesn't want to just come for sex and that he just wants to see me. He did frequently get upset if I didn't message back within a certain timeframe (1-2hours), stating that I was playing mind games with him, and if I didn't reply in a certain amount of time, he was done with me. I work a 12 hour shift pattern Monday-Saturday, which he knew of, so his words annoyed me, so I made the decision to just delete him off everything and called it a day. 

He then came back a month later requesting both of my Instagram accounts, saying he still wanted to see me. From there we started talking again and he seemed like he had mellowed out a little bit more. 
Fast forward, a week later we ended up grabbing coffee and then went to my place. We watched a movie and ended up hooking up. After that, he left and went home because he was working early the following day. I didn't hear from him until I then posted a selfie on my Instagram around 4 days later to which he replied to, and then said he wanted to see me again. A few days after that, we then hooked up again he stayed the night and he took his time to them get to know me, even after we had sex (the bar is in hell, I know). 

The following morning we then hooked up yet again, and he dropped me to work. This man then went ghost again for a few days. However, was always watching and liking my Instagram stories, to which I just assumed he wasn't looking for anything serious, which was fine because I was the either.  A week later he messaged and said he would see me after he went to a birthday meal. I waited up for him and he finally replied at midnight, saying he had only just got home, I gave him the benefit of the doubt but I was a bit upset. He said he would make it up to me and see me the following evening, but then the same thing happened. I left this man alone again, however this time I didn't delete him off anything.

He then ended up going on vacation for a few days and when he came back, he started hitting me up over Whatsapp, saying how bad I am at replying and asked if I would would reply better on that app instead of Instagram, which, by the way, my replies were never bad when we reconnected I always replied to him within 10-20 mins. It was reasonable, whereas he would just ghost me for days after we hook up. He then started messaging me nonstop for an entire week, replying back within a two minute timeframe, which was weird because his replies used to be slow. 

He was asking me about my Christmas plans and my family and was just being genuinely sweet again. It then turned into sexting and we'd agreed to meet on the upcoming Saturday evening, where he said he would stay the night. For the rest of the week, we'd go back and forth from sexting and sweet small talk. Saturday morning, he ended up convincing me to let me see him during his lunch break at work, we then hooked up. He told me he would be round straight after work and would shower at mine, and stay the night. He continued messaging me when he returned back to work, telling me how much fun he had and how he was excited to see me later. Then his replies got slower and yet again he stood me up, messaged at midnight and said he was busy helping his family. 

At this point, I was angry at him and at myself for falling for this yet again. He didn't message the following morning with his usual good morning text, so I asked if everything was okay and he said he was busy working. I then left him alone and didn't hear from this man again. He started posting on his stories, which he rarely does, and I took it upon myself to delete this man again. I assumed this was the part he would ignore me for a few days after hooking up, but I was sick of it. He unfollowed me immediately after he saw that I unfollowed him. Still no communication. I tweaked out a bit and called his number to ask him to delete any nsfw pictures of me he had on my phone. He called back asking who was calling and when I said my name he hung up immediately. He is now blocked on everything and I wish to never have contact with this man again. If he used me for sex why would he take the time to know me? Why would he delete my number but have my address saved, and knew where to find me on whatsapp? I am so confused. I thought he was interested in some parts. I am mad at myself for letting this happen.

Literally, I struggle with my mental in many ways and recently I've been forceful separated from my spouse, for the next few YEARS MINIMUM. The effects of it is immensely difficult and chaotic, making my other physical medical symptoms even more irritating than they've been for the past consecutive months. I'm also worried about being judged/not taken seriously due to substance abuse and psychological challenges but I feel like I am unsafe to be around my own family if it is contagious...I don't want to be dealing with whatever tf it is that's wrong with me and my body. I can't try to count the hours and hours, days, weeks straight even, that I have spent researching and testing, etc. just trying to find the slightest feeling of peace but I'm at a total fkn loss seriously. It's done ntn but educate me and I need a diagnosis! (I don't know what I'm doing lets be real) I can't get a doctor or anything like that, hopefully there's one that will see this but if anyone has anything at all, I'm in desperate search of all opinions rn.
backstory:
1 year ago-left everything and everyone behind moved into basement apartment in the city complete isolation from outside world to pursue toxic relationship, our ""bedroom""( that I rarely left-shower, toilet, rare bowl of noodles, even more rare event of me joining the living room or Tim's coffee run, etc) was a closet.. not just any closet, the type that is meant to hang ur coat in and store shoes when you just walk in, about 1m x 3m foot space but there was also the attached few m² (under the stairs-enryway so lots of dirt falling from steps) there was also a scorching hot pipe in the corner(upstairs heating system) this got annoying. Anyways stayed in the closet for roughly four/five months, reached my last straw with that idiot guy and left. Everything was great, lived life to fullest and if anything is wrong it has ntn to do with these few weeks lol. Fast forward couple months, moved back into basement apartment but never slept in that closet again, howeverrrrr this time around the basement became; toxic mold, garbage piled to ceiling, insane humidity, worst relationship experiences of humanity, some of you probably can't even begin to imagine. No bed, sometimes an air mattress on the floor man I'm telling you that this place was completely wrecked, trashed, WROTE TF OFF. UNINHABITABLE AND INHUMANE. NOW, I'm back in my family's home and feel invisible bugs, smell strong weird scents, and sm more. The symptoms just keep adding up but none ever go away or are even healing at all. I let myself go but now that I'm around my baby sisters and pets, grandparents and others I need to put an end to it. It's just getting worse and I can see it affecting my animals and house/items. I don't know if anyone can help me but as crazy as I sound this is just the base of it.

I’ve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can’t get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I’m a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It’s pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There’s still a lot about sleep that science can’t explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn’t ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or “non-scientific “ sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don’t understand as deeply. 

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you **how to hack these systems** in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don’t care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it’s really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine’s only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health** 

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes 
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

 So who’s the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days  come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.  And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone’s parking spot–but it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash…

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It’s not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions. 

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness. 

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a “second wind” but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there’s one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first. 

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep 

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep. 

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun. 

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream. 

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol—whether it's you waking up or your alarm clock—it alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day–

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it’s because  your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream—and letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee. 

Like a car,  you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight. 

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct. \[see process below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA](https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA)

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there’s still hope. There’s actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't. 

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n](https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n)

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing  your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

___
**Part 2**

So, you made it through the first post and you understand how hormones mirror each other night and day to keep you from falling asleep and staying awake.

Let's go a step further and unmask the actual actor behind your sleepless and turning nights. This is the key to always getting a sleep score that looks like this

[https://imgur.com/a/UgKJ0CQ](https://imgur.com/a/UgKJ0CQ)

*This is from my Garmin watch last night. (I’ll talk about what apps and tools I use to track my sleep another time)*

The first thing we have to understand is that it's not all about the adenosine and cortisol balance that you read about in part one ([How To Fix Your Sleep Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepTight/comments/1hoid9n/how_to_unfuck_your_sleep_for_good/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

There's a much stronger force at play and there's good and bad news.

The good news is that its stronger meaning mastering this almost guarantees good sleep

The bad news is that it can't be controlled as easily as your cortisol and adenosine levels

It's your circadian rhythm.

Think of it as an around the day internal clock. Circadian is Latin for “around the day” anyways, so it serves its name. This force dictates when those sensations will peak and trout. It’s powerful. . . And it wont ask. 

The Circadian force will turn you off and on like a light switch. Remember this chart?

[https://imgur.com/a/gqlqu2W](https://imgur.com/a/gqlqu2W)

The circadian force is the puppet master behind it. 

It acts like wheels at the base of the start and finish, shifting left and right on the time axis that dictate when you sleep. And It’s dependent on a number of factors we’ll discuss later.

For you night workers out there, your lifestyle has pushed your circadian clock far to the right, so far to the right that your sleep-drive peaks in the late morning and your wake drive peaks late at night, making your chart look more like this

Aligning your rhythm with your lifestyle is ideal and considered best practice by all the health gurus out there. But be warned. 

When you fall short of pairing these two in phase, and your circadian rhythm does not align with your outside environment . . **Insomnia** enters the chat.

In this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that drive your circadian rhythm.

I’m gonna tell you how to take back control of these systems in your body and what I did to master my internal clock to the point that I beat my alarm clock by 5 min.  Every single day.

Once again, If you don’t care about the science I'll break the post down like this so you can skip around

# How To Reset the Circadian Rhythm

The period your Circadian force demands sleep can be broken into one single block. Everyone has a unique block according to how much time you allow for sleep.  

My block looks different than yours and no two blocks look exactly the same

The schedule of this block is called your Circadian Rhythm. Think of it like an employee, working at a shop that makes sleep recovery. The shop itself is your sleep.  When it is open, you are asleep, and when you are awake the shop is closed.

Only you have the keys and control the shop hours. The problem is the employee is only there to help you, so it clocks in and out of work at the same time every day whether the shop is open or not. 

This means that regardless of what time you decide to go to bed, the employee leaves when the block is up. So if you plan on sleeping past your block, good luck.

The shop will be empty, and the rest of the time you are asleep will be useless.

This is why you can sleep for your usual amount of time and feel like shit when you wake up.

Shop was open, but nobody was there.

But what happens when you make it to bed on time but still can’t get that recovery your body needs? Chances are that one employee of yours is finicky, stubbornly showing up to work whenever it wants and leaving when it feels like it, ruining your sleep effectiveness.

This is a Circadian Rhythm disorder. And we’re gonna talk about what causes it and how to fix it.

# Circadian Rhythm Disorder

A Circadian Rhythm Disorder happens when your internal sleep clock is out of sync with your usual schedule. There are a number of things that can cause this disorder. The most common are Jetlag, inconsistent shift working, and having an inconsistent bedtime.

The way to force the syncing of that internal clock with your real sleep clock is by consistently shutting down and going to bed. At the same time. Every night.

If you show up to open your shop at different times every night, can you really blame your employee for coming in at different times?

No. You can't. Don’t have your Circadian Force guess what time you will be asleep, be intentional. Because when it’s guessing, it won't always be right, and you’ll pay the price the following morning.

There are some things you can’t plan for, like being called in to work a night shift out of nowhere, or the Jet Lag after a long flight. But the goal isn’t to avoid the reality of life, things happen. 

The goal is to become resistant to the wrinkles and inconveniences by building a disciplined and consistent Circadian Rhythm. 

**Fighting Insomnia**

Insomnia comes from the brain having trouble regulating your sleep-wake cycle. It can happen despite you consistently going to bed in the best environment possible.

When your Circadian Rhythm does not respond to your change in habits and timeliness there is something else preventing the training of your circadian rhythm

If you're experiencing this, it's super important to get it fixed as soon as possible. Your perpetual Insomnia will throw off hormones and receptors in your body and lead to bad long term effects on health and mood like

* Heart disease
* Diabetes
* Weakened immune system
* Mental health disorders
* Memory, concentration  problems, and Dementia

Lucky for you, Circadian Rhythm and Insomnia are closely related. And if you are experiencing insomnia symptoms, it could just be a Circadian disorder,

I call these my 6 Shooter Laws. These are the laws that I use to battle what I thought was Insomnia but turned out to be a funky Circadian Rhythm.  I always make sure they are present in my sleep life and when they’re not, I start to get insomnia symptoms:

|1. Stick to a Sleep Schedule|Have consistent shop (sleep) hours|
|:-|:-|
|**2. Create a Relaxing Routine**|*How To guide in the works*|
|**3. Seek specific light intensity and angles close to bedtime**|*Discussed later in this post*|
|**4. Create a sleep sanctuary**|*How To guide in the works*|
|**5. Exercise Early**|Uses Cortisol levels early in the day (Discussed in Part 1)|
|**6. Avoid Naps later in the day**|Allows Adenosine levels to rise normally (Discussed in Part 1)|

Now, If you are doing everything you can to align your environment and lifestyle with your internal sleep clock and still can’t seem to get results, chances are your problem stems from other health conditions like sleep apnea or brain related issues.

A Doctor can run tests and give you more accurate information on where your sleep troubles come from.

# Waking Up With No Alarm Clock

Earlier I mentioned the ability to wake up before your alarm clock. This is the **Mount Olympus** of sleep. 

When you get to this point you know you made it. Now that you know the bread and butter of how to get there, let me show you how to enjoy the hard work and discipline you put in.

You learned how to skateboard,  now I'll teach you how to shred.

**How Does my Brain Tell Time (The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus)**

The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus is the brain’s master clock. It doesn’t only control sleep timers, it controls every other function in your body that has anything to do with time. The Supra's perception of time is programmed by outside factors like sunlight, temperature, noise, etc. Pretty neat right?

An example of this being shown is you getting hungry at the same time every day. Having to use the bathroom every morning or night around the same time, etc.

But the most interesting part about the Supra Nucleus is not its function.

It’s the location.

It sits in the Hypothalamus, at the base of the brain, and right above the body’s main hormone dispatcher.

That might not sound too interesting at first, until I tell you that the Hypothalamus plays a role with your cerebral cortex in processing your thoughts and stress. 

This means the Supra nucleus can influence the release of cortisol based on your **thoughts and stress levels.**

Remember that time you woke up 5 minutes before your alarm clock to your first big interview or first day of school? It was no accident.

You didn’t want to be late, and the night before you hammered into your subconscious the idea of waking up at a certain time. That’s the key.

Before you go to bed, visualize yourself waking up before your alarm. Practice this regularly and it will happen often. Convince yourself to wake up at a reasonable time that aligns with your circadian block.

Your body will do the rest.

This isn’t some manifest heresy, this is years of experience and practice that turned me to research and helped me arrive at this “aha” moment.

**How to Increase Natural Melatonin**

Melatonin is a hormone. It promotes sleep onset and signals the body to rest. If Melatonin is Yin, Cortisol is Yang. Both working towards a common goal in your sleep cycle.

You know that when you first wake up, a timer is set off by your Supra Nucleus. This internal clock runs for about 12 hours. 

When the clock expires, melatonin is released into the bloodstream. 

Keep in mind that Adenosine promotes sleepiness while Melatonin helps initiate and maintain sleep at night. Signaling the body to prepare for rest.

Because melatonin only comes from the pineal gland located in the center of our brain, right in the line of sight of our eyes, the only sensory input that can cause the release of Melatonin is

You guessed it, Sunlight. 

More specifically, Intensity and angles of Sunlight

The science behind it is brain neurons in your retinas called retinal ganglion cells communicate the absence of  light or presence of sunset light and its angles to your Supra Nucleus

[https://imgur.com/a/OwzXxPN](https://imgur.com/a/OwzXxPN)

So, If you want to increase natural production of Melatonin, avoid high lumen light in the evenings and catch a few sunsets every once in a while

Avoid overhead lights and use lights around your home that lie at or beneath your line of sight, mimicking the angles low intensity light from sunsets would enter your retinas.

So now that you know everything about how to fix your Circadian Rhythm, sleep problems, and develop an internal clock, here’s the biggest tool you’ll need to get there

**Your Greatest Tool to Manage Sleep: Your Eyes**

That Supra nucleus has a connection with every single cell and organ in your body. Kind of like this

[https://imgur.com/a/UJQOaFt](https://imgur.com/a/UJQOaFt)

Provide the sensory inputs via your eyes and let your body do the rest. If you can't hit the bullseye on sleep, it’s because your sleep environment lacks those inputs.

In other words, manipulate the light around your home. Control when you consume it, how often, and the angles you take it in.

If you live in a dark climate, work nights, or for some other reason cannot reliably get lumens, I'll make a post soon about how to get artificial lumens and products you can look into for artificial high lumen lighting

Remember, it's the lumens and angles of the light that count. Sunlight is optimal because it has the most lumens and best angles (sunrise and sunset) but you can create this environment yourself. Check out some lux meter apps on your phone to measure sunlight.

Just mimic the Sun. It’s the source of life for a reason.",49,1735651924.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False
1hqequ5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hqequ5/they_werent_wet_were_they/,"they weren’t wet, were they?","My name’s Walt Kelly, and I been sittin’ on this story ‘bout a remote lighthouse off the Oregon coast for nigh on thirty-five years now. Figgered it’s time to let it loose, like a bad smell at a Sunday picnic, probly.

The lighthouse. The Widow's Tooth, some of the old-timers called it. And she’d earned it, they said. More storms rolled over that rock than you’ve had hot dinners. Old timers used to say the place was cursed, that the souls of shipwrecked sailors was trapped in the lantern room, forever watchin’ for a shore they could never reach. Just stories, mostly. Keeps the tourists interested though.

Worked that light for twelve years, I did. Seen every kind of weather the Pacific could throw, every kind of boat that dared to come close. You learn to read the water out there, know the sound of a trawler from a sailboat a mile off. Seen things you wouldn’t believe, mostly just the ocean bein’ the ocean, mind you. But this… this was different.

It was a night just like any other in late fall. The kind where the wind howled like a banshee lost in a barrel, and the waves crashed high enough to spit water right up onto the lantern room. Couldn’t see nothin’ but white fury out there. Radar was spittin’ and cracklin’, pickin’ up nothin’ but the storm itself, and I figgered that was that. You get used to the loneliness out there, the constant roar of the sea your only company. You settle into a rhythm, checkin’ the lamp, the gauges, makin’ sure Widow's Tooth was doin’ her job, warnin’ folks away from the teeth of that rock.

Then, clear as a bell over the roar, I heard it. A knock. Not a bang from the wind, nothin’ like that. A proper knock. Like someone standin’ there, polite as you please, in the middle of Armageddon.

Figgered it was the wind playin’ tricks, but then it came again. Three sharp raps. No boat coulda made it close that night without me seein’ it, hearin’ it. And even if they did… they’d be clingin’ to life, not standin’ there knockin’ like they was expectin’ tea and biscuits.

I went down the windin’ stairs, heart thumpin’ a little faster than usual. Bolted the heavy door open, and there they was. A fella, his wife, and two young’uns, huddled together. Seemed normal enough at first glance. Except… they was dry. Bone dry. Like they’d just stepped out of their parlor on a sunny afternoon. Their clothes, looked like wool, but felt… papery, almost. And their hair, the rain shoulda plastered it to their heads, but it was dry, like it hadn't even been near water.

“Lost, are you?” I asked, the wind tryin’ to rip the words from my mouth.

The fella, he had a thin mustache and a nervous look, just nodded. “Storm caught us out,” he said, his voice barely a whisper against the wind. The wife, she had her arm around a little girl, maybe six or seven, and the boy, a couple years older, was holdin’ onto his daddy’s coat.

“No boat,” I said, lookin’ past ‘em into the storm. “Ain’t seen no boats all night.”

The fella just shrugged, a weak little shrug that didn’t explain nothin’. I wasn’t born yesterday. You don’t just appear on a rock in the middle of the ocean during a gale.

“Come on in,” I said, more out of habit than anything. Couldn’t leave folks out in that.

They stepped inside, and the wind seemed to sigh now that the door was shut. They dripped nothin’ on the floor. Not a single drop. I’d just mopped the floor that afternoon, the linoleum still a bit slick. They stepped inside, and nothin'. Not a bead of water. I remember thinkin' I needed to check the desiccant in the lamp housing later, keep the moisture out. But that dryness… it wasn't right.

“Coffee?” I offered, pointin’ to the pot always brewin’ on the stove. Strong enough to float a damn horseshoe.

They nodded, still quiet. The young’uns, a boy and a girl, they didn’t say nothin’, just stood there, clingin’ to their mama’s skirts.

It was the way they looked at you though. The wife, she’d smile, a real polite smile, but her eyes… her eyes would drift off, lookin’ past you, like she was seein’ somethin’ on the wall behind you that wasn’t there. The fella, he mostly kept his head down, but every now and then, he’d glance up, a quick, dartin’ look, then back down again. Like he was expectin’ somethin’ to jump out.

And then there was the peekin’. The little girl, she’d stand in a doorway, just out of sight, just her eyes peekin’ around the jamb, starin’ at you with that same fixed smile. Or the husband, he’d be sittin’ by the fire, but you’d catch him lookin’ over his shoulder, starin’ at the shadows in the corner. The firelight dancin’ on the walls, makin’ shapes.

They didn’t act like they’d just escaped a watery grave. No shiverin’, no cryin’, nothin’. Just… there. And they stayed dry. Even sittin’ by the fire, their clothes didn’t steam, didn’t even look damp. It was unnatural.

It started subtle, just a glance here and there. But then it got more… organized. You’d be talkin’ to the fella ‘bout the storm, tryin’ to make small talk, and the wife and kids would all turn and stare at the same time, then just as quick, look away like nothin’ happened. It made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.

Once, I went up to check the lamp, the beam swingin’ out over the black water, and when I came back down, they was all standin’ in the middle of the room, just starin’ up at the ceilin’. No reason, just starin’. When I cleared my throat, they snapped their heads down, smilin’ that same empty smile. Like nothin’ was wrong.

My mind was tryin’ to make sense of it, tellin’ me I was just tired, seein’ things. But that feelin’… that cold knot in your gut… that don’t lie. I’d seen things out on the water, things you can’t explain, but this was different. This felt… wrong.

It hit me when I saw the little girl walk right through a puddle of seawater on the floor by the door. Didn’t even ripple the water. That’s when the cold really set in. That’s when I knew somethin’ wasn’t right, somethin’ was deeply, terribly wrong.

I’d been watchin’ the wife help the little boy with his coat. Just a normal thing, a mother and her son. But the way she smiled down at him… it was too wide, too fixed. And his eyes… they was lookin’ past her, lookin’ right through her. And somethin’ just clicked. That wasn’t her. And them weren’t her children. Not anymore, anyway.

Come mornin’, the storm had passed. Sun was shinin’ like nothin’ had happened. And they was gone. Just… gone. Door still bolted from the inside. No wet footprints, no nothin’. Just the memory of them smiles and them eyes.

Never saw ‘em again. Never heard nothin’ ‘bout a missin’ family. The sea keeps its secrets, and sometimes, it spits things back that ain’t what they used to be.

So, if you’re ever caught out in a storm, and someone comes to your door lookin’ for shelter… look real close. Especially if they’re dry as a bone when they shouldn’t be. And if they start starin’ at the corners of the room, smilin’ that empty smile… bolt the door. Let the storm rage. Because sometimes, the sea ain’t the only thing that washes ashore. It brings other things too. Things you don't want to see. Things that ain't natural.",6,1735651918.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1hqeqei,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqeqei,M/28/5'7” [246 to 174] (2 years) - No working out ,"Just as said in above. I don’t work out at all. I walk my dog three times a day for thirty minutes so that’s about all I do. I walk around the city a lot so that’s also about it.

I decided to lose weight by doing calorie reduction for a few reasons.

1.) I had tried diets, and while some did work, most were fad diets that were too restrictive and when I wanted to come off I didn’t have any better eating habits so whatever I lost from the diet I gained back.

2.) I never really had an issue with GAINING weight. I generally eat fairly healthy and rarely overeat or indulge in sweets. However, after a divorce I gained a lot of weight by eating my feelings, but as I healed emotionally I stopped binge-eating. Once I stopped doing that, my weight plateaued and I stayed around 250-256. I ate about 2000 calories a day so I was neither gaining or losing weight. With this mindset, I realized that it wasn’t that I necessarily eat badly, it’s that I’m eating too much to lose any weight. I know that’s an obvious conclusion for most people, but for me something in my brain finally clicked. This was something I could plan and control.

I started out slow by cutting out the bagel I would get with my morning coffee. Eventually I realized that in general, I struggle to remember to eat lunch at work and could utilize this to start intermittent fasting. I liked intermittent fasting for the most part because it shrunk my stomach and helped lower my overall appetite but it was still too restrictive with the times. I changed how I did it for my own sake and decided to keep protein bars at my desk at work in case I ever felt woozy or lightheaded. Doing this allowed me to really enjoy whatever I wanted to eat after work. I didn’t have to feel guilty if I ordered out and the calories were high, so long as I balanced it with vegetables and protein. Even so, I always liked to snack after dinner while I gamed a bit before bed so I was also letting myself have popcorn and the occasional sweet treat.

I needed to make sure I wasn’t losing too much weight too quickly or denying myself foods when I really wanted them because I know how quickly one can fall into an eating disorder. Anytime I felt myself say “no I shouldn’t do that” after having only eaten 1450 calories a day 5 days that week, I paused, and then would be resounded to buy whatever treat I had wanted because I did EARN it.

I lost all of the weight over the course of two years, but could have lost it much faster if I chose to. I chose NOT to because I had a lot to lose to hit my goal, and I didn’t want to get one of those loose skin bodies you see from ozympec success stories. No offense to those people, congratulations on their weight loss, but I know I can’t afford the surgery needed to get rid of that skin and that would be me if I did this in a year instead of two.

Rowling’s novel series? At first glance, a connection between this historical figure from Belarusian history and a fictional character appears impossible. But let us unravel this mystery together.

# “Butterbeer” by J.K. Rowling

We know relatively little about the “Butterbeer” that Harry Potter and his friends drank so eagerly in the tavern at Hogsmeade. This beverage is mentioned several times in the Harry Potter books, but the most detailed information about it appears in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* ([Bloomsbury Publishing](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-9781408855911), 1999; Image 2).

[Image 2: The cover of the first edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \(Bloomsbury Publishing, 1999\).](https://preview.redd.it/7889j2zbq6ae1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddd518251a35114b2dc3892671d600f22be7d5ad)

In this, the third book of the series, the properties and characteristics of the magical drink are described:

* **Chapter 8 “Flight of the Fat Lady”**:
* *“…in the Three Broomsticks over foaming tankards of hot Butterbeer… Too bad we couldn’t bring you any Butterbeer, it warms you up so nicely…”*
* **Chapter 10 “The Marauder’s Map”**:
* *“…Ron came back after five minutes, carrying three foaming tankards of hot Butterbeer…”*
* **Chapter 22 “Owl Post Again”**:
* *“…He skimmed through the letter and suddenly felt as warm and cozy as if he had downed a whole bottle of hot Butterbeer…”*

In addition to descriptions of its flavor in the Harry Potter books, there are a few indirect signs suggesting that “Butterbeer” might be slightly alcoholic.

**Chapter 10 “The Marauder’s Map”**

In this chapter, Ron suggests Harry visit the Three Broomsticks, where they order hot Butterbeer with a thick foam (“foaming tankards”). The tavern’s warm, noisy, and smoky atmosphere, as well as the mention of “rowdy warlocks” at the bar, adds to the feeling of a typical pub.

>*“Harry took a large sip. It was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted, warming every bit of him from the inside.”*

This “warming effect” is often attributed to drinks with a low alcohol content, while a foamy “head” is typically associated with beer.

Here, Professor Lupin brings Harry some “Butterbeer,” and Harry happily admits he has “tried this stuff before,” which slightly raises the teacher’s suspicions.

>*“Lupin… still looked a bit suspicious: how could a student have experience with such a drink?”*

The toast (“Let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory!”) and Harry’s embarrassed reaction suggest that “Butterbeer” is not perceived as a children’s drink, even though it is never explicitly called alcoholic.

**The key point:** while the books never outright claim that “Butterbeer” contains alcohol, its serving in “foaming tankards,” the “pub-like” setting, the “warming effect,” as well as Harry’s embarrassment in front of a teacher, all hint at the presence of some (albeit small) alcoholic content in this magical beverage.

In the American culinary magazine *Bon Appétit* ([Condé Nast](https://www.condenast.com/), January 2002; Image 3), J.K. Rowling [responded](https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/harry-potters-butterbeer-recipe-uncovered) to a question about what she imagined Butterbeer to taste like:

>*“I think it tastes a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch.”*

[Image 3: J.K. Rowling’s comment in Bon Appétit \(Condé Nast, 2002\).](https://preview.redd.it/s7rbv8uhq6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c556c26f54d7a5a14f540df2d3ed11f035df9f4f)

But how can one achieve the flavor and aroma reminiscent of butterscotch?

From the perspective of food chemistry and technology, when sugar and butter are heated, complex chemical transformations take place: caramelization of carbohydrates, thermal decomposition of fats, and the formation of specific compounds that create the characteristic taste and aroma of toffee and caramel.

An authoritative source on these processes is the work of scientist Harold McGee, [*On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen*](https://www.academia.edu/44009255/ON_FOOD_AND_COOKING_The_Science_and_Lore_of_the_Kitchen_COMPLETELY_REVISED_AND_UPDATED) (Scribner, 2004; Image 4). McGee describes in detail the chemical reactions that occur when sugar, butter, and dairy products are heated.

[Image 4: The cover of Harold McGee’s On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen \(Scribner, 2004\).](https://preview.redd.it/aipi0fflq6ae1.jpg?width=765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdb76dfa38ef3f02f27e2675e794c17f7a1d1ab5)

Additional scientific grounding is provided by the monograph of researcher W. P. Edwards, [*The Science of Sugar Confectionery*](https://books.google.com/books?id=JTdUXI9fz2kC) (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2000; Image 5), which thoroughly examines the technological processes of making toffee and other caramel confections.

Summarizing what we know about J.K. Rowling’s “Butterbeer”:

1. The drink is called “Butterbeer.”
2. It is served hot and has a foamy “head.”
3. The drink contains a small amount of alcohol.
4. The main ingredients are butter and sugar, which, when heated, provide a toffee-like flavor profile.

# “Butterbeer” in the Tudor Era

In English history and culture, there really was a drink called “Butterbeer.” The earliest mention of it dates back to the Tudor era and is found in the book [*The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin*](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_the-good-huswifes-handma_book_1594/mode/1up) (1594; Image 6). It is known that King Henry VIII was a fan of “Butterbeer.”

[Image 6: Portrait of Henry VIII and the “Tudor rose,” plus the cover of The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin \(1594\) featuring a “Butterbeer” recipe.](https://preview.redd.it/sb5yzmnrq6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f21911d439a896ed09d0f045cdc434d4b8bb9e54)

According to the 1594 recipe, the drink was made by heating and mixing beer, chicken egg yolks, cane sugar, and butter, with the addition of spices (nutmeg, ginger, and cloves) (Image 6).

Later sources, for instance, in chef Robert May’s [*The accomplisht cook, or, The art & mystery of cookery*](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_the-accomplisht-cook-_may-robert_1671/page/n5/mode/2up) (1671; Image 7), mention adding grated breadcrumbs, which did not affect the taste or aroma but made this already high-calorie drink even more filling.

[Image 7: The cover of The accomplisht cook, or, The art & mystery of cookery \(1671\) featuring a “Butterbeer” recipe.](https://preview.redd.it/acwjzrksq6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e83f0fbc3f54c68c4b98f31e31bdc3c26c12079)

Through a series of experimental preparations of “Butterbeer” using the 1594 recipe, we obtained a hot, mildly alcoholic drink with the same features as the magical “Butterbeer” described by J.K. Rowling: a distinct toffee-like flavor, a foamy “head,” and a hot drink containing a small amount of alcohol (Image 8). This suggests that the Tudor-era “Butterbeer” was indeed the basis for the drink appearing in the Harry Potter books.

[Image 8: An experimentally recreated “Butterbeer” using the 1594 recipe.](https://preview.redd.it/o6wxsv1xq6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=641889c78b7e38548cdfa4dc6cc516c3ba50f522)

Despite the clear similarity of recipes, in that same January issue of *Bon Appétit* (2002), J.K. Rowling insists that “Butterbeer” is her own invention. It is likely that such a statement was prompted by a desire to avoid fresh accusations of plagiarism: in 1999, when the first edition of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* (the very book in which “Butterbeer” first appears) was published, the writer already faced [a lawsuit from Nancy Stouffer](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/221/425/2486359/), who claimed Rowling had borrowed elements from her works.

Most likely, Rowling emphasized the originality of her drink to steer clear of any association with historical analogs. However, judging by surviving sources, “Butterbeer” was known as early as the Tudor era (1594) and remained popular until the 19th century. The similarity in ingredients and preparation methods suggests that this historical drink (or its later variations) served as the prototype and inspiration for the “Butterbeer” described in the Harry Potter books, and it is fair to draw an equals sign between the two.

# “Gramatka”: Sigismund I’s Beverage

“Gramatka” is not simply a drink or dish; it is part of the cultural heritage of Belarus, Lithuania, and Poland, with roots tracing back to the era of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

This beverage was one of the most popular among the szlachta (nobility) and played an important role in the ideology of Sarmatism.

“Gramatka” was considered not only a Lenten drink but also a medicinal one. Here is one mention of such a case in the descriptions of the church in the village of Vanyuzhychi in the Mazyr district dating back to 1778 (Image 9). It describes miracles attributed to the local miracle-working icon. Under the 5th point (5to) in the middle of the paragraph, it describes how an elderly noblewoman, Pani Byanetskaya, became so ill in her leg that she could not walk for 30 weeks and, moreover, during those 25 weeks of illness ate no solid food, but every day she drank a small cup of warmed beer with sour cream.

[Image 9: A description of the church in the village of Vanyuzhychi in the Mazyr district \(1778\) \(National Historical Archives of Belarus, f.136, vop.1, spr.41240, ark. 67adv\).](https://preview.redd.it/j0nh1cm0r6ae1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbc5079475ddbd8462f7c795e71fc2132feb6558)

At that time, preparing “Gramatka” required expensive ingredients, including various spices—among them cane sugar, which was also considered a spice in those days. For this reason, the drink was only accessible to the well-to-do. For a long time, “Gramatka” remained a principal morning, warming, and invigorating beverage, effectively functioning as coffee. However, around 1700, with the opening of the first *cafengauz* (coffee house) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Gdańsk, Pagenpful Street), coffee began to spread; and by the end of the 18th century, thanks to the mass appearance of coffee houses (see Image 10) and coffee becoming affordable to a broad strata of society, “Gramatka” was finally displaced from the everyday morning diet.

Merach \(today Merkinė, Republic of Lithuania\) lay on an important route between Vilnius and Grodno. The heavy traffic inspired the then starosta of Merach, Mateusz Agiński, to build a large wooden coffee house with stone vaults opposite the town hall in the marketplace. This establishment was famous for its good coffee.](https://preview.redd.it/n8fca7l3r6ae1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff491435f3b5ad74fb3da88701d844526d50f859)

Adam Mickiewicz mentions “Gramatka” in his poem [*Pan Tadeusz*](https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Pan_Tadeusz_(wyd._1834)), describing a period when it was still being drunk, but coffee had already begun to gain popularity (Image 11):

>*“The elderly ladies, rising early, sipped their coffee.*  
*Now they prepared another dish for themselves:*  
*Hot beer whitened with sour cream and butter,*  
*In which floated pieces of curd cheese.”*

[Image 11: The nobility on the left and right, and poet Adam Mickiewicz in the center with a quote from Pan Tadeusz.](https://preview.redd.it/9okatyo5r6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b79d355bb78049502edc2171d2db5c9c89cb2e4)

The earliest mentions and recipes for “Gramatka” can be found in the works of Polish historians and researchers Tomasz Święcki and Zygmunt Gloger, who studied 15th–17th century archival documents and engaged in ethnography.

In 1816, in his book [*Opis starożytnéy Polski*](https://books.google.pl/books?id=A_YKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), Tomasz Święcki, referring to King Jan III Sobieski’s English court doctor, [Bernard O’Connor](https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/bernard_o_connor_s_the_history_of_poland.html), and his work [*The History of Poland*](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_the-history-of-poland-_connor-bernard_1698/page/n1/mode/2up) (London, 1698), wrote (Image 12):

>*“In the morning, men and women usually drink a beverage of beer mixed with ginger, sugar, and egg yolk.”*

We already see obvious parallels with the Tudor-era “Butterbeer” recipe: the same basic ingredients and spices.

[Image 12: The cover of Opis starożytnéy Polski \(1816\) mentioning “Gramatka.”](https://preview.redd.it/qd6y6uq7r6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6de399b92b29c1b37d1a321cfe729b95266e7dc3)

Moreover, in various 19th-century sources (Image 13), one can find many recipes for “Gramatka” and so-called “beer soups,” which were very similar to one another and differed only in certain spices (for example, using cinnamon instead of caraway seed).

[Image 13: Recipes for “Gramatka” and “Beer Soup” from Kucharka polska \(1879\) and Praktyczna kucharka \(1886\).](https://preview.redd.it/t59i67j9r6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb56eade6963e68fe83aa0cc53657b84391ba25)

Zygmunt Gloger, in his [*Encyklopedia staropolska ilustrowana*](https://polona.pl/item-view/826c1c89-fe58-4c99-93a6-c127bb1f9891?page=4), also writes (Image 14):

>*“Gramatka is a thick soup made from beer and grated bread, which stood on Polish tables on fast days for centuries. Syrenius teaches how to cook gramatkas and other soups: ‘You must boil leftover bread in beer with sugar, adding butter, egg yolks, and some wild caraway for flavor—then you get gramatka.”*



[Image 14: Reference to a “Gramatka” recipe in Encyklopedia staropolska ilustrowana \(1900\).](https://preview.redd.it/jp7ewo8br6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c889d8890b4e938ad32e19db5688f54a8cf981b6)

Thus, along with the main ingredients (beer, butter, sugar, egg yolks, ginger), the spices vary (caraway, cinnamon, or nutmeg) according to regional and economic factors. Spices were expensive and hard to come by, which led to different varieties of “Gramatka” and “beer soups” depending on available seasonings.

Drawing on all the above, note that “Gramatka” and 1588-era “Butterbeer” share the same base:

* Beer
* Butter
* Egg yolks
* Cane sugar
* Ginger

Additional spices used in “Gramatka” may include caraway or cinnamon, while in Tudor-era “Butterbeer,” nutmeg was used (Image 15).

[Image 15: Comparison of “Gramatka” and “Butterbeer” recipes.](https://preview.redd.it/a5lyzctcr6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c744adaf946e4c214cce30a6b74b49a3bd3c1c)

This similarity in foundational recipes justifies the conclusion that “Gramatka” and “Butterbeer” are actually one and the same beverage, differing only in certain ingredient details.

Furthermore, Zygmunt Gloger in his *Encyklopedia staropolska ilustrowana*, referring to Adolf I. Pawiński and his work [*Źródła dziejowe*](https://archive.org/details/rzadysejmikowew00goog) (Warsaw, 1876–1896), also notes:

>*“Household records of Sigismund I from the 15th century, when he was still a prince, show that on fast days he usually had ‘Gramatka’ for breakfast (according to Pawiński).”*

Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Sigismund I, the grandson of the legendary Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), was a great lover of “Gramatka.” Legend has it that in 1518, when the king married the Italian Bona Sforza, “Gramatka” was served to the young bride after their first wedding night. It is believed that this is how she began her acquaintance with her new homeland and its cuisine.

All this leads to the conclusion that the Tudor-era “Butterbeer,” which served as a prototype for the beverage in J.K. Rowling’s novels, and “Gramatka” are, in fact, variations of one and the same historical recipe. Hence, Harry Potter and Sigismund I really could have been enjoying practically the same drink!

# Beer Soup: The Ancestor of “Gramatka” and “Butterbeer”

It is also worth noting that the tradition of mixing beer with egg yolks, spices, and other ingredients originated in Germany, where this beverage was known as “Beer Soup.” It has a rich history going back to the 14th–15th centuries. Early references to a recipe very similar in ingredients and preparation method to “Gramatka” can be found in[ Marx Rumpolt’s cookbook ](https://portal.dnb.de/opac/showFullRecord?currentResultId=auRef%3D12486175X%26any&currentPosition=0)(1581), suggesting that “Beer Soup” was widely known.

The classic “Beer Soup” included beer, bread, eggs, butter, and spices—the same set of ingredients we see in English “Butterbeer” and in “Gramatka” (Image 16). Essentially, it was more of a hearty beverage rather than a soup by modern standards, and people often drank it in the morning.

[Image 16: Left: The cover of Marx Rumpolt’s cookbook with extracts of “Beer Soup” recipes. Right: A cookbook cover and a portrait of Henriette Davidis.](https://preview.redd.it/9fcpfzpfr6ae1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a3f5febccef1c85a50cdb3a3a721f1da6adda89)

Documents from the German court at the start of the 18th century refer to beer and bread as “Früh” (an early drink) rather than a full breakfast. Based on this, some researchers have speculated a connection between the German word “Frühstück” (breakfast) and the Belarusian “Gramatka,” which had an alternative name “Faramushka,” resembling the German “Früh.”

It is known that King Charles II of England also consumed a similar beverage in the morning during the ceremony of washing and dressing. This is yet another piece of evidence suggesting that English “Butterbeer” has its roots in the German tradition of “Beer Soup.”

“Beer Soups” were so popular in Germany that dozens of variations existed. For example, the German emigrant Henriette Davidis, in her [*Henriette Davidis’ practical cook book*](https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/40) (1897), provides 11 variants of “Beer Soup” (Image 16).

Thus, “Beer Soup” from Germany, spreading through trade and cultural influence, became the ancestor of both the Belarusian “Gramatka” and the English “Butterbeer.”

# How to Make “Gramatka”

After studying this rich cultural and historical heritage and drawing on our own culinary experiments, here is an adapted “Gramatka” recipe—an old-time beverage once served on the tables of grand ducal and noble families for centuries. Its taste and aroma represent not just a national cuisine but also the interweaving of European gastronomic traditions, uniting a rich flavor palette and warming softness in a single mug.

# Ingredients (for 1–2 servings)

* **Beer**: approximately 500 ml (preferably dark, semi-dark, or special seasonal Christmas beers)
* **Butter**: 30 g
* **Cane sugar**: 50 g
* **Egg yolk**: 1 pc.
* **Fresh ginger**: about 2 teaspoons, grated
* **Whole nutmeg**: about 1 teaspoon grated, without the “heap”
* **Cloves**: 2–4 cloves (approx. 0.3 g)
* **Caraway seed or cinnamon** to taste (optional, depending on the desired aroma)

# Preparation

1. **Prepare the egg-and-sugar base**
2. In a small bowl, combine the cane sugar with the egg yolk until the consistency is smooth and slightly creamy. The mixture should become uniform with no grainy sugar crystals to the touch, and it should be mustard-yellow in color.
3. **Prepare the spices**
4. Grate (or finely chop) the ginger and nutmeg, and get the cloves ready. If you prefer a more traditional “Gramatka” flavor, you can add caraway seed. For a “spicier” twist, use cinnamon instead of or alongside caraway.
5. **Heat the beer with spices**
6. Pour the beer into a small pot or saucepan. Add the grated ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and optionally caraway or cinnamon to taste. Heat the beer slowly over medium heat, bringing it to a gentle boil.
7. **Tip for a non-alcoholic version**: If you want a drink without alcohol, boil the beer for about 30–35 minutes. This will evaporate the alcohol while preserving the taste and aroma.
8. **Strain the beer**
9. Once the beer reaches a boil, remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth to remove any pieces of spice. You will have a clear, richly spiced beer infusion.
10. **Combine with the egg-and-sugar mixture**
11. Pour a small amount of the hot spiced beer into a separate bowl. Slowly add the egg-and-sugar mixture to this portion, stirring thoroughly. This will temper the yolk and prevent it from curdling. Once the mixture is smooth, drizzle it back into the main portion of the beer while gently stirring.
12. **Add the butter**
13. Place the pot with the beverage on low heat and immediately add the butter. Keep stirring constantly until the butter is fully dissolved. “Gramatka” will begin to thicken and develop its characteristic creamy-caramel texture.
14. **Finish and serve**
15. Serve “Gramatka” warm or hot in heat-resistant mugs. Optionally, you can dust the top with cinnamon or grated nutmeg for extra aroma. It is best enjoyed fresh to fully appreciate its warming effect and rich taste.

For context, I am 23 years old and in my last semester of college. Nmom never wants me to go out for fun. So I let her think I was going out to study alone at coffee shops, even on holiday. She is aware that I am very studious and that my grades are consistently high. Even with a boyfriend since 2nd year, I am performing extremely well academically because he motivated me a lot. And with that, I am dedicated to finishing my studies, finding work, and go NC with my parents once I'm done being dependent on them for college tuition. 

  
But what she did now is completely out of hand. She then accused me of being a whore, a good-for-nothing, and that I was always doing shitty things that drives them mad. She said, ""You said you're smart? But why are you doing dumb shits by going to a man's house? Do you want to get married already? after everything I sacrificed for you to send you to a private school? You're so ungrateful! I don't know what the fuck is going on with you! You're so dumb! Why did you betray us like this?

  
In another context, it was HER CHOICE to send me to a private school. I actually have the option to be at a public university since I graduated as Valedictorian in my high school years with a scholarship. But SHE INSISTED for me to be in a private school no matter how much I convinced her to just put me in a public school so they don't have to pay for tuition. 

My ndad, who is even worse than her, shouted at me and said ""Just get the fuck out of our house you ungrateful, and spoiled bitch! You bring nothing good in this family, I don't even know why we have a daughter like you.""

I then contacted my bf and told him that there will be a possibility I will get out of this house. He then told me he will support me if ever I will be kicked out. Final context, I do not have pending balance anymore in my college tuition for the last sem, and for my everyday needs, my bf is willing to provide me what I need until I graduate and be independent.

### 1. **Know Thy Audience**  
You wouldn’t sell death metal to fans of acoustic coffee-shop covers, right? (Well, I mean, you *could*, it’d just be weird.)  

- **Who listens to your style?** Picture your dream listener. What are they wearing? What’s on their Spotify Wrapped this year?  
- Tap into specific communities: Are you trying to hook Gen Z synthwave stans? Indie folk nerds? Lo-fi bedroom producers? Knowing who you're talking to is already half the win.  

And hey, niche is good. Niches LOVE their own. Find your corner of the internet and *own it*.

### 2. **Social Media: Friend or Frenemy?**  
Let’s be real: social media can either be your playground or a soul-sucking vortex of anxiety. (No in-between, apparently.) Approach it as a tool, not your life’s purpose, and use it to connect with your fans.  

- **Post authentically:** Nobody’s here for the “I’m just dropping my new single, check it out” energy. They want YOU. Your goofy behind-the-scenes moments. Your process. Your random meme cringe-fests.  
- **Pick your platforms wisely**: You don’t need to be everywhere—focus on the platforms where your fans are. Love TikTok? Get ridiculous there. Prefer IG? Slide into Stories.  

The trick? Stay consistent. A quiet account fades into oblivion. Find what YOU enjoy doing and do it regularly.  

---

### 3. **Build Genuine Connections (NO. NOT SPAMMING.)**  
Imagine someone commenting ""LISTEN TO MY NEW MIXTAPE 🔥🔥"" on every post you make. Now imagine how fast you’d block them. Exactly.  

- Engage without being pushy. Comment on other artists’ posts *thoughtfully* (again, not “Yo, peep my stuff, bro”).  
- Build *real* connections in communities and subreddits like this one. Musicians supporting other musicians creates win-win situations.  

Being approachable and human is way cooler than being a spam bot.  

---

### 4. **Create a Story Around Your Art**  
Here’s the raw truth: People don’t just buy music—they buy feelings, ideas, and stories. So tell yours.  

- Why did you write this song/album/project/whatever?  
- How does it connect with you or your listeners?  

Be intentional with your visuals, your bio, your *aesthetic*. Build a vibe. Your music doesn’t live in a void—it’s part of something bigger.  

---

### 5. **Patience Is Not IRL Spotify**  
Look, not to burst the bubble, but you’re probably NOT going viral overnight. (If you do, congrats! But that’s not the norm.) Music marketing is about tight long-term strategy, not quick fixes.  

- Release regularly—even if it’s in smaller, digestible bits like singles instead of massive 18-track mega-albums no one has time for.  
- Take your time. Watch what works and double down where the payoff’s at.  
- *Celebrate the small victories.* That first comment? That 100th stream milestone? ALL WINS.  

---

### The Tl;DR: Marketing is a Beast, But You Can Totally Tame It  

So, yeah. Marketing can feel a little “blah” because all you really wanna do is make great music. Totally get that. But here’s the silver lining: it’s also a creative process when done right. It’s storytelling in action. It’s connecting with people who LOVE what you’re putting out into the universe. It’s growing a tribe of like-minded humans who *get* you.

1hqejtk,https://i.redd.it/gd1unm27q6ae1.jpeg,First year of collecting perfumes!,"If you told me at the beginning of the year that my new hobby would be collecting perfumes, I wouldn't have believed you. But here we are. Most of them have been ordered from u/svk43 and it has been great dealing with him. Not gonna review all of them but here are my favorites -

1. Choco musk layered with Mancera Amore Caffe - Amore Caffe has a synthetic opening but after an hour you basically start smelling like vanilla ice cream. Adding the dairy milk note to that with choco musk and it smells absolutely blissful.
Pairs well with Qahwa too, I feel.

2. Versace Dylan Blue - Sooooooo freshhhhh. Fresher than the mental scar your ex recently left you with. Projects nicely for like 30 minutes and then drops off. Same complaint with Coolwater ofc.

3. Azzaro M.W Intense - Fell in love since the first spray itself. Very sweet and there's noticeable hints of spiciness as well. Lasts more than 12 hrs on clothes. Probably gonna get a full bottle in the future. 

4. YSL Y - Fresh, sweet and woody. Lasts around 3 hrs on skin and 5-6 on clothes. Very safe fragrance , will please literally everyone.

Special mention - 
5. Ombre Leather - Absolutely nuclear. I don't know if I like it for the performance or the fragrance itself. Sprayed on my neck at 8:30 AM and could still smell it after gym at 9:30 PM - 10/10

6. TF Black Orchid - Got it for free (1.5 ml) with the Ombre Leather decant. Know that smell when you step out of the salon or that purple Lux body wash? Yeah that one. Has kinda grown on me with time. Performance is great too - lasts all day on clothes.

[Hall of Shame]
7. T.K Velvet Chocolate - Okay I get that it is supposed to smell like intense chocolate. But honestly, it smells like burnt dark chocolate. Like, chocolate which will ruin your gut the next day kind of chocolate. I wonder if it will pair well with some other perfume. Can't comment on performance because i had sprayed once on my wrist before gym and I could smell the same note 3 hrs later too.

Wanted to share my personal experience with all the cafe's and roasters i've tried.

First of all, i'm amazed by all the quality coffee i've seen in the top ones. A lot of good Panama's available and they were all amazing. 

[Gotta collect them all](https://preview.redd.it/cdxp3434h6ae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3259640718154ad29fb0fb74da74e12cdea94b4d)

I will start in Tokyo, Japan;  
Went to Glitch, Leaves & Apollon. And with Leaves I was truly amazed by their coffee, shop and approach in the roastery. They make a small chat with you, ask what you usually like and there is a menu to choose from (cheaper to premium beans). I went for the Ethiopia Sky project and my girlfriend took the Panama Elida Falda - this Panama was the best beans we experienced in a while. From hot to colder a vibrant, bright and complex cup. Luckily they still had 2 bags for sale.

[The view when waiting for your coffee](https://preview.redd.it/0rurjfmpi6ae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=143b25218f034d4432f422f6930e5c017b439c44)

[Checking their pouring technique](https://preview.redd.it/47jcy0jxi6ae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbc1f8a9f320734db66f72588d94bee0be476536)

  
And then Glitch. Not that bad que (like 30mins). Wide selection from cheap to premium too. Took an espresso and a pour over tasting board with 3 coffees. For some reason it felt not so comfortable and a bit rushed.

[Ethiopia Hartume - Colombia Monteblanco - Panama Volcan Finca Deborah](https://preview.redd.it/fq8rp836k6ae1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fd89bcd33483c06cc9a494356e23d1bff6dcee3)

The Ethiopia was really nice and spot on with the notes. Unfortunately the most premium beans (panama) were really muted, dull and not like we expected. I talked a bit with the barista and said the panama was not really it – he didn't really understand where I was going. The espresso was too cold and not tasty.

So with Glitch I don't really understand the hype. They have a nice selection but i'm missing the personal touch (this is just my experience).

  
Then Apollon's Gold. Really chill neighbourhood, no que, nice staff. We had a La Isla and a Gesha from Pepe Jijon. Unfortunately we got served in paper cups. Coffee didn't taste that amazing and a bit roasty for us.

https://preview.redd.it/e7od5qamm6ae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6dcf6f0ac1c07fa22749a43f88a9810c8d3e82

Another shop in Osaka which was really surprising me was LiLo coffee roasters. You have to love the co-ferment and super fruity coffees. The smell in the shop is really something.

[Part of the premium menu from LiLo coffee roasters](https://preview.redd.it/rg5h8dsum6ae1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9af6ba5df6734438b3439f1e175aed681f78ceef)

  
Then over to Thailand, it was mixed. The Thai beans didn't blow us away with its profile. Best experience was Terroir in Chiang Mai, Thailand. And now they also opened a location in Bangkok, Thailand.

[Terroir in Chiang Mai](https://preview.redd.it/1xb7jvttn6ae1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baef7c9b6c54a32a7dde9e1fdc1f00b5efa6fdb)

In the end the whole trip was worth every penny. Quite surprised with the que's in Japan at the premium spots. Waiting 30 to 60 mins can be quite normal. And will definitely visit Leaves coffee roaster again.

The haul;

Please help me lock in my nutrition and workout routine,

I am not currently training for anything specific other than to be better than I was yesterday, I want to build muslce and maintain weekly mileage so im not totally out of running shape for any spur in the moment marathon.

I am a 5ft9"" Male 29 years old weighing in around 214-219lbs


Workout routine:

Sunday: Rest

Monday: 5 mile easy run (10 minute mile pace), followed by Chest, Triceps and Shoulders.


Tuesday:  5 mile tempo run(8:30-9 minute mile pace),followed by Back, Biceps


Wednesday: Off


Thursday: Speed work(5 half mile sprints(low 7 minute pace) and then 2 mile easy run), followed by Shoulder, Biceps,Triceps



Friday: 3 mile easy run or 5 mile on ebike, followed by Legs and Abs



Saturday: Optional long run(if i have time) Or monthly run club  race
 (Which varies depending on the race between 5-13 miles.)

I keep my lifts short and heavy after I do a warm up set. I do 3 sets of 8 and then 1 set till failure,  I do machines and free weights to try to get the muslce a couple different ways.


I try my best to hit all the miles, but somedays I do less but I will run at least 3 miles minimum. 


An example of my basic max lifts are:
Bench: 245lb
Leg press: 810lb+( my gym only has smith machines, and I can't squat with those)



Nutrition:

Breakfast: .5lb of 80/20 ground beef with 6 large eggs, coffee with a few tablespoons  of heavy cream



Lunch: 1lb 80/20 hamburger meat with a few pieces of Kerrygold Dubliner cheese 



Dinner: 1lb of either steak/salmon/lamb/ground beef
Maybe a little cheese as a snack after dinner



All is seasoned with only salt/pepper/garlic and cooked with with butter or tallow



All of this should be into the low/mid 3,000 calories with 245+ grams of protein, I also take creatine and magnesium daily. 


I have been doing this for a few months now with a lot of tweaking along the way and like to think I can see a change in muslce growth. I weigh myself somewhat daily and the scale has been all over the place. From 207lbs-220lbs. So i am really trying to lock everything in and be perfectly consistent everyday ",1,1735651100.0,ketogains,0,1.0,False

1hqeg83,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1hqeg83/ghosted/,Ghosted,"Hey guys, I need some advice as I struggle with reading in between the lines. I have a feeling I was used for sex but I got so many mixed signals i can't tell. Any suggestions on what's going in inside this man's head is much appreciated.

I matched with this guy on bumble back in August, he then followed my Instagram and we'd occasionally talk, he'd reply to my stories and like them. 

Early October we exchanged numbers would iMessage each-other, playing iMessage games and him just being sweet, getting to know me, and things like telling me he'd bring me soup if I was sick, or wanting to meet. I told him I wasn't comfortable meeting at my place, and he reassured me, telling me he doesn't want to just come for sex and that he just wants to see me. He did frequently get upset if I didn't message back within a certain timeframe (1-2hours), stating that I was playing mind games with him, and if I didn't reply in a certain amount of time, he was done with me. I work a 12 hour shift pattern Monday-Saturday, which he knew of, so his words annoyed me, so I made the decision to just delete him off everything and called it a day. 

He then came back a month later requesting both of my Instagram accounts, saying he still wanted to see me. From there we started talking again and he seemed like he had mellowed out a little bit more. 
Fast forward, a week later we ended up grabbing coffee and then went to my place. We watched a movie and ended up hooking up. After that, he left and went home because he was working early the following day. I didn't hear from him until I then posted a selfie on my Instagram around 4 days later to which he replied to, and then said he wanted to see me again. A few days after that, we then hooked up again he stayed the night and he took his time to them get to know me, even after we had sex (the bar is in hell, I know). 

The following morning we then hooked up yet again, and he dropped me to work. This man then went ghost again for a few days. However, was always watching and liking my Instagram stories, to which I just assumed he wasn't looking for anything serious, which was fine because I was the either.  A week later he messaged and said he would see me after he went to a birthday meal. I waited up for him and he finally replied at midnight, saying he had only just got home, I gave him the benefit of the doubt but I was a bit upset. He said he would make it up to me and see me the following evening, but then the same thing happened. I left this man alone again, however this time I didn't delete him off anything.

He then ended up going on vacation for a few days and when he came back, he started hitting me up over Whatsapp, saying how bad I am at replying and asked if I would would reply better on that app instead of Instagram, which, by the way, my replies were never bad when we reconnected I always replied to him within 10-20 mins. It was reasonable, whereas he would just ghost me for days after we hook up. He then started messaging me nonstop for an entire week, replying back within a two minute timeframe, which was weird because his replies used to be slow. 

He was asking me about my Christmas plans and my family and was just being genuinely sweet again. It then turned into sexting and we'd agreed to meet on the upcoming Saturday evening, where he said he would stay the night. For the rest of the week, we'd go back and forth from sexting and sweet small talk. Saturday morning, he ended up convincing me to let me see him during his lunch break at work, we then hooked up. He told me he would be round straight after work and would shower at mine, and stay the night. He continued messaging me when he returned back to work, telling me how much fun he had and how he was excited to see me later. Then his replies got slower and yet again he stood me up, messaged at midnight and said he was busy helping his family. 

At this point, I was angry at him and at myself for falling for this yet again. He didn't message the following morning with his usual good morning text, so I asked if everything was okay and he said he was busy working. I then left him alone and didn't hear from this man again. He started posting on his stories, which he rarely does, and I took it upon myself to delete this man again. I assumed this was the part he would ignore me for a few days after hooking up, but I was sick of it. He unfollowed me immediately after he saw that I unfollowed him. Still no communication. I tweaked out a bit and called his number to ask him to delete any nsfw pictures of me he had on my phone. He called back asking who was calling and when I said my name he hung up immediately. He is now blocked on everything and I wish to never have contact with this man again. If he used me for sex why would he take the time to know me? Why would he delete my number but have my address saved, and knew where to find me on whatsapp? I am so confused. I thought he was interested in some parts. I am mad at myself for letting this happen.

My friend we will name her Jennifer who has been with her man for 2 years a month later got engaged also. She had planned her wedding to be a year later in 2020. I didn't plan to have mine til Late 2021 as I wanted to be certain I was marrying the right guy for me by giving the engagement some time and us to settle in together. 

Well Jennifer had asked me to be in the wedding of hers and I accepted. She had requested that I don't talk to her about any of my wedding planning because this is her time not mine. First red flag. But okay. 

Jennifer and I lived 4 hours away but in our early 20s we worked together. But my man and I went to visit her and her man so we can talk wedding planning and also because I missed her. When there I colored and cut Jennifer hair. I had made dinner. I cleaned up the kitchen. The next day I made coffee in the morning as I was a early bird and got ready for the day because we was having a party with the wedding party. During the party as we was outside drinking and Jennifer was not around her partner was drinking and blurted out that she bought the ring and forced the engagement. *Second red flag* 

That night after everyone left. Jennifer and her partner got in a fight. He was yelling at her about being a crappy host because I was making myself at home and cooking and cleaning. Being a good house guest. My man said if I ever treat you that way slap me. Jennifer heard that. 

The next day my man and I left. We of course said our good byes I hugged Jennifer and my man shock her man's hand. Everything was fine but then bam 5 mins into the drive home I was getting text messages. That she hates my man. That I'm no longer welcome to stay at her house when we come in. That she don't want me in the wedding. At this point I didn't have anything to say I was heart broken and I was mad and I just blocked her on everything... so I thought. 

5 months later of no connection. I logged into a old email and saw there was messages from Jennifer on my old Pinterest that I never use. I never really cared for that App but I wanted to see what she had to say. 

Jennifer was telling me she was Sorry and that she missed me. And said like she went to far and that she isn't going to give up trying to get me back as a friend. 

I at this point. *this was dumb* I forgave her and let her back in my life. My man said that's fine but he don't like that decision and don't want to go around her. *fair* he was smart. ",1,1735650576.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

If I had an abundant amount, somewhere down the line it vanishes and I find myself broke and looking for a job again. I find a job, catch up on credit card debt once I'm secure, I end up losing that job and its the same pattern all over again. 

I am currently unemployed (receiving unemployment) and looking for a new job. I told myself everything always works out. 

My routine is as follows: I tell myself whatever I visualize will come true. So everyday for about ten minutes I just visualize my dream job. Well, not just my dream job, but my ideal day. I wake up next to my partner, get ready, make my coffee, go to work, come back and see my partner at home.

I do this everyday when I wake up, after the gym in the morning and I'll try to visualize this before I fall asleep. 

I'm getting ready to pay my rent for JAN 1 and I looked at my bank account and I'm like ""shit, this number is low"" And what happened? I began to panic internally. ""Shit, how am I going to pay for this, this and that!""

The old me would have just sat there panicked, reached out to a bunch of friends ""hey! If you have any leads on jobs please let me know!"" 

I told myself that number that I saw in my bank account is not real. I closed my eyes and saw the ideal number in my head. I closed my eyes and visualized THAT IDEAL JOB in my head. Telling myself whatever I just visualized is the ideal reality. The true reality. 

I know I will find a job and I will find it not in a scarcity mindset but in a mindset that doesnt come from lack or panic. I will take inspired action and/or will have a job come to me when I least expect it. 

I just want to check in with you all if this is the best route to go when you are feeling a bit frantic about your finances?

1hqeauy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hqeauy/doctor_isnt_concerned/,Doctor ‘Isn’t Concerned’ ,"There’s a lot going on here, I appreciate anyone who bears with me. 

I am female, 37. On December 9th I got blood and urine tests done because my hair had started thinning. My stylist is pretty sure it’s due to the products I was using and we’ve made some changes (already seeing some small signs of improvement), but I got testing at her recommendation just in case it was an underlying health issue. 

Test results are available online in my Province and I did look at them, but apparently due to the way the website is laid out, I missed a chunk of results. 

What I saw when I first looked is that my Potassium is 3.4 mmol/L my Ferritin 25 ug/L is (despite taking iron supplements daily), and Vitamin B12 1406 pg/mL (I was also taking supplements for that and stopped). When I spoke to my doctor she only brought up the portion of my results that I’d seen, and said she is “not concerned at anything [she] is seeing.” She said to make sure I’m getting more potassium and iron (despite me telling her that I take 28mg of high absorption iron supplements a day), and to watch my B12 intake, (which as I said I stopped those supplements right away). She also said my thyroid is fine.

This morning I remembered I had gotten urine tests as well and didn’t see those results, so I decided to take another look at the report. That’s when I realized I’d missed a big portion of it. From the other results I discovered the following: Erythrocytes 3.79x10*12/L, MCV 101.8fL, MCH 34.0 pg, Urobilinogen 3.2 umol/L.

I did some research and I’m noticing that I have a lot of the symptoms these results would cause, and have had them for years. I’ve been gaslit my entire life by doctors about my health. I’m not exaggerating. For example, I started having issues with fatigue in elementary school where I would struggle to stay awake in class. When it was brought up then, and any time since that I’ve brought up struggling to stay awake throughout the day, I’ve been shrugged off that it’s one minor thing or another and never had it investigated. 

Some of the symptoms I’ve learned to live with over the years, that apparently these things can cause are: fatigue, weakness, paleness, mouth/tongue soreness and ulcers, memory issues, balance issues, shortness of breath over a small amount of exercise/movement, heart palpitations, fast heartbeat even at rest, poor concentration and being easily confused. 

I have been accused of most of these symptoms being ‘in my head’, and have had extensive mental health treatment (mindfulness, DBT, CBT, childhood trauma therapy; and have spoken to multiple therapists, counsellors, psychiatrists and psychologists). I am diagnosed with ADHD and BPD, with depression and anxiety as side effects. I work for an Autism resource centre and many of my coworkers who are Autism experts think that I am also Autistic.

At the time these tests were taken I was not on any medication other than Depo Provera shots every three months. From 2008-2010 I had a period of alcoholism that has been under control since. I smoked weed (about 3g a day) from 16 until I quit cold turkey 4 months ago. I also have IBS. I am 5’3” and average around 135lbs (my weight fluctuates frequently between 120-145lbs).

Due to my IBS I watch what I eat, I am on a low FODMAP diet (and was at the time of the tests) and am working on figuring out my food triggers. I drink between 1-3L of water a day. I haven’t had coffee on a daily basis for 6 months now, instead I drink GamerSupps which is a drink powder that is vitamin fortified (vitamin C, D3, B6, B12 and H, as well as a nootropic blend) but also has caffeine in it; I have one serving of that per work day. I have been taking vitamin D, C, iron and magnesium/calcium/zinc supplements daily; I no longer take B12 daily and am now taking potassium daily.

I’m not catastrophizing with this research, just educating myself. I’m mostly frustrated at having my symptoms gaslit and blamed on my mental health for over 30 years. 

All of this is to say/ask, I’m wondering if contrary to what my doctor said, we should in fact be concerned?",2,1735650315.0,AskDocs,3,0.75,False

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist.

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat not that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

Cheers and Godspeed!

I worked as a barista in an independent coffee shop back in 2014/15, so I have some experience, though it’s been a while. I’ve been researching machines and grinders for nearly a year, and I am nearly ready to hit go now (I think). My daily routine includes a flat white every morning and an espresso in the afternoon before a run, so I need something reliable for both milk-based drinks and straight shots. My total budget is around £1250, though spending less would be great!

**Espresso Machine**  
I was leaning towards a modded [Gaggia Classic Pro E24 from Home Baristas UK](https://www.thehomebaristas.co.uk/e24-gaggia-classic-pro-brass-boiler-model--includes-pid-9-bar-spring-pressure-gauge-enclosure-all-colours-available-new-super-st) (£945), with PID, pressure gauge, 9-bar pressure, SuperSteam mod, shot timer, and eco bypass mod.

However, I recently found the [Lelit Elizabeth PL92T from Coffee Friend](https://www.coffeefriend.co.uk/p/coffee-machine-lelit-elizabeth-pl92t-2/), a double boiler, for £990 (plus a £100 cashback voucher for a grinder).

The small price difference and the double boiler’s convenience make this a tough choice. Which would you recommend for consistent shot quality, ease of use, and versatility for both milk-based drinks and espressos?

**Grinders**  
I’ve been considering the DF54, which seems like a solid option. But, if I went for the Lelit Elizabeth, I would get £100 towards a DF64 which brings it to a similar price. Consistency and grind quality are my main priorities, as it’ll mostly be for espresso, with the occasional French press. Would love to hear your recommendations!

Wake up to the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee, perfectly timed to your schedule.  This eliminates the need for early morning preparation and ensures you never miss your morning caffeine fix.

**4. Automatic Shutoff:**  Enjoy peace of mind knowing that the coffee maker automatically shuts off two hours after brewing. This safety feature prevents accidents and energy waste, ensuring efficient and responsible use of the appliance.

### Maintaining Your Investment: Cleaning and Troubleshooting

Regular maintenance is key to prolonging the life of your Alexa Smart Coffee Maker.

**Cleaning Tips:**

* **Regular Cleaning:**  Clean the carafe, filter basket, and water reservoir regularly to prevent mineral buildup and ensure optimal performance. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines.
* **Descaling:**  Descale your coffee maker periodically to remove mineral deposits that can affect taste and brewing efficiency.  The frequency depends on your water hardness; consult your user manual for recommended descaling intervals.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Clogged Brew Basket:**  If your coffee maker is brewing slowly or unevenly, check the brew basket for clogs. Remove any grounds or debris.
* **Weak Brew:**  Ensure you're using the correct amount of coffee grounds and that your water level is appropriate for the number of cups you're brewing.
* **No Power:**  Check the power cord connection and the electrical outlet.

For more detailed troubleshooting, always refer to the Hamilton Beach official documentation.

Since my divorce, I (mid 60’sF) have been on probably 50 first dates. Had a few short relationships, a couple situationships, but nothing has gelled. I haven’t met anyone in all those dates or encounters who really knew how to communicate and shared common interests. Some  guys were just fun for sex, but there was nothing between the ears. I want more than that, and went off OLD months ago.

I have a male friend (who is almost a decade older than I am) that I’ve known for years from a common activity. We have often emailed each other to share articles or podcasts, and have gotten together many times for coffee. I always enjoy his company and he always tells me he enjoys mine—very bright guy and we share a lot of interests. But I’ve never felt a romantic spark. Recently he has started to ask me to do things that feel more like dates (meals, museums, concerts, hikes, etc) and I was honest and told him immediately— when we moved from just coffee — that I was only interested in friendship. He said that was fine. 

Lately we are spending even more time together. He is very easy for me to be with, and we do have a good time. He has so many qualities I seek in a partner (and he runs circles around 99% of my OLD dates), but I’m not particularly attracted to him and he is so much older (although in very good shape). He seems OK with the relationship as it stands, although I sense he’d like more if I were interested. 

I value the friendship a lot, but wonder if men are really OK long term with a platonic relationship. Or is this man waiting it out, hoping I’m going to change my mind?  I love having a good male friend, but also wonder whether I’m missing a real opportunity --or just have to accept that sometimes everything might be there…except the physical chemistry.

Early October we exchanged numbers would iMessage each-other, playing iMessage games and him just being sweet, getting to know me, and things like telling me he'd bring me soup if I was sick, or wanting to meet. I told him I wasn't comfortable meeting at my place, and he reassured me, telling me he doesn't want to just come for sex and that he just wants to see me. He did frequently get upset if I didn't message back within a certain timeframe (1-2hours), stating that I was playing mind games with him, and if I didn't reply in a certain amount of time, he was done with me. I work a 12 hour shift pattern Monday-Saturday, which he knew of, so his words annoyed me, so I made the decision to just delete him off everything and called it a day. 

He then came back a month later requesting both of my Instagram accounts, saying he still wanted to see me. From there we started talking again and he seemed like he had mellowed out a little bit more. 
Fast forward, a week later we ended up grabbing coffee and then went to my place. We watched a movie and ended up hooking up. After that, he left and went home because he was working early the following day. I didn't hear from him until I then posted a selfie on my Instagram around 4 days later to which he replied to, and then said he wanted to see me again. A few days after that, we then hooked up again he stayed the night and he took his time to them get to know me, even after we had sex (the bar is in hell, I know). 

The following morning we then hooked up yet again, and he dropped me to work. This man then went ghost again for a few days. However, was always watching and liking my Instagram stories, to which I just assumed he wasn't looking for anything serious, which was fine because I was the either.  A week later he messaged and said he would see me after he went to a birthday meal. I waited up for him and he finally replied at midnight, saying he had only just got home, I gave him the benefit of the doubt but I was a bit upset. He said he would make it up to me and see me the following evening, but then the same thing happened. I left this man alone again, however this time I didn't delete him off anything.

He then ended up going on vacation for a few days and when he came back, he started hitting me up over Whatsapp, saying how bad I am at replying and asked if I would would reply better on that app instead of Instagram, which, by the way, my replies were never bad when we reconnected I always replied to him within 10-20 mins. It was reasonable, whereas he would just ghost me for days after we hook up. He then started messaging me nonstop for an entire week, replying back within a two minute timeframe, which was weird because his replies used to be slow. 

He was asking me about my Christmas plans and my family and was just being genuinely sweet again. It then turned into sexting and we'd agreed to meet on the upcoming Saturday evening, where he said he would stay the night. For the rest of the week, we'd go back and forth from sexting and sweet small talk. Saturday morning, he ended up convincing me to let me see him during his lunch break at work, we then hooked up. He told me he would be round straight after work and would shower at mine, and stay the night. He continued messaging me when he returned back to work, telling me how much fun he had and how he was excited to see me later. Then his replies got slower and yet again he stood me up, messaged at midnight and said he was busy helping his family. 

At this point, I was angry at him and at myself for falling for this yet again. He didn't message the following morning with his usual good morning text, so I asked if everything was okay and he said he was busy working. I then left him alone and didn't hear from this man again. He started posting on his stories, which he rarely does, and I took it upon myself to delete this man again. I assumed this was the part he would ignore me for a few days after hooking up, but I was sick of it. He unfollowed me immediately after he saw that I unfollowed him. Still no communication. I tweaked out a bit and called his number to ask him to delete any nsfw pictures of me he had on my phone. He called back asking who was calling and when I said my name he hung up immediately. He is now blocked on everything and I wish to never have contact with this man again. If he used me for sex why would he take the time to know me? Why would he delete my number but have my address saved, and knew where to find me on whatsapp? I am so confused. I thought he was interested in some parts. I am mad at myself for letting this happen.

My sleep has improved quite well, but one thing I've begun to notice is my appetite has also increased huge. I'll have an average sized dinner around 530pm or so, and then by 8pm I'm hungry again. I don't want to end up starving by bedtime around 10-1030, so I'll make myself something like pasta for example around 8, scarf that down, and I'm good. 

The problem is now I'm pretty much having a meal way too close to bedtime which is not good for my sleep. I'm not sure if its the cause of my early awakenings, but this is the one issue I seem to keep having that I can't shake. I'll fall asleep easier than I ever did while on caffeine. I'll get more deeper sleep than I ever did while on caffeine. But instead of waking up around 7am which would be idea, I'm waking up around 5am which is leaving me feeling quite exhausted throughout the day.

Anyone have any advice or thoughts on what might be happening? I have little to no anxiety with regard to sleep so I definitely do not beleive that could be the issue here. I think there is something else going on whether its the food too late or possibly something else. From now on instead of a full meal I'm going to try and just have a healthy snack like a banana, apple, crackers or a granola bar bc one thing is for sure, I can't ignore these new late evening hunger surges.",1,1735649061.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I’m a first time poster hoping to get involved in the community! 
I’ve been learning Brazilian Portuguese in mini doses daily for the past 2 years on Duolingo. I’ve found it’s a pretty easy habit to just commit to finishing at least one lesson a day and keep that streak going. For me it’s first thing in the morning with my coffee before getting ready for work. It usually takes me about 5 or 10 minutes then i’m done. 
 I’ve got zero pressure to learn, I just always thought it would be a cool skill to be able to get by in another language. 
I read a recommendation in another thread for “Clozemaster” I just tried it and it looks like a great addition for days when I feel like doing more! 
I’ve waded through a bunch of recommendations for tv shows, podcasts etc online and obviously you get your good and bad recommendations when you’re totally new to something- here’s mine!

On Netflix I’ve found a couple of shows (I’ve been putting the language to Brazilian and also the captions) So far I really liked “ninguém tá olhando” the pace and plots are pretty easy to follow and it’s a good watch. “The 3% “is good too, although the first show is easier paced for my level.

 For Podcasts I’ve listened to a lot of “café Brasil” while driving- this was a lot easier at my last job where I drove a work truck for a minimum 2 hrs a day and would absorb what I could and let the rest just brush by me and hopefully leave a mark! 

Ai- Chatgpt has been an excellent resource-when I’ve got time I’ll set a prompt for the ai to chat, create a role play, quiz me on vocabulary. 

Facebook- I’ve joined quite a few language and travel communities it’s a very mixed bag I guess I haven’t really found anything captivating enough to recommend specifically, but there’s loads of content for your feed to immerse more with. 

Having different avenues of learning in my spare time has been a natural and interesting evolution and I’m always looking for more.
Disclaimer on my perspective!- 
I’m male, 51, married with a family, work full time, living in the USA 
I’ve had a couple of occasions to use my most basic words through work- most recently I had to access someone’s attic, and the only way there was through a tenants apartment who was Brazilian. It was a great moment to rehearse a phrase and learn the word “sótão”!

1hqdjtw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqdjtw,Zyn review.,"This is a coffee flavored zyn rated strong. 

If you've never tried nicotine then be prepared to vomit.
 
If you've tried nicotine and have built some kind of tolerance then this doesn't give you the kind of kick everybody says it does. I'm sure you have to be a regular user to get that effect. But if this is your first time you will feel nauseating, but just a little bit. 

The taste is coffee so putting that aside I'd say the tingly sensation you'll feel is the same as that of cinnamon. It's spicy and hurts a wee bit. When the saliva takes the content inside one of these pouches to your tongue, you'll for sure get reminded of that time you had cinnamon. 

Now the question begs: Will this remove the smoking addiction? Not sure, maybe it's more likely to change your addiction from cigarettes to zyn when you start to feel the kick. But if you're like me that smokes maybe once a while and don't find the fun in it, you'll probably dislike frequent uses of this. It surely is great if you dont want the aftermath of smoke scent on you all the time. But perhaps I don't really understand the nicotine addiction. 

There are two types of flavor that I'm aware of: coffee and apple. 

Should you try it? Depends upon your system and how well you handle nicotine, weed and alcohol. All comes down to tolerance I suppose. If you're all about flavour then have fun with trying stuff. 

Do I recommend it? I'm not sure as I went through all the tolerance and your preferences. But as I say often, even if you're healthy your entire life or sick, you will die one day and no one will give a fuck. It's like finishing an open world game like rdr and rdr2, you'll realize that you've missed so many hidden details and Easter eggs and treasure hunting. This doesn't mean that you should go jump off a cliff because you'll die anyways but more like,"" I tried that and that so and so."" There is a high chance you'll get addicted but honestly you can get professional help and realize who you are and what you want to be as a person. You can have a perfect job, career and marriage but still try stuff and not effect your life. For me realization is what's keeping me away from addiction. In conclusion I don't recommend it because I don't know you. But never forget to have some good time. Have a great day! ",1,1735647395.0,NepalSocial,1,0.67,False

So the recipe I'm following for now, is famous Coffee Chronicler with changes for sweeter cup. I grinded 20G of coffee. I utilized tap water double filtered through Brita filter, and unfortunately I don't have gooseneck kettle but more traditional electric one. Having opened valve and using 93°C water I poured the first 160g of water within 20 seconds so that I can close the valve at the 25 seconds mark. Before closing but after finishing this pour I did a small swirl for higher agitation. Then at 30 seconds mark I started pouring the rest of my water. I think I poured a little bit too fast and aggressively ending this pour at about 50 seconds. At around 1 minute and 10 seconds I added more agitation by mixing with the spoon the content of the switch. I opened the valve at 2 minutes mark finish the brew at 3 minutes.  
  
The resulting cup was quite sweet with little acidity and light body. Overally pleasant for my liking. But at times it was a little bit too harsh and bitter? Even quite burnt tasting. Is this just what to be expected from the switch due to the immersion step that there always be some kind of bitterness? Or should I try less agitation, cooler water maybe 91°C or to grind coarser?  
  
Ngl today I added more agitation and grinded one click finer than yesterday since I felt like my cup was a little hollow but acidic/bitter at the same time, but maybe I still don't understand some basic concept of pour overs. Even though I've been using V60 for two years I still feel like I don't understand some basic concept and my cups often miss the mark.

Is it worth upgrading? I paired my bambino with a sage grinder so I assumed my set up was similar but now I'm thinking a second hand express may the way to improve the experience. 

Or was it just the coffee shop beans my friend was using? The crema looked better on the express too although the Bambino sometimes does this too. ",1,1735647332.0,BrevilleCoffee,6,0.67,False

I’m Sam, a Warhammer hobbyist for almost eight years, and I wanted to share something I’ve been working on, I hope this is the right place as it is my first time posting on Reddit. Inspired by old-school RuneScape videos from Tedious, I put together a spreadsheet that randomly generates tasks to help you work through your Warhammer model kits. While I haven’t fully used it for my own painting yet (it’s still brand new), I’ve tested it a lot and think it’s a fun way to keep the hobby fresh and exciting!

Here’s how it works:

* **Random Tasks:** Click the ‘Generate Task’ button, and the spreadsheet will assign you a model to buy, build, and paint. Once you’re done, just hit ‘Complete Task’ to check it off.
* **Tier System:** You’ll start with Easy Tier tasks, move to Medium Tier, and then tackle the Hard Tier.
* **Fully Customizable:** Got your own kits or goals? You can add them by including a picture, name, status, and army in a new row.
* **What’s Included:** I’ve manually added every model from the Warhammer webstore (as of the 'Last Edited' date) except terrain, Warhammer+ exclusives, and resin kits. Prices are based on the NL version of the store.

A few things to keep in mind:

* **Download the File:** The spreadsheet is 122.5 MB because it includes pictures of every model, so it’s too big to run on Google Sheets. You can download it from my Google Drive (link below).

* **Enable Macros:** I’ve coded the spreadsheet using VBA to handle the task generation and completion buttons, so make sure to allow macros when you open it.
* **Use It Your Way:** You can also manually complete tasks by editing the 'Status' column or tweak the spreadsheet to fit your needs—totally up to you!

If you enjoy the spreadsheet and want to support my work, there’s a Buy Me a Coffee QR code on the dashboard, so I can get myself a coffee while I plow through the Easy Tier. ☕

I hope this adds some extra excitement to your Warhammer hobby! Let me know how it works for you, and feel free to share any feedback or ideas.

Thanks for checking it out, and happy hobbying! 😊",1,1735647035.0,Warhammer40k,4,0.66,False
