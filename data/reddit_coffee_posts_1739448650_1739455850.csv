1iojs0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1iojs0t/best_electric_kettle_dezin_glh200a_review_is_it/,Best electric kettle DEZIN GLH-200A review: Is it worth your money?,"I’ve been using the DEZIN GLH-200A electric kettle daily for a couple of months now, and it’s been a bit of a mixed bag. As someone who starts every morning with a big mug of tea and ends most evenings with a steaming cup of chamomile, having a reliable kettle is non-negotiable for me. This one? It’s a solid contender but not without some hiccups.

The first thing I noticed was the sleek, stainless-steel design. It blends effortlessly with my modern kitchen and doesn’t feel out of place on the countertop. The 2-liter capacity is fantastic—I can boil enough water for several cups of tea, instant noodles for lunch, and even some hot water for cleaning all in one go. It’s efficient, consuming 1,000 watts, and heats water surprisingly fast. I timed it, and it took just under five minutes to hit boiling point when filled to the max. The BPA-free construction and premium stainless-steel interior are reassuring. I’m glad I’m not accidentally seasoning my tea with plastic chemicals.

However, the kettle isn’t perfect. The auto shut-off and boil-dry protection features work well in theory, but I had a minor scare when I accidentally left the lid open. The kettle kept boiling longer than I expected, and I panicked. The handle, though soft and non-slip, still gets a little warm—definitely not ideal.

[Check DEZIN GLH-200A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-electric-kettle-dezin-glh-200a-review-b07vkt561k/)

The on/off switch is another point of contention for me. It’s easy to operate, sure, but it doesn’t feel particularly robust. I’ve had moments where I wondered if it would give out after extended use. On the positive side, there’s no annoying cord to deal with when pouring, as the kettle is detachable from its base.

**Pros**

* Sleek and aesthetic stainless-steel design that fits most kitchen styles.
* Large 2-liter capacity, perfect for families or heavy hot water users.
* Boils water quickly in just a few minutes, saving time.
* BPA-free and made from food-grade stainless steel for safe use.
* Equipped with auto shut-off and boil-dry protection for safety.

**Cons**

* Handle gets warmer than I’d like during extended boiling sessions.
* Build quality of the on/off switch feels slightly flimsy.
* Doesn’t maintain the set temperature or reheat water without restarting.
* Cord is shorter than expected, limiting placement options.
* Some users report occasional wobbling on the base when it’s empty.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to similar kettles, the DEZIN GLH-200A holds its own in many areas but also has some noticeable weaknesses. For instance, the Cuisinart CPK-17 kettle offers variable temperature settings, which is a game-changer for coffee enthusiasts and tea aficionados. The DEZIN lacks this feature, which might disappoint those wanting more control over water temperature. However, the Cuisinart is significantly more expensive, and not everyone needs the extra bells and whistles.

On the budget end, there’s the Hamilton Beach 1.7-liter kettle, which is slightly smaller but offers similar boil-dry protection and auto shut-off features. While the Hamilton Beach model is more affordable, it doesn’t boast the same premium stainless-steel build as the DEZIN. For those prioritizing aesthetics and durability, the DEZIN is a better choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of cost, the DEZIN GLH-200A strikes a good balance between affordability and quality. It’s not the cheapest option on the market, but its stainless-steel construction and large capacity make it a worthwhile investment for regular users. That said, if you’re looking for advanced features like temperature control or rapid boil times, you might need to consider spending a bit more on higher-end models. It’s a dependable choice for basic needs, but the lack of temperature precision might deter some buyers.

Overall, the DEZIN GLH-200A is a solid, no-frills electric kettle. It does the job well for everyday tasks like making coffee, tea, or instant noodles. However, it’s not without its quirks, and those seeking something ultra-sophisticated might want to explore pricier options.

1iojrfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1iojrfn/compact_and_convenient_a_review_of_chulux/,Compact and Convenient: A Review of CHULUX CL-CM20001 Mini Coffee Maker,"The CHULUX Mini Coffee Maker CL-CM20001 has been my go-to coffee-making companion for the past few weeks, and I’ve truly put it through its paces. As someone who thrives on single-serve brews, this lightweight machine with its compact design seemed like a perfect fit for my small kitchen countertop. It boasts compatibility with both 1.0 and 2.0 K-cup pods, promising a variety of flavors at the touch of a button. But as with all products, it’s not without its quirks.

**Design & Build Quality** From the first unboxing, the CHULUX Mini Coffee Maker impressed me with its minimalist and portable build. The gray plastic exterior, complemented by a stainless steel water tank, feels sturdy yet lightweight. Weighing just 2.3 pounds, it’s easy to move around, which is ideal for traveling or shifting between spaces like home and office. However, the plastic knob on top, which locks the pod chamber, felt a tad flimsy. I often found myself handling it delicately, unsure of its long-term durability.

[Check CHULUX CL-CM20001 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/chulux-cl-cm20001-coffee-maker-review-b085s4yhsp/)

**Brewing Performance** Every morning begins with a race against time, and the CHULUX excels in brewing speed. In just about two minutes, it delivers a steaming cup of coffee that’s hot and flavorful. The 800W heating element ensures consistent performance, and the four-hole needle design extracts a robust flavor from the coffee grounds. However, I did notice that the water level added directly correlates to the output, so precise measurements are key to getting the perfect brew. A built-in water filter subtly enhances the taste, filtering out impurities for a cleaner experience.

**Customization & Controls** This coffee maker keeps things beautifully simple. There’s a single button for operation, which makes it ridiculously easy to use. No complicated menus or settings to navigate—just press, wait, and enjoy. That said, the lack of options for adjusting brew strength or temperature may deter those who enjoy a more tailored cup. As someone who likes a bit more control over brewing, I did miss the ability to tweak these settings.

**Ease of Use** Using the CHULUX is almost foolproof. Even my 12-year-old niece managed to make herself hot cocoa with it during a recent visit. The compact drip tray adjusts to accommodate mugs up to 5.7 inches tall, and the auto shut-off feature ensures safety by preventing overheating. I appreciated not having to babysit the machine, especially on busy mornings. However, the coffee maker’s reliance on K-cups means you’re somewhat limited unless you invest in reusable pods.

**Cleaning & Maintenance** Cleaning this machine is refreshingly straightforward. The detachable drip tray, water tank, and other components are easy to remove and rinse. I was particularly pleased with the BPA-free materials used for the water tank and piercing needle, as it gave me peace of mind about the safety of my brew. However, regular descaling is necessary to prevent build-up, especially if you’re in an area with hard water. On a side note, the compact design means there’s limited space to maneuver when cleaning the pod chamber.

**Capacity & Size** One of the standout features is its single-serve water tank. While this ensures freshness with every brew, it also means you’ll need to refill the tank for each cup. For someone like me who enjoys back-to-back cups, this was slightly inconvenient. That said, the space-saving design is a major win. It fits snugly on my tiny kitchen counter and even made a great addition to my camping gear on a recent trip.

**Pros**

1. Compact and lightweight design, perfect for small spaces and travel.
2. Quick brewing time—coffee is ready in about two minutes.
3. Compatible with a range of K-cup pods, offering versatile flavor options.
4. Easy-to-clean detachable components.
5. Auto shut-off feature adds a layer of safety.

**Cons**

1. Flimsy plastic knob raises concerns about durability.
2. No adjustable settings for brew strength or temperature.
3. Single-serve water tank may feel limiting for heavy coffee drinkers.
4. Plastic smell noticeable during initial uses.
5. Limited to K-cups unless using reusable pods.

**Comparison to Competitors** When stacked against Keurig’s smaller models, the CHULUX Mini Coffee Maker holds its own with a significantly lower price point and a more compact design. Keurig machines often come with additional features like brew size options and larger water reservoirs, but they also have a reputation for being bulky and sometimes unreliable over time, as some reviews highlighted. While the CHULUX lacks the brand prestige and advanced features of a Keurig, its simplicity and portability make it an excellent alternative for budget-conscious buyers.

On the flip side, brands like Hamilton Beach offer single-serve machines with reusable filter compatibility, which could appeal to eco-conscious users. However, the CHULUX’s streamlined operation and minimal footprint still give it an edge for those prioritizing convenience and space efficiency.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** Priced competitively, the CHULUX Mini Coffee Maker delivers solid value for its features. It’s a no-frills machine that caters to those who need a quick, reliable brew without breaking the bank. While it lacks premium features, the performance and ease of use justify the investment, especially for students, travelers, or anyone with limited kitchen space. The absence of reusable pods in the package could be seen as a drawback, but given its affordability, this is a minor gripe.

**Features Integrated into Real-Life Use** The CHULUX’s portability was a lifesaver during a recent road trip. It fit neatly into my luggage, and with just a few K-cups in tow, I had a reliable coffee source at every stop. The auto shut-off feature also came in handy when I inevitably forgot to turn it off in the morning rush. My younger cousin tried using it for tea capsules, and while it worked flawlessly, she did wish there was an option to brew slightly hotter water for her delicate green teas.

1iojr7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1iojr7c/last_night_i_had_a_crazy_dream/,Last night I had a crazy dream,"I just had one of the wildest and most cinematic dreams of my life. I don’t remember it all, just the bits and pieces that stuck with me. Note: I also trimmed some things for legibility, like characters that appeared out of nowhere and didn’t influence the plot.

The dream started out with my brother James and I in the house of a family friend named Tim. Now, I don’t know what Tim does for work in real life, but I know he is quite wealthy and also quite classy. Could definitely see him in a Bond film as a new take on the character or as a villain. Anyway, big fancy house (that my brain made up for him), lots of rich person stuff, you get the gist.

My brother and I are preparing to go to some sort of gala or really fancy event that Tim has invited us to. I think I’m pretty much ready in slacks and a dress shirt, but James finds some shoe shine and starts shining his shoes. For whatever reason, I say hey, let me get some of that, I should shine my shoes too. And I put some on them only to discover that I have put black shoeshine on cream/brown colored shoes.

A quick side note. The shoes I was wearing changed every single time I looked away and looked back. First they were brown, then white slip ons, then gray, then black dress shoes. There was no continuity with what shoes I was wearing, and I like to think that was an easter egg left in by the director, because it’s kind of hilarious.

Anyway, I’ve ruined my shoes and also gotten shoe shine on my pants and hands, so now I need to get new clothes and fast. I hide behind something as Tim walks in and tells my brother that he’s leaving to get there early, and that my brother and I should leave as soon as possible and take one of his cars (a Jaguar) so we fit in, and then off he goes. I tell my brother I need a new suit pronto, and he and I hop in the car and race off to a nearby tailor shop to see if I can get a suit that looks nice as fast as possible.

Now, I don’t always have cinematic dreams, but they aren’t the most unusual for me, and essentially play out like a movie. Anyway, the scene shifts and we see Tim tied up in a chair with Adler from Call of Duty sitting near him. Adler says to Tim that he hopes Tim is right, that my brother and I will turn out to be the agents he needs, or his life is forfeit, and Tim looks back and says something along the lines of I know they will, I have faith.

Cut back to James and I at the tailor. He’s telling me we’re gonna be late as I step out in a well fitting suit and we rush out to the car and rocket off toward the gala. A police car notices our speed and the recklessness of my brother’s driving and gives chase, but the dodge is no match for us in the Jaguar as we weave through the city streets traveling at speeds that could justifiably be called a felony.

As we lose the cops, James pulls out some sort of pendant or something and says Tim gave it to him, and hands it to me. I take a look and it seems like there is a piece of it that can be removed. I remove it, and on the underside is an inscription that says *I’m sorry, but we need the Last Dynasty*

I think it’s an odd thing to have on there, but I read it to my brother, and he seems to simultaneously pass out or have a seizure or something in the driver’s seat, so I grab the wheel to prevent us from crashing. Then all of a sudden he’s back, and he looks me dead in the eyes and I don’t recognize him.

I don’t understand the words he says, it feels like my head is under water. I know what this is. We’re sleeper agents, woken up from the “dream” of reality to do another’s bidding. I try to fight it but everything fades to black.

The scene cuts to somewhere in Siberia, with Adler sitting on a chair by a desk with a hot cup of coffee, smoking a cigarette. A tall, thin woman walks up to him, ushering two children who can’t be more than 10 and 12 up to him. Ah, the Witch and her poppets, Adler says, or something to that effect. She pushes forward the older one. Jamie, she says, strong and big boned. He will do well for you. Adler nods in agreement, then points to the other one. This is Samantha she says. Intelligent. Good planner. They will make for fine team.

Samantha? Adler asks. But this is a boy.

You can raise Samantha as such if you wish. It will make no difference.

The child tells Adler that they will be a boy if needed.

Adler says that will work nicely, and the scene ends.

In the dream I’m sobbing, full on ugly crying, accusing them of robbing me of my identity.

I don’t know what would have happened next because I woke up absolutely shook by the thought that I was a sleeper agent that had my trans identity suppressed for so long. That I had always been a girl but forced to be a boy and implanted with false memories to keep it all hidden from me.

As someone who only recently realized they were trans, and with a chosen name so close to the one I had in the dream, the feels were *real*

All of this definitely changed my shots for the better. Seemingly, my flow rate has changed a bit as there is a bit of (annoying) spatter in my cup but I figured out it's not spatter from the puck prep but from how the coffee is now coming out of the portafilter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slovenia is a small yet stunning country that is home to some of the most beautiful lakes in Europe. From emerald green waters to picturesque mountain backdrops, these lakes provide a perfect escape into nature. If you’re planning a trip to this gem of a country, you’ll want to explore these breathtaking bodies of water. Here are the seven most beautiful lakes in Slovenia that you simply cannot miss.

### Lake Bled

Perhaps the most famous of Slovenia's lakes, Lake Bled is a magical destination. Its clear blue water surrounds Bled Island, where a charming church sits. You can row a traditional wooden boat, known as a ""pletna,"" to the island and climb the 99 steps to ring the church bell for good luck. The stunning Bled Castle perched atop a cliff offers a panoramic view of the lake that will leave you speechless.

### Lake Bohinj

Located within Triglav National Park, Lake Bohinj is larger and less crowded than Lake Bled. The lake's tranquil waters reflect the surrounding Julian Alps and provide an ideal setting for swimming, kayaking, and hiking. The stunning Savica Waterfall, a short hike away, is definitely worth the visit, adding to the serene beauty of this natural wonder.

### Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj Comparison

- **Accessibility:** While both lakes are accessible by car and public transport, Lake Bled is more tourist-friendly with numerous amenities.
- **Activities:** Lake Bohinj offers more peaceful outdoor activities, while Lake Bled has more tourist-oriented options like cycling and boat rides.
- **Scenery:** Both lakes boast spectacular views, but Lake Bohinj's serenity and natural surroundings can be more appealing to some visitors.

### Lake Predil

Nestled in the Julian Alps, Lake Predil is one of Slovenia's hidden treasures. The stunning turquoise water is surrounded by lush forests and rugged mountain peaks. This lake is less frequented by tourists, allowing for a truly peaceful experience. You can hike the many trails around the lake or simply relax and take in the breathtaking scenery.

I recently fell out with a friend of mine. I made comment to him when I was venting about something that happened in the group that upset and he passed that comment on and it blew up. I got made out to be causing drama when I wasn’t. I got quite upset with him I explained I wasn’t happy with what happened. I distanced myself to allow myself to calm down and he also stopped speaking to me. It’s been a few months since this happened and we’ve seen each other at work, he’s just acted like nothing has happened and at times is cold and off or will then try to engage and be friendly. I hate situations like this as I like to talk things out. In these past few months I tried reaching out to him to have this conversation and he point blank refused and said he wants to keep personal and professional separate which I took to mean he doesn’t consider me a friend. I was really hurt by this. Some time has passed and he’s now been making more of an effort to talk to me and ask me things. However I don’t feel comfortable having a friendship until we talk about what has upset me. I said to him last time I saw if he wanted to catch up over coffee sometime to let me know which he said yes but I still haven’t heard from him. Should I just give up? I know it might sound petty but I can’t just be normal with people who disrespect me without addressing the issue whereas he seems fine with just avoiding it all together.

1iojgdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1iojgdm/in_what_ways_do_you_value_relationships/,In what ways do you value relationships?,"I want to spend a minute just putting things into perpsective so that you know where I’m coming from. To start, I think it’s normal for people to place a lot of value in relationships (friendly, romantic, or otherwise). On the most fundamental of levels, our species is a social one (”social creatures”), after all. Beyond that, however, a lot of people are prone to things like feelings of loneliness; valuing a support system (physically, emotionally, or both); looking to others to help form a sense of self-identity and self-esteem; and valuing shared memories, among others. I am often not prone to those feelings/desires, *if at all*, if we're talking on the basis of fulfilling some sort of emotional or instinctual desire.

Since childhood, I’ve always looked at relationships in a very transactional manner - if I’m connecting with someone, and we’re not able to provide equal or near-equal *tangible* (as opposed to emotional) value to each other, then the relationship isn’t really worth pursuing as far as I'm concerned. For example, let’s say that I’ve never driven a day in my life, so you’re often the one who picks me up whenever we decide to hang out. The least I can do is buy you a coffee, spot lunch/dinner for you every once in a while, or spend a few seconds calculating how much I owe you in gas fees. Otherwise, I would consider myself to be the consuming factor in the relationship, so I wouldn’t be surprised (and would be emotionally prepared for, even) if you were to suddenly cut ties with me, because you found it very unfair that you’re always the one driving me around and having to spend a little bit extra on gas because of it.

While it doesn’t apply to every single scenario, for *many* scenarios, as far as I’m concerned, a relationship is worth only as much as the transactions involved - namely, the level of the transactions and how often they’re put into practice on *both sides*. If I value what someone offers me, I find that it’s only natural that I give them something of equal or near-equal value in return (not necessarily monetarily, as something may serve emotional value to others, etc.); and the same goes the other way around: If the value that I provide to someone isn’t reciprocated in some way, I’d often find the relationship to be stale and, thus, worth closing, which I think is normal - the only differing factor in my case is that the transactions I would often prefer to receive are ones of the aforementioned ""tangible"" nature. For instance, if I were to be someone's emotional punching bag, an equal transaction for me wouldn't be for them to also be my own emotional punching bag, as I'm not really the type to get emotional about a lot of things.

I’m curious as to how others would view my perspective on relationships (not that I’m willing to change, because this is just who I am), but I’m even more curious as to how different people view relationships themselves.",1,1739454634.0,SeriousConversation,2,1.0,False

He never forgot his please and thank-yous. He could win a spelling bee as easily as he could cartwheel the length of a football field. He was talented. He was kind, which is rare for a sixth grader.



There was one thing.



Bradyen heard voices. Just one voice actually; he heard the voice of Mary’s late husband, his dead father.



She scavenged the best therapists and psychiatrists, made countless long drives to fruitless appointments. Bradyen received the same diagnosis from them all: he’s a healthy, normal boy.



So what was he hearing?



Maybe she was the one who needed help.



Mary would serve him breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes with real maple syrup, and ignore when Brayden told her that Dad wanted to say good morning.



And the drawings? Brayden could draw with the skill of a collegiate art student, and the pictures were of her late husband. Him golfing. Them as a family. Him waving hello, looking out as if he could see you.



She managed to ignore all that too.



And, she would regret for the rest of her life, she ignored Brayden when he said Dad was teaching him a *magic spell* that involved a rope and knot.



The basement was unfinished. Two-by-fours plagued where there should have been a textured ceiling. Which is where Brayden managed to wrap a rope, tied a noose, and hung himself.



Mary collapsed when she discovered him, made a tortured wail like every ounce of oxygen was ripped from her. She was shaking so bad it took her three tries to dial 911.



In the days that followed, Mary learned that the human body can weep without end. Hour and even days. She learned she was utterly alone. And she learned that she couldn’t even go near the basement door which she always kept closed.



Until one morning.



One morning when she diluted her coffee with French Vanilla creamer and tears, she turned to the basement door and found it open.



She heard something down there. Someone. She could hear Brayden's staccato laugh echoing from the basement.



She tread the wooden stairs down to the concrete floor and saw the rope. When emergency services cut Brayden down, they left the rope tied to the two-by-fours.



The rope hung still, and beckoned. She grabbed the cut end and tied it twelve inches up making a loop, and through that loop she saw into a different world. Her husband and son were laughing on the ninth green of a country club. She could smell the grass, and the cheap cologne she bought her husband for their anniversary.



Brayden looked in her eyes. “Mom! We’re waiting for you!”



Her husband blew her a kiss.



Mary realized that all she wanted in the world was to be back with her family. And they were right in front of her, aching for a reunion.",6,1739454501.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

Background: 30M. Frequent GERD for about 18 months, and infrequently since a few years before that. I was diagnosed with esophagitis & gastritis, and had some bile reflux show up during an endoscopy around 12 months ago. Ph-Meter showed a Demeester score of around 14. And manometer showed a minor disorder with impaired  clearance i.e. weak and uncoordinated motility.

I was finally recommended a Toupet Fundoplication, which I had exactly 6 weeks ago today. During the procedure the surgeon also found a hiatal hernia (around 4cm) which was repaired with a hiatoplasty. 

The first few days were super tough with bloating, spasms, hiccups, and heartburn. The doctor didn’t recommend a liquid diet, and suggested that I can start eating soft foods right away as long as I ate small meals slowly.

About 3 weeks in, I felt my heartburn was significantly reduced, and I was able begin eating & drinking much more comfortably - even including spices, coffee etc. This lasted for about 10 days, where I was obviously super happy that things were finally getting better.

But now since about 5 days, I suddenly started having some aches and pains behind my chest and stomach area, which were slowly followed by some mild night time reflux, which has now turned into full blown reflux just as I used to have. 

I went to visit my surgeon, and he said that while it’s not common, I should wait another 3 weeks to see if symptoms resolve, and that if they aren’t better I would need to do another round of endoscopy, barium swallow, and manometer. He said that maybe my body is “re-adjusting” for the better, but that maybe due to my motility issues the surgery may simply not do the trick for my reflux, and that we may need to investigate further. He put me back on nexium, and said that I can still eat whatever as long as it’s 6-8 small meals a day and GERD-friendly. 

It’s super frustrating obviously to hear this, and I guess I have no choice but to be patient for another few weeks. Any advice, similar experiences, or relevant input from your own doctors that you’d be keen to share?

I'm really want to add more seating to my living room. I started playing around with layout today and would love some feedback on what makes the most sense. I have felt for a very long time that our current arrangement is way off but I believe we have everything set up this way currently because of something to do with the plugin for the TV and my bf doesnt want to turn his neck to watch t.v.. However, I hate this setup lol.

First pic is our current layout. The second one is what I think we could realistically do? It's hard because I really hate feeling like everything is so close together but it's a small living room so I guess I might have to deal with that. 

The third pic is what I think might be the most ideal layout but I'm not totally sure. Mainly because I'm not sure if we can hook the t.v. up to that wall because of where the outlet is. I'm also not sure about whether or not to do a coffee table?

Some other things to note:

*My boyfriend is set on having a couch with a chaise 

*The long white rectangle is a cabinet that our pet lizard resides on and he also needs access to an outlet for his heat lamp. 

*The bookshelf on the short wall is actually built into the wall

*There is no overhead light in this room 

*The other two bookshelf's are for my boyfriend's Gundam models and those will most likely stay

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🙌

Ever feel like your brain's got that spinning wheel of doom—the kind you get when a webpage just won't load? Yeah, same here. If your brain's buffering, it might be time to *unplug*. Yep, I'm talking about a **tech-free weekend**! 🏕️📵

Look, I get it. The thought of going tech-free sounds as appealing as a broccoli smoothie. But trust me, there's some magic in it. Here's why ditching the screens—even just for two days—might be the best thing ever:

- **Rediscover Real Life Fun**: Remember those things called books? Or how refreshing it is to splash around in a pool? When was the last time you had a belly laugh over a good ol’ board game? Yeah, it's been a while! Let’s bring back those simple joys.

- **Quality Time with Yourself and Others**: Ever tried having a convo with someone who’s physically there but mentally scrolling through TikTok? A tech-free weekend means undivided attention to your partner, family, or bestie. And hey, it’s a great excuse to practice that ancient art of *talking*.

- **Banish Burnout**: Constant notifications are like relentless mosquitoes—you never get a moment’s peace. Disconnect for a couple of days and watch your stress shrink like a poplin shirt in hot water.

- **Boost Creativity**: Ever notice your best ideas hit you in the shower or during that morning coffee sans phone? When your mind isn't preoccupied with feeds and likes, it’s free to wander and wonder. Breakthrough ideas could be just a tech-free weekend away!

But let’s be real. Giving up tech isn’t just sunshines and rainbows—it can feel weirdly naked without your phone. 😂 Here's a tip: Plan your activities in advance. Hiking, crafting, cooking, whatever lights you up! A jam-packed weekend means less time fretting about those unread emails.

So, who's game for a tech detox this weekend? Or if you’ve tried one, how did it go? 🤔 Even if you’re a bit skeptical, maybe give it a test run?

Remember, life's more vibrant when we actually *live* it rather than just TikTok it. 🌻

1ioj7kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestTheRest/comments/1ioj7kk/feb_13_2025_morning_market_rundown/,"Feb 13, 2025 - Morning Market Rundown","Good morning All, hope yesterday was a good day. Here's your easy-to-digest market rundown for Thursday, February 13, 2025:

Market Overview:
The U.S. markets are showing mixed signals this morning with futures indicating a slight downturn for the Dow and S&P 500, but a small uptick for Nasdaq. 
Asian markets had a varied night, with some gains in Japan and Hong Kong, but a dip in Shanghai.
European markets are also trading mixed as we speak.

Key Economic Data:
Today's big watch is the Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which will give us insights into inflation at the producer level. This follows yesterday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) which showed inflation remains a bit stubborn at around 3%.

Earnings to Watch:
Several companies are reporting earnings today, including Airbnb, Applied Materials, Coinbase, Duke Energy, and DraftKings. These reports could sway market sentiment, especially if there are surprises on the earnings front.

Commodities:
Crude oil prices are slightly down, which might reflect concerns about demand or global economic pace.

Investor Sentiment:
There's a bit of caution in the air with investors keeping an eye on how inflation data might influence Federal Reserve actions. The markets are on edge, looking for any signs that could hint at future rate decisions.

What to Expect:
Given the inflation data, today's market might be a bit choppy. If PPI comes in higher than expected, we might see some pressure on stocks as it could push back expectations for rate cuts. Conversely, a lower than expected PPI might give stocks a boost.

Tips for Today:
Keep an eye on the earnings reports from the companies mentioned; they could provide some investment opportunities or reasons to be cautious.
The PPI data at 1:30 PM ET will be crucial. If you're trading, be prepared for volatility around that time.

Remember, the markets can be unpredictable, but staying informed gives you an edge. Have a great trading day, and don't forget to enjoy your coffee or tea while you make your moves!

**Background**

**Job:** Student

**Industry:** Grad School

**Location:** Boston area

This is another follow-up diary.  And more big life changes have happened.  My partner from the previous diaries is now my Fiance, we got engaged last July.  We also bought a house together in May.  I know people suggest not buying a house with someone you are not married to, but we’ll be getting married in a few months.  Also, either one of us could afford the house on our own, and I looked at all of the legal documents and in our jurisdiction with the way the deed is recorded it doesn’t actually seem like it makes a huge difference if something were to happen and we broke up in the next year.  Also, I didn’t realize how well M and I were going to do this year until I worked on this money diary.

**Section One: Assets and Debt** 

These are just my assets: M has a similar net worth, but he has not tracked it as regularly as I do.  He has said that he would update a spreadsheet once we get married, so my next money diary in a year or two will likely be fully joint.

Retirement Balance: $226,000. Between my TSP and Roth IRA.

Savings account balance: $9,000. I just had to pay a bunch of school fees, so I’ll refill this throughout the semester.

CD: $23,000. I just renewed this at 5% for a 12-month CD. This will pay for my half of a reception in 18 months.  (There will be left-overs, we’re planning to spend 10-15k total.  Somehow, I’m still not sure what our 3-5 year life plan really is).

Checking account: $3,500. Generally, this is zero-sum with a slight buffer. 

Additional Brokerage: $24,000.

Credit card debt: $1,500.  I bought an iPad for school in January and I financed it through my Apple Card.  I have classes this semester with no book, so I didn’t want to have to print 100+ pages a week.  I also bought a treadmill on PayPall credit’s 0% interest.  The iPad is for 12 months and the treadmill will be paid off in April.  I’ve never paid interest.

Student loan debt: $0.

Car Loan: $1,800. 0% interest on a 60-month loan. I’m so close to having it paid off that it is taking a lot of discipline not to just send Toyota the last of the money.

Equity: We have about $4,500 of equity in our home (half of which is technically mine).  We’ve owned it for 8 months and put 0% down (VA Loan).  We’re hoping to refinance, but interest rates have definitely been going the wrong direction for that.

Net Worth (Assests - Debts): $324,000. Some people feel a certain way about cars, but I include the KBB value of my car. I could sell it today, because we do not need to have two cars between us.  We’re debating going down to one car, so we’ll see what happens in the next year or two.  This may not add up perfectly off of these numbers, but I pulled it directly from my spreadsheet and rounded here. 

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** 

I left the military about two years ago, and I gladly answer any questions in the comments if anyone has them.  I’ll be without an actual income for the next year and a half while I’m in school.  However, I receive VA payments for both my disability level and GI Bill.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

Take-Home Pay: **$2,300 from VA Disability. $4,600 from the GI Bill for months I’m in school.  It’s pro-rated for partial months like August or December.  M receives $3,800 a month from VA disability and just started a job last month bringing in $1,800 a month after maxing his 401k and benefits.  I also have a summer internship lined up that will pay me $43,000 for the summer, before taxes.**

Deductions:

Federal Taxes: M hasn’t had enough pay checks to sort out taxes, but we will be filing as married for 2025, so our tax burden should be fairly low.

State Taxes: IL has a flat 4.95% income tax, so it’ll be that percent of M’s pay once it gets settled and mine over the summer. 

Health Insurance: I’m using the VA for healthcare while I’m in school.  M also uses the VA.  We will probably use his work benefits once we have kids in 3+ years, but for now he doesn’t have anything taken out of his check.  I’m also using school health insurance, which is $2,800 a semester, but my scholarship covers this.

**Section Three: Expenses**

Mortgage: $1,500 (my half).  My fiance and I bought a 3 bedroom/1 bathroom house in May.  It turns out that Boston is so expensive it was cheaper to buy a house for him and our dogs to live in, in Chicago, and pay for a dorm in Boston, than it was to find a place that could accept our dogs.  (The math works out to about $4,250 a month when you account for summers and the cheapest place we could find after our landlord sold our townhouse was $4,500…)

Rent: $7,500 a semester.  I’m in a dorm for this year of school, so I paid this to the school as a part of my fees.  I have my own bathroom, so it’s not much different than a studio, but I don’t have to sort out a sublet for the summer or furniture or set up any utilities.  Yes, long distance sucks, but M hated Boston so much and he’s so much happier in Chicago.  The dogs are happier having a real yard.

Homeowner’s Insurance: It’s about $1,600 for a year, and included in our mortgage payment.

Utilities: We’re still settling into the costs of our new house, but it seems like it’s about $250 a month for electric, water, and gas.  Our internet is a part of our cellphone bill.  We each contribute an extra $500 to the joint account each month to cover joint expenses like our groceries, household things, and the dogs.

Retirement contribution: $0 per month.  I maxed my IRA for the year ($7,000) using a CD that matured last month.  M contributes 40% to his 401k, but we’re not 100% sure what that’ll look like out of each paycheck yet.

Savings contribution: $0. I set aside enough each month to get through the summer without the GI Bill payments and to pay for the dorm for the next year, but nothing consistent month to month.

Investment contribution: Nothing consistent while I’m in school.

Debt payments: $175.  This is the Apple financing and PayPal.

Life Insurance: $160 a year. This is through VGLI. It is age-based and that is my yearly premium for $200,000. I don’t need it as a “single” 29-year-old, but it makes me feel better knowing that if anything happened to me my fiance could make a huge dent in our mortgage. I paid upfront for the year.

Donations: I don’t have the stability to feel comfortable contributing financially right now, but we get the opportunity to do pro bono work through school, and that is exciting.  I did about 20 hours a week last semester doing legal aid work and I do about 15 hours a week this semester for a state government agency.

Cellphone: $150 a month, and this includes my phone, my fiances phone, my dads’ phone, his watch, and Apple+.

Subscriptions: $50 a month. We’re still in the process of combining subscriptions. We also have Apple TV+ from T-Mobile. NYT raised their prices substantially, so I tried to unsubscribe and got a $1 a month for a year deal. I will unsubscribe after that. $15 a month for Audible.  M pays for Netflix and Hulu/Disney Plus.

Yearly Subscriptions: $50 a month. I put away this much per month for my yearly subscriptions in my slush funds. HBO Max, Costco, Sam’s Club (yes, I pay for both… one is for my father and I keep Costco, because there’s no Sam’s near me in Boston), Grammarly, AMC Premier, and a law student subscription. AMC Premier for $15 a year may be the best value of any subscription.  M pays for Amazon Prime (which I’m trying to convince him to cancel) and he set his HBO Max not to renew for next year.

Credit Card Fees: $200.  These are two airline cards.  I’m debating canceling one of the two airline cards and just upgrading my Chase to the Sapphire Preferred.

Pet expenses: $500 - I spoil B and G.  This comes out of our joint account.

Car payment/insurance: $700 a month for my car and $600 a month for M’s. My car payment is $570 something, but I round up to $600. I have 3 payments left!  His is $500 a month.  I pay our car insurance lump sum every 6 months to get the discount, so I set aside $200 a month for that. It’s actually like $1,150 every 6 months, but I’d rather round up.  We’re debating selling my car and going down to one car.  The dealership offered me $23,000 the last time I took my car in for an oil change, so we’re debating on if we should just take the money.  It would mean that my car only cost me about $12,000 over 5 years, so really not too bad at all.

**I only included questions that changed.  This is a second follow-up.**

**Do you worry about money now?**

Moderately.  Law school has been the first time in 7 years that I haven’t had a regular income, and it is definitely intimidating.  I think as 18-year-old college kids, we didn’t know just how bad it was to be entirely on our own and poor, but now that I’m an adult it is definitely scary.  Plus, moving twice and settling halfway across the country is so expensive.  That being said, M just got a job for the first time in 18 months and I have something lined up for the summer, so I know that any worries that I have are pretty irrational.  I’m hoping M working will help with liquidity and make us both feel better.



**Section Four: The Diary**

**Day One (Wednesday)**

4:00 (Ish) - I’m awoken by shoveling outside.  I fight to go back to sleep.

5:25: I turn off my alarm and decide to sleep in because of my earlier wake up.

7:00: I wake up on my own.  Then I go to the gym and run 2 miles.  It’s too cold and snowy outside for me to be able to run outside.

8:30: I get back to my dorm room and get ready for the day.  I eat breakfast (FiberOne cereal and coffee with chocolate milk).  I book a study room on campus before I walk over.

9:15: I sort out getting my “work” computer on to the school network.  It’s “work,” because it’s a clinical class for school where I’m working for a state government agency for credit.  I start working.  I have a 10:30 meeting that got pushed to 11:30, which is a bit stressful because I have a lunch meeting for a student organization that I’m on the board of and I was the one who ordered the food. But, the delivery driver ends up being early and the meeting ends up being short, so its a win-win for me.

12:15: Lunch and meeting for my student org.  We had Halal Guys.  I ordered, so I chose.

1:30: The meeting ends, so I walk back to my dorm room to finish up my work for the day.  I have a project where I’m doing some legal research and another where I’m working on creating some user guides for different state programs.

5:15: I walk to Target.  I let myself get dangerously low on toilet paper, so I had no choice.  I got Toilet Paper, Guac cups, shredded cheese, hard boiled eggs, tikka masala chicken, extra sauce, beans, frozen veggies, tortillas, and mini frozen pizzas.  $42.08

6:15: I make it back to my room and watch some bad crime documentaries.

8:15: I call M.  We talk for about an hour and then I go to sleep.  Distance sucks, but knowing that this is pretty short term and I have a lot of breaks makes it better.

Day Total: **$42.08**

**Day Two (Thursday)**

5:30: Nope. My alarm goes off and I tell it no thank you.

6:30: I wake up to texts going off in a group chat.  I then read the news and worry about the state of the world.

7:00: I get out of bed.  Normally I’m better at waking up, but 17 degrees and slushy isn’t a motivator to get up.  I drink my coffee and get to work on school work.  Both for my “work,” but I also have a substantial paper that needs to get completed.  Editorial point: I’m writing this a week later and I’m 13/50 pages…  

12:00: I walk over to campus because we have a ceremony for my student org.

1:30: The ceremony is over.  It went well.  I eat lunch back in my room (teriyaki beef, rice, and frozen stir fry veggies).  After lunch I keep working on things.  The amount of work is basically endless, so there is always something to do.

6:00: My dad calls.  He calls far more often than I’m willing to answer, because he likes to talk for far too long once he gets going.

7:30: I call M to debrief about the fact that my dad is a pain in the ass.

9:30: Go to bed.

Day Total: **$0**

**Day Three (Friday)**

I get woken up at what I assume is between 2:30 and 3:00, because it sounds like people are coming home from the Thursday night bar session.  I go back to bed.

6:00 - I wake up naturally and scroll for longer than I should.  Note: All of my scrolling is on reddit because I do not have any other social media.  I’m looking for longer form media, maybe substacks, to help fill this space.

8:00 - I call my younger sister before she goes to work, she is back on central time.  I discuss some family drama/issues and the call only ends up leaving me more stressed.

9:30 - I log on to my “work” computer and work on a project.  I don’t normally work on Fridays but we have a meeting at 11:00 that I want to join.

12:00 - I eat lunch (teriyaki chicken and pineapple rice).  I try to do work, but my family stress on top of the numerous other types of life stress (law school class, this paper that is killing me, several legal journals, new homeownership, planning a wedding and a marriage, etc.) leads me to have a slight breakdown.  I text M who calls me on his lunch at work and is incredibly loving and supportive.  I really could not have gotten luckier with a partner who handles how high strung I can be.

1:30 - I take a stress nap, because I am unable to be productive, so I want a reset.

3:30 - The nap worked and I was able to crush research and writing for a few hours.

5:30 - One of my best friends texts our college friend group chat that she has set her wedding date!  I’m thrilled for her and her fiancee, and they happen to also live in Boston, so I’m happy that it is going to be local.  However, they set it the weekend that I was planning a trip with my father, so I have to call him and we are able to reschedule our trip to May.  (It’s a baseball related trip.)

7:00 - I go to dinner at the local bar.  I finished dry January and felt good about it, so I haven't stopped yet.  I order a quesadilla and a mocktail while I’m waiting for a friend.  Once she gets there I order a NA beer and fries, she gets a sandwich and beer.  I put it all on my card and she Venmo's me.  **$65.23.**  They we walk a few blocks to my friend’s “christmas party.”  She was waiting until everyone was back from winter break to throw the party.

11:00 - Four of us split an uber back towards where we live, because it started raining pretty hard.  **$7** venmoed to the friend who called it.

10:30: I eat breakfast (FiberOne cereal and hardboiled eggs), shower, drink my coffee, and start working on homework.

12:30 - I eat lunch, it’s the last of the teriyaki chicken. Then I get back to work.

2:00 - A friend texts our group chat that there are some cool events happening on campus.  I put on real pants and head to the first event, it’s a podcast recording.

5:45 - We head to pick up tickets for the second event and then get dinner.  We get dinner at one of the dining halls on campus, it’s chicken parm night.  My friend has extra meal swipes from his job, so he swipes me in.

7:00 - The talk was really interesting.  It was a comedian who was doing a talk about how to talk to people.  It was a good time.

8:30 - I get back to my room and FaceTime with M.

9:30 - I go to sleep.

Day Total: **$0**

7:00 - I wake up on my own.  I have coffee and FaceTime with M.  Then I do a room reset (take out the trash, do my dishes, make my bed, etc.)

8:00 - I start my homework for the week.  I work on an assignment, 1,000 word short answer about a paper that we were assigned to read.

8:45 - I finish that assignment and email it to the professor.  I’m also in a class about evidence, so I do my readings for that class.

11:00 - I get ready for the day and then walk across campus to meet my friends for brunch at the dining hall.  I know it’s a silly pleasure, but I actually genuinely enjoy dining hall brunch.

2:00 - I make it back to my room after a great brunch.  I have a class on feminist legal theory that I have to do my readings for.  I also have some catching up on work for my student organization to do.

5:30 - I do some dorm room meal prep.  I use the pre-cooked microwavable meats, frozen vegetables, and a microwavable carb.  I make broccoli beef with stir fry veggies and rice and beef tips with pasta and peas.

7:00 - Call with M.

9:00 - Go to sleep.

Day Total: **$0**

**Day Six (Monday)**

6:30 - I get up and get ready for the gym.  I run 3 miles in 33 minutes.

10:00 - I go to class.  It is interesting.

12:00 - I walk back to my room for lunch.  I go with a beef tips and pasta.

1:30 - I go to class.

4:00 - I go to my last class of the day.

7:30 - M calls.  His ex BIL (not technically, because he and his sister were never married, just together for over a decade, but still) passed away.  It’s a mess because they have a child and were just in the process of separating.  My heartbreaks for their child.

Total: **$26**

**Day Seven (Tuesday)**

5:45 - I set my alarm early to take care of the reading that I had planned to do last night.  I read for my morning class.  I also write another page for my paper.  After that I get ready for the day, shower, breakfast (yogurt) and I text M about potential elopement photographers.

10:00 - Class.

12:00 - I go back to my room and finish my readings for my afternoon class.  I also eat more beef tips for lunch.

1:30 - Second class.

4:00 - I have a call for “work” where I get another assignment.  I also have to grab stuff for an event that we’re doing for my student organization.

From a simple lifestyle shot that offers inspiration, to a clean infographic that educates your audience on how your products or services can help them, your **listing images** need to directly address the needs of your audience.

 Get ready, because here we are about to reveal the ways to make outstanding photos to drive conversions.

# The Unique Impact of Images on Amazon Conversion Rates

Your product images are more than pictures—they are your silent salesmen ready to speak directly to your customers when you are selling on Amazon. **Listing images** can help you achieve all your conversion goals, build customer trust, and make your brand stand out from the competition on Amazon. 

Below are eight creative and actionable ways images can affect Amazon [conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-amazon-product-photography-affect-conversion-rates/), along with new tips and examples for sellers.

# Scroll-Stopping First Impressions

Your number one image is the first and possibly the only opportunity for your product to capture attention on Amazon and most other e-commerce sites. A good, bright, and cleaner shot can set you apart from others in the listing. 

To this end, identify a main image that stands out from other listings, follows the Amazon guidelines, and showcases what makes the product special.

* For instance, if a seller is selling a stainless steel water bottle, the [main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-the-right-main-image-can-be-a-game-changer-for-your-product/) may contain the water bottle, but will also contain colors and reflections to demonstrate its high quality. When the product catches the viewer’s eye on a pure white background with full clarity, it can be identified from a distance, which makes you stop scrolling.

Weighty Tip for Sellers: Experiment with angles for your primary image to see which engages the most viewership. Choose an A/B testing tool (like Splitly) and test it out to see what does better

# Detailed Product Images Starts Building Trust

As shoppers don’t get to see and touch their products, clear and high-quality images are necessary to create trust. Show multiple **listing images** with all sides, details, and close-ups of textures and materials. This insight reduces friction and gives buyers confidence that they know what they’re getting.

* For instance, if you sell leather wallets, show images of stitching quality, even leather quality (with some close-ups), internal compartment- images, etc. Detail of the embossed logo or brand can also point out the quality or authenticity.

A Fresh Concept for Sellers: Macro photography for extreme close-ups of luxurious materials or fine details. Emphasize the uniqueness of your product, such as special design, craftsmanship, or endurance.

# An Emotional Bond Connecting Lifestyle Pictures

Lifestyle shots enable customers to envisage how your product integrates into their lives. You can create an emotional response in your audience by showing users using your product in real life situations. You enkindle desirability.

* If you are selling a yoga mat, show someone doing yoga at a beautiful outdoor area that evokes relaxation and health. Show features such as grip or thickness in action so that the customer can easily visualize how they will experience it too.

Ideas for Sellers: Partner with micro influencers or photographers for lifestyle shots with varying demographics and environments. Just make sure those images resonate with the dreams of your audience.

# Provide Informative Infographics To Answer Questions

Infographics are a very effective visual method of communicating important information. Employ these to truly showcase scale, functionality, or any additional aspects that aren’t as clear in standard images.

* For instance, the seller of noise-cancelling headphones can insert an infographic with specifications for battery life, noise cancellation, and device compatibility. Buyers also find it easier to digest technical information when it is paired with clear visuals.

Have another idea for product comparison — Infographics — Without mentioning any competitor’s name. Employ appealing icons, graphs, and bulleted lists.

# Sequential Images Storytelling

Step by step illustration or cartoon-style photo also helps buyers take a travel plan, visually illustrating the process of using guides or the process of change. It works particularly well on products that are targeted to solve a particular problem or need to be assembled.

* Illustrate the actual process if you are selling a kitchen gadget (say, a vegetable spiralizer) — step-by-step images of how to set it up, how to spiralize some vegetables, and how the final plate looks like, for example. Visual storytelling that shows how to use a product and/or final results.

Fresh Concept for Sellers— Complementing sequential pictures with lifestyle graphics showing the way the product fits into daily routines to improve familiarity and utility.

# Standing Out With Unique Angle Shots

While many sellers are content with standard front-facing images there are plenty of angles that differentiates you from the products of other sellers. Show details that make your product unique, show perspectives that competitors might miss.

For instance, a seller of ergonomic office chairs should take under-seat angles where the adjustment levers are, or close-ups of the lumbar support system. These angles focus on functional fashion and comfort.

Tip for Sellers: Try incorporating 360-degree shots (or videos, where shoppers can “move around” the product) into your mix. Such an experience can increase conversions immensely.

# Fostering Confidence With Authentic Use

Using real photos of people who use your product establishes credibility and boosts buyer confidence in your brand. Commonplace scenarios rather than overzealous models

* For kitchen knives, you might feature a chef or a home cook preparing a meal in situ. Steer clear of pictures that look forced; your camera can smell the shine from across the room.

Sellers’ fresh approach: Add customer-generated material that has got your authorization showing what they went through! These **listing images** serve as both social proof, and help make your listings come off as more authentic.

# Highlighting Value Through Before-and-After Comparisons

Use before-and-afters to showcase your product. They are the first to communicate the value of your product.

* E.g. A cleaning products seller may show a dirty surface prior to use and show the area nice n shiny post cleaning. This becomes a visual story of change

Make sure that these **listing images** are accurate and according to Amazon guidelines to not mislead the purchasers.

# Can Your Images Answer Buyer Questions?

[Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/) can do much more than showcase your product—they can address buyer concerns, clarify features, and answer questions before they’re even asked. 

By using strategic visuals, you can reduce uncertainty, build trust, and boost conversions. Here’s how you can create images that act as a silent customer service tool.

# Showcase Dimensions Clearly

The biggest question buyers ask most of the time is the size of a product, when buying online. Although text descriptions include detail, **listing images** can bring dimensions to life in a way that is closer and easier to comprehend.

 Buyers never know how big or small a product actually is in real life, and they get confused about sizes a lot. Comparative images are a great solution to this problem.

* As an example, if you are selling a storage container, you might place it next to household items like a coffee mug, soda can, and/or a ruler. Which provides a context to help potential buyers quickly see how small or large the product actually is. 
* For instance, the dimensions of the container in the image should be displayed (length, width, and height) to avoid misleading customers.

# Highlight Key Features

Although bullet points and product descriptions are necessary for letting customers know about specific features of a product, **listing images** is a much quicker way to get these features across. Without any visual context, buyers would struggle to define expectations out of a wishlist. 

On the other hand, images that draw attention to these features make your listing more visually appealing and easier to understand, so your customers will find the most important information about your product right away.

Instead of providing a list of features in text, think about having images that highlight each feature on its own: e.g. if you are selling a backpack, show an image that highlights the anti-theft pocket, another image for a water bottle holder, etc. 

* For example, you can make a close up image to focus on the waterproof zippers or have a picture of padded straps while in use which provides comfort and durability, The same can be represented in the bag shot, like an image showing the various compartments with text call-outs pointing to the compartment available in the bag can explain the organizational structure of the bag perfectly. 

This lets customers see the value of the product right away, without having to wade through product specs.

# Demonstrate Usage Scenarios

A large portion of the ecom experience relies on the assumption of how a product will fit into a shopper’s daily life. This leads to a common doubt in the buyers about how the product will perform in the real world and if it all solves their need. 

[Lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) are the best way to alleviate those concerns and display how your product works perfectly in different situations. This will help buyers to visualize how the item can be used, making it more attractive.

* So if you have a foldable water bottle, include how to fold it for a small bag, how to take it out on a hike, and how to wash or rinse it under a tap. Such **listing images** contribute to buyers picturing the usability and practicality of the product.

 Do not just do the dreaded white-background in the middle of the screen shot of the water half-filled with unbranded water, but show it in action (it is where the convenience, portability, and functionality lives).

Lifestyle images lead buyers to visualize the product in action, and they are giving you an opportunity to help them feel an emotional connection with the item by imagining how well it could work for them, and what benefits they can derive from it.

 These images more or less respond to questions such as: “Will it fit in my bag?” OR — “Is it travel-sized?” They also convey that your product makes sense and works for a variety of occasions, therefore raising its value.

# Answer Reliability Questions

buyer’s want to know how durable and long-lasting a product is going to be, especially with products that are going to experience a lot of wear and tear. Don´t just wait for potential customers to ask if your product is durable or not, tackle it without asking through images.

Providing evidence of product reliability can go a long way, and this can easily be achieved by showing the product in operation or even being tested under realistic conditions.

* So say you are selling a phone case, show non-stop pictures of you dropping it from a height of 5 feet onto a hard surface and it still not breaking = shockproof. Reverse waterproof splash scene — this would be a very strong visual to demonstrate the waterproof aspect of the case. 

You are offering actual pictures of the item withstanding such conditions, which means you assure clients that this is durable.

This is a simple idea that works to ensure that customers become very clear about the value of the product and also the reliability of the product due to higher trust levels and increased likelihood to purchase.

# Show “What’s Included”

Too often, buyers are frustrated because they don’t know exactly what they are paying for. If customers are not sure if all the required components are included in the package, they are bound to have doubts, resulting in cart abandonment. 

How to avoid this: Include images with everything that is included in the product. This removes ambiguity and manages customer expectations correctly.

* If you are providing a kitchen product like a blender, you should show an image with all the parts arranged in an organized manner: base, attachments, an instruction manual, and power wire. Shorthand what is included in the list under each item with text. 

That is especially vital for products that are offered with several components or accessories that, the customer may think, are offered additional to that portion.

# Clarify Assembly Requirements

As a result, consumers worry about how hard the product is to assemble when buying assembly-required products. 

However, if your product requires assembly, addressing these potential concerns upfront through **listing images** can be impactful. Step by steps ensure customers can do it, if they have doubts about complexity or need special tools.

* So, if you are selling a flat-pack piece of furniture, then perhaps diagram each step of the assembly process. Images of necessary tools Together with each component Is the subject of the product By step If the assembly process is simple, this will take away any doubt regarding complexity, and will also make it seen as a product that is easy to set up.

# Illustrate Safety Features

For several buyers, security is one of the most essential issues especially when this is in regard to a product meant for a child, pet or yourself. 

When buyers can see its safety features they are likely to trust that product as well ultimately making a huge impact in their buying decision. Use visuals to show your product safely.

* If you are selling a baby car seat, make sure to display pictures that emphasize on the safety features that the car seat offers: safety locks, side protection, correct installation in a car, etc. Showing a slight variation if a kid is buckled safely in the seat can also add the perception of safety.

# Address Maintenance Concerns

Most of the buyers fear about the maintenance of a product Read more! But on the other hand cleaning or maintenance of the product is easy to handle. Even if the offering is something that potential buyers may wish to get but if the product maintenance is tricky, people may hold back from making the purchase. 

Combat this through pictures showcasing the ease of cleaning or maintenance. A simple visual signal can remove any uncertainty and encourage more conversions.

* If you’re selling a non-stick frying pan, you can have images depicting how its surface would come off easily after use, or easygoing videos of it being placed in a dishwasher without fear. Images of this nature will also show the product necessities in the way of maintenance, which is a real selling point for a lot of customers.

# Common Image Mistakes That Turn Buyers Away

# Poor Image Quality

The most common mistake sellers make is uploading poor-quality images. Photos that are blurry, pixelated, or poorly lit not only make it all but impossible for buyers to see details about a product, but also imply a lack of professionalism in the product or the seller.

 Stock or low-quality images can cast unnecessary doubts regarding the genuineness and quality of the product among potential buyers. An unclear or fuzzy image might imply that the seller is hiding defects, or is not interested in putting his product in its best possible form, which might lead to reluctance and cart abandonment.

When it comes to **listing images**, high-resolution, crystal-clear and brightly lit photos portray professionalism as well as transparency. This allows customers to get up close and personal with the product, its texture, its material, and anything unique about it. 

Especially for products such as jewelry, clothing, or electronics where every detail may make a difference, high-quality images are crucial. 

High quality photography can change the way people look at your stuff so invest in some or use tools, to make images more appealing and help you build a better image of your brand and product.

# Inadequate Lighting

The secret sauce in product photography success is lighting. Bad lighting hides important details and makes it hard for a buyer to see the product. Insufficient lighting that is either too dim or too bright can leave shadows over the item or exaggerate coloration, making the item look very different than it actually does. 

This can annoy prospective clients that wonder why what you are selling simply cannot be unique, or unique enough.

* Such hasty spirit is a sure shot to a blunder as fair but smooth lighting should be used to project the true colors of the product. Natural light works well for some products as it gives a neutral and flattering tone. 

Or, more simply, shaped light, such as a softbox or light tent, controls the harshness of shadows while gently revealing the details of the product without blowing the highlights. Using the right lighting can foster trust and guarantee that the product is not misrepresented, making a conversion more likely.

# Overly Cluttered Backgrounds

One of the most common mistakes in product photography staging is using backgrounds that are too busy and cluttered. Too busy of a background takes the eyes of the buyer away from the product – and can make it look less professional.

* If a background is very busy or is distracting in nature, a buyer might struggle to separate the product from the background and may not get a clear picture of the elements of the product. This person would think the item is less valuable and could become confused or displeased.

One of the simplest ways to make a product stand out is with a blank background. A neutral or solid background is ideal so the attention remains on the product being sold. Occasionally, lifestyle photos where the product is being used are acceptable, but the product still needs to be the focal point of the image. 

By having a clean, well-staged background, the seller not only points focus towards the product and all of its features, but also indicates that they have taken the time to present the product as a professional seller should.

# Lack of Multiple Angles

Another common error is to upload only one image of the product. A single shot does not allow the buyer to get a full idea of the design, functionality, or quality of the product. 

* For example, customers tend to look at a single product from several angles, such as shape, texture, and how it is likely to fit itself into the customer’s lives. When you offer just a single image, it may cause doubt to the buyers because they feel like they miss half of what is in the photo.

To avoid this error, use multiple images at different angles for a good view of the product. If you are trying to sell a piece of furniture, include photos of the front, sides, back, and close-ups of important features. 

Demonstrate product if relevant, e.g. a person wearing a jacket or a lamp switched on. This diversity offers buyers a complete insight into the product and might have a positive effect on their purchase intention.

# False Or Deceptive Advertising

Inaccurate images, for instance showing photos that are not truly related to the actual product, may prompt potential buyers to turn away.

 These can be images with too many features, **listing images** that are overly posed, or images with filters that enhance the colors and texture of the product to the point that the product does not actually look like this. 

Buyers are more likely to return products, leave bad reviews and refrain from buying from the seller again when a product does not reflect its image.

The best way to avoid this error is to make sure the images that are used to represent a product, accurately reflect the item that is being sold. It should encompass the colors, proportions, and features of the product without any distortions. 

In case the product has variations (like colors options or sizes) use individual images so that it does not lead to confusion. Good images with transparency and authenticity establish credibility and trust, which in turn, leads to increase in sales and repeat customers.

# Ignoring Product Scale

When images are not well conceptualized in terms of scale, sellers often lack the ability to effectively represent product sizes to the buyer. Buyers may have no sense of scale, and without additional photography, they may think the item is smaller (or larger) than it is. 

* A photo of something small, like a keychain or pen, may appear larger than anticipated if set within a vacuum with no other objects to reference its size. That might end in disillusionment when the product comes in, which is able to lead to returns.
* You can also try adding reference objects in the photo that buyers can relate to, such as a hand holding the object, or place the product next to everyday objects, for example, place a coffee cup, ruler, or a coin. 

These references give customers a better sense of scale to the product, thus allowing them to decide if this product is for them or not. Offering precise size references can help to enhance customer experience and limit returns.

# Not Demonstrating Product Usage or Purpose

This is part of understanding your customer base — buyers want to know how the product looks and how it functions. One of the biggest mistakes is not showing the product in action & then potential customers would be unsure if it actually works and whether they actually need it or not. 

* As an example, when selling a blender, the static, unassembled product image will not communicate the way it works or how easy it is to use.

# How Image Layouts Influence Buyer Decisions

Having an organized image layout will direct the buyer view in a particular sequence to help them view the most important features of the product at the very beginning. Putting the primary product image at the top or in the center of the layout attracts immediate attention.

 Secondary images directly follow with logical sequencing, highlighting close-ups, lifestyle shots or alternate angles. 

Not only does this clear hierarchy allow customers to process information quickly, but it also guarantees that they can navigate through the listing images easily to get a complete picture of what the product actually is.

The easier you make it for buyers to view an item from different angles or in different contexts, the more likely they are to be sure about what they’re purchasing. 

# Improving User Experience (UX)

Having a familiar and predictable structure enhances the user experience. If buyers can access relevant information like product size, color options, or essential features, they are more likely to get a pleasant experience on their shopping journey. 

The perfect layout of images helps in reducing friction – as the time taken to comprehend the product becomes less. 

* If you are selling a piece of clothing, for example, you should be able to see an image of the item from the front, back, sides and close up of details of the item such as stitching or fabric so the customer can inspect the product without having to find his/her own pictures.

Some layouts may offer zoom-in features, where users can click to have a closer look at some product information; this is another way to improve the experience by offering the buyer to be in charge of how much they want to see. 

Having a simple, structured, and easy to navigate image layout makes it easier for potential customers to buy something from you and accordingly lower the [bounce rates.](http://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/less-is-more-simple-web-design-and-bounce-rates.html)

# Enabling Product Comparisons

Also, vibrant and intelligent [product comparisons](https://medium.com/gobeyond-ai/how-to-create-a-great-product-comparison-page-to-boost-conversions-a37bf95681fd) are made by prospective buyers in the shopping cart stage of e-commerce. A good image layout makes it easy for them to compare your product to others by simply visualising its unique features and differentiators. 

* As an example, if you are marketing a gadget that serves multiple functions, you can show images of the different modes or functions the product offers, highlighting the versatility of the product. 

Using strategic placement of **listing images** to highlight these key differentiators will aid customers as they imagine why they should choose your product over another one.

This kind of image display may also play well with comparative charts demonstrating various iterations of a single product (e.g., color comparison, size comparison) alongside each other. This alleviates uncertainty, which is an essential part of the process when closing a sale. 

When a buyer can easily compare features and see why your solution is better, the chances they take the next step of shopping are higher.

# Trustworthy Design Through Repeated Web Layouts

Trust plays a vital role in any buying decision, especially when you buy something online, you are not able to physically test a product. An organized image layout can always help in gaining trust as this reflects our efforts and reliability.

 If the set of images seem unpolished and appear to be taken by random customers, it creates a doubt in the customer mind if the vendor actually cares about the presentation of their products. 

This is especially useful if you carry high-ticket items or products that buyers may be skeptical about their quality or authenticity.

Cohesive image sizes and orientation, along with the usable formats reinforces the identity of a seller as organized and detail-oriented, instilling trust in the customer. 

# Improve Product Feature Focus

This sends us to a main element related to image layout: the capacity to highlight the highlights of the item, but without flooding the buyer with each of the data fragmented in a shot. Inserting a layout of call-out text, arrows, or labels into the image can highlight key features. 

* So, for instance, if you are selling a high-end kitchen appliance, you can have an image with labeled arrows indicating specific features, say buttons, digital screens, or special attachments.

This way, you create a more informative experience by directing the customer’s eye towards the product features that matter most. This is especially effective in case of complex products having many features. 

A well-structured demo: When the buyer can visualize how each feature would work then they can realize the uniqueness of the product and can feel confident about buying the product.

# Show Scale and Size of a Product 

One of the flaws that people often stumble upon while purchasing online is not being able to estimate the size of a product or the scale of an item. This can be eased by providing relatable references within the image layout. 

* For instance a product alongside a known object such as a coffee mug, phone, or person can be helpful as it allows buyers to gauge the actual size of the product. 

But for a product that is meant to sit on a shelf or be worn, customers will scale relative to their other dimensions, and without these references, customers will either scale even larger or smaller than you intend, and there is potential for disappointment.

This can also be solved by putting measurements in the actual photos. Showing an image of the shelf with labelled dimensions can provide buyers with all the specifications they need to ensure the product will fit into their space. 

Helps provide clarity on size and proportions through the layout of the image and decreases uncertainty for buyers and subsequently reason for potential returns.

# Make Interacting With The Product Attractive

An image layout that promotes engagement will lead to increased engagement and, eventually, an increased probability of conversion. With features like 360-degree views, zoom-in view, and an option to view the product from different angles, customers can virtually interact with the product.

* Such a layer of interaction is crucial for high-end or complex products, for example, electronics or luxury products, which buyers usually want to view in detail before purchase.
* Interactive image layouts on your product page offer a more immersive experience and give customers the experience of holding the product in their hands. 

Touch-that at least this hands-on approach even in the online world can do wonders when it comes to prompt the final buying action-as it brings out an in-store shopping experience.

# What Do Buyers Look for in Amazon Images?

# Original and Straightforward Product Advertising

Consumers prefer **listing images** that depict an item in its true form since the photos they receive are actually as depicted. While saying ‘less is more’ is usually not entirely appropriate for most things in life, overly polished and edited photos might disappoint buyers or lead to a string of returns. 

Real life images depict the facet of the product which has not been altered in any manner, including the color, texture and surface finish of the product. 

* For instance, a leather handbag must have photos that zone in on material, which features textural, sewing, and underlying graininess. While these details do tell the quality of the product they also assist in creating confidence in consumers.

Further, authenticity also means presenting the product in a way it is, without putting a lot of makeup on it. For instance, if one is designing a ceramic dinner plate the image should not contain shinny filters if the dinner plate contains matte finishing.

# Realistic Use in Everyday Settings

Purchasers need to understand how they would use a product. Great pictorial images that depict the product in contexts that are familiar encourage customers and emotional buying.

* For instance, a [coffee maker placed](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/20/review-erm-that-aint-cold-brew-spinn/) on a clean kitchen top cup of coffee on the side gives a clue as to how the coffee can enhance one’s morning routine. It brings the functionality of the product closer to life and enables buyers to easily place the product in their lives.

Lifestyle settings are critical more so for products that are used every other day. Scenes in which a pair of sneakers can be photographed include a person strolling through a park or a person exercising on a treadmill. 

* For kitchen appliances, it is perfectly suitable to demonstrate what meal the blender is making as a smoothie, or what meal a slow cooker is great for making.

They also speak about the possibilities to use the product, these settings are realistic. For instance, a multi-functional desk shown in a home office setting together with a computer, books and a cup of coffee gives an idea of how a workspace can adapt to work-from-home. 

Likewise, from the comfort of their home, a sofa placed in a cozy living room setting will make buyers imagine how the piece of furniture will look like in their homes.

# Culture and LifeStyle Preferences

* Pictures and other visuals in line with these views may carry a great impact on buying behavior. For example, presenting a set utilized during the holiday, including Thanksgiving or Diwali, captures the buyers ‘ attention and makes them visualize the product’s use. This makes the product more appealing and relatable to the target market due to cultural affinity it has towards the product.

Relevance to lifestyle is also considered important in well defined segments. 

* For example, the workout wear worn on different-shaped models in different settings such as gym, a park or even a home fitness equipment section shows that the brand is inclusive. Most consumers desire their images reflected in products or product advertisements. 
* For instance, an advertisement that depicts a yoga mat in use at a natural setting such as a garden and inside a cramped up apartment satisfies different types of needs, thus, the product cover’s a broader mosaic.
* Another important aspect of cultural relevance of the imagery is that it creates trust. For example, if the product is being marketed globally it could be useful to include pictures depicting people of different skin color, dressing style or even different cultural practices, preferences etc. 
* For example, the sellers of cookware could put in their visuals examples of recipes from different cultures, appealing to the buyers’ culture.

# Standard Zoomable for Inspection

Purchasing offline stores gives buyers an experience of touching and feeling of the products they are buying. A lack of visible textures and low detail density is counterbalanced by zoomable images that provide customers with detailed observations.

 It is valuable for such types of products as jewelry, electronics, luxurious leather accessories, etc., especially if they are bought to be used at business meetings with partners or at other formal occasions.

* For instance, a buyer of a leather wallet will want to inspect the wallet’s stitches, grain and the embossed logo of the wallet. Image enlargability which allows the customers to examine the quality of the product from **listing images** that are in higher resolution. 

Likewise, the use of detailed images for electronics, such as ports, buttons, and screen displays, enables the buyers to better appraise form and features of what they are purchasing.

Another advantage of zoomable images is that they are useful when describing products with some highly relevant technical attributes. 

* For instance, a power tool can have detailed shots of attachments, grip, and protective measures in motion; such an aspect helps buyers make judgments on the tool’s use and construction. For clothing, specific views of fabric, stitches and other details let the buyer make a correct decision about style and wear resistance.

# Images Addressing Concerns

Consumers sometimes have particular issues or questions in mind when choosing and considering buying a particular product. In fact, negating these concerns through **listing images** can rid it all together and foster trust. 

* For instance, an adaptor for charging a phone could display animations of how the charger is appropriate for charging phones, tablets and laptops. This can be done with a picture of the charger connected to different kinds of devices with manufacturers’ brands and the devices’ models inscribed on a nearby label.

 This is advantageous to the buyer because they are assured about their purchase by being told what they want to hear, that a certain product is compatible with another.

* Another example for kitchen products is a knife set. As for the actual artefacts, buyers question specifically the sharpness of the knives as well as their general sturdiness.

 However, touching an image of the knives while they are in use by placing them in a setting such as cutting through a hard vegetable such as pumpkin or even flesh of an animal gives a visual guarantee of their performance. 

Two requirements that may cause durability worries can also be addressed with here showing images that depict real testing conditions. 

* For instance, a suitcase may be used while demonstrating that it has passed a certain drop test or while demonstrating that it is strong enough to bear a several hundred pounds weight. This puts the mind of the buyer who may have some doubts about the durability level of the product.
* In the case of electronic gadgets, figures that can explain safety features such as overheating protection of the hair straightener can remove safety concerns. Besides, it is useful to have an image where you can depict that people, children, adults, or professionals, can use the product.

# Product Variations in Action

Some purchases are made in different color, size or format, and the buyer would wish to see these options clearly before arriving at a decision. Photographs that present the product with different options used in various applications give the buyer clarity that helps in picking the most suitable variation. 

* For example, if a brand selling furniture wants to display a sofa they are selling, IMAGES should depict the same sofa in five different colors on a background depicting a living room setting. In doing so, the buyers can easily have a glimpse of how one variation could fleet with the rest of the interior theme.

It is also a good idea to single out the size or other differences, apart from the colors. 

* For example, a travel backpack, the product can be placed on different people where the labels are superimposed on the images of small, medium, and large bags. This also allows buyers to choose the best size for their needs from a given size range available on the market.

Branding brands always stand out when it comes to showcasing product iterations. A dress can be made and sold in several patterns or materials, hence, the models which promote the dress sundress might be of different colour or size. 

Besides marking the availability of various choices, it gains access to the broad circle of consumers, thus making people interested in the product.

# Graphics True to Safety and Sustainability

Today’s consumer provides much emphasis on the safety of the products as well as the environmental effect of the products. Managers need to understand that specific **listing images** that call attention to various aspects of a product like safety and the firm’s sustainable practices have a strong impact on buyer perception.

* For example, a baby crib could also offer images of how it locks securely and other highlights i.e. side impact and safety certifications such as ASTM or JPMA. However, a picture of the crib along with the badge which shows that it confirms the safety standard of the country also provides the parents confidence about the product.

For products targeted at conscious consumers the imagery associated with sustainability strikes the correct chord.

* For example, a reusable water bottle can have pictures on it that point out such facts as the type of packaging used or the kind of material used in its manufacture. Additionally, one can add an infographic that demonstrates the advantages of using the bottle, comparing it to the single-use plastics to maximize the message about the product’s sustainability.

A [product with labels](http://157.245.213.31/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-launch-private-label-product-on-amazon/) like organic, biodegradable, or carbon-neutral should be able to clearly indicate these in the visuals used. 

* For example, an organic cotton bedding set might include a picture of the bedding set itself on an actual bed in a relaxing bedroom, then place the icons of organic certification, and a short message of how it contributes to the environment on top of it.

I had a bit of a conversion event by myself and was recommended this church by a very devout grandmother of mine (who wasn't in the area anymore, but knew this place from way back in the day)

Given the subreddit I'm in, I don't have to paint much of a picture: you know what it's like from your regrettable history, dear reader. Services go on incredibly long, always infringe on schedules/deadlines. Band consists of shell-shocked zombified people terrified to play anything they want to, held under the tyrannical thumb of the pastor's daughter-turned-vocalist who has her keyboards dialled up louder than any other instrument. Vague drama raging behind the scenes, especially around contentious ongoing political debates, which often see entire families withdrawing and disappearing for months at a time before being lured back in.

Pastor and his sidekick wife had a tendency to devolve into passive aggressive rants during the service, directed at individual members they were feuding with/disapproving of. God forbid I go to a rock concert. God forbid I cover someone's food while it was unattended, lest a seagull eats it? Apparently that's a sign that I'm 'unintelligent'? What the fuck are you talking about you blathering cunt?

A moment to talk about the NICE people, momentarily: >!There were a good deal of NICE, casual people there, who I think just wanted to meet likeminded people and didn't ACTUALLY believe much of it or take it too seriously. They tended to be career professionals who were a bit lonely, dressed nicely and spoke nicely (which, in England where this story is set, can set you apart/make you a bit of a target). They walked a certain tightrope though, adhered to social codes, as not to have the pastor and his family breathing down their necks and sniffing them out for sinful behaviour.!<

>!I also had to say that it was a rather diverse church. Unlike your typical American church it had a dozen different nationalities present, very ethnically and culturally-mixed. Unfortunately shitbags come from many different places.!<

Said shitbags were very envious, manipulative, condescending and smarmy. They were just plain immature, childish, psychologically-stunted, even into their 30s/40s. They alone taught me that many devout Christians, those who have known nothing but the church their whole lives, tend to be very psychologically underdeveloped and do not know how to process feelings of jealousy, insecurity, inferiority and anger. They'll channel all these things instead into religious righteousness.

I had so-called friends jeering and shouting at me while playing guitar/performing publicly because it was music they didn't like. I had so-called friends upstaging and berating me while walking through a park because they were jealous of a girl liking me. I had so-called friends seizing weights from me in the gym because they were terrified of me lifting more than them. I had so-called friends invading the homes of people who had (mistakenly) generously invited them over for lunch, only to begin rearranging their house and changing their computer settings right in front of them.

The main guy responsible for this behaviour was the son of another pastor. He literally went to bed every night listening to Christian music while he slept. He literally wore a cross every waking hour. He literally didn't know what marijuana smelled like. He literally received exorcisms back in his home country every single week to cast out demons. For all his memorising of the bible, his history of exorcisms and his self-righteous behaviour, he couldn't cast out the spirit of an angry manchild from his heart.

Nor can many pentecostals. Even old relatives I have, unaffiliated with said church and knee-deep in the doctrine, are some of the most envious, bitter, gossipy people I've ever met and relentlessly blabber to each other and social media about whatever Darlene or Josh has been doing wrong, whether it's the way they stir their coffee or the music they listen to in their car.

I was lucky to have only a casual Christian upbringing which I was permitted to distance myself from/question in my early teens. I was lucky to only experience this brief pentecostal stint for 1-2 years in my adult life.

audio version: https://youtu.be/8tR08prsmls?si=12WU_1Qv4_9q5bXC

I need to know—am I the asshole for trying to stop my son from throwing away his entire fucking existence for an aim trainer, a number, and full-blown, Alex Jones-level psychotic right-wing extremism?

A year ago, my son was just a normal teenager. He had a life. He had friends. He had dreams—not just of shooting pixels but of going outside, of doing shit that mattered. He was good at Roblox Arsenal and wanted to get even better, so he started training with KovaaK’s. At first, it seemed harmless. I figured, hell, it’s something to do that’s productive. I thought it was a good thing. A healthy obsession.

But now, ,my 18-year-old son—who used to be a kind, left-leaning, progressive, compassionate, well-rounded person—has turned into a Trump-worshipping, conspiracy-obsessed lunatic with the emotional stability of a chihuahua on meth.

 	Every single aspect of his life now revolves around VT Pasu Rasp Advanced, Trump, and drinking himself into oblivion every night over a number that doesn’t even fucking matter. He has been grinding this same aim training scenario for MONTHS trying to hit 1120, and every single day that he fails, he spirals further into complete fucking insanity.

 It’s like watching a man slowly lose his mind in a locked room, except in this case, the room is his own dumbass brain, and the lock is self-imposed because he refuses to just fucking stop. He’s convinced he’s “genetically unlucky” like he was born with some kind of cursed DNA strand that prevents him from clicking on dots fast enough. He blames the “RNG gods” for his failures like his life is a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, and the dice just keep rolling against him. 

He genuinely believes Trump is the “ultimate winner”—that Trump’s mindset is what separates the strong from the weak. Every time he fails to hit 1120, he tells me “the RNG gods rigged it, just like they rigged the election.” And when he inevitably fails to reach 1120 for the day, he drowns himself in alcohol, spiraling further into a Trump-induced, caffeine-fueled existential crisis.

My son is now sitting in his room, crying over a fucking number, and sipping whiskey out of a Trump shot glass like a goddamn lost cause every single night. Eighteen years old and getting wasted in his room, slumped over his keyboard, reeking of cheap liquor, muttering about how he’s “genetically unlucky” and how “liberals want to keep men weak.”


I thought he was just lonely, but it turns out a girl at work had a crush on him. A girl who actually liked him. And what did he do? He ignored her—he didn’t even text her back. Instead, he locked himself in his room, playing Pasu for hours on end, saying he had no time for “distractions.”

 Every morning, he wakes up, stumbles out of bed like a sleep-deprived ghoul, chugs a concerning amount of caffeine, and immediately loads up KovaaK’s to grind Pasu for another eight to twelve fucking hours. And it’s not even about playing an actual game anymore. No, games are a ""waste of time"" because they ""don't optimize aim efficiency.” This motherfucker doesn’t even play games anymore. He just stares at moving dots all day like he’s training to become the world’s most efficient fly hunter. And just when I thought his Pasu-induced psychosis was the worst thing I had to deal with, the Trump shit started.

 The Radicalization: MattyOW’s Discord Server Ruined Him.

I 100% blame MattyOW’s Discord server for this. I don’t know what the fuck goes on in there, but I swear to God, it’s a far-right, transphobic, ultra-MAGA brainwashing cult disguised as an aim training community. At first, my son was normal. A sweet, left-leaning, respectful kid. Then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere, he’s casually dropping Ben Shapiro talking points like a Fox News anchor on Adderall.

 It started small. At first, he just said Starbucks was ""woke garbage.” “The bipartisan border bill wasn’t actually about securing the border.” Then it became ""Kamala Harris is ruining America.” I’d shut that shit down, IMMEDIATELY. One day, I walk past his room and hear him listening to Matt Walsh. I stop in my tracks. There is no fucking way. I burst in. “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LISTENING TO?” He turns to me, dead serious, and goes: “The truth.” I almost threw up. Oh, HELL NO. IN THIS HOUSE? IN MY HOUSE?? WHERE WE LITERALLY CELEBRATED THE BIDEN-HARRIS VICTORY LIKE IT WAS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY??? We are an ultra-progressive, leftist, pro-LGBTQ+, science-loving, Kamala Harris-worshipping household. We have Harris bumper stickers on the car, Fauci bobbleheads on the mantle, and a giant ‘Protect Trans Kids’ sign in the front yard. We even have Black Lives Matter stickers on the coffee pot. We don’t tolerate racism, homophobia, transphobia, or right-wing lunacy. We had Kamala Harris signs on our lawn. We raised our son to respect Anthony Fauci, to listen to experts, to trust facts. Thomas Matthew Crooks is a hero in this household. We don’t entertain conspiracies, Trumpian fascism, or any of that Fox News bullshit. If Donald Trump, Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson or any of those fascist fucking clowns are even mentioned in this house, it better be followed by the words ""should be in prison."" But no matter what I said, it was too late. MattyOW’s server got to him.

 The Starbucks Incident: My son has been chugging absurd amounts of caffeine to ""maximize his performance"" in Pasu, so I thought, okay, let’s at least get him something normal. I bought him Starbucks coffee. Big fucking mistake. The moment he saw it, his entire body tensed up like a conspiracy theorist at a COVID vaccine clinic. He looked at me like I had just handed him a transgender Antifa manifesto soaked in soy milk. ""I'M NOT DRINKING THAT WOKE POISON."" 

He full-on shoved it away like I was trying to assassinate him. Said the ""deep state agents"" were putting estrogen in it to ""make him weak"" so he couldn’t hit 1120. Because apparently, Howard Schultz himself is personally orchestrating a global conspiracy to ruin my son’s Pasu scores.

The Hair Incident: He Dyed His Hair Blonde to Look Like Trump One day, this motherfucker bleached his hair blonde. Like, full-on platinum Trump blonde. I saw him walk out of the bathroom, and I almost had a fucking aneurysm. ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO YOUR HEAD?"" He stares at me, dead in the eyes, and just says: ""MAGA."" And then—I shit you not—he raised his arm and did that weird Elon Musk Nazi salute thing. I thought I was going to fucking faint. 

The Mall Incident: We were at the mall because he wanted a pretzel after buying some Victoria’s Secret perfume that “smells like Astra dynamic abilities.” We were walking past the store when I saw a morbidly plus-sized trans woman wearing a she/her pin. And then, it happened. This fucking kid—my own flesh and blood—looked right at her and went: ""Actually, HE wants a pretzel."" I WANTED TO FUCKING DIE. And then he DOUBLED DOWN. ""Trump is proudly taking away your rights.” ""You won’t exist in a few years.” ""The deep state won’t save you."" I had to drag his Nazi-ass out of that store before we got banned from the mall forever. 

The Olive Garden Incident: One night, I thought, maybe if we go out, do something normal, have a fucking meal together, he’ll snap out of it.. We went to Olive Garden for dinner, and everything was fine, I swear to God, I’ve never seen a person break down faster. We were sitting there at the table, trying to enjoy some spaghetti and breadsticks, when he picked up the menu and saw it. He read the calorie count for spaghetti with meatballs. 

1120 fucking calories. 


This grown-ass man started crying at the table like I had just told him his entire family died in a plane crash. His hands were shaking, his breathing got all weird and shallow, and he just kept whispering “it’s a sign” over and over again. The waiter was horrified. Other diners were staring. I have never felt so fucking humiliated in my life. 

But that wasn’t the worst of it. No, that came when I took him overseas. I thought maybe traveling would help him. Make him see there’s a world outside of this shit. I wanted to believe he could still be saved. 

We landed after a 14 hour flight, and we were exhausted. We got to the hotel, and check into our room.

The room number? 1120. 

And do you know what he did? 

He fucking froze. He refused to step inside. His hands were shaking. He looked at me like I had just asked him to sleep in a haunted fucking graveyard. He kept muttering to himself “bad omen” and “I can’t risk it.”

RISK WHAT??? 

I told him it’s just a number. A coincidence. But he was dead serious. His breathing got shallow. His face went pale. He was fucking terrified.

I had to go to the front desk and ask them to change our fucking room because my grown-ass son thinks a goddamn hotel number is out to get him.

A week later, I decided to search his room while he was at work, and what I found made me want to fucking die. Trump flags on the ceiling, Trump posters on the wall, a fucking Trump light switch. A book from Matt Walsh titled “Johnny The Walrus”, Charlie Kirk magazines on his desk, and I kid you the fuck not, a custom Donald Trump assassination attempt skypad. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried. Receipts for donations to Trump’s campaign. I wanted burn it all and baptize him in Fauci’s fucking name. 

 When he got home, I confronted him. He looked me in the eyes and said: “Trump was falsely accused by E. Jean Carroll.” I lost my fucking mind. IN THIS HOUSE, WE KNOW TRUMP RAPED E. JEAN CARROLL.

I thought it couldn’t get any worse. Boy was I wrong.

The Dog Incident: One day, I hear him talking shit to the dog. Not to me, not to his fellow conspiracy theorists. TO THE FUCKING DOG.

Why?

He misgenders her and accuses her of being “suspiciously woke” because she won’t bark at a Coldstomper pasu vod. 

After that, there was the amazon driver incident. One day, I walk outside and notice cameras. I ask him, “What the fuck are these?” 

And this delusional psychopath looks me in the eye and goes: “They’re to keep watch for Antifa and deep-state anti-Pasu agents.” I swear to fucking God, I started losing vision. Turns out, an Amazon delivery driver wore a blue shirt one day and my son spiraled into a full-blown paranoid episode, convinced it was a ‘Kamala agent’ sent to sabotage his Pasu grind. He ASSOCIATES THE COLOR BLUE WITH KAMALA AND NOVA RANK.

I was at a complete loss. My wife and I both decided that enough was enough. The drinking, the Trump obsession, the Pasu insanity—it was too much. So I did what any responsible parent would do: I set him up with a counselor.

We get to the office, and the therapist—a kind, middle-aged woman with a rainbow pin on her blazer— greets him warmly. She asks him a simple question: ""So, what brings you in today?""

 And this absolute fucking moron sits back in his chair, crosses his arms, and with the cockiest, most smug smirk I’ve ever seen, he goes: ""I don’t take advice from hardstuck Jades."" I blink. The therapist blinks. Nobody knows what the fuck he’s talking about.

She tries to keep it professional and asks him what he means, and he just scoffs. ""You wouldn’t get it, you’re a socialist.” A FUCKING SOCIALIST. HE CALLED A LICENSED THERAPIST A HARDSTUCK JADE SOCIALIST.

This woman went to eight years of school to help people, and my brain-poisoned, Trump-worshipping, Pasu-addicted, terminally online son just completely dismissed her existence because he thinks she isn’t good enough at a fictional aim rank to help him.

I apologized and dragged his dumbass out of there before he could start ranting about the deep state.

 My son is gone. I don't know what to do. So I ask: AITA for trying to stop my son from becoming a number-obsessed, transphobic, Trump-worshipping, conspiracy-driven, brainwashed psycho?

1ioiyxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1ioiyxw/my_binge_cravings_are_disappearing_i_want_to/,"My binge cravings are disappearing, I want to share what helped.","I have struggled with binge eating disorder for about 7 years now. I've tried to handle it with pure willpower, healing my emotional trauma, finding coping mechanisms other than food, ashwaganda, and getting in tune with my bodys needs and hunger. I have had various results.

I have realized that a lot of my binging behavior comes from food scarcity. I binge a lot when I perceive a potential food scarcity. At work is really bad for me, because my breaks were often limited and restricted to certain times, and I couldn't take them when I needed them to curb hunger. Or I couldn't possibly pack with me enough food to feel food secure at work. I've been jobless since December, which while bad for my wallet, has been doing wonders for my mental health which definitely contributes to my progress Im sure.

Something I started right before the new year, is cutting out added sugar in my diet, which pretty much meant eat all the same foods except the zero sugar option. Zero sugar soda, zero sugar ice cream, Zero sugar coffee creamer, zero sugar ketchup, anything that has sugar I replaced with Zero sugar alternatives. I did this not as a means to help binge eating but because I have PCOS that I need to learn to manage and living a diabetic lifestyle will help with that a lot. But wow!! It has so helped my binge eating. 

I haven't had a binge urge in probably around a month and my hunger has gone way down. I didn't restrict calories for the first week or two of sugar free so my body could adjust, but now its been really easy to eat 1800 cal a day or less because I am so much less hungry. And less hunger equals less feeling of food scarcity because I'm not as worried about mitigating hunger. The nail in the coffin was when I replaced my morning bagel for breakfast for eggs and whole grain toast, something that I did to help fuel the gym better.

I never thought I could do anything like sugar free because of BED but I'm realizing that sugar addiction and blood sugar crashes were so contributing. I still eat sugar, I just try to keep it less than 25g a day, but normally I'm at 0g or 1g. I eat ice cream nightly, but its sugar free. But I'm also not super strict restrictive, when I went to the state fair last week, I ate so much sugar, probably 100+ plus grams honestly! And I always have a little treat when I go out to places that have offered some homemade fruit tarts or pies. A key still with BED or any lifestyle change is still letting yourself enjoy the things around you.

also PSA the Target brand low calorie ice cream is to die for! 100x better than Halo Top and its just delicious. Helps me gets my sweet treat fix in with lower calories and no added sugars. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my progress. I've got zero binge cravings and I'm down 7lbs. 💓💓💓",3,1739453136.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False
1ioiyr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ioiyr6/hindi_lang_ako/,Hindi lang ako.,"I've been pursuing someone for over a year now. We're both guys—I'm in accounting, he's in logistics. At first, I thought there was nothing serious between us. But over time, we met for lunch, dinner, and coffee, and we slept together more than once. We exchanged gifts. I’d send food to his workplace, and he’d do the same for me. He even memorized my favorite Starbucks order, even though he doesn’t like coffee himself.

I knew his struggles—how he wanted to resign, how exhausted he felt. And he knew mine—how I juggled work and school, how much I wanted to make things work.

For a while, I thought we had something real. Until tonight.

I saw his Instagram post—a table set for two, with two bouquets resting on top.

[Writer’s block](https://www.guidexmentor.com/post/how-to-get-over-writer-s-block-for-your-college-essay) is literally the worst, especially when you’re stuck writing your college essay. Trust, we've ALL been there—staring at the screen like “Is this even real?” But don’t panic. At [GuidEx](https://www.guidexmentor.com/), we’ve helped so many students push through the struggle. Here are some easy tips to help you get that essay done without losing your mind:

https://preview.redd.it/hoojsolcqwie1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=f903fc3d5e066b999632e26bef1f4da8c1f34868

**1. Brainstorm First, Write Later 💡**

Don’t even think about writing the perfect essay on the first try. Start by brainstorming—just jot down everything that comes to mind about the essay prompt. It doesn’t have to make sense right away. Just get all those thoughts down and you can organize them later into a killer essay.

**2. Freewriting Is Your Best Friend 📝**

When the pressure to write a *perfect* essay feels suffocating, freewriting is a lifesaver. Set a timer for like 10-15 minutes and just write whatever comes to mind. No worrying about grammar or structure—just get the words flowing. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it gets once you stop trying to make everything perfect.

**3. Switch Up Your Scene for a Fresh Vibe 🏞️**

Staring at the same screen for hours? *Nope*. Change up your environment! Go to a coffee shop, park, or library—somewhere with new energy. A change of scene will give your brain a reset and you’ll be surprised at how many new ideas pop up when you’re in a new place.

**4. Keep It Real: Focus on** ***You*** **👑**

Listen, there’s no “right” answer to those broad essay prompts. Admissions officers just wanna know *who you are*. So, drop the fake stuff and talk about your real experiences, values, and passions. The more authentic and YOU it is, the better your essay will land.

**5. Don’t Forget to Take Breaks ✨**

Writing non-stop? That’s a recipe for burnout. Take breaks! Watch a funny video, take a walk, or scroll through TikTok—whatever helps your brain reset. When you come back to your essay, you’ll feel way more focused and ready to tackle it.

**6. Writer’s Block Happens, Don’t Stress 💯**

At [GuidEx](https://www.guidexmentor.com/), we always say: writer’s block is part of the deal. Every writer deals with it. So, instead of getting frustrated, just embrace it. Stay patient, keep going, and trust that your brain will come up with ideas when it’s ready. Don’t force it—just let it happen.

Follow these tips, and you’ll get through writer’s block like a pro. Writing an essay is a process, and it’s totally okay if it takes time. With these methods, you’ll have an essay that’s gonna impress *for sure*.

1ioivub,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1ioivub/venlils_best_friend_part_14/,Venlil´s Best Friend (Part 14),"Well, it's been a while since I last updated... I've seen a lot of comments about losing motivation or things like that, the truth is that I haven't stopped writing, the problem is that I haven't had time to translate what I write.

After finishing school nobody tells you that there comes a phase where you have to go back and forth to deliver documents and carry out countless procedures in addition to going to job interviews and contine studying for a final exam I have. I like to use the phone´s notes to always write no matter if I'm in line at the bank, stuck in traffic or just sitting in the park, the problem is that when I finally finish a chapter I don't have the same ease to translate it, I need to sit down and concentrate to correct and write several things before translating it, then reread it and correct it again (even so I always omit several erros, sorry about that).

As compensation, I will upload the next chapter of Lyra tomorrow and if time allows, I will upload the next chapter of Kajim this weekend.

If you are still reading my story despite everything, I really appreciate it, I know I always say it but you have no idea how much it means to me.

As always, your comments are always welcome and I'm open to any criticism or suggestion,

**Transcription memory, subject:** Lyra, Commercial and cultural exchange program with the earth subject

**Date \[Standardized Human Time\]:** November 22, 2137

“Thanks, you for using venlnections your FTL calling system, please wait a moment while we establish an FTL channel for you, connecting venlils across the galaxy""

\[SIT\]

\[SIIIT\] ""Good boy,"" I said as I rewarded Ozzy with his ninth or tenth treat of the day.

I had finally gotten Ozzy obey me 70% of the time and I couldn't be more proud of my progress. \[SIT\] \[PAW\] \[NO\] and recently \[FIND\] were the commands that Ozzy and I had mastered so far although the last one is a work in progress, with regular training sessions during the days I did outside work.

I've searched online and the amount of tricks, instructions and training is practically endless. Jumps, flips, tricks of all kinds, the imagination is the limit! I can't wait to find a way to teach him the order \[CLEAN\] and forget about having to clean the backyard every morning, although from what the boss has told me, this is a slow process and I have to increase the complexity progressively, but honestly, I think I've got it down, the only disadvantage is the huge amount I've spent on treats to get Ozzy to obey me. I don't know if he has gained weight because the treats or if it's just a normal part of his growth but judging by how tight his leash is it seems to be quite a bit... I'll probably ask Angie the next appointment.

The communicator was still ringing, waiting to connect the call to the other side of the galaxy. I had already shown my new abilities to everyone I knew except one person, the most stubborn and traditional venlil I know... This time, Mom will have to admit that I am more capable than she has always claimed.

""Sigh... Lyra, what are you doing calling now? Don't you know what time is here?"" Mom said rubbing her face.

""But I checked the time zones, you're supposed to be awake at this time.""

""I joined a gardening club and now I sleep on this paw"" she replied.

""And how am I supposed to guess that?!"" I said a little annoyed.

""Oh honey, you hardly ever call and when I've tried you never answer"" The world behind Mom turned abruptly as she plopped down on her bed again. ""Sometimes I fear you've already been eaten.""

""I ALREADY TOLD YOU TO CHECK THE TIME ZONES BEFORE CALLING, THE 24-HOUR FORMAT IS NOT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND""

""Oh honey... I already told you that it's complicated for me, just call at a time that isn't my sleep or my club time"" She said indifferently as she puffed her wool, seeing her own image in the call.

“THAT’S WHAT I DID, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GUESS THAT… you know what? Forget it…” I knew this was a lost cause “I only called for two things” I said.

"" Hmmm ?"" Her attention was back on me, I placed the pad´s camera on the coffee table in the living room, focusing on an open area of the room and I positioned myself in the center of the shot.

""Beautiful house, you've never shown it to me before"" she replied snuggling into her bed ""But I don't understand why you needed to wake me up for that""

""It's not that... \[SIT\] It's almost your turn"" I said motioning for Ozzy to still stay out of the shot ""There's something or... Someone I want to show you"" I said trying to maintain the mystery as much as possible.

…

""Oh no, don't tell me you too..."" she said, bringing a paw to her forehead in frustration.

""What? Me too?"" Were there others like me?

""Don't tell me you're dating a human"" she said, bringing the camera very close to her face at a very strange angle.

""What? No!"" I said feeling my face blush.

""Even if you adopt, they say that that the venlils raised with predators have sharper teeth and longer claws” she said “A member of my club told me that...""

""IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT, YOU UNDERSTOOD?"" I said with a higher-pitched bleat than I anticipated, even making Ozzy go on alert. ""COULD YOU JUST SHUT UP AND LET ME SHOW YOU?"" Brakh, now I remember why I don't call her that often...

...

""I don't like the tone you're using, young lady"" she said, taking a somewhat arrogant attitude. ""You've always been a scoundrel, but living with those humans for so long has only made it worse""

""Yeah, yeah whatever, you always say the same..."" She always ends up resorting to that argument when she gets angry ""And that I'm lazy, messy, irresponsible, impulsive and that I'm incapable of settling down, well... Someone like that could achieve something like that?"" I said full of pride. Her prejudices were nothing more than a house of cards compared to what I had to show her.

""OZZY, COME HERE"" I felt like a great general giving an order and Ozzy came running towards me like my loyal soldier. Of course, all air of authority ended when he started jumping around me, looking between my paws for his next treat.

\[SIT\]... \[PAW\] I gave the commands as firmly as I could and Ozzy seemed to understand them on the first try, making my demonstration perfect, sitting right in the center of the shot.

""If this isn't the ultimate display of discipline and responsibility then I don't know what is"" I said to the camera, but... There was no response. ""Mom?""

My pad screen remained dimly lit with the message “Call Ended”

""Did she hang up on!?"" I ran to confirm the connection of the call and indeed she had hung up...

""Does she have any idea how much I spend for each call I make to her?"" 

…

“Thanks, you for using venlnections your FTL calling system, please wait a…”

I insisted at least 3 more times until the call was finally accepted, the image was focused on some dirty and dark place but mom was nowhere to be seen.

""Mom? Where are you?"" I said and moved the pad in different directions in an attempt to see beyond the boundaries of the screen. ""Are you okay? What happened to you?"" I said, starting to get worried.

""I-Is it r-really you?"" A shaky voice said with no one appearing on the screen.

""What kind of question is that?"" I said, a little annoyed by the absurdity of her answer. ""Who else on earth would be interested in calling you and make it so early?""

A pair of ears peeked out from one edge of the screen and with a discreet shiver Mom showed her face again.

""What was that?"" I said angrily. ""Do you know how much all the call attempts I made will cost me? The company charges you for using an FTL communication channel whether you answer or not.""

""Oh honey you're safe"" he said as he crawled under what looked like her bed ""You managed to escape from that creature""

""It's Ozzy mom, I've sent you pictures of him before""

""I've never opened one of those images, thanks to the stars that the chat system puts a warning before seeing a picture of such horrible creature"" she said, flopping back down on her bed ""I don't know how you sleep knowing that thing is lurking around your house""

""Ozzy isn't a ""thing"" and he won't do anything to me, he can make a mess sometimes but that's why I'm training him"" I headed him out to the backyard for now, I don't want him to accidentally show up on the call and have to make a call again because mom freaked out and hung up ""Wait... You thought I was being attacked and the first thing you did was hang up?

...

""I couldn't do anything through the screen, I was thinking who to call for help""

""If you knew that then why did you hide under the bed?"" I honestly wasn't surprised that Mom did that but still, a feeling tightened in my chest just thinking about it.

""Honey... I panicked okay? This is too much for me, you have to understand that...""

""AND YOU THINK THAT ALL OF THIS HASN'T BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME TOO? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I'VE FACED?""

""Honey, you chose that, you can't blame me for your decision to go against your nature...""

""THAT'S NOT MY NATURE, it's not the nature of any of us actually"" I felt my emotions overflowing so I had to pause to breathe ""Sigh... When the humans arrived I cursed the stars for allowing their existence , spreading unstoppably throughout the galaxy, invading, destroying and contradicting everything we once took for granted... it was then I thought ""well if this is how things are going to be at least they should pay me for it"" That was why I joined this exchange program, a way to make contact with them but still under our terms and yet, everything they did threatened everything that was my world; values, beliefs and fears, nothing seems to be true and I honestly I still not completely sure what to think""

""Ok, I understand but I don't see any reason for... all of this"" Mom sounded quite irritated moving her paws and eyes as if in front of her was an invisible list in which was written every single thing she wanted to reproach me for ""You have always been problematic but now there are times when I don't know how much of my daughter is left... I just don't understand what they have done to you to act like this""

""No one has done anything to me; I have had the freedom to choose, to express myself, to scream without fear of being pointed out and I don't know, at some point caring for Ozzy has become a part of me... without the irrational fear, it even feels good""

""THAT FEAR IS WHAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE"" Her high-pitched voice made me move the pad away from my face ""You can be around them, pretend you're like them but you're not. Look, I understand you're young and want to experiment a little, but this?""

""He needed help and I gave it, is that really so bad?""

""IF THAT THREATENS YOUR SURVIVAL THEN YES..."" She was losing her patience too ""At what point did you lose your common sense?""

""I... I don't know okay? I guess, I grew fond of him, he's not so bad when you get to know him. Once they find a place in your heart there's no turning back"" I said letting myself fall on my couch, I didn't know if I felt exhausted from having woken up so early to make this call or from how exhausting it is to argue with mom.

...

""That's horrible, it sounds like you have parasites"" she said with a disgusted expression ""I didn't want to do this but you're going to have to decontaminate yourself and go through a full medical checkup before you come back, I don't want any of that vermin in this house"" The disdain with which she spoke as she was checking her claws was painful to see.

""Well, I...""

""What? You're not really thinking to bringing that thing home when your program ends are you?""

...

""BY THE STARS..."" He said with absolute indignation ""I should have listened to them, a few solar steps of orientation in a PD installation wouldn't hurt""

""DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT"" I felt my wool stand on end just thinking about it ""Do you know how many of my coworkers went through that? Most of them suffered things that they didn't even... Sigh..."" I knew this was a lost cause...

""Honey, I care about you, I really do, that's why I'm telling you this...""

""Look, I think I have something good here and I wanted to show it to you... Fear and that feeling of inferiority, I’m tired of them, of being looked upon with pity all the time. I like to feel that I have control over something in my life, that I am needed by someone else just for being who I am. why is it so difficult to understand?” a pain in my chest made increasingly difficult to continue “By human standards maybe is really nothing but it's something important to me and I'm proud of it, just… I'd like you to support me a little in this, to stop pointing at me and see that it's not so bad...""

""Honey..."" The lines of disgust and anger on his face softened a little. ""Wouldn't you prefer something else?""

""YOU ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE; DID YOU KNOW THAT?""

""If I allow this, then you'll want to bring that thing into the house, then you'll want to bring more and one day when everyone gets eaten you won't be responsible for the consequences, I know you..."" I felt like a little girl again being lectured by my mother, my teachers and adults who never in their lives did what they preached, something I always hated ""I think you've already experienced what one of those predators can do to you or do I need to remind you?""

She didn't need to, I still have nightmares about it and an occasional itch on my arm, right where I got bitten, served as a constant reminder of that horrible moment, but I try to see it as just a bad experience, not all of them are bad but, not all of them are good either and I guess that's okay...

""I just wanted to show you what I'd learned and invite you to meet where I work, we're having a program end event soon and they said we could invite family and friends. Your invitation will go along with the shipment of conditioner you asked for... Apparently there are things you are willing to accept from predators and their planet..."" My body felt heavy as if I was dragging a large rock tied to my tail and continuing to argue only seemed to add more weight, a part of me wanted to tell her that the conditioner she'd liked so much was used for creatures like Ozzy but honestly I was too exhausted for another round against mom.

""Honey, I don't think that...""

""You're not obliged to come, okay? But the invitation is there.""

""Lyra, please… I need you to know that I love you, that's why I want to protect you, even if it's from yourself...""

""... Goodbye mom...""

""Please get rid of that dog…""

…

I ended the call before she finished, I couldn't hear another word. I wanted to hate her, to scream everything I thought and drag her out of her bubble but... I guess I can't blame her for everything, after all, we were taught to be that way, we were told that was the only way...

I walked out to the backyard and there was Ozzy, sitting right in front of the door waiting for his chance to sneak inside the house, ready for some new mischief that for some reason I kept allowing, would he really be capable of attacking me one day?

Not all of them are bad, but not all of them are good… I think I know which side Ozzy is, but there are days when that little doubt seeps into my head.

I guess I won't have to worry about that in the future. I hated to admit it but out of all the nonsense Mom said, something was true, she and probably the everyone in Saltmountains won't let me step a paw inside the town if Ozzy goes with me... I tried not to think about it but every day that passed it was more a reality... maybe, maybe I could...

""WE'RE LATE!"" I exclaimed when I noticed the time. Apparently I had spent more time than planned arguing with Mom; I have to hurry up or another sermon is all that awaits me.

""Get ready too, you're coming with me today,"" I said to Ozzy as I served his food. ""Today is training day"" I said, and as if he understood my words, he began to devour his food with a greed that was quite predatory for my taste.

\---

""Damn, your relationship with your mom is really fucked up"" Marcus said as he drove the vehicle. ""My mom didn´t let me bring animals home either"" he said, laughing.

""I need you to help me know what to answer, not to laugh at my situation"" I said giving her a small flick of my tail in response ""You are always cruel when you answer Maria, what do you recommend?"" I said and Maria immediately gave me one of her murderous looks, that is just what  I need but in the form of words, although almost instantly it changed to a more thoughtful expression.

""I guess if you didn't have those kinds of arguments with your parents then they wouldn't really be your parents...."" Maria said and I couldn't do anything but tilt my head and lower my ears in confusion.

""In my experience, conflicts with your parents about some things are inevitable and is impossible to win the argument, the best thing you can do is to accept it and even listen them from time to time, sometimes what they tell you can be really useful"" she added.

…

""...That's not useful..."" I said and Maria just rolled her eyes and went back to her business.

Kajim was busy with Ozzy, keeping him calm during the trip so I preferred not to break the peace we were both enjoying.

""Maybe... I just need to show her something so amazing that she can't say anything more than 'sorry honey, you were right' and has no choice but to accept it"" I pulled out my pad searching through the different trick videos I wanted to teach to Ozzy ""Which of these do you think I could get that effect on her? The two-legged walk or the backflip?"" I showed Marcus the different options but he put the device away to continue driving.

""I don't think that's going to convince her""

""So how did you convince your parents?""

""Well... I never did it actually, my mom always said it was unhygienic, but there was a stray dog that always visited me, he belonged to everyone and at the same time to no one, always accompanied me when I went out in the neighborhood but never let me put him a collar"" he said without taking his eyes off the road.

""A dog free on the streets of Saltmountains ... Nope, that doesn’t work for me either..."" My spirits were getting lower and lower. ""Wait, how is that I've never seen it?""

""Like I said, he never belonged to anyone. Sometimes he was there and sometimes he wasn't. And the day we all evacuated... we couldn´t find him anywhere"" He said with a sigh ""We looked for him in shelters in Venlil Prime and on earth, we asked everyone we knew but we never hear of him again. The last I heard from Rocky was that the night before everything happened, I sneaked him a bowl of Mom's stew and that was it""

""I... I'm sorry... I shouldn't have asked..."" A tight lump formed in my throat, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the fate of the poor animal, predator or not he was a friend of my friend.

""It's okay... He lived a good life, untamed to the end"" Marcus forced a smile on his face ""It's funny that a venlil could have a dog but I couldn't"" he added although I didn't know how to respond to that.

...

""Hey, how about you stay on earth? No one will bother you here"" Marcus said, abruptly changing the subject. ""You could ask for a permanent job on the farm, I'm sure the boss would accept"" He turned to look at me with a smile, waiting for my answer.

""...uh... Keep your eyes on the road!"" I said pushing his face back towards the windshield with my tail, that was not a question I was ready for and even less so with him staring at me ""We're almost there"" in the distance the silhouette of the farm grew larger and more detailed.

“I better get Ozzy ready for the pointless checkup the exterminators always insist to do…”

""Hey Lyra... Did you do something wrong?"" Maria said joining the conversation.

""N-Nothing... I guess"" A little nervous I did a quick mental recap of anything that could be a reason for a scolding and I think I'm pretty good.""Why?"" I asked already knowing the answer.

""Because it seems that the supervisor who is always with the boss will do your check up today."" Maria pointed at the only person at the farm entrance, pacing back and forth with a rather stern expression.

""What did you do, Ly?"" The joy in Marcus's voice had disappeared.

""I DIDN'T NOTHING! Why do they always point at me?"" Even though I knew I hadn't done anything wrong I couldn't help but want to hide and pull my ears down to avoid being seen.

My fears only increased when I felt the vehicle stop in front of the main entrance and I heard the supervisor's voice.

""You're a friend of Miss Lyra's, right? Did you know what time... Oh... Miss Lyra! Just at the face I wanted to see"" I opened my eyes and there he was, with his face pressed against the car window making me shudder. ""Oh, and your prickly friend too, excellent"" He added.

My heart was beating so fast that I felt like I was going to have a heart attack at any moment. It's never a good thing when your boss or your boss's boss is looking for you, even if it's not for a scolding or punishment, never is good.

""I appreciate you offering to take over the guided tours today but I don't think that will be possible, Ozzy came with me today"" I said before even thinking about the consequences of contradicting a superior causing my tail to wrap around one of my legs when I realized it ""B-But I'll be happy to help you another time""

""That's the thing, I want you and Ozzy give the tour today"" Supervisor Maaro said with a big look of joy on his face. ""I'm trying to promote an image of unity in my reports and pictures of you two working together would do wonders, plus Martin's not today so I doubt he'll be able to help you with your dog's training.""

""I don't think the boss will like it... Wait, he won't be in today either?""

""I'm Martin's associate so don't worry, you could say I have the authority to decide a few things while he's away. Plus, I'm sure he'll love it, you just have to lead a couple of tours, answer questions and show them the tricks you do with Ozzy, it's no big deal"" said the supervisor ""I contacted a group of students who will be coming and they are more than happy to live an extreme experience""

""Extreme experience? This?"" Maria interrupted with her typical raised eyebrow.

""Many still consider seeing a human yawn as a near-death experience, of course it is an extreme experience to tour with a dog"" I guess he has a point.

""If it were at least several dogs I could consider it an experience of some kind"" Maria added and Maaro responded making several quick notes on his pad and muttering something about bringing the boss's dogs next time ""Well, I think as a first test one will be more than enough...""

""So, what do you say?"" The supervisor said placing both tentacles on my shoulders ""I've seen your progress and I can't think of anyone more capable for this""

""Ly... I don't think you should do that..."" Marcus said from my periphery.

""W-Well... If it's just that, I don't think it's a big deal..."" If Mom shows her a picture of me and Ozzy with a bunch of other species, I'll leave her speechless.

""Excellent, your human partner can assist you in whatever you need"" the supervisor pointed at Marcus who had a slightly uncomfortable expression, with him around this plan should be fail-safe.

""And as for you my prickly friend, I have a special job for you too"" he said to Kajim who had been distracted for a while playing with Ozzy ""I liked the way you handled the exterm ...""

""SECURITY PERSONNEL"" Kajim said, much more annoyed than he would have expected.

""...I liked the way you handled the security personnel the other day, also, not everyone understands the scribbles Martin puts on his clipboard but you did, I’m impressed"" Maaro joked although no one seemed to get the joke ""...The thing is, Martin is busy today, I invited another committee member to come and Martin went to greet them, I'll be joining them later too and I don't want Leader Zep or the other exter... the rest of the security personnel see this as a void to fill. So what do you say? Just like you did last time""

""You want me to be the boss?"" Kajim said.

""Just  today… I can't think of anyone better for this responsibility""

Without saying a word Kajim ran off into the farm leaving us all behind in confusion.

""W-What... what is he doing?"" the supervisor asked, to which we only responded with a shrug of our shoulders ""Where are you going?!"" He shouted at the Gojid who was running as fast as he could into the farm.

""If I'm going to be the boss, I need a few things first!"" He shouts from across the parking lot before kicking open the door to the boss's office.

“Then I’ll take that as a yes…” The supervisor said, crossing it out on his pad.

""Is he really the best choice to manage the place?"" Maria approached the supervisor with all her doubts written on her face.

""Actually, he's the only one. I asked others and no one wants to deal with extermina…""

""SECURITY PERSONNEL"" a shout echoed from across the parking lot, for the distance the image was blurry but I could almost see the furious expression Kajim made every time he heard that name, how did he even  hear that?

""Yeah... What your friend said... I offered the roll to other non-humans and no one seems to be interested"" Maaro said, briefly showing a list of crossed-out names. ""But to be honest, the little one didn't it bad the last other time and Martin didn't object to the idea so I guess it'll be okay.""

""If you say so..."" Maria replied, still in a rather skeptical tone.

""I understand your concern, in fact it wouldn't hurt to have someone to support him. I admire the little one's energy but from what I've seen he can be a little... Overly passionate at times, someone to keep that energy focused would be a great help... tell me, would you be interested in helping me with that?"" Maaro extended his tentacle towards her.

…

""If it keeps me from having to stand in the hot sun all day, why not?"" Maria took the tentacle and gave it a good squeeze judging by the supervisor's face.

""Excellent, then I'll come to pick you up when the students came Miss Lyra, meanwhile you can continue with your normal activities"" the supervisor bowed politely and headed to his own cart ""This will look great on my report"" he said to himself.

""Are you sure it was a good idea Maria?"" Marcus asked as we all entered in the vehicle again ""Basically you'll have to make sure Kajim doesn't get into fights with the exterm ... With you know who, all day long""

...

""Mr. Supervisor, could you please reconsider...""

""Sorry, too many places to go, too many things to do, bye"" the supervisor stepped on the accelerator of his cart and drove off as fast as the small engine allowed him ""See you later Miss Lyra!""

""Well... Then we'll be tour guides today..."" Marcus said.

""Roaming around the farm, seeing things, showing the tourists what Ozzy and I can do... It'll be easy"" I relaxed a little as the vehicle moved smoothly over the cobblestone of the parking lot.

""You know the history of the place, right?"" Marcus said.

“Also, each trip between visiting the animals and collecting fruit lasts at least 3 continuous hours, I hope you are prepared for that” Maria added.

...

I think I didn´t consider that...

""I hope the stars help you..."" Marcus said, mocking me.

1ioivoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1ioivoi/we_need_to_be_louder_about_organizingonline_and/,We need to be LOUDER about organizing—online AND in real life.,"I saw a post earlier where someone was shocked that their local Democratic Party didn’t know about protests being organized and shared in this sub. The comments turned into a debate: Should people be paying more attention? Should organizers be doing more to spread the word?

Let me be blunt: If people don’t know about a protest, that’s on us as organizers—not on them.

I’m closer to 50 than 20, and I can tell you firsthand that a massive number of people WANT to show up—but they don’t even know these events are happening. Not because they don’t care. Not because they aren’t engaged. But because they’re not living on Reddit and Twitter the way many assume.

These are the people who have jobs that don’t allow them to take off at a moment’s notice. Parents who need to arrange childcare. Older activists who are motivated as hell but don’t have time to sift through endless social media posts to find details. They would show up if we reached them.

If we want real numbers at protests, we need to stop shouting into the same internet echo chamber and start meeting people where they are.

We need to do in-person outreach:
•Put up flyers. Coffee shops, libraries, grocery stores, laundromats—anywhere with a bulletin board.
•Table at local events. Farmers markets, street fairs, festivals—be visible, talk to people, and hand out info.
•Talk about protests in public. If people overhear a conversation about activism, they might ask how to get involved.
•Coordinate with local progressive groups. If Democratic groups and community organizations aren’t in the loop, get them in the loop.

AND we need to do online outreach beyond social media, because not everybody uses Facebook and discord and Instagram, and even if they do their algorithms may hide stuff:
•Create a public protest calendar. Something simple that people can check without scrolling through posts.
•Set up an email or text alert system. Many people don’t follow social media constantly but do check their texts and email.
•Use Facebook Groups & Nextdoor. Many non-chronically-online folks use these way more than Twitter or Discord.
•Encourage cross-promotion. Stop letting every activist group operate in a silo—share events, collaborate, and build networks.

We are not at the underground resistance stage.

Or at least, most of us aren’t. Certainly not with something like a public protest. Right now, the problem isn’t secrecy—it’s visibility. People can’t show up for something they don’t know exists.

I’m organizing locally, and it frustrates the hell out of me how many dedicated, passionate volunteers have zero idea these protests are even happening. Not because they aren’t trying to find out, but because the people who need them there aren’t actually reaching them.

If the goal is mass mobilization, we need to act like it.

If you’re already organizing—how are you spreading the word beyond the internet?
If you want to help—what’s stopping you?

We need to start thinking bigger, louder, and smarter. Otherwise, we’re just organizing in circles.",2,1739452831.0,50501,1,1.0,False

1ioitv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyExpat/comments/1ioitv6/moving_to_sicily/,Moving to Sicily,"Ciao!

I wanted to ask for some advice and share a bit about my journey of moving to Sicily. Apologies in advance – this post gets really long, but I feel that these details are important. Who knows – maybe this post will lead me to an amazing opportunity! :)  
Moving to another country alone can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming, and I’d love to hear different perspectives, insights, and experiences from people going through the same thing.

About a year ago, I did a marketing internship in a software company in Sicily through the Erasmus+ program. Before that, I had already traveled to Sicily once, and that experience was the reason I chose Sicily for internship destination. I loved everything so much that I ended up doing a second internship in the same company later that year, focusing again on marketing + sales.

Then I understood that I want to move to Sicily. I try to take at least one step every day towards this goal, but sometimes I hit a “stuck” moment. That’s why I’m writing this post.

# Job opportunities in marketing and tech

The biggest and most important question for me right now is finding a job. I studied to be a marketing specialist, and I've also started designing websites on WordPress. I know that I need to finalize my portfolio to showcase my work, and I’m actively working on that.  
For job searching, I use platforms like it.Indeed, LinkedIn, and I search in Italian for software development companies and marketing agencies to find opportunities that might not be listed on job platforms. I also check if companies outside of Sicily offer remote positions.

Marketing and website(+software) development industry is really fascinating to me. Since I’m still at the beginning of my career, I’m also totally open for internship opportunities, as I understand that gaining experience is essential.

So – if anyone reading this works in a marketing agency, tech company, or startup that might need something regarding to marketing, I would love to hear from you!

# Learning Italian

Since moving to Sicily is my main goal, I need to do something for it every day and this means prioritizing language learning. Here are some of the resources I use:

Duolingo & Coffee Break Italian (Spotify)  
Music & YouTube channels (Marketing Espresso, lifestyle vloggers)  
The website [italiano-bello.com](http://italiano-bello.com)  
My own file for industry-specific vocabulary (marketing terms, phrases, and exercises)  
Even the most little things are important for me too, writing things down, reading them, recognizing words and sentences while listening to music and so on, everything matters to learn!

If anyone has more fun or effective ways to learn Italian – please let me know!

# Renting an apartment with a dog

I would also love to hear about your experiences with renting apartments in Sicily:  
What is the usual deposit requirement (1-2 months' rent upfront)?  
Are utilities fixed in the contract, or do they vary monthly?  
How do landlords typically feel about pets? (I have a dog, but most listings for example on Idealista don’t specify if pets are allowed.)

Luckily I have friends who can help me read and translate contracts, so I won’t sign anything without fully understanding the terms. I'm so thankful for that, but of course any extra tips are welcome!

# Work permits and hiring process

I’m from Estonia and I’m curious – do companies find it difficult to hire someone from another EU country? Would love to hear from anyone who has experience with this!

# Final thoughts!!

I can't even describe with words how big my desire is to move, and I try to do at least something every day to bring myself closer to this goal. This is also why this post is so long and can have recurring thoughts. But at this stage, I feel that hearing about other people’s experiences and getting answers to some of my questions would help a lot.

If you work in marketing, social media, or if you are part of a tech company or startup, or if you even know anyone else in this industry, I’d love to connect! It would be amazing to meet people from my industry who are already living in Sicily. I truly believe asking for help in this post can lead me to cool ideas and people!

Feel free to share anything that could help – job search platforms, useful resources, or just general life advice about moving to Sicily.

For privacy reasons, I prefer to share more personal information via DM.

Grazie! I can’t wait to read your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions. Sorry for the long post, if I can post the questions in the comments so they are better to answer, please let me know!",3,1739452666.0,ItalyExpat,4,0.8,False

The beguilingly haunted memories started to peek – it was what from I verily ran apart like a freak…  
She used to call my name frequently – no my full name, to switch on the fan. I was astonished and annoyed by her calling me, every time, out of all for such a triviality. Callow me, wondered frivolously, that I shouldn’t do something because I wasn’t their servant. Yes, I used to sit beside the switch box, but even if I was away… but why, when it was about her calling, I couldn’t do anything but rehearse whatever she had to nurse. I was annoyed; if someone else, any lass, pretty or petite, called my name for that, except her… as if now I wanted her to say my name to switch on the fan.

‘\[My full name\] … Can you switch on the fan?’ I used to do it without a question, though I still wasn’t sure what it was for. She used to take a minimum of 2 seconds after calling my name as if she used to wonder what to say or not. She was bold, pretty smart, and not particularly beautiful, they said; at least my sister used to call her names (I used to be ashamed), but there was something to her that aroused me in a way no one ever did. It was 7th grade, and soon she became the reason for me coming to school… I used to play cricket, and even though I wouldn’t check who was looking at me at the time, I was hoping she was catching some glances. Two girls came to shake my hand, not that I wanted to, and I was seeing her checking it as if she was annoyed. Her frequencies increased; now I was in deep spirit – as if I now realised I was in something I always anathematized – devotion. She sang happy birthday for me, though other girls did. I, with my reserved nature, felt astoundingly intrigued by her.  
  
I came to school on the date I still celebrate intrinsically; I sat, and I know I wouldn’t check their faces. I still knew someone was wearing a dress that was not in uniform. I wished it was her – and yes, it was her… It was her birthday, and when I saw her, it was when I truly believed she was the serenity that I wanted to sink in this bliss of relish. However, all I said was thanks, even though her clothes touched mine, igniting a spark in my heart.

‘\[My full name\] … can you switch on the fan?’ Everyone was there; class was going on, the season of winter, yet out of oblivion she called my name without any furnace to switch on the fan… I saw her face, her eyes, that beauty truly propelled… What did I even do… nothing but mundane… Yes, I was always reticent and bashful… coward  
  
A year and a half passed away; I didn’t forget her, though, but we never talked during that period. 14 December it was when I learnt I would see her again; I wasn’t sure how it would turn out, but I was fervently nervous at all. I went to the classroom, seeing no juveniles but only demoiselles, as I scrolled. I saw her, but I was crushed upon the idea of shyness; I couldn’t even look at her, and as if my feelings were fading away—at least I told myself to run away from her. But soon she came to, no, I did,

and then she came again and talked to me. Again, that sweet voice, as if she was telling me to talk. I felt nice, and my feelings returned again, but again I never called her name. I and a cohort were alone; she came with her friend and asked, ‘Can you go outside?’ As if she didn’t want me to go but wanted me to stay with her alone… but I went away… and that day, 16th December, we could have been consummated if I had not been an unsophisticated coward… but I still cherished that day.  
  
Next grade came, she again approached me. We used to play together, and she was on my team, but I couldn’t say. Waiting for the moment, which was never there, became my nightmare. I wrote a letter that I believe (now) was phenomenal, but I tore it away thinking I would make a laugh… of myself, who deserved to be mocked.  
  
Soon, we became distant; oh, was there ever a connection that was not transient? She saw no one of me, and I of her, as if we were never truly for each other. I used to wonder what happened because if there was nothing, then why did she use to call me so often? I became sick, fell ill, and when I came back, I knew I was wrong. She had a leman, a partner all along, and it was not me. I knew with the glance the fellow was hers… where did it go wrong, I wondered. Well, it was incorrect from the start, and it pondered me with the blast. Why did she choose him who just approached her suddenly? I couldn’t say he was an ugly, grotesque, though everyone did. Those eyes, which used to provide nourishment and flourishment, were now felt sickly scorned, and I couldn’t do anything but mourn… The person who I wanted to see me being her hero, and now she doesn’t like me, did she ever like me? I used to seek no one but her, and she chose someone as if I was a scar. I, now, wanted her not to love me back but to know whether she ever loved me or not – I was tormented by the thought of revealing my feelings for her, not to get closer but to get closure… I saw her face; we were alone there, as if she wanted to tell me she was ashamed, but I did was run – which I always did from the only person I ever loved…  
  
I wrote letters, but I tore them away; all I wanted was to know if she ever loved me or not… but was it worth it, I thought. Even if she did, yet she still chose someone who I was not… if this love was any equal? There’s no veracity to it, but my heart betrayed me, saying I was above her because I was better than her. In reality, I was the worst and a degenerate coward. But all I wanted to know was if she ever loved me or not…  
  
2 years passed away; I woke up one night; no popsy truly affected me other than her sight! She was what I wanted; she was what I dreamt of. I became better, yet I was crestfallen, sad, and lugubriously mad because my life was incomplete, thinking about the only greet, but I know I was a freak. I knew I couldn’t be with anyone else other than her, but I also just wanted to know whether she loved me or not. I didn’t want her but her answer, because I was hoping for not closer but closure. If she says no – god I win; I will not be the coward anymore; I will get the closure I ever wished for.  
However, if she says yes, then I will cry and ask her what went pretty wrong. For all I know, I just wanted an answer.  
  


  
  
Waiting for the time, I thought I would build myself up to the shore, so that I could have the audacity to address the message I always wished to press. All I did was focus on myself, but my mind was fixated on her… I knew someone else, probably more than one, but someone else liked me, but all I did was run because I only wanted one – and not even one, but the answer, a validation. Years passed away, and I knew I wanted to know, but I believed I should get a job; I ignored all, for something I never had at all… ‘Should I message her now?’ But where is she? I never knew; her whereabouts were undivulged for all I skewed. Still, I was chasing her – no, the answer, a one, that was validation. I was older, but I knew I would only want her.  
  
Another two years passed; I was now superfluous, and all I should have done was to seek her. ‘Is this enough? Is this the time? Maybe I should do more so that she will see that I have flowed and not flawed.’ I was besotted by the idea of not even reconciliation but the answer, a one, validation. Years passed away; I was now blossomed. I waited and waited to become something I was never… ‘Is this time?’ All I could think was that I needed an answer, one validation.  
  
Now, I had the allure, wealth, and a transcendent view because I finally decided to see her and tell her, not to be mine but to get the answer I always mined, to know whether she loved or not, not to get closer but closure because I hoped she would say no, so that I could be free in glee, and that was all her answer, one, validation.

I knew where she lived; I paid to find her, and I knew I was going to her. I went; I knew she would come at the coffee shop, as the men said she often did. I sat there, hoping she would, and we would meet after too long. Now I wasn’t hoping for the answer but reconciliation, as if we could finally be together, that we could formulate this consummate caress. I was reading a book there, though I could read the words conjointly adjourned her…

She came but not alone, her baby, husband, and her allure. I didn’t know she was married; I didn’t know she birthed a baby. They looked cherished, delighted; the look at her face propagated wallowing serenity that I always wanted to peruse incessantly.  
I didn’t say anything; I descried them from far away. Suddenly, I stood up and ran and ran and ran… how I wanted her to be with me, how now I again ran without even getting the answer, one, validation that I always endeared. I ran and ran…  
  
And here I am, all by myself, lost in the thoughts. Seeing her blissful made me chuckle and melancholily numb. I ran away; I wanted to go back, but I knew she was beauteously plausible without me; I couldn’t bear to obstruct her happiness. I am not that monstrous.  
  
“I knew she would never be on my side; we would not have our hands together for all I might. She was all my imagination; she was never mine. We could have been one, but I knew I would never know if she loved me; I will never get that one validation.""

  
Note: Lol, I am 18 (turned recently) but the story that I have formulated is all true except for the part where we grow up and she's married. It's just that this unreliable, deeply virulent narrator could have been me if I couldn't have moved on. ",2,1739452127.0,IndianTeenagers,6,1.0,False

1ioin2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ioin2b/need_some_advice/,Need some advice,"So a little back story: 

I started dating this woman. We talked every day for about 3-4 weeks, went out on a date 4 times. I really liked her and during that time I know she felt the same, she told me as much. Then on our 4th date we were driving to this restaurant for a nice sit down dinner. On the way she ended up having a full blown seizure in my car. By the time I pulled over she was done and slumped over in my passenger seat. Once pulled over I try to do everything I can to make sure she’s all right. Talking to her, rub her arm, etc. even opening my glove box to get a napkin and wipe the foam from her mouth and chin. As she came too I started asking her questions to make sure she was good. I could tell she was a bit foggy. I got her out of my car and we walked down the street a little so I could get her moving and some fresh air. Asked her if she was okay and if I should take her to the hospital down the street or just go home and rest. She insisted she was okay and didn’t need or want to go. So we just went to the restaurant and continued with our date. Afterwards we go back to her place and I stay the night. The next morning we have a cup of coffee together, watch a little tv, and talk. I suggest I come back in a couple days and this time I cook her dinner, she agreed. Then she ends up having to cancel because she had to take her kids (ex had to go oot). So I suggested maybe that Saturday instead and she agreed, then we kiss goodbye and I leave. 

Here’s where I’m lost. We texted for the next couple of days then all of a sudden the next day there’s zero contact. She just ghosts. No biggie I thought, maybe she got busy. The next day same thing. Now I start to worry that she isn’t okay. Maybe she had another seizure and it was worse this time. I’m messaging her every way I can just to make sure she’s okay, with again no response. The third day same thing, although by the evening time I knew she was okay because I saw something on her social media that confirmed for me. After a sigh of relief she was okay. I decided to text her all call her out for it. Telling her that it was a pretty shitty and fucked up thing to do especially after what happened on our last date, and how I was genuinely really concerned about her. Not knowing if I’d get a response or not I told her it’s possible this may be my last message too and to take care of herself and wished her the best. She then responds with an apology about doing that and said how sweet I am and that I didn’t deserve it, and how she’s been dealing with some things and it’s been a lot. She said I was a really good guy and she wished me the best. A few hours later I respond to that with understanding and empathy but reaffirm that ghosting is not okay. At the very least send a response that you’re okay and you’ll reach out in a few days. How I don’t really want to give up on building something between us, but if what she did was any indication of how she’d handle things in the future then it’s best we end things now and move on. If she felt the same I was willing to still come over Saturday and cook her dinner and we can talk. I planned to talk about us and moving forward and taking things more seriously. She didn’t respond. Being the nice guy I am, I still decided to text and wish her a happy birthday the following week, she said thank you and I left it at that. 

Now before all this went down I decided to order her a preserved black rose for her birthday/Valentine’s Day and have it sent to her place since I wouldn’t have seen her on either day (she has the kids). But Saturday after Valentine’s Day she doesn’t, so I had reservations at this nicer steakhouse that my friend works at for us to celebrate. Well since all this went down I’ve since contacted my friend and had him cancel the reservation, but I completely forgot about the gift I was having delivered to her place. I just remembered about it yesterday night and still have a window to cancel that too. 

I guess my question is, should I cancel it or just let it go? There was also a personal note in there wishing her a happy birthday and Valentine’s Day and how I’m looking forward to seeing her for our dinner. Again, I did like her a lot and still think about her daily. Is there still any hope that things could work out if we’re able to just sit and talk? Or should I just forget about her all together and move on? I already have a date planned with someone else this Sunday. But a big part of me still wishes it was her. What should I do? What would you?

I can add more context if and when needed. Any advice would be appreciated.

1ioily9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1ioily9/best_coffee_maker_aeropress_original_review_is/,Best coffee maker AeroPress Original review: Is this your ultimate brewing tool?,"I’ve been using the AeroPress Original coffee maker for a few months now, and I can confidently say it’s become a staple in my morning routine. As someone who’s tried various brewing methods over the years—ranging from bulky espresso machines to pour-overs—I was curious about how this compact, manual coffee maker would hold up against the competition. Spoiler alert: It’s surprisingly impressive, though not without its quirks.

The first thing I noticed about the AeroPress Original is its lightweight, durable plastic build. It’s portable enough to toss in a backpack for work trips or camping adventures. On a recent road trip, I packed it along with some pre-ground coffee and paper filters, and it proved to be a lifesaver for avoiding those dreadful gas station brews. The entire setup is intuitive to use, even for someone who might be new to coffee brewing.

Brewing with the AeroPress is straightforward. It combines pressure and micro-filtration to produce a smooth, grit-free coffee, which is a significant improvement over the French press method. I experimented with different grind levels and water temperatures to see how versatile it could be. Using finely ground coffee produced a surprisingly rich and full-bodied cup, free of the bitterness I’ve often encountered with other methods. I even managed to whip up a passable espresso-style shot, though it’s not quite the same as what you’d get from a high-pressure espresso machine. Still, for the price and portability, I’m not complaining.

[Check AeroPress Original price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-coffee-maker-aeropress-aeropress-original-review-b0047biwsk/)

The included paper filters are easy to use and clean up. After brewing, I simply pop the coffee puck and filter into the trash with a quick push of the plunger. Rinsing the components takes seconds, making it ideal for busy mornings or when you’re on the go. I’ve even tried reusing the filters a few times, and to my surprise, there wasn’t a noticeable difference in taste.

However, it’s not all sunshine and smooth coffee. I did find the plunger requires a bit of muscle, especially when trying to extract every last drop of coffee. If you’re someone with limited hand strength, this might be a minor annoyance. Additionally, the small brewing capacity means it’s best suited for solo coffee drinkers or those who don’t mind brewing multiple rounds for a crowd.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight, perfect for travel or small kitchens.
* Produces a smooth, rich, and grit-free coffee.
* Quick and easy cleanup with minimal effort.
* Versatile brewing options, from regular coffee to espresso-style shots.
* Durable and shatterproof build.

**Cons**

* Limited capacity, not ideal for brewing for multiple people at once.
* Requires some physical effort to press the plunger.
* The plastic construction, while durable, might not appeal to those who prefer stainless steel or glass.

**Comparison to Competitors**

The AeroPress stands out when compared to similar budget-friendly coffee makers. For instance, standard French presses often leave sediment in the cup, which the AeroPress effectively eliminates with its micro-filtration. Additionally, while pour-over methods like the Hario V60 produce excellent coffee, they require more skill and patience to perfect. The AeroPress, on the other hand, feels forgiving for beginners while still allowing experienced brewers to experiment.

That said, for those who prioritize authentic espresso with rich crema, a semi-automatic espresso machine like the De’Longhi Dedica offers better results but at a higher cost and larger footprint. On the portability front, few rivals can match the AeroPress—though manual espresso makers like the Wacaco Nanopresso come close in terms of compactness and usability.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The AeroPress Original hits a sweet spot for value. It’s affordable compared to electric coffee makers and offers an excellent balance of quality and versatility for the price. Considering its durability and the fact that replacement filters are inexpensive, it’s a solid long-term investment for coffee lovers. While it might not replace a high-end espresso machine or cater to large households, it’s a fantastic choice for solo drinkers, travelers, and those who want a fuss-free brewing experience.

For anyone debating whether this is the right choice, I’d say the AeroPress is hard to beat for its portability and ease of use. If you’re tired of inconsistent coffee from hotel machines or simply want a better cup at home without breaking the bank, it’s definitely worth considering.

So, there’s this 3D designer who sits at the desk in front of me. She’s 28, I’m 27.

She’s incredibly attractive, kind, and intelligent—has that sharp, sophisticated look. She’s also very easygoing and gets along well with everyone in our small studio (six employees in total). She chats easily with people, but despite that, I feel like I don’t really know her on a deeper level.

From our small conversations, I know she’s the eldest grandchild, has two younger brothers, and is working on a personal project (a coffee shop). I also know her political views, and that she was previously engaged, but it didn’t work out. That’s all I know on that topic.

The Challenges:

1. Is she actually interested?

As friendly as she is, she seems like a total badass—straightforward and confident. Since she’s naturally nice with everyone, I can’t tell if we’re actually building a personal bond or if she’s just being friendly.

2. Religion and Society

This is Saudi Arabia, so things are complicated. I have no idea how religious she is or whether she’d be open to a relationship before marriage. Some women prefer a guy to go straight to their father and propose, which is common here. Personally, I wouldn’t mind doing that since marriage is already in my plans. But I fear rejection.

There’s also the fact that we’re from different sects—she’s Sunni, I’m Shia. That can be a major issue for some families, and I have no clue how hers would feel about it. Plus, she’s a year older, and I don’t know if that would be a dealbreaker for her.

All of this makes me hesitant about asking her for marriage outright.

3. The Workplace Factor

We work together, and honestly, I love working with her. It keeps me motivated—I’m always on time, no absences, fully engaged. But if I make a move and she rejects me, things could get really awkward. Seeing her every day might become uncomfortable, and I don’t want to jeopardize my work environment.

So, what should my next step be?

Should I try to build a deeper connection first? Should I straight-up ask about her views on marriage? Or should I just let it go?",2,1739451794.0,Crushes,3,1.0,False

The goal is to make self-care enjoyable, relaxing, and easy to incorporate into your day without adding unnecessary stress. Here are **five tips for creating a self-care routine that feels natural and fulfilling**.

# 1. Keep It Simple and Flexible

Self-care shouldn’t be complicated. Start with small, simple activities that you genuinely enjoy. Whether it’s reading for 10 minutes, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music, choose activities that feel effortless and restorative. Keeping your routine flexible will allow you to adjust it to fit your day rather than feeling pressured to follow a rigid schedule.

# 2. Focus on Quality Over Quantity

Rather than overwhelming yourself with a long list of self-care activities, focus on doing one or two things that make you feel truly rejuvenated. This could be a short walk outside, a quick meditation session, or practicing deep breathing for five minutes. By prioritizing quality over quantity, you’ll get more benefit from the activities you enjoy without feeling like you’re “checking off” tasks.

# 3. Incorporate Self-Care Into Daily Routines

Integrate self-care into your regular routines so it doesn’t feel like a separate, added responsibility. You can turn activities like morning coffee, a shower, or even a stretch after work into mindful self-care moments. This makes self-care feel more like a natural part of your day, rather than something extra to manage.

# 4. Choose Activities That Energize, Not Drain You

The goal of self-care is to recharge, not add stress. If you feel drained by an activity (e.g., intense workouts or long hours of reading), consider something more relaxing or rejuvenating. A short [**micro-workout**](https://minutemicros.com/shop/) might help boost your energy and mood without leaving you exhausted, while also improving overall health. Choose activities that leave you feeling refreshed and energized.

# 5. Practice Self-Compassion

Self-care is about taking care of yourself without guilt. If you miss a day or your routine doesn’t go as planned, don’t be hard on yourself. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a friend. The goal is to feel better, not to add more pressure.

By creating a self-care routine that feels light and fulfilling, you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and rejuvenation without the stress of adding another task to your list. Combine simple self-care practices with effective, quick [**micro-workouts**](https://minutemicros.com/shop/) to support both your physical and mental well-being in a way that feels natural and enjoyable.

**1st of Septober, 5500**

After a few minutes, I found myself all but surrounded by men and women, some armed while others weren’t. As far as I could gather, their tech level appeared to be a few steps above tribal but still nowhere near industrial.

They had a considerable caravan of at least eight people, with four massive muffalo serving as their beasts of burden. 

As we stood there, eyeing each other up and down, one woman stepped away from the group and approached me, a considerably muscular hulk of a woman with a rather broad brow. A stiff breeze and a few more seconds pass as the woman finally offers a smile. “Seeing as you haven’t attacked us yet, you are either very intelligent or are cut from a more amicable cloth than most, both of which are a rarity in these parts.”

“You could say I’m a bit of both.” I say, returning the smile as I look up at the woman. “Mind if I ask what you are doing in these parts?” 

The woman smirked a little as she stroked her chin before speaking up. “Only if you allow me to ask the same in return.” She said and continued after I nodded. “My name is Quintina, and we’re a merchant caravan from Lindum 2 heading west to do some business.” She explained, gesturing at herself with one hand before gesturing to me with a quirked brow. 

I couldn’t help but smile as I met her gaze. “My name is Ezekiel, I uh… Crashlanded here a few weeks ago and now I’m just doing my best to get by.” With that, I glanced over towards my mountainside shack, Quintina doing the same before we looked back at each other.

“Well, you certainly chose a great place to crash, Ezekiel.” Quintinas said with grim amusement as she made a show of looking around the frozen expanse around us. “This place is known as the Balrarcer Expanse and is a full-blown cesspit for all the major pirates, junkers, bandits, and savage tribal factions on this planet.” She explained, earning a few nods and grunts of agreement from her fellow caravaners who casually checked their weapons. “And you just happened to be right in the middle of it all, along the only real, safe unmarked path after crossing the Ontolior Mountains.” 

“That’s… Good to know.” I said with a sigh as I shook my head. I couldn’t blame Sagittarius for any of this since it's not like he could have possibly predicted that information. “Is there anything else I should be aware of?”

Quintinas looked thoughtful before tilting her head after a moment. “Well, there have been reports of a massive wild bug infestation somewhere west of here; I’d say they’re about four days travel if I had to put a number to it.” She offered before shrugging. “But I wouldn’t worry about that too much, considering the cold.” 

The mere mention of the bug infestation sent a shiver down my spine. Memories of their screeches and the acrid smell of burnt flesh and plastic still haunted me. I managed to stammer a response before my silence became too noticeable: “I-I see… Thanks for the warning.” 

Whether Quintinas noticed my reaction or even cared about it, I couldn’t tell. Instead, she pushed on, a confident smile on her lips as she patted one of the muffalo in her caravan. “Well, if you’re going to be sticking around these parts you should do your best to be well supplied.” She stated before looking me over. “So, how about you take a look at our wares and see if anything catches your eye.”

I shook off the memories and ran my fingers through my hair to help myself refocus on the moment. “Yeah, sure… Do uh… People use silver as the base currency on this planet or is it something else?” 

Quintinas chuckled softly at my expense as she showed me around to the various wares on the muffalo. “Yes, silver is at the core of this planet’s trade, followed by gold and jade pieces in value.” 

Between the five hundred silver pieces I found in the pod with me and the jade pieces I got off that mad tribal, I probably had a decent little sum to work with. 

As I began looking through the various bags and crates strapped to the animals, a wave of relief washed over me as I saw all the different vegetables. “Oh thank the stars, you have food.” While I wasn’t hurting for supplies in the near future, getting the means to start the oh-so-reliable practice of agriculture is a massive step toward long-term living. They had potatoes, corn, bell peppers, coffee beans, psychoid leaves and… “Are these chocolate beans?” I haven’t had chocolate since I was a child and that was a taste I won’t soon forget. 

I was nearly knocked off my feet by a heavy clap of Quintina’s hand against my shoulders as she looked amused by my reaction. “You have a nose for the good stuff, don’t ya kid? We’ve also got some processed chocolate, lightly sweetened and ready to eat if you’re interested.”

I absently licked my lips before I could really think about it, my tail slowly swaying at the idea of a nice treat after the hardship I’d endured since waking up. “I’m interested.” I said before looking back towards my shack. “I’ve got plenty of silver, but would you also be interested in bartering for some pelts perhaps?” 

Quintina readily nodded with a small smile as she gestured to her people. “Sure, kid, bartering is well and good with me. "" she said as I began walking towards my shack, followed by the procession of locals. 

They waited outside for me while I stepped inside. Shovit then rolled on in and offloaded their share of the steel while I dumped my backpack. 

“So… Who’s out there?” Simon asked quietly as she stood from the tailoring bench, leaving behind an unfinished piece of soon-to-be apparel with her arms crossed tightly to herself and eyes wide with evident anxiety.

I flashed her a sympathetic smile as I went to my dresser and grabbed the pouch of silver and jade, tying it to my belt before collecting some furs and pelts that Simon didn’t seem to be working with. “Don’t worry, it's just some merchants. I don’t think they’ll be sticking around for too long if that's what you’re worried about.”

She nodded slowly, leaning against one of the walls while eyeing the doors. “Sure, okay… Sorry, I just… I know you’re alright, but I’m not ready to m-meet others, okay?” 

“Yeah, that’s fine; you don’t have to meet others if you don’t want to.” With that said, I looked around my shack before deciding to come up with another project. “Conbui, put together an electric stone-cutting workbench, try and use more wood than steel.” I ordered, the mech quickly setting to work with Shovit as I looked back to Simon. “If you’re up for it, let's get started with making some stone bricks; that way we can start expanding the shack so we have more room to grow into… If you’re up for it of course.” I explained while ensuring that she knew I wasn’t pressuring her into anything and that it was entirely her choice.

Simon smiled, slowly nodding as she watched the mechs get to work. “Sure, that sounds good to me. "" she said, looking satisfied as she slowly meandered toward the tailoring bench. 

After watching her settle back in, I made my way outside with my goods, greeted by a warm smile from Quintina. “Hey, sorry for the wait. I needed a moment to see what I needed to use and what I could trade away.” 

“Not a problem.” Quintina said with a cheerfully dismissive handwave. “Now, let's see what you’ve got.” 

The merchants proceeded to take the pelts off my hands. After several minutes of appraisal and discussion, we settled on thirty units of potatoes, corn, bell peppers, coffee beans, chocolate beans, psychoid leaves, and two bars of chocolate in exchange for all the pelts I offered up, the twenty-seven pieces of jade, and forty pieces of silver. 

Quintina and I stepped aside as the others unloaded the muffalo, giving Shovit an uneasy look as it hauled everything into the outdoor freezer, the snow starting to drift down from around us from an ever-greying sky. “So… Kid… Ezekiel. You seem like the okay type, and seeing as you’re likely to spend quite some time around these parts, do you mind if I spread the word to other merchant groups who plan to pass through this area?” She asked, seeming rather sincere in seeking my permission as she crossed her arms. “After all, it's by sheer luck that we came across you today, and other groups might not be so lucky to find you out here.” 

I had taken a moment to stash away the paper-wrapped bars of chocolate in my duster pockets when Quintina asked her question, my ears flicking in contemplation before I decided on a response. “Sure… While I’m not sure how long I’ll be planetside, I could do with regular visits from merchants for supplies I can’t easily procure myself.” 

Quintina flashed a satisfied smile as she patted my shoulder again. “Good answer, kid.” She enthused warmly before looking back to her group and then looking to the sky again. “We’ll be getting out of your hair now. We still have a way to go before we set up camp for the night.” She said before meeting my eyes and holding my gaze. “Most new arrivals such as yourself usually don’t last the week… I hope the time you claimed to have survived is a sign that you are made of sturdier stuff.” She said while holding out her hand to me. 

I managed to smile as I reached out for her hand. “I like to think so, at least.” I mused before nearly losing my balance again as Quintina energetically grabbed me by my forearm and gave it a single, firm shake. 

“We’ll likely never see each other again Ezekiel, but I shall pray for your well-being.” She said before pulling away. 

“I appreciate it, Quintina. May the stars always shine your way on your travels, "" I said while casually massaging my forearm.

Quintina nodded in appreciation, soon rounding up her people as they continued heading west. Meanwhile, the snowfall only got heavier, and the wind whipped more noticeably through my hair and tail.

With the surprisingly friendly locals on their way, I returned inside to find Simon stepping away from the already opened door as she backpedaled nervously. “A-are they all gone?” 

“Yeah, they’re all heading off now.” I reassured as I shut the door behind me. “By the way, it looks like you were lucky to find me out here.” I said while procuring the bars of chocolate and holding one out to her. “One of those merchants told me we’re right in the middle of an unmarked safe zone for caravans in what is an apparently lawless cesspit of criminal activity… One wrong turn, and who knows where you would have ended up.” 

Her eyes widened slightly at my words, but she took the bar readily enough with somewhat shaky hands. “Wow… No kidding? I know I’ve said this before, but you are my little miracle, aren’t you Ezekiel?” She said with a growing smile before unwrapping the bar and taking a bite from it. 

I couldn’t help but chuckle at the comment, it truly didn’t feel deserved. “I really didn’t do much… If you want to thank anything, then you can thank the stars for having me practice an old religious ceremony the night I did it.” 

Simon giggled, actually giggled at my words. The sound itself was strangely refreshing as my ears twitched at her amused joy. “If you insist, I suppose I’ll thank the stars instead.” She said before closing the distance between us, looking up into my eyes and smiling a little more. “Instead, I’ll thank you for the chocolate.” With that said, she waved the bar in front of me, tapping the part she bit against my lips. “Thank you.” 

“Y-you’re welcome.” I murmured as I felt my face visibly flushing.

Without another word, she stepped away while biting into the bar again and heading towards the fridge to start working on dinner. 

I felt myself licking my lips again, the taste of the chocolate was so much sweeter than I remembered. 

**3rd of Septober, 5500**

It’s like all I do these days is mining… I’d like to think I’ve gotten better at it since coming to this planet, but the difference isn’t exactly noticeable in the grand scheme of things. 

I once again pivoted away from building the comms station, having instead dedicated resources to an array of batteries to store up more power after coming to terms with just how many electronics I’ll need to have up and running if I want to make any real headway towards general stability or even decrypting the info brick. 

That said, all the pivoting has finally paid off. With Simon’s help, I’ve expanded the mech charging and gestation shack with brand-new granite brick walls with room for the comms station and a few other potential upgrades in the future. 

Of course, I was out mining for more steel in the large deposit I’ve been slowly clawing at these last few weeks. I coordinated with Shovit, who hauled every usable chunk I mined to the mental blueprint Conbui was working on. 

Once there were enough materials and Conbui was actively building up the device, it was just about time for lunch. Today, it was something a little more complicated and refined: pan-seared ox steak with a sauteed berry blend that Simon had Shovit bring back for me after dropping off the last of the steel. 

It was… Okay? The meat felt gamier than usual, and the berries were strangely tart for whatever reason… It was only after I had finished the dish that my stomach suddenly turned and twisted, forcing me to puke out everything I had just put in, painting the snow with a disgusting blend of browns, purples, and reds.

‘It appears you may already be aware of it, but you are currently suffering from food poisoning… The cause is unknown, as I have limited access to the finer details of your internals, given your mostly unmodified body.’ Sagittarius silently informed, sounding vaguely regrettable at the delayed warning. 

I just shuddered and groaned as I felt my body actively shake at the sensation of puking, the act of it bringing back bad memories. “Y-yeah… Thanks for the heads up… Just… Um… Keep me notified if things get worse.”

Without further response from Sagittarius, I returned home and forced a smile on my face despite my current condition. I spotted Simon quickly enough, busily working away at the electric stone-cutting bench and preparing more bricks for future use. “H-hey there, Simon… I uh… Have good news!” 

“Welcome back, Ezekiel.” Simon said warmly as she stood from the workbench. “What’s the ne- Oh! Are you okay? You don’t look great…” She said, looking concerned as she quickly crossed the room and began looking me over, a hand coming up to cradle my cheek while the other pressed against my stomach. 

Despite my rapidly deteriorating condition, I could still feel my tail start to wag and sway under her attention. “Y-yeah… I’m fine…” I said, doing my best to wave away her concerns and taking a step back to regain my composure. “It seems like lunch didn’t sit well with me, but don’t blame yourself… I’m not exactly used to having solids so often for my meals… It’s just another thing I’ll need to get used to since coming here.” 

Simon looked unsure about my claims but nodded slowly before crossing her arms. “Very well, Ezekiel… So what's the news?” 

“The comms station, Conbui finished putting it together a little while ago, and I’m about to go turn it on. Wanna come with me and see if I can’t reach my people?” 

Simon blinked with clear surprise but quickly smiled as she clasped her hands with delight. “Really?! Amazing! Of course, I’d love to join you. Lead the way.” She enthused, hurrying over to the door to open it for me. 

We made our way to the other end of my stony hill, entering the tech shack. There, we spotted one of the penguins hopping about and exploring the newly expanded room. “Hey there, little fella, you here to listen in too?” I mused cheerfully despite my guts doing their very best to act like knots. 

As I approached the comms console, I looked it over before finding the switch I needed. I flipped it as the device began to power on, whirring and whining with life as it began tuning in to all the signals that were no doubt bouncing around this planet. 

Before I could say or do anything else, I felt a jolt travel down my spine as a red flag flared at the front of my mind. Killing intent? As I turned to look for the source, my back suddenly tightened unnaturally, a wave of tingling sensations coursing through all my back nerves in a frighteningly familiar way… Then the heat hit me, a disgusting, overwhelming heat that washed across my back. I… I’ve been stabbed? 

I step away from the comms console, my knees almost immediately buckling as I stumbled to the ground, a puddle of muddied blood forming beneath me as I spot Simon holding some kind of steel shiv that gleamed red with was no doubt my blood. “W-why?”

“Sorry, Ezekiel, I can’t let you contact any of your buddies…” She said as she flashed an almost playful smile. “We had such a nice thing going here… Why did you have to go and actually finish building that stupid comms station, hm?” She said while shaking her head with what I could tell was exaggerated disappointment.

Between the food poisoning and the fresh stab wound, I could barely muster the strength to sit up, let alone go for my weapon as Simon suddenly mounted me, pinning me to the ground with her body and raising the shiv above her head with both hands to slam it down against me. 

With one desperate move, I managed to bring my hands up, catching her by her wrists as I tried as hard as I could to keep her from plunging that thing into my body again. 

But this struggle only spurred her on as she leaned in close, her hair brushing against my face as she locked eyes with me. ""Give up; you don't stand a chance in a place like this! Let's end this here! It will be easier for you, so much easier! You'll see it will be over quickly; that’s the least I could do for you.""

“N-no! S-stop this! Please!” I cried out, panting heavily as I willed my body to move, even though I could feel it start to fail me with each passing second, watching as the shiv pierced through my duster and began cutting into my flesh. 

Suddenly, an aggressive chirping squawk cut through the air as the rockhopper quickly hopped at Simon, biting her in the face and drawing blood as it quickly nipped at her ear and refused to let go. 

This sent her reeling, throwing herself off me with her attention fully grabbed by the tiny penguin while she yowled in pain. “G-get off me, you damn pest!” With a slash of her shiv, she sliced the rockhopper’s chest open as it was forced to release her, collapsing into a bloodied heap.

When she finally recovered, she turned her attention back on me, and our eyes met one last time as I pulled the trigger, sending an accelerated round straight through her forehead. Her head snapped back at the impact, and her body soon followed as it dropped like a puppet that was pushed after its strings were cut.

‘Ezekiel, you are currently bleeding at a rate of 170%; you have already reached a stage of minor blood loss and will die in thirteen hours. Please tend to your wounds before you succumb to either excessive blood loss or your worsening food poisoning.’ Sagittarius advised with silent concern. 

 “I… I hear you, Sagittarius… L- Let me catch my breath.” I said softly before noticing that the little rockhopper was still breathing, though clearly in a bad way. “But first, I must ensure our hero pulls through before I even consider saving myself.”

‘Very well Ezekiel, I'll do my best to monitor your vitals, please don't take too long.’ 

“Right… Of course.” I replied softly, glancing at what was left of Simon before forcing myself back up to my feet.

1ioifx5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ioifx5,Progress…,"First pic was testing done on 12/28/24 and the second pick was yesterday 2/12/24. 

Little backstory on the first lab result; since April 2024 I had made dietary changes which I was able to stick to and dropped a good 40 pounds from April right up until a week before the December test. While I was on a calorie deficit, a lot of my foods were still higher in Saturated Fats than your typical diet, nothing Keto-like but I wasn’t shying away from small portions of beef/pork, cheeses, etc.

While my doctor was happy with the weight loss, he wasn’t immediately worried about this result in December but asked me to adjust a few things diet-wise…. I went off the deep end and read everything, including a lot of posts on this sub (thank you all!) and made the following changes:

-Limit Saturated Fats to under 10g per day
-Upped my fiber intake to the 40-50g a day range
-Started taking Berberine
-Up the water intake
-Cut back on coffee consumption (not sure this made a big difference but wanted to try)

Stuck to it day in and day out, weekends included, kept up with my existing workout regimen and I’m gonna say it: I STILL OCCASIONALLY ENJOYED MYSELF A FATTY MEAL… Just not nearly as often! 

My doctor had wanted me to wait until April to retest but I had a feeling there would be a positive shift even now after less than 2 months. This doesn’t mean I’m done of course as I know 129 LDL is still considered elevated, but I wanted to share this in hopes it could serve as some positivity for anyone else making those changes.

Then the shift manager appears and critiques my pace and says I’m going too slow even though NO one is helping me. He then also says that I need to be stationary at the presenting window, so I told him “if I’m waiting on one coffee and no one’s making it, I’m going to make the coffee.”

We have a dog and 2 kids. It is also always very tidy. I personally make sure to go through every room the night before our cleaning lady comes so she doesn't have to do any picking up or tidying, and so she can focus on the cleaning.

Our previous lady was doing it in 4 hours, but our current cleaning person seems a bit slow and was taking way more hours. So I started paying her for 5 hours instead. She does take however more than 5 hours to clean. I have to remind her it is time to go home. But I think she knows how chilled she is that she ends up staying a bit longer. I also always invite her for a break and to seat down for a coffee and a sandwich in between.

But this doesn't make me feel very good. Knowing that she is staying an average of 6hours and I am paying her for 5h. At the same time she never seems to be very agile.

I am growing a little frustrated because sometimes I need her to be a bit more aware (sometimes the cleaning is a bit superficial), but I don't want to be too demanding either. I know that in 6hours I could do a much better job, but then this is my house and one always cares more for one's space, I believe.

She has been coming once a week but I just asked her to come two times per week, every other week, on top of that so some areas are better taken care of.

Anyway, for my reference, my question is: how many hours does your cleaning person take vs size of your place?

1ioianw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1ioianw/the_harsh_truth_about_video_editing_that_will/,The HARSH TRUTH About Video Editing (That Will SAVE Your Channel),"Look, I'll be brutally honest: if you're searching for that magical editing secret, that 24-hour viral hack... don't read this post. You won't find it here.

Know what's worse than not having a YouTube channel? Having one that's dead because you're stuck on editing.

Here's the truth: we've all been there. That moment when you don't know if posting that video would stick or go down the drain like the rest where you spent hours editing. But something changed everything for me: You don't need to be an editing wizard to start. For real.

What you need is to make videos people actually want to watch. That simple.

What makes people watch? Clear flow. Getting to the point. Respecting their time. Always ask yourself: 'Would I watch this? Would I click on this thumbnail?' That's your guide, everything else comes after.

Everything else? Just fancy extras.

Let's get to what matters: tools you can use TODAY.

Starting out? You need simple. Canva Video Editor is basically PowerPoint for videos. If you've ever put together a presentation, you've got this. Drag, drop, done. Then there's CapCut, your pocket ace. Free, mobile-first, surprisingly capable. Best part? Edit while waiting for your coffee (pro tip: you can install the older versions if you have android to bypass the paywalls).

Ready for the big leagues? Alright. DaVinci Resolve is where things get serious. We're talking Hollywood-level stuff here - the same tool used in films like Avatar and The Batman. Yeah, that level. The insane part? The free version is more powerful than most paid editors. The catch? Steeper learning curve, but trust me, it's worth it.

Need voiceovers that don't sound like robots? Here's your secret weapon: DupDub turns your text into natural-sounding voices in 70+ languages. For tutorials or explanations? Total game-changer.

Let's talk audio tools you'll actually use: Audacity is your free lifesaver for cleaning noisy audio, while Krisp kills background noise while you record. Adobe Podcast magically enhances your audio quality, and Timebolt automatically removes silence without AI, totally free.

For thumbnails (because let's face it, that's half the battle), you've got Snapseed for quick mobile photo editing that looks pro, Remove,bg for background removal in seconds, and Photopea when you need Photoshop power without the price tag.

Smart creators know organization is key, so here's your power trio: Notion for planning your content and scripts like a boss, Trello for keeping your workflow visual and on track, and Google Keep for capturing those brilliant video ideas that hit you at 3 AM.

Don't let budget stop you. Here's your resource goldmine: Pexels and Pixabay offer quality stock footage that doesn't scream ""stock,"" Mixkit serves up copyright-free music that won't put your audience to sleep, and Kapwing handles collaborative editing when you need a quick fix.

Here's your lifesaver toolkit: OBS Studio for crystal-clear screen recording without watermarks, Handbrake when your videos are too heavy but you can't lose quality, and Descript for those who hate traditional editing - edit your video like it's a Word doc.

But here's what really matters: Your tool matters less than what you do with it.

I've seen phone-edited CapCut videos hit millions. And pro-software videos with zero views.

The difference? Content. Story. Message.

Here's your million-dollar secret: Pick TWO tools maximum to start. One primary, one backup.

Why? Because analysis paralysis is real. And every minute you spend comparing tools is a minute you're not creating.

Don't freeze up searching for the perfect tool. It doesn't exist.

Pick one. Any one. Start.

Your first video will suck. Your second one too. But by number ten? That'll be a different story.

You've two choices now: Keep reading about editing. Or open one of these and start.

That's your call.

Which one are you picking? Don't say ""soon."" Don't say ""when I have time."" Tell me which one. Now.

Because the only editing that doesn't work is the editing you never start.

Any interaction with her feels disingenuous and performative. Then there’s the snide comments from her about how I’m “so negative” and “we never have any fun”, plus just an air of condescension, so I’ve decided in the past 6ish months to just keep it brief and cordial if I ever run into her, not initiating contact anymore.

So back in October, she gifts me a facial at my birthday gathering with our group, and at that point I was really just done with letting her walk all over me. So I told her over text that I appreciated the sentiment, but that I just had a lot going on and it wasn’t a good time for me. Also, AFTER she “gave me” the facial gift she texted me to say that she didn’t realize that the spa prices were so high, and would I mind if we went to the local beauty school instead. Personally I thought that was tacky but I didn’t care since I wasn’t going anyway.

Fast forward to last week, I ran into her on the street walking with one of the others in our group, and she says hey, we never booked that facial, how about we set a date? I blew it off at that moment, but then she sends me a text today asking if X date works. I’m just like wtf? Since October we have BARELY spoken. Exception being that a month or 2 ago she had a medical issue  so I reached out a couple of times and sent her a bit of food. I did this mainly because I felt it would have been super rude to ignore her entirely, and she had sent a group text about how she has been struggling quite a bit. I won’t detail her response but it was along the lines of thanks, but I’m fine. ????? You literally just said that you weren’t? 

So I really do NOT want to go, I’m thinking I’ll just say that I’m not comfortable going to a beauty school for facial services, but her behavior is perplexing to say the least. What in the hell could be going through her mind?

Also when I first tried to talk to her about her attitude over a year ago, she dismissed me entirely, shut down any attempts at adult communication. She was more than happy to keep up this weird phony friendship, and that’s one thing I cannot tolerate.",2,1739450882.0,FriendshipAdvice,12,1.0,False

Im sitting around 1100 to 1200 calories. I've got to be in a deficit right? There's no way Im not. However, I feel bloated and/or like Im moving in the wrong direction. Will it just take time for my body to get used to? Im coming off of intermittent fasting, I tended to eat unhealthy. Is my metabolism shot? I also wonder if its just the increased fiber and if its going to take a couple weeks to do much. But I'd hate to eat like this for weeks if I'm just going to gain weight. 

Before anyone comments: You'll have to pry the cookie out of my cold, dead fingers. It is non-negotiable. 😂

I exercise 1 day a week realistically for 45 mins. Id like to lose weight dieting first and then add in exercise if that's possible, its hard for me to do both because exercise makes me insanely hungry for all the wrong things. Lol. ",3,1739450861.0,WeightLossAdvice,14,0.72,False

I just want to start by saying I love this community and always refer here when I need advice cause you guys are the best! 💕 

Some back story! I (34F) have been married to my husband (40M) for 3 years (together for 8) and we’ve finally made the full traditional dive! I quit my job in December to be a SAHW! Thanks to all the book recommendations and advice here, I’ve been consistently working on reframing myself and becoming more submissive which has obviously paid off (yay it works 😉) 

But I need help I can’t figure out how to navigate this in a feminine submissive way! 

My husband has become increasingly agitated with me over the tiniest trivial things…sometimes daily at this point. I get so many mixed signals from him…one minute he says “i don’t want to have think about things you should take the initiative”. Then I take the initiative and he says “he doesn’t like surprises and why didn’t I ask him?” I’m so confused. It feels like he’s picking on me. He knows I’ll do anything he asks…but he doesn’t want to ask he expects me to read his mind? 

I have tried being “unbothered” I just apologize and agree with him but this almost never works in my situation. I feel like he doesn’t accept my submission and just keeps pushing to get a reaction out of me. for days sometimes! 

Yesterday I mistakenly left some food in the crockpot because when he gets home he doesn’t like me doing…well anything really he wants me to hang out with him. When he woke up in the am, he saw it and brought it to my attention at 4am. I apologized and let him know I had turned it off at midnight as I didn’t have time to portion it out before I fell to sleep. He berated me for about an hour on food safety practices (which I agreeeeee I know I messed up I apologized) and then after he left for work proceeded to send me articles on google about food practices. 😐

That was yesterday. Today he’s mad that I didn’t wake up when he did to bring him his coffee. he says i’m “laxing” 💔…but when i offered yesterday he said it was too early?? IM SO CONFUSED. i’m not a mind reader!! (I’m humbled this is how many men feel on the regular) which leads me to my next question…

I feel like I’m noticing my husband is more emotional than I thought and doesn’t know how to accept my submission? is that a thing?...I feel like I’ve progressed soo much with my submission (I’m still a work in progress for sure!) but it feels like to me (I’m just going to be honest) 

1. he’s jealous that i’m home and he has to work 
2. he wants a reaction out of me, he wants to fight with me or he’s just taking things out on me 

I’m working very hard at keeping my mouth shut and trying not to REACT and to stay present when in the past I would over explain myself and get very emotional. I need advice guys. 

How do I stay feminine and submit when my husband is pressing me otherwise? 

How do you appropriately set boundaries with submission? How do you say “no” as a submissive wife? Can you say no? (Sometimes it feels like I just have to go along with whatever regardless of what I feel about it…i caught him watching porn the other day when we had discussed neither of us watching it forever ago and i was hurt but i just went along with it…to be submissive??)

Any feedback is SO MUCH appreciated! I’d also love to have a friend in this space so feel free to message me! Thank you guys so much!! ❤️",1,1739449852.0,RedPillWomen,11,0.6,False

Hi all,

I currently have a delonghi magnifica s bean to cup machine which I really like. But it takes up space and makes a lot of noise when it grinds the beans.

context: 

so i played sims 4 back in 2014 when it first released, and was an avid player of sims 3 before that. i downloaded cc back then but it tended to be from the sims resource, it was never all of this patreon stuff back then (from what i’m aware of). i played for a year or two and ive only just come back to sims 4 at the back end of LAST YEAR. i took a very long break due to some personal stuff. now obviously my first task was download CC (because i can’t play without it lmaooo), id never even heard of patreon being used for cc with the sims, i’d never heard of people putting stuff behind paywalls either, so you best bet i was super shocked when i saw this was even a thing?? 😭 

i FULLY understand (but don’t agree with) why creators want to earn money for their creations. it’s time, effort, dedication, skill, and a side hustle. cool. however it’s morally and ethically wrong, no? (i’m not sure please tell me otherwise as like i say im not aware of the rules and what EA specifically said about this). what i do agree with is the option to donate, or the ‘buy me a coffee’ options. they’re cute. they’re mindful. they’re demure. they’re *optional*!! 

edit * i also agree with the early access payment side of things, i genuinely understand and appreciate that this is some people’s way of income and i do agree with the early access content and wanting to be paid (a reasonable amount) for that. that’s ABSOLUTELY fine. but again, the perma paywall personally doesn’t sit well with me. 

long story short, i saw a reddit post from a year ago who had mentioned some of these patreon creators had been doxing people’s information, putting viruses in their downloads etc?! and i guess i just wanna know a little more. i didn’t understand the post they linked properly as, like i say, im *VERY* late to the boat, and my old and decrepit 22 year old brain doesn’t understand 🥲 but just wondered if anyone has anything they wanna say or share!

While coffee has long held the crown as the go-to morning jolt, a remarkable shift is underway—one that favors the refined allure of premium teas. This trend isn’t solely about flavor; it’s about embracing a holistic, mindful lifestyle that celebrates health, artistry, and sustainability.

# A Gentler Caffeine Boost

Premium teas deliver a refined caffeine experience that sets them apart from coffee. Rather than the sharp, fleeting spike of energy that can leave you jittery, premium tea offers a gentle, sustained lift. This means you stay alert and focused without the unwanted crash later. Many tea enthusiasts are now turning to expertly curated collections, such as those available from [Golden Tips Tea](https://www.goldentipstea.in), for a balanced start to the day.

# A Symphony of Flavors and Aromas

Coffee typically offers a limited range of roast profiles, whereas premium teas open up a world of diverse taste experiences. Whether it’s the delicate floral hints of[ Darjeeling](https://www.goldentipstea.in/collections/darjeeling), the bold, malty richness of Assam, or a complex herbal infusion, each blend offers its own story and character. This diversity allows you to choose a brew that matches your mood, the season, or even your specific health needs.

# Health Benefits That Go Beyond the Cup

The perks of premium tea extend far beyond a simple pick-me-up. [Premium green teas](https://www.goldentipstea.in/collections/green-teas) are packed with antioxidants, black teas are known to support heart health, and herbal blends help with digestion and relaxation. While coffee has its benefits, it often doesn’t offer the same comprehensive wellness package that premium teas provide—making them a smart choice for health-conscious individuals.

# An Inviting Ritual of Relaxation

Drinking premium tea is more than just consuming a beverage—it’s a mindful ritual. The process of steeping loose-leaf tea, watching the leaves unfurl, and savoring that first warm sip creates a moment of calm in an otherwise hectic day. This ritualistic experience is a stark contrast to the hurried nature of coffee consumption, offering a path to mindfulness and intentional living.

# Commitment to Sustainability

Today’s discerning consumers care not only about what’s in their cup but also how it’s made. Many premium tea producers emphasize sustainable and ethical sourcing, working closely with small-scale farmers and embracing eco-friendly practices. This commitment to environmental responsibility adds another layer of appeal to premium teas.

# Versatility in Every Cup

One of the greatest strengths of premium tea is its versatility. Enjoy it hot, iced, blended into lattes, or even infused into creative cocktails—tea adapts effortlessly to any occasion. This flexibility has driven its popularity in both home kitchens and upscale cafes, solidifying its status as a modern luxury beverage.

# Conclusion

While coffee will always have its loyalists, the rise of premium teas reflects a broader shift towards healthier, more mindful consumption. With their sophisticated flavors, myriad health benefits, and sustainable roots, premium teas offer not just a drink, but a full sensory experience. Whether you’re new to the world of tea or a seasoned connoisseur, there’s never been a better time to explore the rich, aromatic journey that premium tea offers.

Embrace the change and elevate your daily ritual with a cup of premium tea—your body, mind, and soul will thank you.

1iohqr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1iohqr4/is_frigidaire_wf2cb_the_best_refrigerator_water/,Is Frigidaire WF2CB the best refrigerator water filter? Read this review to find out!,"Using the Frigidaire WF2CB PureSource2 Ice and Water Filtration System has been an interesting experience. As someone who values clean, fresh-tasting water, I was eager to test the capabilities of this filter. Over the past months, our household put it through rigorous daily use—whether filling water bottles, making coffee, or simply enjoying a cold glass. Here’s what stood out to me.

The installation process was refreshingly simple. With just a press of the release button, the old filter popped out, and the new one clicked into place effortlessly. I ran the recommended three minutes of water to prime the filter, and voila—ready to go. This ease of use is a major win, especially for those who dread overly complicated appliance setups. My teenage son even asked if he could replace it next time, just to feel helpful!

Performance-wise, the difference in water taste is immediately noticeable. Our tap water, which previously had a faint chlorine odor, now tastes crisp and clean. The filter effectively removes contaminants like mercury, lead, and pesticides, which gives me peace of mind as a parent. I’ve also noticed that our ice cubes are clearer than before—no more cloudy, suspiciously murky-looking ice in our drinks!

One minor design change caught my attention. Unlike the older transparent versions of this filter, the WF2CB is white and opaque. While this looks sleek, it means you can’t visibly inspect the filter’s condition, so you’ll need to rely on your refrigerator’s reminder light. For some, this might be a drawback, but I personally found the light reminder feature handy and reliable.

[Check Frigidaire WF2CB price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/product-reviews/best-water-filter-frigidaire-wf2cb-review-b0032jts5e/)

**Pros**

* **Easy installation:** It genuinely takes less than a minute to replace. Perfect for busy households.
* **Noticeable improvement in water taste:** Crisp, clean water that rivals bottled options.
* **Effective contaminant removal:** Filters out lead, mercury, chlorine, and more.
* **Compatible with specific Frigidaire models:** Fits snugly without leaks, thanks to its precise design.
* **Affordable compared to frequent bottled water purchases:** Long-term savings are significant.

**Cons**

* **Opaque design:** You can’t visually check the filter’s wear and tear.
* **Limited compatibility:** Only works with specific Frigidaire refrigerator models.
* **Reminder light doesn’t automatically reset:** Requires manual intervention, which can be inconvenient.

**Comparison to Competitors** When stacked against other refrigerator water filters, like the GE MWF or Samsung HAF-CIN/EXP, the Frigidaire WF2CB holds its ground well. The GE MWF offers comparable contaminant removal but tends to be pricier, while the Samsung model boasts a slightly longer lifespan but lacks the straightforward installation of the WF2CB. If simplicity and taste are top priorities, the WF2CB edges out competitors. However, those seeking longer filter life might favor other options.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** Considering the features and performance, the WF2CB represents excellent value. While the upfront cost may seem steep to some, the savings compared to bottled water and other filtration systems quickly add up. Plus, its six-month lifespan or 200-gallon capacity ensures you’re not replacing filters too frequently. That’s a relief for both your wallet and the environment.

In summary, the Frigidaire WF2CB PureSource2 filter may not be perfect, but it excels in areas that matter most—ease of use, water quality, and reliability. It’s an investment in your family’s health that pays off with every refreshing sip.

1iohq6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1iohq6d/non_tourist_stuff_to_do_this_weekend/,Non tourist stuff to do this weekend,"So my wife and I are hosting our dear friend’s 21 year old daughter for a long weekend, this weekend. Unfortunately her mom just passed after a long battle with cancer and she’s having a rough time - I think she just needs a little spot of brightness and to be around people who loved her mom. (No dad in the picture and she’s an only child.) she’s never been to dc before and we haven’t been around her a ton. 

She’s also coming for a week at spring break where we will do the touristy things. This visit she doesn’t want to do the tourist stuff. 

So my question is what would you suggest around town that’s fun and engaging but not touristy? 

On Friday we are going shopping, coffee, nails, and to a wine bar for Valentine’s Day. Saturday maybe Ben’s chili bowl and a movie in the afternoon. I checked Suns but timing won’t work. 

After that I’m sort of stumped. Open to cool artsy fun interesting - talks, classes, coffee, beer - anything really. Baltimore/Annapolis also an option. ",0,1739448871.0,washingtondc,27,0.31,False

1iohpt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warehouseworkers/comments/1iohpt4/need_advice_drinks_on_forklifts/,Need Advice - Drinks On Forklifts,"Hey guys,

I'm semi-new to the warehouse world as I've been transferred into an assistant position. It has been a learning process and been going well but I need advice on how other warehouses handle something in either policy or ways to work around it.

Our owner is 100% adamant that food and drink is not allowed on our forklifts. There are safety concerns and potential damage to the lifts themselves in a spill. The manager had been allowing the guys to drink water and coffee in any container on the lifts for years but our owner finally gave the absolute, this changes now.

Our team is pretty irritated and upset about this. We are in Texas so during the Texas heat, they go through alot of water to stay hydrated. We want to meet safety and health guidelines (we store packaging for some food products) yet want to help the team. 

One of the team members mentioned at his last job, they were able to drink water only on the forklifts as long as it was in a specific type of container with a closed lid that was spill proof. It was not provided by the company but it was stated that if you wanted water while on the floor, that was the only container type allowed.

Could I get some assistance or advice on how to deal with this situation? We could easily say no, its policy and it is what it is yet we want to help our team feel valued and are somewhat worried about the summer months when its 100+ outside. I also need to somehow convince the owners that we should do this as we don't want to get chewed out for disobeying his policy. I'm thinking if there is something in OSHA or general worker policy?

1iohpc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iohpc2/formatting_your_resume_how_do_you_do_yours_and/,Formatting your resume - how do you do yours ? And  other strategy tips,"Hi everyone 
This week I’ve reviewed about 70 resumes or so and wanted to pass on my suggestions for your resume from a GenX minivan dad and engineering leader 

1. No addresses - because you’re willing to move anywhere avoid location bias. 

2. School first if new grads , skills first if you’ve got experience - right away post this and make sure if the job requires Java that’s the first thing in your skills/resume 

3. Post your GPA , courses taken and awards - a lot of you absolutely crushed college. Highlight that .  If you busted your ass but GPA is less than 3 just leave off your GPA. C’s get degrees , degrees get you interviews. 

4 . Use the format of doing X solution to Y problem with Z outcome - use this format to explain what you do and why you did it and how it worked. USE METRICS OR GUESSTIMATE for outcomes. 

5. Bullets and descriptive phrases appropriate for
The role you’re applying for - a resume  is a sales description of why we should hire you.  That’s it. You’re likely an awesome person but I need a specific set of skills. Think of it like a sales pitch for a car - in northern Vermont USA where it snows and I want to ski , I know I need an all wheel drive car with active vectoring  and a manual transmission along with snow tires. If you’ve got a locking differential , AWD, stick and snow tires let’s go. 

6. Expand your location when you’re first applying  - it sucks. You love the Mets and don’t want to leave NYC to go to LA but there is a job there and you don’t have a mortgage , kids , dog , or spouse at the moment. Psssst - there are lots of Mets fans in LA. You can always come back . You may not get the role there. But apply. 

Other tips in your survival guide 

7. Use a fixed amount of time per day to apply - start your day off with some exercise then apply to jobs for
An hour. Don’t try to do it all day. Even if you’re unemployed. Using new roles that have just popped up filter because you’ve already applied to all the old roles out there , Scan the jobs and save them . then knock out the quick apply roles , then do the longer apply positions. 

Then walk away from your computer or close out LinkedIn at least. And don’t read the though pieces on that platform for the love of god make sure when you apply you don’t automatically follow a company or their drivel. Nothing sucks more than to see someone get the role you wanted posted on a company’s site. 

8. Networking via text , phone call , coffee , bike ride , whatever your goal is to pursue advice on getting a role - you’re looking for anyone to help with advice on getting into a new gig , market , industry , work in computer science. Your goal is to get to a hiring manager to see what tools they use to solve problems and to genuinely learn as much as you can.  

Your goal is to listen as much as possible. 

And you have to do it everyday. Because once it becomes something you do a few times you’re going to get way more comfortable doing it and confident in your delivery.  And you’re going to hear a ton of NOs but you will become better at . You’re a salesperson for yourself. 

9. When looking put the bat signal out to your non work friend and family  group - let everyone know outside of work and simply keep it away from coworkers , even friends. This doesn’t mean changing your self on LinkedIn. It means leveraging a network effect of people that you want to move on. 

10. “ Cracking the coding interview “book is worth the $20 to own it.  Read it all.  She does an absolutely great job and you can pass it on to someone else when you score a job. 

11. Give first….. And don’t expect anything at all in return. If you’re in a position to help others , give first. 

12 you have to eat so if you’ve got to take a part time or a less than desirable job , DO IT.  No one interesting has had a linear path without obstacles. This is your story and just a bump in a very long road. It’s humbling and sucks but you need money.  

13 if you get laid off or let go file for unemployment insurance - it’s insurance. You paid for it. Getting laid off can feel like a car crash. Use the insurance to help yourself out.
