1iedh0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iedh0z/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_their_blood_sugar/,Does anyone else struggle with their blood sugar? Any advice?,"I'm not diabetic, but as long as can remember I've had sudden blood sugar crashes where I shake and feel faint and dizzy. I never knew why, until I started suspecting ADHD (in my 30s) and saw all those very relatable memes about forgetting to eat and not realising you're hungry until your legs start to shake...

I've managed to keep it somewhat under control during periods of time when I've had the energy to ensure that I eat plenty of whole grain and have regular meals, but honestly, that's the exception more than the norm (i.e. cooking hyperfixations).

And now that I've started stimulants, it feels like it's gotten worse, like my blood sugar is completely out whack from the second I have my breakfast and meds (esp if I have coffee, so trying to cut that out).

Does anyone have similar problems? I know that the solution is obviously a healthy diet, but as we all know, that is a great struggle with an ADHD brain - so what do you do when the energy just isn't there for three homecooked broccoli based meals a day, but you also need to not be shaking all day?",1,1738325823.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

My anniversary is coming up and I would like to give my girlfriend a gift of a watercolor of this courtyard in Kerrytown where we met. I have included a screenshot of the maps location, but I'm prepared to drive out there and get a better picture for reference. Apologies, I've never had a piece of art commissioned before, so I'm not sure what other info you might need.

If you are an artist or know of one that would be good for this kind of art, please let me know!",1,1738325772.0,AnnArbor,0,1.0,False

A sprayer (assumedly for pesticide) has been left on the median in front of 1820 Richmond Road. It's 3/4 full of a pinkish liquid, very likely a herbicide. It's been there for at least two weeks now, I've noticed it before, and it hasn't moved. Hopefully nobody tries to mess with it, I'd be worried some kid tries to find out what's in it.

When my Nmom left the hospital room, my dad thanked me for coming out to make sure she wasn’t mean to him. It was really really heartbreaking.

I suspect she is bipolar or similar, her mood is unpredictable. She’s been very manic the last few days and I’m about at my wit’s end. Every 15 minutes or so, reminding me she exists and what nice thing she did or got at the store (yogurt, coffee). My dad was in clear agony in the hospital room and she decided to use that time to read the entire 6 page info sheet about after care for his surgery to him. Like, she can’t read the room or have empathy. 

I used to avoid my family entirely because anytime I give my nmom or nsister an inch they take a mile. Despite being here now, allowing her to visit in April AND agreeing to Thanksgiving together, it isn’t enough, and while she had me 1;1 in the hospital cafeteria she told me I am coming home for Christmas and all of these other travel ideas she had that I wouldn’t feign excitement for and it upset her. Like, her and my sister decided these things on the phone without asking me. Never mind that I’ve made plans with my sister for things and she 💯 ghosts me on them. And I am here. Now. Just spend time with me instead of planning for the next one?

Like…. I am 35 years old, LOL. I am so homesick and feel like a child. 4 more days and then I am safely back, across the country. ",1,1738325570.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Here are a few details:

The living room is 14' wide x 20' long, located off the kitchen. There's a lot of natural light with large windows overlooking the lake. The patio door leads to the deck. There's a separate formal dining room elsewhere. We'd like to remove the carpet and replace with LVP. We like the idea of building a coffee/wine nook.

We're aiming for a modern look with a cabin/lake vibe. Must be family friendly as we have little children.

We're open to spending a few thousand dollars on remodeling, furniture, and decorations.

We are launching again soon, targeting the first week of February, midweek. Half of the coffee has arrived, and the rest is in transit. If there are any delays, we will start in the second week of February once everything is here.

This project is a continuous work in progress. Everything—from the website (expected completion by the end of February), purchasing (over ~$6,700 in coffee already), mockups, individual dosing, labeling, packing, and shipping is handled entirely by me. No outsiders, no help, no investors.

I have asked for feedback and reviews to speed up the iteration process. While I love refining, optimizing, and perfecting things, I believe the best approach right now is to keep releasing, even if everything is still evolving.

The coffees currently in the carousel will be included in the next release, with a few more additions on the way.

Shipping to Canada is now active.
For pricing, check rates from Los Angeles to Canada through DHL or UPS for an estimated cost.

Single-Serving Coffee is Available
All coffees will be offered in single-serving portions. If you are interested in trying a specific brand, this is your opportunity. Pricing is based on the full bag price, broken down into individual servings.

No special requests. No nonsense. Just single-dose coffee from the world’s most famous brands.

The Core Idea Behind Rotation.Coffee

This entire project is built on a simple concept: proving that customers are more likely to take a chance on unknown coffee brands when they can try single-dose servings first.

Most people hesitate to spend $28 on a full bag of single-origin or co-ferment coffee plus shipping. But a $3 sample? That’s a much easier decision.

1iecwvh,https://i.redd.it/mzo7rae4hbge1.jpeg,I don't understand the hype for this book,"I bought this book to gift a friend of mine. She had been talking about it like crazy and said she loved the quotes she saw from it on Instagram. Upon buying it, I thought, might as well read it myself to see how good it is.

The poems were not polished enough to maintain a rhyming scheme while also conveying emotion. It felt more like the writer had a quota of poems to fill and simply put together some sad words that happened to rhyme. I mean it—the poems actually felt FORCED. Still, I wouldn't dismiss everything; some of them were genuinely good.

But the quotes—OH MY GOD—I have never read a book that screamed ""post me on Instagram"" more than this one. And I think that's the only purpose they served, to be part of a marketing campaign. All the quotes felt superficial, with no deeper meaning. Good for an aesthetic photo with a coffee cup and a sunrise/sunset in the background, but nothing more than that. I wonder how many people actually bought this book to read it.

Also, I don’t even understand why the author says, ""Your heart needs this book."" No, sir, now my heart needs to read something good to forget your book.

But I guess the marketing worked—my friend's feed was almost getting bombarded with such reels. If she likes it, good for her (she ain't a reader anyway).

The convenience store’s automatic doors slid open with a faint hiss, and I made my way to the fridge section. Grabbing two energy drinks, I hesitated before adding a third—Jenny would probably claim she needed ""extra fuel"" to survive algebra. As I walked to the counter, I caught myself smiling. Somehow, running late-night errands for her felt less like a hassle and more like second nature.

When I pulled up to her building, the faint glow of her phone screen lit her face as she sat on the front steps. She looked up when my car door slammed, her eyes lighting up in the way they always did when she knew she was about to get her way.

""Wow, you actually came through,"" she said, standing and tucking her phone into her hoodie pocket.

""Don’t sound so surprised,"" I replied, holding up the bag. ""I even got extras, so you owe me big time.""

Jenny grinned and took the bag from me, peeking inside. ""Energy drinks *and* snacks? You’re spoiling me.""

""Don’t get used to it,"" I shot back, following her up the stairs.

She glanced over her shoulder, smirking. ""Oh, I already am. Now let’s see if you can turn me into a math genius—or at least keep me awake long enough to finish this homework.""

We sat cross-legged on the floor by her coffee table, textbooks and scraps of paper scattered in every direction. I tapped my pen against the edge of my notebook and pointed to the next problem in her workbook.

""Alright,"" I said, leaning closer, ""this one’s just like the last. Start by simplifying the equation.""

Jenny nodded, her brow furrowed in concentration as she copied the problem onto a blank sheet. ""So… move the three over here,"" she murmured, dragging her pen across the page.

""And don’t forget to change the sign when you move it,"" I added.

""Got it!"" she said, her voice determined. For the first twenty minutes, she was surprisingly focused, nodding along to my explanations and even asking the occasional question.

But as the session dragged on, her energy began to fizzle out. She rested her chin in her hand, her other hand moving the pen sluggishly across the page.

""Wait, what was I supposed to do again?"" she asked, staring blankly at the equation.

""Isolate the variable,"" I reminded her patiently, though I could see her focus slipping away.

She nodded again but didn’t make a move to correct the problem. Instead, she let out a long sigh and leaned back against the couch. ""Why does algebra feel like it’s actively trying to kill me?""

""Because you’re not letting the caffeine do its job,"" I teased, nudging the unopened energy drink still sitting on the table.

She laughed softly but didn’t pick it up. Instead, she slumped further down, her eyes drooping. ""Maybe I just need a ten-minute nap to recharge…""

""Or maybe you need to finish this problem first,"" I countered, tapping the workbook with my pen.

""Fine,"" she groaned, sitting up again, though her movements were slow and exaggerated. ""But if I pass out mid-equation, it’s on you.""

After a few more equations, Jenny set her pen down with a sigh and stretched her arms over her head. ""Alright, I need a bathroom break,"" she announced, getting to her feet.

I raised an eyebrow at her sudden enthusiasm for taking a break. ""You’re just trying to escape algebra, aren’t you?""

""Maybe a little,"" she admitted with a grin, already heading toward the hallway. ""But seriously, you should keep going. Work through a few problems so you’re all prepared when I get back.""

I blinked, caught off guard. ""Wait, you want *me* to do the homework?""

Jenny turned around in the doorway, smirking. ""You’re already ahead in class anyway, Mr. Genius. Just figure it out so you don’t have to waste time understanding it before you teach me.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but she was already gone, leaving me alone with the mess of equations. Shaking my head, I grabbed her workbook and flipped to the next problem.

""Guess I’m doing her homework now,"" I muttered to myself, grabbing my pen. ""What else is new?""

As I finished up the last few problems, I glanced at the clock. Jenny had been gone for a while. I decided to check on her and make sure she wasn’t just pretending to be “busy” with a nap. Walking down the hallway, I noticed her bedroom door slightly ajar. When I peeked inside, I found her curled up on her bed, sound asleep.

I couldn’t help but smile at the sight—she had completely passed out. She’d probably barely made it to the bathroom before her body decided it needed some serious rest.

Quietly, I placed her workbook on her desk and tiptoed out of the room. I wasn’t sure what to do with the time now, so I sat back down on the couch and kept working through the homework.

A few minutes later, I heard footsteps from the stairs. Jenny’s mom appeared around the corner, looking down at me with a warm smile. ""Everything going okay in here?"" she asked, her eyes briefly flicking to Jenny’s bedroom door.

""Yeah, I’m almost done,"" I replied, holding up the last sheet of problems I was working on. ""She fell asleep though, so I thought I’d just finish these up for her.""

She smiled fondly. ""She’s probably exhausted after staying up late again,"" she said, leaning against the doorframe. ""I’m glad you’re helping her, though. You’re a good friend.""

I shrugged, trying to hide my awkwardness. ""It’s no problem. I said I’d help, so… I’m just doing what I can.""

She raised an eyebrow, a playful glint in her eyes. ""Well, you know, if you keep helping her with all this, you might just end up being the family’s go-to tutor,"" she teased, crossing her arms.

I chuckled, rubbing the back of my neck. ""I don’t know about that. I’m just trying to get her through tonight.""

She laughed softly, her eyes twinkling with amusement. ""Well, you never know. Maybe I’ll need your help with some stuff someday—math or… who knows?"" she said with a wink.

I laughed awkwardly. ""I’ll be sure to pencil you in for whenever you need a homework savior.""

She grinned. ""I’ll hold you to that. But really, it’s sweet of you to help her out like this. She’s lucky to have you looking out for her.""

""Yeah, well, someone’s gotta do it,"" I said with a smile, finishing up the last of the equations.

She nodded approvingly. ""Well, I appreciate it. You’re a good influence on her.""

""No problem,"" I said, giving her a thumbs-up. ""I’ve got it covered.""

""Alright then,"" she said, with one last playful grin. ""I’ll let you finish up. Thanks again for being such a good friend to her. You’re a keeper.""

As she walked back toward the kitchen, I quietly returned to my work. With the homework almost done, it felt good knowing Jenny would at least have something to hand in tomorrow. I didn’t mind being her backup—especially when it came with the occasional thank-you, like that one.

Once I had finished the last of the problems, I glanced over at Jenny’s still-sleeping figure, a small smile on my face. I had done what I could, and I was pretty sure she’d be grateful when she woke up—once she remembered all the caffeine and energy drinks I’d supplied. It felt good to know I’d helped, even though it wasn’t exactly what I’d planned on doing when I first agreed to assist her with algebra.

I packed up my things, making sure everything was neatly placed on her desk. There was a part of me that wished I could stick around and make sure she didn’t wake up with a mountain of work left to do, but I knew I had to head home. It was getting late, and I still had a few things I wanted to get done before I turned in for the night.

As I quietly left the house, I locked the door behind me and stepped out into the cool night air. The streets were empty, the kind of peaceful stillness that only late nights could bring. The drive back to my place was quiet, a kind of solitude that let my mind wander. I thought about the night—about Jenny, her mom, and how, in some small way, it felt like I’d done something important.

By the time I got home, the house was dark and quiet. I parked in the driveway and sat in my car for a moment, reflecting on how strange it was. Helping Jenny had been one of those things that didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, but now, as I lay in bed, I felt oddly satisfied.

It wasn’t just about doing her homework or running errands for her; it was about being there when she needed me. Maybe that’s what friends do. And I guess, even though it wasn’t part of the plan, I was okay with it.

this is just a short review. I had the pleasure to get a coffee from French roaster Feve - their anaerobic Ethiopia [(link to the coffe on their site)](https://www.fevecoffee.com/product/ethiopie-bona-zuria/). It is my first experience with this roaster and also with a roaster from France and I was really pleasantly surprised and would recommend it to everyone.

Roaster describes it the flavour as complex, plums, tropical fruits, rose, orange and lemon.

Smelling it I can sense what strongly resembles a traditional pie from my country (Czech Republic) - the pie usually has filling with plum jam with a little bit of rum, sweet curd with a little bit of lemon zest and this is what I found in the smell of whole beans.

Grinding them brings the fermented notes forward.

After brewing the coffee still presents the same interesting notes in taste, just the plums are more forward than the rest of the notes I could smell.

I used the Hoffmann single cup recipe with Abaca filters I normally use grinding it slightly finer than I do for Ethiopian varieties, compared them to Sibarist fast filters while grinding a lot finer, the coffee then has more pronounced start but overall more balanced with the second half which seems almost velvet smooth.",1,1738323717.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

But more importantly, it’s an emotional rollercoaster with three distinct stages:

1. **Preparation Panic** 📝💀
2. **Exam Day Terror** 😱✍️
3. **Results Limbo** ⏳🤯

Let’s break them down.

# Stage 1: Preparation Panic – The Denial and Despair Era

It starts innocently enough. You tell yourself:  
*""This is fine. I just need to make a study plan and stick to it.""*

Fast forward two weeks, and you’re drowning in a sea of notes, flashcards, and unanswered practice questions. You develop **four different study schedules**, each more ambitious than the last, and still find yourself watching “just one more” YouTube video explaining contract law… in ASMR format.

Symptoms include:

* Frantically highlighting everything in your textbook.
* Questioning why on earth you didn’t go into a simpler profession (like lion taming).
* Convincing yourself you’ll wake up at 5 AM to study (spoiler: you won’t).
* A constant state of existential dread fueled by coffee and panic.

# Stage 2: Exam Day Terror – The Chaos Chronicles

You wake up on exam day after exactly **27 minutes of sleep**, feeling like you’ve been hit by a truck—possibly because you *dreamt* about trust law chasing you down a dark alley.

Arriving at the exam center, you see two types of candidates:

1. The “Calm and Prepared” (who are they?! Are they even real?!)
2. The “Frantically Whispering Latin Phrases” (your people).

As you sit down and read the first question, your brain does the following:

1. Deletes **everything** you ever knew about the subject.
2. Suggests you move to a remote island and start a new life.
3. Recalls the exact plot of an irrelevant Netflix show you watched two years ago.

So, the first question:

*""How do you call a barrister during court proceedings?""*

Your brain:  
🚨 **SYSTEM ERROR** 🚨  
🚨 **404: KNOWLEDGE NOT FOUND** 🚨

Your options:  
(A) Stare at the screen hoping for divine intervention.  
(B) Select the answer that “feels” right.  
(C) Think about every mistake you’ve ever made in life.  
(D) All of the above.

Correct answer: **D**.

By the time you hit the final question, you’re *this close* to picking “Consideration is… consideration” as a SBA and walking out. But you power through, exit the exam hall, and immediately google **“SQE pass rate 2023-24”** as if that will somehow help.

# Stage 3: Results Limbo – The Endless Abyss

Now begins the real torture: **waiting**.

Days turn into weeks, and you start analyzing **every single** question you answered. *Did I pick the right answer for that SBAQ? Did I read the question correctly? Was ""Rylands v Fletcher"" the right answer, or was that just my mood at the time?*

Your coping mechanisms include:

* Replaying every question in your head like a bad horror movie.
* Googling “SQE pass rates” **daily** as if that helps.
* Assuming the SRA **lost your results** because it’s been *three* hours and you haven’t heard back yet.

And the group chats are full of people saying:  
*""I definitely failed.""* (They probably passed.)  
*""I think I did okay.""* (They definitely passed.)  
*""I don’t want to talk about it.""* (They passed *in Q1*.)

At this point, you go through five stages of grief:

1. **Denial** – *Maybe they lost my paper? Maybe they’ll cancel the results and let me retake for free?*
2. **Anger** – *Why did they make equity and trusts so confusing?!?*
3. **Bargaining** – *If I pass, I’ll never procrastinate again!*
4. **Depression** – *Time to update my LinkedIn bio to ""Aspiring... something else.""*
5. **Acceptance** – *Screw it. If I fail, I’ll just become an influencer and sell study planners instead.*

Then, **THE EMAIL ARRIVES**. You stare at it for an hour before clicking. Heart pounding. Hands shaking. You open it and—

**…Well, let’s just say, whatever happens, you’re still alive.**

I just had a pretty weird dream. For context my dad died in October. It was very sudden and very traumatic. 

I don’t know if I believe in the afterlife but I had quite a weird dream today. I was in a coffee shop with a little girl. I don’t know anything about her and I certainly haven’t met her yet. All of a sudden my dad walked in and told me it was time to go, in a very lighthearted tone. When I saw him I started crying, but he kept smiling and told me to be quick and pick a croissant. 

I was picking a salty croissant, when something very similar to a slot machine appeared next to me. 
There were numbers on it. They looked a little distorted but I could see a sequence. I’ll change it up a little bit, because I want to keep the real numbers for myself. They were five numbers and I immediately thought of a date. 

Imagine something like 14749, like 14th of July 2049. I looked at my dad, trying to understand what they meant but he just kept smiling at me.

Then I woke up and I wrote them down because I didn’t want to forget them. 
I’m kind of afraid it means something ominous, like the date of my death (I’m young right now and if that’s true I won’t make it past middle age lol). 

If that’s a date I’ll be precisely 50 years old. 

But I don’t think my dad would be smiling like that if it was something so dark. And I also don’t think he would be showing me something so anxiety inducing in the first place.

1iecog7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iecog7/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_everything_i_did_wrong/,I can’t stop thinking about everything I did wrong in my last relationship,"It’s been almost two months since the official break up with my ex and I’ve spent every single day thinking about all the things I did wrong. 

I can’t stop seeing every mistake, even though we had loads of things in common, I was mirroring some of his likes just to attract him more. We texted for a while before meeting in person and when we finally did I discovered he wasn’t the chattiest person so I stayed quiet too to avoid making him feel uncomfortable instead of being my usual self and make the conversation more natural and bring us closer. I should have been better at telling him what I wanted when he asked me where I wanted to go for dinner instead of being afraid and just go with “whatever” because it felt safer. We had been dating and had been intimate by the time Valentines day came and I just spent the day by myself because I was afraid of sharing my expectations, I should have told him I liked celebrating and it would have been nice doing something together instead of just pretending I didn’t want to be with him. We moved in together just a few months after and very quickly I started yelling and shouting when I wasn’t getting the support I wanted with the household chores and I could have just asked more nicely and been more patient with the learning curve. He works for a super market and that stopped me from establishing a healthy routine for both of us to get involved with grocery shopping because “I didn’t want to drag him back to work” during his free time. I cried two days before my first birthday together and he did the best he could to give me a nice time at home because we were in the middle of the pandemic and he planned to go for a walk and a coffee to a park with flower gardens because he knew I loved flowers, the day went by and he wanted to smoke and have sex which I wanted too and asked me if it was ok to leave the park for the next day because it would be too late to go after, I said it was ok, but it wasn’t, I should have said “no, let’s prioritise the time outside because that’s what I like and it’s my birthday and we leave the love session for later”. I started behaving as a wife and acting as his mother, I started being bossy and controlling, and I missed my opportunity to just be his girlfriend and focus on knowing each other better and learn to spent more quality time indoors instead of fighting because we weren’t going out more in the middle of the pandemic!! I should have considered the fact that he never stopped working and I was just staying home all day, I could have modified my sleeping schedule to be awake for longer when he came home late at night from work and not fall asleep during all the movies we wanted to watch after dinner. I should have been more interested in learning how to play video games because it’s his thing and he would have loved it. I should have put much more effort into learning his language because I wasn’t being able to communicate with his people when I saw them and because he had no issue learning mine. I shouldn’t have been so financially comforting, I should have asked him to stick to his word of “providing for both of us” and do better with my own finances as well instead of just pointing fingers. I should have not pretended that things weren’t important when something was killing me inside. I should have been more authentic to myself, I could have remained the girl he met and fell in love with, I shouldn’t have fought him so hard to turn into my expectations and I should have focused more on being happy with myself and make the changes I needed to feel ok and don’t blame everything on him. 

He also has his share of the blame of course, there was a lot he could have done differently as well but he was just happy with my company, and to know avoiding my toxic behaviours would have made a gigantic difference kills me. He had a lot to learn and I understood that we I took him so I don’t know why I lost my patience so quickly that things started going south. I feel so responsible for all the pain even though he let me down so many times too.

We found each other broken and we were the light at the end of the tunnel we desperately needed. It hurts so much we just took a breath of fresh air and slowly started walking back into the darkness.

Price wise I am putting a hard limit of $75. I picked up a Optiplex 3050 for $40 on eBay last month to make a friend a Batocera rig so that price point is feasible IMO.  8th gen intel seems to be the most common around that price but if 9th or even 10th gen offers greater compatibility  I can look around for those if they stay within budget  If it can perform at least similar to a Coffee Lake iMac 19,2 that would be ideal.



The target requirements are I want it running Sonoma, be able to sleep, and audio out. I have hardwired CAT5 where its going.   



Yes, I took a look at the dortania guide and the FAQ sidebar here… which while people keep recommending it says it has not been updated in 4 years and its delves more into Clover as where everyone seems to have migrated to OpenCore.

My usual mornings: Visual problems are almost constant besides I am either dizzy or super tired. Then I drink a few sip of coffee and a lot of water thinking it may help a little. Then bamm, I feel like my head will explode, or like I will soon have a stroke, so I go out to the street to breath fresh air and also because I want to go to a public place so they can find me in case of dying. Then I come back, my hands are shaky, so I eat something then bamm super brain frog and I am still useless. Then it will slowly get better until evening. I am in my best self at the end of my workday, around 5 or 6 o'clock so I am trying to do the whole days work in 2 hours speed up version.

I spoke to my doctor about this and they said it might be a byproduct of the different binders used by the different manufacturers.

Here on this post I just really wanna gather how did some people overcome loneliness so maybe other ones can learn something from it. 

> Why this post ? I have a friend (we have not spoken for years) he suffers from loneliness, he does not wanna see a doctor because he thinks it's shameful and not worth it (there are many other reasons that I am surely not aware of). Whenever we do a small gathering back in my hometown (we are a small group of friends that did study together, the friendship is there) he would not come even though his mother urges him to go touch some grass and have a coffee with his friends.

so, everyone dealing with loneliness just know you are not alone and please seek help because there are some serious health concerns about it.

- someone who is a resident here
- someone who can pay his/her own share
- someone who is friendly, and not rude
- someone who causes no drama (I really don’t care if you’re single, in a relationship, married, etc)

1ieciwt,https://i.redd.it/xhccoicecbge1.jpeg,And this is how cross-species drug approval procedures were born.,"Through the 22nd century up to the 2170s, the Terran Colonies' government somehow managed to have consistent and effective policies for a long enough time to, through legislation, affordable and available addiction care, and an ungodly number of crackdowns, get to a place where most of the entire human race could finally be declared mostly drug-free. Humanity as a whole won the war on drugs, another step towards a thriving interstellar utopia. It was an amazing achievement, to say the least.

Fast forward some 70 years. The human race is now one of the founding species of the Interstellar Confederacy. Holy shit, isn't that awesome? We've made so many friends in such a short time! So many very. Different. Friends.

Enter Spero. Spero was the human-marketed brand name for a sedative that, on the species native to the planet it was originally used on, had only a very mild calming effect. Think, perhaps, the opposite of a cup of coffee. It should've been fine.

Cocaine. It was fucking cocaine.

Okay, not strictly cocaine, but the effect it had on humans made it practically cocaine. The exact opposite of what was intended, dialed up to 11. In a very short time, way too many humans were not only over-simulated, but also addicted to space cocaine.

The Terran Sub-federation attempted to solve the issue, but to no avail. It was way too late. A new iteration of a market for all kinds of drugs had already been starting to develop, most of the drugs alien in nature, with unexpected effects on the human body, and Spero was the first big one.

To this day (2340s), Spero, a.k.a. ""spears"", a.k.a. ""kit"", a.k.a. ""the whale"", a.k.a. ""the bugs"", and a multitude of other names of varying levels of obscenity, remains the most accessible illicit hard drug, especially due to the fact that it still remains a widely available alien sedative.

Behind the scenes fun fact: ""Spero"" is actually a kind of abbreviation-amalgamation of the words ""space heroin"" that I came up with when working on one of my main characters' backstory. Once I decided against the drug being space heroin, I briefly considered changing it to something that works with ""space cocaine"", but felt I'd need to apologise to the entire population of Spokane, wherever the hell that is.",6,1738322205.0,WorldBuildingMemes,2,1.0,False

I added a picture of the door of the kitchen and the entrance for reference since I would like to bring a bit of that color to the living room like a light wood coffee table or black being the tv stand is grey so I’m not sure what to choose and neither for a rug.

1iecedb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1iecedb/need_some_serious_advice_guys/,Need some serious advice guys!!!,"Hey everyone, I’m a 25-year-old guy from a small town in India, living with my mom and older brother. I graduated with a BCom degree in 2021. I took commerce because I didn’t think arts had much value, and I thought people who studied arts just ended up teaching. I wasn’t a bright student, and since my family isn’t wealthy, science wasn’t an option for me, so commerce seemed like the only path, even though I didn’t really have clear goals or plans at the time.

For the past 3.5 years, I’ve been working as a Quality Assurance specialist at a US-based IT firm, earning 25k a month. But lately, I’m feeling totally burned out. I’ve lost interest in everything, I don’t have a love life (I’m still stuck on a girl I once loved), and I just feel aimless with no real goals or passions. My dad passed away three years ago, and now I’m especially worried about my mom. I want to do something that would make her proud, just once.

I’m an introvert, I’ve gained a lot of weight, I’m struggling financially, I’ve lost my hair, and I’ve been dealing with back pain. I really don’t want to stay in the corporate world, but I don’t know what else I want to do. Even coffee doesn’t help me feel better anymore. I want to pursue different things, but I lose interest so quickly.

I’ve always enjoyed video games, but I’m not good enough to turn that into a career. I’ve got a tiny bit of interest left in art, so I’ve been thinking about switching to graphic design or animation. But here’s the thing: I don’t even have the tools to get started, and with money being tight, buying things seems impossible. To land a decent job in graphic design, I’d need skills, and I don’t have those yet. I really don’t like my current job, but I can’t quit until I find something else in design.

My life feels messed up right now, there are family issues, responsibilities, debt, and my mom is getting older. I have so many dreams, like traveling to different places, but I have no idea how I’ll ever achieve them if my life stays like this. I think I might be depressed and want to see a therapist, but I can’t afford it. Life is just passing by, and while my friends seem to be moving forward, I’m stuck in this endless loop. I’m late to work almost every day, and when I get home, I’m so exhausted I don’t even do chores. I just end up playing mobile games, which makes me feel a little happy because I love gaming.

I really don’t want to get old and feel like a failure. I want to build a better life for my family and for those who’ve supported me. Right now, I feel completely lost, and I could really use some advice. Sorry for writing so much but I need help.",1,1738321664.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False

1iecb7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Selfhelpbooks/comments/1iecb7j/a_book_that_has_really_stuck_with_me/,A book that has really stuck with me.," *Killer Habits* by Sree Krishna Seelam offers a unique perspective on personal growth, prioritizing contentment, compassion, and curiosity over the relentless pursuit of material success. Unlike many self-help books that impose rigid views, this one fosters a collaborative and engaging relationship between the author and the reader. Facts, personal experiences, and case studies back each habit introduced. The writing style is simple yet inspiring, creating an intimate atmosphere like a conversation over coffee. The interconnection of these habits forms a cohesive guide to personal growth, blending factual insights with relatable storytelling.

# Awake, Arise, and Kickass

The book opens with a compelling question: What do successful business executives, elite athletes, and top students have in common? The answer: They wake up early. The author emphasizes the importance of rising early and getting 7-8 hours of proper sleep, supporting this with research and experiments conducted by Aleksanteri and Antonie, Shai Danziger, and Fit Bit. He also draws from examples of Jews and Aristotle to illustrate why these are the first steps in making necessary life adjustments.

The conversational tone makes the advice feel personal, while the leading-by-example approach enhances credibility. I appreciate the emphasis on discipline and consistency as the pillars of long-term success. This chapter serves as a wake-up call, urging readers to take charge of their lives with immediate action.

# Be a Hero

This chapter, my personal favorite, highlights the importance of compassion in a world increasingly driven by self-interest. The author frames volunteering as an act of gratitude, stating, *""The value of life depends on the number of people we serve.""*

It also tackles pressing global issues such as animal cruelty, pollution, and human greed problems that are frequently discussed but rarely addressed with real momentum. The author uses vivid examples, from the floating island of plastic to oceanic dead zones and shrinking biodiversity, to paint a sobering yet necessary reality check. This chapter urges readers to reflect on their role in these issues and take actionable steps toward sustainability.

# Dromomaniac

Derived from the Greek words *dromos* (journey) and *maniac* (enthusiast), this chapter explores the transformative power of travel. The author encourages solo travel as a means of self-discovery, sharing personal experiences working in Mana village in 2015 and visiting Srinagar during unrest in 2016 that broadened his perspective.

To illustrate the psychological benefits of travel, the author references an experiment where rats placed in enriched environments with toys and mazes showed greater cognitive development than those in barren surroundings. This supports the idea that exposure to new and stimulating environments enhances mental agility and creativity.

Historical examples further emphasize this point, such as Einstein’s nature walks that led to breakthroughs in physics and Darwin’s observations in the Galápagos Islands, which shaped his Theory of Evolution. The chapter also highlights the value of cultural exposure, drawing parallels with Ivy League colleges' diverse admissions policies. Ultimately, the author argues that by connecting with the world, we stop seeking external validation and instead focus on meaningful growth.

# Live a Hundred Lives

This chapter champions the power of reading as a gateway to experiencing countless lives within a single lifetime. The author explains how reading sharpens decision-making, broadens perspectives, and even improves health. He advocates for autobiographies and memoirs, calling them *""hours spent with great souls.""*

The discussion also touches on how reading fosters empathy and character development, citing the famous Bobo doll experiment and the historic Baghdad book market. Additionally, the author examines the manipulation of education through state propaganda, referencing textbook revisions in Pakistan and Mao Zedong’s book bans in the 1960s. By investing in reading, we not only enhance our critical thinking but also cultivate a calm, well-informed mindset.

# Stay Curious

The final chapter underscores the importance of curiosity in rational thinking and decision-making. The author urges readers to question information, whether from politicians, religious leaders, or mainstream narratives and to verify credibility through independent research.

He also explores how moral values evolve, cautioning against blind adherence to societal norms. By staying curious and open-minded, we can avoid becoming passive followers and instead forge our paths. This thought-provoking conclusion encourages readers to continuously seek knowledge and challenge conventional wisdom.

# Final Thoughts

Unlike traditional self-help books that equate success with wealth, *5 Killer Habits* redefines it through contentment, compassion, and curiosity. The author’s blend of factual information, personal anecdotes, and a nonjudgmental tone makes for an inspiring and lasting read. Instead of offering fleeting motivation, the book provides tools for long-term growth and fulfillment.

By encouraging readers to give back, explore the world, and embrace lifelong learning, it shifts the focus from material success to meaningful connections and personal development. It’s a refreshing reminder that true success isn’t about money it’s about the memories we create and the lives we touch.

1iec9z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WingsOfFire/comments/1iec9z8/winfs_of_steel_snowstorms_regret_chapter_16/,Winfs of Steel. Snowstorm’s Regret. Chapter 16,"Icesurge had been keeping a close eye on his daughter and her father for the past few days now. *Her other father.* He thought with annoyance. *I know I’m her father, I’m referring to my husband. And yes, I’m stealing Blade’s fourth wall breaking.* He was currently pacing in the kitchen waiting for his coffee to finish brewing as he thought of ways to solve this haunting problem. 

“The icewing drinking coffee?” Icesurge temporarily stopped pacing to turn his head towards the voice. It was Steelblade slowly limping over. “Either you knew I wanted some and started it or you actually plan on drinking some.” The steelwing joked as he sat at the kitchen counter. Icesurge let out a small chuckle before subconsciously beginning to pace around again. “Thinking on how to help Nitride?” Steelblade asked, probably trying to distract the icewing. 

“Not just her.” Icesurge said with worry as he sat next to his father in law. “I’m worried about Boron, he’s not taking care of himself because of his worry over you and Nitride.” The coffee had finished brewing when it was done and Icesurge made an effort to get up and pour some mugs for him and Steelblade, who stopped him and got up to do it himself. “There’s only so much a thick shield of hardened ice can do.” He continued on venting to the old dragon. 

“Only so much anything can do.” Steelblade said with a sigh as he looked at his opened talons for a few seconds before clenching them. “But this is something that can be stopped, it’s been done before.” He added on as he slid a mug towards Icesurge, who in turn caught it with ease as he knew Steelblade’s drink sliding. “Heh, got that down pretty good kid.” Steelblade joked as he sat back down with his mug and took a drink. Icesurge’s mug was smaller but he didn’t mind. He probably wouldn’t drink as much as the bigger dragon and Steelblade did have a point, it was rare for him to drink coffee. “Have you considered asking some of Boron’s friends?” Steelblade asked after they had both taken a few sips of their coffee. 

“Only ones I could think of were Peril and Turtle.” Icesurge replied. “He said they were the ones he kept most in touch with.” He smirked as he lightly punched above the steelwing’s shoulder scar. “And you already beat me to them.” Steelblade let out a small chuckle. 

“What about Moon?” He asked before taking another drink of his coffee. “She’s rather impressive in the therapy department. Think I heard she was learning how to be a therapist even.” 

“That does sound helpful.” Icesurge said with agreement before thinking of something. “She could figure out who’s in Nitride’s head!” He said with excitement, causing Steelblade to jump slightly. He had a look of confusion on his scarred face before his transitioned to realization. 

“Her mind reading.” He said with hope. “You’re onto something kid.” He said as rubbed Icesurge’s head. “Well? What are you waiting for, get her over here.” Steelblade ordered as he got himself another cup of coffee. 

“Me?” Icesurge said with confused surprise. 

“You’re the one that thought of it.” Steelblade replied. “Plus she’ll know it’s both Boron and Nitride of importance if you go. She could tell it was mainly Boron I was worried about when I went to get Turtle.” Steelblade explained. “And don’t worry, I’ll tell the crew where you are.” Icesurge nodded at the steelwing, who nodded back, before he bolted out of the restaurant and into the sky towards Sanctuary. 

He landed in Sanctuary with so much speed, he slid past the house he wanted. He quickly jogged back to it and knocked on the door. He took the moment of waiting to catch his breath before he heard talonsteps nearing the door. The door opened and a sandwing with a scar over his snout was looking at Icesurge with confused greeting. 

“Where’s. Moon?” Icesurge said between breaths. 

“Just started her flight to visit the nightwing part of Glory’s kingdom.” Qibli replied. *Shit.* Icesurge thought as he quickly turned around before warm talons gripped his shoulder. “Hold on, give me something to go off of why you need her specifically really quick.” Qibli told him. 

“Her mind reading could identify who’s haunting my daughter.” Icesurge replied with urgency. 

“Fair enough, now get after her.” Qibli replied as he let go of Icesurge, who took off into the sky and bolted towards the rainforest. 

*Come on Moon.* Icesurge thought as he powered through the rain that was currently pelting towards him. *Where are you?* 

“Down here!” A voice called from before him. He saw light coming from a cave with a large nightwing standing out front. Icesurge turned his course towards the nightwing and landed in front of her. “What are you doing all the way out here in this whether?” Moon asked as she led Icesurge over to the fire and put a blanket over him. Even for an icewing of his caliber, he was cold from the rain. 

“You have the means of helping my daughter.” Icesurge replied after a few minutes. She looked at him with a confused look before he continued. “Your mind reading could identify who’s haunting her.” Moon looked at him for a few seconds, probably piecing together everything. “And Blade said you would also be good at calming Boron.” Icesurge added after a few seconds. 

“What’s wrong with Boron?” Moon asked with slight panic. 

“He hasn’t been taking care of himself because of his worry for Blade and Nitride.” Icesurge replied, hearing his own worry in his voice as he spoke of his broken husband. Moon nodded before she walked back over to the entrance to check the whether and walked back. 

“We’ll have to wait until the storm clears before we go back to Possibility.” She said with regret. 

“We don’t know how much time we have!” Icesurge said with panicked urgency. 

“It’s cold out there even for you.” Moon countered fiercely, sensing Icesurge was starting to let panic take over. “We’ll make better time when we aren’t being hit with raindrops the size of Kinkajou.” Icesurge waited for a few seconds, thinking over his options, before nodding as he looked into the fire, hoping to pass time. 

He woke up to talons shaking his shoulder. 

“Jeez you’re colder than I thought.” Moon said as she shook her talons. “Colder than Winter even.” Icesurge got bolted to the entrance of the cave to check the weather and saw it was a clear night. “I woke you up as soon as the storm cleared.” Moon said as she walked up next to him. “Let’s go.” She said as she took off and flew in the direction of Possibility that Icesurge didn’t expect from a nightwing her size. She was nearing Meerkat’s size and she was nearing Cavemaker’s speed. Icesurge didn’t waste any time being distracted by the nightwing’s impressive physical performance as he took to the skies and bolted after her. 

They got to Possibility and saw Steelblade pacing outside the restaurant. 

“Shit shit shit shit SHIT!” He ranted as he paced before he spotted them. “Nitride’s gone missing!” He said as they landed. *Oh no.* Icesurge thought with dread. *We’re too late.* He could feel his wings drooping. 

“When did she go missing?” Moon asked with worry. 

“Right before the storm hit.” Steelblade said, concern plaguing his voice. 

“Where’s my husband!?” A voice yelled with such panic, Icesurge could hardly believe he knew who it belinged to. Boron shoved past Steelblade and Icesurge immediately felt dread at the hybrid’s condition. His eyes were bloodshot and his legs were shaking from exhaustion, barely able to keep himself standing. Icesurge didn’t have a moment to say anything before the hybrid tackled him and forced him into a hug that he would never have been able to get out of. “I was so worried about you.” Boron started to sob into the back of Icesurge’s neck. The only movement the icewing could do to hug the hybrid back was lay his head along Boron’s shoulder. 

“Blade!” A voice boomed from down the street. Icesurge quickly spotted Queen Snowfall and a talon full of elite guards. “Do you have anything to do with the rebellion that appeared during the storm?” She asked with an accusatory tone. 

“Rebellion?” Moon asked with confusion. 

“Yeah, with his granddaughter in the lead.” Snowfall said angrily as she looked on at Steeblade. 

“Nitride?” Icesurge asked with confusion. *What is she doing leading a rebellion?* He thought. *And better yet, HOW?* Icesurge looked at his father in law and saw panicked realization in his eyes. 

“Queen Snowfall.” Steelblade started. “I promise that you’ll have your throne back and this rebellion gone or turned back in your favor.” *Turned back in her favor?* Icesurge thought with confusion.* Boron had loosened his grip on the icewing at the mention of their daughter and appeared to be listening. “Just…. Give us some time.” The icewing queen snorted at him. 

“Fine. We’ll be around.” Queen Snowfall said before she turned down a different street out of sight. 

“Well shit just got a hundred times worse.” Steelblade groaned. Icesurge saw Turtle walk up next to the steelwing and looked at him with a look that said the two of them had a theory. And by the way Steelblade nodded at Turtle, the theory was confirmed. 

“Boron. Icesurge.” Steelblade started. “Come with me.” Boron let go of Icesurge and stood up, scales near his eyes stained in tears. Icesurge put his wing over the hybrid and let him lean against the icewing as they followed the steelwing to their room. 

“How and why would Nitride lead a rebellion against Snowfall?” Boron asked almost to himself with a sob. 

“I don’t know.” Icesurge said as he put his chin on top of the hybrid’s head. “But we’ll get her back.” 

“I know how. But not why.” Steelblade answered. “And I don’t know whether she got it from Icesurge’s blood. Or distantly from Boron.” He continued. 

“Where she got what?” Boron asked with sobbing confusion. Steelblade took a deep sigh before looking them both in the eyes somehow with his one. 

“Your daughter is an animus.”

1iec90y,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1iec90y/stomach_fat_and_cutting/,Stomach fat and Cutting,"Hello!  
Can I get any advices on how to drop more fat? Most of my fat are in my stomach. Sitting or standing, I still have a beer belly (though I don't drink) but if I flex my abs, it will be minimized and the upper 4 packs will be visible. I am already on the end of my 4th month of my cutting phase.

I typically lift/do body weights 4-5 times a week, around 1-1.5 hours. On my rest days when I can (around 1-2 times per week), I try to run 3-5km.

I am 30, male. 176cm (5'8"") and according to my non-digital weighting scale, I am around 68-69kg (150-152lbs). I usually weigh after I wake up in the morning and pee and before drinking any fluids. My work is just a desk job so not much physical activity.

Last week, I had my Body Composition Analysis taken with InBody (the one with sensor for hands) to get a reference where I am at.

The result is as follow (will also include previous results):

|Period|Weight (kg)|Soft Lean Mass (kg)|Percent Body Fat (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024/07/19 (mid-bulk)|69|56.8|12.8%|
|2024/09/20 (near end of bulking)|74.2|58.4|16.6%|
|2025/01/21(cutting)|67.8 (8.8kg)|56.2 (16.6 kg)|12.2% (8.3kg)|

Before I stared bulking seriously, I was at 63kg.

Between July and September, I mostly got fat according to that. lol

I started cutting last year October and to be honest, my cutting phase is not good, I had a 1 week trip with friends last October so could not really exercise and cut properly. Then, for December and January, there were Christmas and New Year.

I started running last late November but got injured so it got stopped and I just resumed it late December.

According to the Segmental Fat Analysis, this is my fat distribution.

I don't really take any supplements aside from Whey and sometimes, caffeine from coffee.

I drink Vitamin C and D but for health purposes since I don't have chances to go out much while there still sun outside.

This sub helped me get in tip top shape for my long rides and now, I once again require your expertise!

So here's the thing, I'll be coming from BGC going to Rizal Windmill Farm as suggested by people but I'm not quite sure of its difficulty.

For a brief background that will hopefully help you gauge my capability, I recently rode to Tagaytay via Conchu-Amadeo with 3 stops (supplies and bathroom) for the whole duration of the climb. My bike is on the heavy side so I'd say speed was roughly 11-15kmh and with plenty of energy to spare to return after a **mediocre** ramen lunch.

Now compared to the Rizal climb, how's the difficulty level?

P.S. here's a screenshot of the route I plan on taking and any suggestions are very much welcome.

And do ignore the McDonalds breakfast 1st stop... ❤

We were traveling with another couple, and we shared a taxi (5-seater) along with the driver. The other woman and I got out to grab a cup of coffee, while my wife and the other man, along with the driver, continued on for another 100 meters to use a restroom near the toll gate. Unfortunately, a truck carrying tons of stone collided with the car, and the stones fell onto it, crushing it severely.

I had no idea about the incident until I arrived at the scene and saw a crowd gathered. The car was on fire, and I fainted upon seeing the tragedy. I was taken to a nearby hospital to recover. Sadly, the bodies of my wife and the other man were crushed and burned beyond recognition. 

TLDR:

Morticians and doctors informed us that they would not be able to separate the two bodies. As a result, the wife of the other man and I decided to bury them together in a large coffin and put up a memorial for both. However, I am unhappy with this arrangement because I thought of burying my wife separately.",15,1738320980.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.89,False
1iec6nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Maxwellknowsitall/comments/1iec6nc/the_wrestler/,The Wrestler,"It was not the how of the thing that bothered him, but the why. Anton had always been strong, even as a boy. ‘*Mon petit ours,’* that was how his mother had taken to calling him; she would not have done so if he had a feeble child. Yet Anton had always been gentle. He liked his coffee with plenty of sugar, he liked to read, and he liked to stroll down the boulevards on long summer evenings. He had apprenticed as a typesetter at one of the great Parisian publishing houses, and that job had suited him well. He liked the feel of paper and the strong smell of ink that lingered on his fingers. Poets, authors and great minds, all had come to have their words printed on common paper, so that the people of Paris might hear their voices. Anton could not imagine a more noble profession, and the pay had not been half bad either. For ten years he had managed to send enough money home to keep his mother afloat. An act for which she was eternally grateful, if her letters were to be believed. It was a shame that things had had to come to an end. Before it had managed to find its feet, the second republic had come to an end. Napoleon – *a* Napoleon, at any rate – once again sat upon the throne, and he had not appreciated some of the things Anton had helped print about his uncle. The publishing house had been shut down, and the market was… less than flourishing. He had been afraid, for himself, for his mother, but that had proven needless. This was Paris, the city of light and commerce, and there was always money to be made. And Anton had always been strong.

The air was chilly and restless. From beyond the red curtain, the sounds of grunts, meat and tickled observers spilled forward endlessly. They were fighting, Anton knew, and it was not exactly dangerous, but it still made him nervous. He had been trained for no more than two weeks; his saving grace was his strength and his size. Even the more experienced wrestlers struggled to wrench him down. This should have been a point of confidence for Anton, but it was not. He hated the moist, desperate slapping of palms and muscles. Now that people were watching, he hated it even more. He was not made to be a wrestler, he did not have the heart. Competition made him sick to his stomach, and the thought he might hurt someone kept him up at night. People were rarely hurt during these matches, but it happened. The a-rhythmic, senseless cacophony of combat was so different from the measured, regular humming of machinery that Anton preferred. In this place there were no guarantees. He looked past the draped curtains. Two men he did not know looked like they were trying to kill one another while the crowd watched from above. The crowds came here every night, and, though he had no way of knowing, he felt they hungered for blood. Anton fidgeted, uneasy in his own skin. Like the men in the arena he was stripped down to his breeches and lightly oiled. He felt more like a prized cow than a man. The crowd roared excitedly as one man picked up the other by the waist and flung him to his right. The one thrown landed on his back, making a face that Anton could not make out from where he stood. Soon it would all be over, he told himself. They did not care if he won or lost, he only had to go out there and be strong, that was all they wanted. If he won he would be Heracles, if he lost, Goliath. It could not matter less to Anton, he just wanted it over. He thought of his mother, what would she say if she saw him now? Perhaps not much, she knew the value of making ends meet. She had always been against him leaving for Paris and, in a way, this was his punishment. Anton was not so sure he had done anything wrong. The two men grabbed at each other, both clearly panting for breath. The had gone on for longer than expected, and still no victor had been declared. Their palms met in a serious of rising strike, each deflected by the next, the motion building their postures until they stood almost at full height opposite one another. Then something happened that Anton could not make out. The man who had been thrown earlier stumbled, a slight waiver, but enough to knock him off balance. He fell backwards, reaching out for his opponent for purchase. Sweat, oil, and fatigue denied him. When his head met the earth, it made sickening sound that was immediately lost in the surrounding cacophony. A confused silence followed. It had happened, but not the way they had wanted it to. It was not yet clear if the man was dead, or simply unconscious. Four attendants entered the arena with a stretcher and removed the body. When they passed Anton he noted how the man had refused to bleed. In a way, it was almost a waste.",1,1738320779.0,u_Maxwellknowsitall,0,1.0,False

1iebzpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1iebzpn/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

It is about curating a space that combines elegance, comfort, and style. Whether you are designing a new living area or giving your existing one an upscale makeover, certain elements will elevate the ambiance and make it feel like a five-star retreat. Below are the top ten must-have elements that will turn your living room into a luxurious haven.

**1. Quality Seating**

Seating is the foundation of any living room and is essential for both comfort and style. Invest in high-quality sofas or sectionals that offer deep cushions, plush upholstery, and ample space. Look for materials like velvet, leather, or fine linen for a sophisticated touch. Make sure to choose seating that is appropriately sized and arranged to allow for both socializing and a sense of openness in the room.

**2. Statement Lighting Fixtures**

Lighting can completely transform a space. In a luxurious living room, it is crucial to choose fixtures that not only serve as functional lighting but also act as focal points. Chandeliers or pendant lights made from crystal, metal, or glass can add a touch of grandeur. Additionally, table lamps and floor lamps with intricate designs will help create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Layering different light sources from overhead, floor, and table lights will enhance the room’s overall aesthetic.

**3. Rich Textures and Fabrics**

Luxurious living rooms often feature a variety of textures to create depth and interest. Mixing fabrics like silk, cashmere, wool, and velvet adds a tactile quality to the space. Consider draping your windows with heavy silk curtains that fall gracefully to the floor. Incorporating plush throw pillows, soft area rugs, and cozy throws will help create a rich and inviting environment. These textiles not only look great but also add comfort to your living room.

**4. Artwork and Sculptures**

Art is one of the most effective ways to add personality and character to a living room. Bold, large-scale artwork or sculptures can serve as the room’s focal point, tying the entire design together. Whether you choose classical oil paintings, modern abstract art, or a striking sculpture, make sure it resonates with your style. Place the art in prominent positions, such as above the sofa or on an accent wall, to highlight its beauty.

**5. High-End Rugs**

An exquisite area rug can tie the entire room together and provide comfort underfoot. Choose a rug made from luxurious materials such as wool, silk, or cotton, and consider patterns or colors that complement your overall design. A Persian or oriental rug can instantly elevate a room with its intricate patterns and timeless appeal. Make sure the rug is the right size for your space so it doesn’t overpower the room but rather enhances it.

**6. Custom-Made Furniture**

While mass-produced furniture can serve its purpose, custom-made furniture allows you to create pieces that perfectly suit your living room’s size, style, and needs. Opt for bespoke furniture designs that reflect your taste, whether it’s a tailored sofa, hand-carved coffee table, or a unique bookshelf. Customization ensures that every item is functional, fits the space well, and adds a one-of-a-kind touch to your home.

**7. Aesthetic and Functional Storage Solutions**

In a luxurious living room, organization is key. Elegant storage solutions can help maintain a clean and clutter-free environment while contributing to the room’s style. Built-in shelves, stylish cabinets, and sleek storage ottomans can hide away everyday items while adding beauty to the space. Consider integrating luxury materials like lacquered wood, glass, or mirrored finishes for a touch of sophistication.

**8. Indoor Plants**

Adding greenery to a living room will not only enhance the air quality but also make the room appear more natural in beauty. Tall plants such as fiddle leaf figs, palms, or snake plants can fill empty corners and provide a refreshing contrast with luxurious furniture and décor. For a more dramatic effect, choose a large statement plant or a collection of smaller plants placed strategically around the room. These natural elements help soften the overall design and bring life to the space.

**9. A Cozy Fireplace**

There’s nothing more luxurious than a fireplace that serves as the centrepiece of your living room. Whether you opt for a traditional wood-burning fireplace or a sleek modern design, a fireplace adds warmth, elegance, and charm. A stone or marble surround can enhance the aesthetic of your living room, making the space feel cozy yet grand. Even in warmer climates, an electric fireplace can still provide the ambiance of a traditional one without the heat.

**10. Smart Home Features**

Technology plays a crucial role in modern luxury living. Integrating smart home features can make your living room more functional and convenient. Voice-controlled lighting, automated window shades, and smart speakers offer both style and practicality. Additionally, consider adding a top-of-the-line sound system for an immersive audio experience during movie nights or entertaining guests.

**Conclusion**

Transforming your [living room](https://kingsmendecors.com/) into a luxurious retreat requires attention to detail, a blend of high-quality elements, and a thoughtful approach to design. By incorporating these ten must-have elements, from statement furniture to smart home technology, you can create a space that exudes sophistication, comfort, and timeless elegance. Whether you're relaxing with family or hosting guests, your luxurious living room will be a testament to your impeccable taste and attention to detail.",1,1738319816.0,u_Remarkable_Bus7256,0,1.0,False
1iebyul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1iebyul/11_days_by_god/,11 days by God,"So glad to be done with the FF prison.  I, like many of you,  started with curiosity.  At the time I started,  I was 3 years Booze sober and 1 year off weed.  Life was good, but like the addict that I am,  I was looking for that feeling.  That feeling you get when you take that first hit. The one you get when you feel the first shot or beer kicking in.  IYKYK. 
I saw these over and over at Circle K, and the more often I saw it,  the more curious I got.  I finally caved one day in April last year when I asked the guy behind the counter of he'd ever tried one.  He said that It was a legal euphoric high that relaxed you,  but energized and gave you focus.  I bought just the one.  After finding out it tasted like fucking swamp water,  that first bottle was like falling into a wonderland of blissful relaxation,  and energy for days. Hours at my job floated away. I could focus.  I was anxiety and depression free. I felt no pain.  I thought ""Hey,  this isn't bad at all"". GSUS was I wrong.  
After a week,  I stopped in an grabbed another one.  Same thing.  Beautiful dopamine and serotonin release. Great sex.  Day at work went well. Then the next time I stopped in (2 days later) I got 2. I took one in the morning,  and one in the afternoon.  Feeling ""Free"" and working like a machine,  I thought I'd found gold.  
Then the next day I got 2 more. (A $10 a pop, mind you) Then I bought 2 more the next day.  The two days were 3. Then 4. Then 5. 
They called to me in a way not even booze or weed ever did.  Over the course of the next month I was buying 5 or 6 every day.  I wasn't sleeping well,  I wasn't eating much,  and the days I actually had off work,  my body would crash and burn and sleep for 12 -15 hours just to wake up and start the cycle again. 
I was up to 6-8 a day by November.  My skin was flaking off and I looked powdered in the mornings around my face.  My sex drive was gone.  My hair was thinning. I was a pale, exhausted, invalid, shell, going through the cracked out, gas station heroin that this stuff truly is.  
December at Christmas,  I had a brief break from it for 3 days while I joined my parents on a road trip up to Virginia to see my brothers family.  Those 3 days were freedom.  I ate great food like I hadn't eaten in months,  I was surrounded by family and Love, and I didn't think anything about this Swamp water.  Then,  the first thing I did when I got home was buy 3 for that night and the next day. I drank all 3 of those bottles on the way home,  had to stop on the side of the road,  and proceeded to throw up.  It was explosive and I lost 3 cups of coffee, and all the food in my stomach.  Once I was empty,  I bought 3 more.  Went on a long drive feeling high as hell,  and then stopped and bought 2 more. 

I started praying for God to help me.  I told Him I'd cut back,  and I needed strength to hold me to it.  But the next day,  I'd be back to it.  4,5,6 to 10 a day at the start of this January.  By my Birthday on the 15th, I'd held steady at 4 to 5, but I knew that it needed to stop. On the 19th,  I got down on my knees and said I needed intervention.  I asked God one last time for his help to get rid of this Demonic Blue Bottle. 
The next day,  I bought 2 in the morning, and went into work.  Right after I finished the 2nd one,  and started working on my last client of the day, the chills started in my arms.  They spread all across my upper body and the only warmth I felt was in my chest.  Soon my entire body was ice, and all I wanted to do was be warm, get home  and sleep.  

When I got off work,  I was nauseous,  cold,  exhausted, and dead to the world.  Luckily I had the next day off because I was done.  Fever of 102. Stomach wouldn't hold anything down.  Upper respiratory infection.  I couldn't get out of bed,  let alone get any of this Garbage.  I was feverish and had both types of the flu. (On top of the CT DT WD's) I was down for the count for 7 days.  4 of which I didn't sleep because of the withdrawals and my throat feeling like I was deep throating Jack Frosts pet pinecone.

The only things I was able to ingest and keep down for a week were coffee, broth, and a couple gas station sandwiches. 

11 days later,  I'm free.  I don't need them.  I want nothing to do with this nasty shit anymore. I spent thousands in hard earned cash, isolated myself  in order to maintain my cycle,  and was a slave to the ""Feel Free"" Devil for far too long. 

Whether you believe in Him or not,  I give thanks to God for answering my prayer,  and not giving me the option to continue in my addiction.  Every day,  I feel better,  and more like myself.  

I've been reading the posts on this page for far longer than I've been sober from this stuff,  and you guys are a phenomenal group of support, love,  and testimony. This stuff is pure evil,  and I wouldn't wish it's addiction on anyone. 
 
Thank all of you for your continued support,  and even if this helps just one person, I want them to know that we're in this recovery game together.  You aren't alone.  Yes,  failure happens,  but the strength to try again and keep moving forward is the key to actually being free from addiction.  

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.  Stay strong. ",3,1738319795.0,Quittingfeelfree,1,1.0,False
1iebxrl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iebxrl,Advice in colors for living room (open space),"
As the title says, which colors do you think would go with the living room to make everything blend together? 

We moved not very long ago and there are many things we still need to do like getting a chandelier over the dining table, coffee and side tables, plants, rugs, etc. but I feel very confused atm since I’m not sure about which color we should use for a rug in the living room, cushions and art that could fit the dining table and desks😣

I added a picture of the door of the kitchen and the entrance for reference since I would like to bring a bit of that color to the living room like a light wood coffee table or black being the tv stand is grey so I’m not sure what to choose and neither for a rug.

Another doubt I have are the PC setups and if there’s a way to make it look better. We are thinking in changing the desk and chairs and getting something custom made but it wouldn’t be anytime soon.

Results were good.

Now with the Pietro, I tried doing the same but the results are not as good, the brews taste just ""intense/sweet"" but without any discernible note; if I try going coarser, the brews are just acidic, not bad and sour, it's a good acidity but again, it's just that with no other notes. So I'm oscillating between just-sweetness and just-acidity, without any muddiness but also without any notes in both cases?

I see a lot of people saying they are grinding between 7-8 on the dial, how do you do it, I'm trying between 4-5 and at 5 the acidity already starts going into the bad sour territory 😩 I use only 12g of coffee",1,1738319576.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1. I am a hardcore coffee lover. Hence, the ""I drink coffee like a Gilmore"".
2. I am into books, hence the bookshelf.
3. Always Team Jess.
4. I always wanted to have the same bond with my mother like how Rory had with Lorelai.
5. The same way I feel when someone ask me to calm down and do my work.

One side of the shop was a normal book store and the other side a small cosy cafe. Some people had come on a date there having coffee, chatting, smiling, blushing! One guy was just sitting having hot chocolate may be, reading a book with green, pink and neon highlighters lying around the table. One girl was sitting at the corner attending a group call. The book store owner was a kind and sweet man. He let me roam around going through the books at my own time. Also gave me two bookmarks. Wanted to have a coffee there, but wasn't alone. The person with me though a great-great friend, doesn't read that much.. So there was no point forcing. Left the shop with the thought of coming back someday have a book in one hand and coffee in other.

1iebsf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iebsf3/i_get_it_i_finally_get_it_and_make_perfect/,I get it! I finally get it and make perfect espresso! [story time],"So I have been interested in making good coffee for a while now. I like drinking coffe, in particular I like to sit down with a nice cup of cappuccino or flat white and enjoy it through all the stages, from burning hot all the way to cold.

So I finally got myself an espresso machine. I wasn't happy with it - no matter what, it made just a bad tasting coffee. So I got myself another one.

And it was better. Not by a whole lot, but it was manual, and not automatic, so I knew I can make it better. So I started. And fell into quite a rabbit hole, in no small part thanks to this subreddit, but also YouTube coffee influencers.

I started making coffee, tweaking, buying different beans, additional equipment, learning about the coffee theory, all the ratios, roasts, times underextraction, overextraction, channelling. I've wasted A LOT of coffee and money for that. Bottomless portafilters, WDT tools, funnels, puck screens. And even if I made a good tasting coffee, I was like ""Well, the ratio is not good, so it must be possible for it to be better"". I would get frustrated, almost throwing this whole setup to bin. I just stopped drinking coffee at all, frustrated, that I can't make it perfect! And even if I did, got the ratio correct, the pull time, no channelling, good looking crema, from a bottomless basket... It didn't taste good for me.

I took a week off. Didn't even look at the machine. But at some point I just needed this ""boost"" only coffee can provide. I couldn't find my bottomless portafilter, so I grabbed the stock pressurized one, weighted more or less 14 g of beans, set my grinder to arbitrary number I pulled out of my \*\*\* (in reality I just looked at the time, it was 7:49, so I just set it to 49, seemed about right since the grinder manual advises 40 for espresso in bottomless basket), made coffee, frothed some milk, poured it in the cup...

And it was a perfect cappuccino. At least for me. It tasted good, it was the best coffee I have ever drinked. And at this point I just stopped caring about being ""perfect"" as in ""objectively perfect espresso"". Yes, I pulled a shot from pressurized basket on cheap machine, with ""more or less"" 14 g of beans, with grind size I just guessed, frothed milk with panarello. Didn't weight it, didn't care about the ratio, there was some channelling, but I shrugged it off. And I enjoyed it. I just started enjoying my coffee instead of forcing myself to do it ""the proper way"". 

So yeah. Making coffee for me is not about ratios, weights, pressures, channels. It's about dialing it in in a way, you have a coffee that you like. Not objectively perfect. Just perfect FOR YOU!",2,1738319007.0,espresso,0,0.75,False

I F31 years old met a male online M35 years old on a matrimonial  website .  I Kind of started liking  him . We talked for more than a month almost on video everyday . He Complimented me multiple times and we talked a lot called me beautiful  2 -3 times .I started falling for him . We both had traumatic  breakups in the past. His breakup led him to drinking problems which he resolved  completely but still drinks occasionally Which i am fine with . I am sober since 5 years and don’t enjoy drinking .

He was in multiple relationships in the past but was serious for only one girl.. He asked me to visit his city and I booked plane tickets but made sure I was safe .                                                  His behaviour one day changed and he stopped calling and removed me from Instagram . I got scared . So after 2-3 days of silence and my messages and miss calls   he called me back . He said  he removed me from Instagram because I added few girls from his contacts . He said “why are u possessive u are not my gf or wife. Why u have trust issues ?  “.                                     .

I said add me back he said no. I said sorry million times. I said I booked tickets to his city and will he talk to me in future he said he doesn’t know . He said he doesnt know he will meet me . He further asked me about my studies  and any test results I got . He later left for work. I got scared. I  messaged him sorry million times, apologised and even removed Instagram for him  . I messaged him all this but I got no reply. No text no call . He later added me back on Instagram but didn’t reply or call.             Later.                                                                                                     I messaged him that I am coming to his city is he still up for meeting me . We didn’t call each other like before and  it was only texting . He said yes as promised I will meet u.

I Reached airport and messaged him. After I  reached to his city I messaged how bad the hotel system is here he said I could have crashed as his place . I said I didn’t wanted to be a burden . He said no burden . So next day the day came  and we met .                      I tried to look my best ..

I video called my sister to ask me how I am looking she said u look good  generally she is pretty blunt so I believed her . We met each other in the mall. We spent few hours their roaming . Initially he was reserved and we walked for sometime in the mall .

IT was our first meeting .                                                        initially Their wasn’t much eye contact and his body language appeared shy and closed but later he started opening up. I said I expected the city to be chiller  therefore I am wearing warm clothes  he joked that the city is less chiller  now because of entry of hot people . I was smiling a lot . He said he wanted to drink beer and let’s have some  beer . I said sure .

We both  had beer. I generally don’t drink much but he took me to this amazing brewery where I had the best beer of my life  and the food was good and we both loved it . He loved the chicken  . We talked a lot  and he made a lot of eye contact their . we Spent some time their . He made few jokes . Laughed and smiled a lot. He told me I am a really good girl infact a very good girl and he is a bad boy and I deserve better. He asked me about my studies   . Maybe he needed beer to open up . It was just 5 percent alcohol so I was comfortable but it made me a bit wobbly while walking because I have been sober since 5 years .

We discussed what we can do next  and planned to visit a famous place and monument  in the city but we were near the closing time . We both took a cab to his place. We took selfies in his phone  . In cab we spoke about our life and we spoke about our exes. I asked him why he was serious about his ex . He said he was physically attracted to her  and she gave him answers to him in ways he didn’t think about or his mind couldn’t decipher  and she reassured him in ways which comforted him.

He said it’s not like he hasn’t dated prettier girls than her but he was attracted to her but it was the worst most horrible breakup he had which devastated him. He dated other girls but it never lasted long . In cab he said I was bold etc. and he was sitting very close to me . He said even men want love  and affection but we don’t say  and there is nothing wrong in being desperate in relationship.

So we reached his place and entered his apartment. He kept his tv on and played romantic songs on it in the background . I was sitting in his bed with him after sometime he started kissing me and making out with me . Honest I didn’t plan to have sex but went with the flow . He started massaging and sucking my boobs and soon we had sex . We had sex like  3- 4 times in those  4-5 hours . We did it in tv lights and he kept the room lights off . It wasn’t dirty sex infact very loving . Tons of kissing ,cuddling ,hugging , keeping his face near my chest  and looking deeply in my eye during sex . He would bury his face in my chest and try to nap like a baby .

But after we are done he would bury himself under the sheets or wrap a towel around himself instead of being naked . He said he preferred it that way .  We talked during sex and he said please don’t ask me very emotional deep questions I don’t have answers to them . He said in bed that girls  always look to marry or go for hypergamy and will leave u if they found someone better.He said it’s not my fault with how things are.I said I want to love him and care about him and I will never leave him , I will be very loyal to him etc but he didn’t reply he just gently said these things are rubbish and don’t exist. I think he didn’t believe me .He asked me what I liked about him and I told him many reasons one of them is how he raised his eyebrows and he jokingly raised them multiple times. . I think he doesn’t believe me .

We hugged after sex too 2-3 times . We dressed and he helped me in getting dressed  politely and he made coffee. He said his workplace treats him like shit and donkey and he feels he has forgotten himself in all this. He doesn’t feels like himself anymore . He feels he is in a low phase of life  and before he felt like powerfull but now he feels he is very low . I told him isn’t it better a girl likes u in your low phase he said maybe u wouldn’t like me in my high phase because u would think I  am egoistic . I said it’s not like that. He booked a cab to my hotel so that I can take my things to airport later .

He was talking a lot with me in cab . He dropped me off to the hotel and wanted to hug me but we couldn’t because people were around me and I am not into pda. I told him I will miss him he said he will miss me to .  
When I reached airport I texted him that I reached airport . He texted back that he enjoyed us and also said thanks for coming with a hug emoji.

After few days I messaged him that I wanna talk to him and he said sure . He called me after 2 day moderately drunk  I told him I missed him he said noted . I asked him how did he find me he said very nice very good . He said he wants me to study a lot and send him results of my scores.  I later messaged him I want to be loyal to u he said that is your wish but don’t expect anything  from me .i later texted him my Scores and he said good. I asked him what are u looking for in a girl he said someone who loves him with a lot of intensity and affection and he meets her every single day Like female Kabir Singh ( Kabir Singh is a guy who loves his gf a lot but gets very violent , alcoholic and desperate after she leaves him. ) because that’s how he loves . He said meeting onetime is not  enough. He wants everyday . I said I will try very hard so that I can come to his place to stay which involves lot of work . He said u will have to work very hard to reach here  . I said I will work hard.  
I said I missed him he said noted Later I texted him I wanna be exclusive and loyal he said that’s your wish but don’t expect anything from me. I didnt message him again .

I like him and I don’t know what’s going on. I think I should move on but I am not able to .

Is he comparing me to his ex ? Is he actually avoidant and emotionally unavailable ?

what should I do?  
no text or message from his side
