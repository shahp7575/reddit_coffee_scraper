I'm a nerdy, awkward, introvert [looking](https://drive.proton.me/urls/MAQH5Y8PZ4#dVnSMKUoNB6H) for a long-term, monogamous, childfree relationship. I can be slow to warm up to people, especially physically, but definitely a cuddler once we've established that rapport. People I'm comfortable around know to expect bad jokes and general goofiness. Living the millennial dream as a WFH desk jockey with an unrelated bachelors degree, living in an overpriced 1-BR apartment.

What I'm looking for:

A woman (sorry boys) who is introspective, desires to grow as a person and have a positive impact on the world around them. Someone who is open to sharing their whole self and receptive to me as a full person. A partner in the most complete sense of the word... Pretty lofty goals for a reddit post, so realistically I'd be happy to chat with like-minded folks.

An assortment of things I like:

- Running - [it's fun I swear](https://drive.proton.me/urls/RBCH1RK538#f9T3YfEwT8su)
- [Hiking/backpacking](https://drive.proton.me/urls/TCQSM7F0KC#EkDBEcM2OYwX) - sometimes I even make it to [the summit](https://drive.proton.me/urls/CRQ3JBVXT8#zRlcVidmZ3KA)
- My family - they're good people and like me, it's great
- Broccoli - all-star vegetable (*must be cooked)
- Learning something new or working on a project in my ceaselessly growing backlog
- Reading, mainly fantasy
- Coffee - top tier beverage and flavor
- Hearing different perspectives on how the world ""really is""
- Podcasts - ""The Rest is History"" was my top listen in 2024
- Puzzles, riddles, and scavenger hunts  

For those that don't like to look at pictures here's how I'd describe my appearance:

- 5'10"" (179cm for the enlightened)
- Kinda thin, but working on gaining muscle through calisthenics
- Skin tone which puts me in the ""burns easily"" & ""skin cancer risk"" categories
- Short-ish brown hair with length varying by season/ambient temperature
- Bearded, out of convenience
- Glasses - to ensure I conform to ""nerdy"" stereotypes
- Pierced ears, because it's less commitment than a tattoo

Even if you can endure my dumb jokes, my lifestyle and views may not appeal to you. Here are some of the big ones which may be turn-offs:

- I'm frugal and working towards financial independence. I have a decent job in a field that interests me, but I find having a 9-5 to be a grind. I would not describe myself as ""ambitious"" and any desire I have to advance my career is rooted in the hope that by achieving financial security I will be able to live a [simpler, more fulfilling life](https://drive.proton.me/urls/CAV6K5N5AM#KAb9JaVP12Hj).
- I'm car-free. Living in the Boston area allows me to get around without needing a car, which I absolutely love. I'd much rather be stepping, pedaling, or strap-hanging than behind a steering wheel. I live on the Red Line if that means anything to you. I think cars are one of the most destructive inventions of all time and will talk your ear off about it given the chance (you've been warned). I know most people in the US need a car to get around and definitely don't judge those that do. I dread moving to a place where I'd need to own a car again, but it feels almost inevitable.
- Leftist. I think most everyone can agree that there are lots of problems in the world today. I don't think our current system, with so much power in the hands of so few, is good for the well-being of most people. I spend time thinking about what a post-capitalist society could be and how to realize that change (cringe I know).
- Atheist. Was raised in a non-religious household and never felt drawn to it. I'm wary of the coercive power that ""eternal damnation/salvation"" can exert.
- Child-free. Never really had an interest in kids and now that I'm the age where my peers are having kids, I'm more confident it's not for me. I have fun playing with younger relatives but it's nice to be able to hand them back to their parents when it's time to go (or they start crying).

If all that sounds like something you'd want to get involved with, send me a DM. Sleuths are encouraged to send an email, those really persistent could send a letter. Stalkers are gently discouraged from waiting outside my apartment.

I eagerly await first contact. 👽",1,1743285791.0,u_Decroded-Ant-923,0,1.0,False

1jmxf1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/theregulationpod/comments/1jmxf1l/english_vs_american_breakfast/,English vs American Breakfast,"I’d like to propose a discussion here:

Traditional English Breakfast:
Bacon,
sausage(s) — Not always specified,
eggs (of a choosing),
Mushrooms (fried),
Tomatoes (fried or grilled),
Black pudding,
Baked Beans,
fried or Toasted bread

Geoff’s “American”breakfast:
Two eggs,
Hashbrowns,
Crispy bacon,
Toast (with butter and jams)


Let’s break this down on a couple levels:

Both breakfasts contain: eggs, toast. 

English breakfast contains more things (which could be more filling, potentially)

Things Geoff left out on a potential “quintessential” American breakfast — American sausage (links, patties, or ‘scrambled’, by his own words.) 

A potential point of preference: coffee vs tea. 

I’d like to offer a better rebuttal that fits Geoff’s argument for the “quintessential” American breakfast, that better aligns with the number of ingredients with Gavin’s English Breakfast:

Two Eggs (eaters choice),
toast (butter and jam choice for the eater),
Crispy Bacon,
hashbrowns,
sausage (links or patties, eaters choice),
Biscuits with white pepper gravy (no need for sausage gravy, because of previous sausage entry),
Two pancakes,
Black Coffee.

“sauce” (syrup in the context for Gavin, subsequently, Mechanic, agreeing)
Acceptable syrups: Maple, Blackberry, Blueberry, and an outlier — Boysenberry.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

Is anyone here seriously learning **Italian** or **Spanish** and looking for a study partner? I know a small bit of both but have been pretty lazy about studying for the past few years, and I’m ready to change that! Either language is fine since I have to learn both. I know there are classes in C'ville, but this works better for me.

Your current level doesn’t matter - what *does* matter is your dedication. I’m looking for someone who genuinely wants to speak, understand, and write the languages and who plans to put in the work to do so.

I’d love to meet 1-3 times a week (or more!) at the library (preferred) or a local coffee shop to practice and stay accountable. We can also keep in touch throughout the week to reinforce what we’re learning and share resources.

Eventually, I plan to hire a native Italian/Spanish teacher to help with pronunciation, grammar, colloquialisms, etc. and you’d be welcome to join, no cost to you! That way, we can get real-time corrections and improve faster.

If you’re serious about learning and can commit to regular practice, let’s do this! But if you’re unsure or can’t make the time, no worries - I totally understand and would be happy to pair up when you can make it a priority.

Long-term, I’d love to test my skills by traveling to Italy or a Spanish-speaking country (not this year, unfortunately). If that sounds exciting to you too, we can chat about it down the road.

This offer goes out to anyone it applies to and I dont mind having a group or several dedicated people. Let me know if you’re interested! 😊📚☕ ",1,1743285216.0,Charlottesville,0,1.0,False

Tess was a bubbly brunette. Leo was the quiet but unhinged ADHD guy.

Alex, the extroverted, self-proclaimed alcoholic, glued us together. 

It was my turn to cook for our weekly cooking competition. 

I ordered Hello Fresh:

Chicken-wrapped asparagus with mushroom sauce and lightly salted fries.

I hid the packaging. If Leo found out, he’d argue for my disqualification. 

He was leading with “Fromage whatever-the-fuck.” I can't read French.

“Oooh, that smells good!” Leo came home early, a cigarette dangling from his lips. 

I grabbed his shoulders, forcing him into his seat. Tess arrived next, then Alex, who I had to wrestle into his chair. 

(I forgot he hated mushrooms.)

He scrunched up his face. “But it’s *mushroom*.”

Still, he took a bite. “It’s… tolerable.”

When they were done, Leo playfully shot me the finger before hugging me.

“Okay, you *win*.”

But I noticed he was... *hot*. 

When he stepped back, sweat glistened on his brow.

“Uh, it's… indigestion,” he said, when he burped, before darting to the bathroom.

When Leo puked, mid-run to the bathroom, Tess went pale. “Elle, did you… cook the chicken correctly?”

“Yes!”

I felt her forehead when she burped. 

She was burning up.

“Clearly *not*,” Alex’s eyes were unfocused, and he stumbled into the refrigerator.

I ran for Leo, forcing the door open. 

He was bent over the toilet. But it wasn’t him I was staring at. His blood stained puke was floating around him, bobbing in front of his frenzied eyes. 

Leo spluttered, his body twitching, skin undulating, and shampoo bottles lining the shower violently flew up into the air. 

“I…” He dropped to his knees, the floating puke splashing onto the floor.  

“Elle, I need… *help*.”

Leo collapsed, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. 

I ran for my phone, and Tess, rolling around on the floor, coughed up black smoke, smoldered orange erupting through her lips. 

*Fire*. 

Alex blurred, appearing in contorted chunks.

He was on the floor, and then he was spliced through the kitchen door. 

I didn’t call 911.

I called Hello Fresh.

They answered on the first ring. “We’ll be there to pick them up.”

They arrived almost immediately, masked figures grabbing my roommates. 

Tess and Alex were lifted onto stretchers. Leo fought back, sending one flying, but they took him down. 

He turned to me, struggling violently, accusing, eyes ignited unnatural blue bleeding into his usual coffee brown. 

“What the *fuck* did you do to me?”

Leo stumbled back, on instinct, sending one guy straight through the ceiling. 

The floor split underneath us when he screamed, the windows shattering. 

“Thanks for using Hello Fresh!” the woman on the phone chirped. 

“What did you…what did you do to them?” I demanded in a cry. 

Leo was knocked out from behind, a masked man scooping him into his arms, and carrying him into the night.

### **Prologue: The Spark**  
The humid air of Barcelona’s El Raval district clung to Alejandro “Alex” Mbeki-Reyes like a second skin as he hunched over his laptop in the corner of Café L’Antic. The café’s flickering neon sign cast a blue glow over the equations he’d scrawled on a napkin—a fusion of quantum computing and flamenco rhythms. At 18, he was already a ghost in his own life: a prodigy coding for startups by day, DJing at clandestine warehouse raves by night, and scribbling poetry on the night buses between jobs. His mother, Nomalanga, a nurse who’d emigrated from Soweto, had sewn his first circuit board into the lining of his school blazer to hide it from his father, a mechanic who believed “dreams don’t pay bills.”  

Then came the TikTok heard round the world. A grainy video of Alex freestyling about Schrödinger’s cat over a beat he’d composed on a stolen synthesizer went viral. By 22, he was a paradox: a Grammy-winning producer with a diamond-studded Ouroboros ring, a tech mogul who owned a minority stake in a fusion energy startup, and UNESCO’s youngest Goodwill Ambassador. But in the silence of his Los Angeles penthouse, he traced the cracks in his facade—the guilt of outrunning his parents’ struggles, the whispers that called him a “colonizer in Gucci.”  

---

### **Part I: The Blueprint**  
**Chapter 1: The Double-Edged Crown**  
The penthouse’s floor-to-ceiling windows framed a smoggy LA sunrise as Zara Nkosi, Alex’s razor-sharp assistant from Khayelitsha, slammed a dossier on his marble desk. “You’re trending again,” she said dryly. A tabloid headline blared: *“Billionaire Boy Wonder Buys Soccer Team—To ‘Relax’?”*  

Alex smirked, spinning a holographic model of his true obsession: *Project Horizon*, a $100B blueprint to connect Spain and South Africa through startups and scholarships. “Relaxation is a capitalist myth,” he said, tossing her a USB drive labeled *CFIUS RISK ASSESSMENT*. “Tell the lawyers I’ll handle the visa loopholes. And cancel the Maldives trip.”  

Zara arched an eyebrow. “The Maldives was *your* idea.”  
“Plans change,” Alex replied, pulling up a live feed of a Johannesburg township where kids tapped pirated code into cracked tablets. “We’re building bridges, not beaches.”  

**Chapter 3: The Gala Collision**  
The Climate Horizon Gala was a sea of champagne flutes and virtue-signaling oligarchs. Alex, in a tailored black-on-black suit that cost more than his childhood home, debated carbon credits with a Silicon Valley CEO when *she* appeared—Emma Watson, herding a group of Syrian refugee girls in mismatched gowns.  

Their collision was inevitable. Alex’s champagne drenched her ivory Dior dress. Instead of anger, she laughed—a sound like wind chimes in a storm. “I’ve read your TED Talk on AI ethics,” she said, dabbing at the stain with a napkin. “Brilliant, but naive. You can’t algorithm your way out of systemic poverty.”  

Alex countered, “And you can’t hashtag your way out of it.”  
They argued until dawn on his rooftop, Emma’s hands sketching constellations as she spoke of refugee schools in Lebanon. “Your app could be a lifeline,” she said, “but only if you let the margins design it.”  

---

### **Part II: The Launch**  
**Chapter 5: Code Name Al-Andalus**  
Madrid’s Torre Picasso boardroom hummed with disdain. Rosa Vázquez, a fourth-generation olive farmer turned AI-agritech CEO, glared at Alex. “You want *10%* of my company for internships?” Her Andalusian accent sharpened like a blade. “My algorithms predict harvests down to the raindrop. What can your *niños* teach me?”  

Alex leaned forward, his voice low. “Your AI knows soil pH, but can it taste the olives?” He slid a photo across the table: his father’s calloused hands repairing a tractor at 3 a.m. “The kid who’ll disrupt your industry isn’t at MIT. He’s fixing that tractor—and writing code on his phone.”  

Rosa’s defiance cracked. “One intern,” she conceded. “And they’d better survive harvest season.”  

**Chapter 6: The Soweto Gambit**  
In Soweto, Zara faced her own trial. Thandiwe “Thandi” Mokoena, a street artist turned solar-panel mogul, stood atop a shipping container, her dreadlocks threaded with copper wire. “You want my factory to train interns?” she shouted over the din of generators. “They’ll learn to weld, code, *and* write protest poetry. No exceptions.”  

Zara, who’d sold her thesis on microgrids to pay her sister’s tuition, met Thandi’s gaze. “Deal. But I’m auditing your books. No offshore shell games.”  
Thandi grinned. “You’re worse than my ex. Welcome aboard.”  

---

### **Part III: The Storm**  
**Chapter 8: The Hack**  
The Horizon App launched at midnight—a sleek platform where Catalan coders could partner with Zulu poets. By 12:07 a.m., it crashed.  

The hacker collective *Los Despiertos* plastered Alex’s face across the dark web, morphed with Cortés and Cecil Rhodes. The meme read: *“New Empire, Old Playbook.”* Emma found Alex on his penthouse floor, surrounded by shattered VR headsets. “They’re right,” he muttered. “I’m just another rich kid playing savior.”  

Emma knelt, her hands steadying his. “Look.” She showed him a notification: a 17-year-old in Khayelitsha had used the app’s beta to prototype a bracelet that converted sweat into drinking water. “Her name’s Luz,” Emma said. “She’s your counter-narrative.”  

**Chapter 10: Visa Roulette**  
The ICE office reeked of stale coffee and fear. Agent Carter, a bulldog in a too-tight suit, sneered at Alex’s O-1 visa. “Your ‘extraordinary ability’ is throwing parties for tech bros.”  

Alex’s lawyer, a Haitian immigrant named Marisol, slid over a dossier. “Page 42: Horizon’s partnership with UNHCR. Page 103: The app’s encryption protocol—rated tighter than Pentagon systems.” She smiled. “He’s not just playing. He’s rewriting your rulebook.”  

---

### **Part IV: The Summit**  
**Chapter 13: The Barcelona Crucible**  
The Spain-South Africa Innovation Summit erupted in chaos. Thousands packed the Gothic Quarter—farmers in *traje de flamenca*, programmers in startup hoodies, and *Los Despiertos* hackers masked as conquistadors.  

Onstage, Thandi unveiled her masterpiece: olive oil-powered batteries, co-designed with Rosa’s AI. “This isn’t just energy,” she roared. “It’s *ubuntu* meets *duende*!”  

Emma then brought out Luz, her bracelet now hydrating drought-stricken Andalusian villages. The crowd surged, chanting *“¡Sí se puede!”*  

Backstage, CFIUS agents cornered Alex. “Hand over the app’s data.”  
Zara materialized, a South African flag pin gleaming on her blazer. “It’s encrypted in Basque and Zulu. Good luck.”  

---

### **Epilogue: The Horizon**  
Five years later, Alex stood at the heart of the Mbeki-Reyes Institute in Johannesburg. Luz, now 22 and the youngest professor, demonstrated a microgrid built by Spanish engineers and Xhosa poets. On the Horizon App, a notification blinked: *“Rosa’s AI just partnered with Thandi’s solar farm. Projected jobs: 1M.”*  

Emma, her belly rounded with their first child, handed Alex a letter. Inside was a sketch from *Los Despiertos*: Alex redrawn as a bridge, his body spanning the Mediterranean. Scrawled beneath: *“Okay, you win. Now go fix the rest.”*

Onstage, Thandi unveiled her masterpiece: olive oil-powered batteries, co-designed with Rosa’s AI. “This isn’t just energy,” she roared. “It’s *ubuntu* meets *duende*!”  

Emma then brought out Luz, her bracelet now hydrating drought-stricken Andalusian villages. The crowd surged, chanting *“¡Sí se puede!”*  

Backstage, CFIUS agents cornered Alex. “Hand over the app’s data.”  
Zara materialized, a South African flag pin gleaming on her blazer. “It’s encrypted in Basque and Zulu. Good luck.”  

---

### **Epilogue: The Horizon**  
Five years later, Alex stood at the heart of the Mbeki-Reyes Institute in Johannesburg. Luz, now 22 and the youngest professor, demonstrated a microgrid built by Spanish engineers and Xhosa poets. On the Horizon App, a notification blinked: *“Rosa’s AI just partnered with Thandi’s solar farm. Projected jobs: 1M.”*  

Emma, her belly rounded with their first child, handed Alex a letter. Inside was a sketch from *Los Despiertos*: Alex redrawn as a bridge, his body spanning the Mediterranean. Scrawled beneath: *“Okay, you win. Now go fix the rest.”*  

---

**Author’s Note:**  
*Bridges of Tomorrow* is fiction, but its pulse beats in every young coder, artist, and dreamer who refuses to choose between roots and wings. The horizon isn’t a place—it’s a promise.  

**THE END*** is fiction, but its pulse beats in every young coder, artist, and dreamer who refuses to choose between roots and wings. The horizon isn’t a place—it’s a promise.

She was really kind and sweet, but I realised recently that she never actually encouraged me to improve my situation, and in fact seemed largely uninterested when I got my first real job or starting taking my workout routine seriously. She was always talking about eating healthy but we mostly went to fast food or coffee shops, and even when I went elsewhere to eat (storebought is still somewhat healthier IMO) she'd always tell me I was taking my diet too seriously.

In fact she'd say that quite a bit- I was taking care of my brother at the time and working my butt off to help my family stay afloat, but she'd just say to take life slow and not stress about working hard or becoming a millionaire which I always talked about (Hey, a poor city kid needs aspirations lol). Honestly I started shutting her out and just focusing on my own stuff, which eventually led to me ending things to focus on studying for further education and making money in the meantime.

I hadn't thought about her for a while until today, I was at a concert earlier tonight and there was a guy who looked a lot like me but slighter darker skinned. But his hair was pretty much the exact style I remember wanting for the past year maybe, as well as a Leather Jacket I remember pointing out to my ex a few months ago when we were still dating. This man looked cool as heck and had an extremely beautiful girl by his side, and they seemed really happy together.

Now I'm not saying that if I'd changed those things I'd look that cool or be a chick magnet or whatever, but honestly I've had girls I like including my ex say they don't really like the hairstyle or that it'd look bad on me, and I'm a guy so I figured they knew better in matters of style so whatever. But I remember my ex making fun of me for wanting that jacket, saying how bad it'd look.

It just got me thinking, maybe it was her seeing if I'd do it anyway or not, but it feels more like for those last two things and for everything else that she was actively against things that would make me stand out, be more attractive, or improve myself to a point where I basically outgrew her. (This isn't me being pretentious by the way, she always seemed insecure about her not being enough or saying that I should be with someone more interesting.)

I feel bad that I had to end things, but the bottom line is I'm not happy with where my life is yet. If I'm running in one direction, and I have a bunch of people holding me back with ropes, the only options are to yield or to cut them.  
  
Anyways I'm sorry to the guy I saw today but I'm totally going to take a similar hairstyle to my barber, and find your jacket in that store if they still have it :)",1,1743284852.0,selfimprovement,0,0.99,False

My whole body aches and I could have slept in bed all day I am so exhausted. On a day like today in the past, I would have assumed I had the flu or a cold and let myself sleep all day. Now, knowing that it's likely a fibro flare, I'm not sure what to do. 

I take ADHD meds and decided to take my regular dose and drink my coffee, but after thinking about it, I'm wondering if this is going about it in the right way. I feel basically stuck on the couch in pain but with more energy than I need and feeling pretty stressed out about it. I am reading that stress can really impact FM, and I think my meds do tend to make me stressed/anxious in addition to all of the positive aspects they provide like energy and motivation. 

I am wondering how you all manage a bad day and what works for you. I am especially curious of the experiences of other ADHD folks but every bit of info helps!

1jmx3wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1jmx3wu/what_bill_really_wanted_the_psychedelic_gap_bill/,What Bill really wanted. The Psychedelic Gap: Bill Wilson’s Unfinished Revolution(trigger warning for brainwashed cultists),"One of the most critical elements missing from Alcoholics Anonymous is the recognition of the profound impact that plant psychedelics can have on achieving spiritual awakening. Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, experienced a pivotal ""come to God"" moment during his Belladonna treatment—an early form of psychedelic therapy—that catalyzed his understanding of recovery. His initial vision for AA was rooted in the transformative power of such experiences, yet the program has largely moved away from this foundational insight, and only sees a long term success rate of around 5%. Now that we have all the information at our disposal, and with 20/20 hindsight, why not follow the path to spiritual attainment that Bill himself took? 

Bill Wilson’s Belladonna-induced awakening was no anomaly—it was a deliberate neuro-spiritual reset, akin to the shamanic initiations of the Amazon or the Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece. Yet modern AA has sterilized this inconvenient truth, clinging to dogma while ignoring the very tools that birthed its founder’s revelation.  

The data is undeniable:  
- Psilocybin therapy (Johns Hopkins, 2022) shows 80% abstinence rates in alcoholics—16x more effective than AA’s 5% long-term success rate.  
- Ibogaine interrupts opioid addiction within hours, with 50-70% of users remaining clean for months (MAPS, 2021).  
- Ayahuasca repairs dopamine receptors (Imperial College London, 2020), addressing the root neurochemistry of addiction.  

Wilson knew this. His 1950s LSD experiments weren’t a lapse in judgment—they were a return to the origin. Yet AA traded transcendence for group therapy and coffee breath.  

The Alchemical Diet: Feeding the Fire of Awakening

Spiritual energy requires biological fuel. The Standard American Diet (SAD)—flooded with glyphosate, seed oils, and synthetic additives—numbs the pineal gland and clogs the lymphatic system. Compare this to the Templars’ fasting regimens or the Ayurvedic sattvic diet, designed to elevate consciousness.  

Keys to a Kundalini-Friendly Diet: 
- Omega-3s (wild salmon, walnuts): Repair dopamine receptors damaged by addiction.  
- Bitter herbs (dandelion, milk thistle): Flush endocrine disruptors blocking spiritual energy.  
- Electrolyte minerals (celtic salt, coconut water): Stabilize the nervous system for deep meditation.  

AA’s donuts-and-cigarettes culture isn’t just ironic—it’s biologically sabotaging spiritual attainment.

Detox: The Shadow Work of the Body  
True sobriety isn’t just quitting substances—it’s evicting the toxins they left behind. The liver stores metabolites of trauma (literally—emotional stress alters bile composition), while heavy metals jam neural circuits.  

Radical Detox Protocols: 
- Dry fasting: 72 hours without food or water triggers autophagy, recycling damaged cells (Nobel Prize, 2016).  
- Infrared sauna: Sweats out petrochemicals (e.g., benzene from alcohol) stored in fat.  
- Chelation therapy: EDTA binds to mercury/lead, freeing the pineal gland.  

Most AA members never detox—they swap alcohol for sugar, keeping the brain in a dopamine desert.  


Mythology: The Missing Manual for Transformation

AA’s “Higher Power” is vague because it lacks a mythos
Jung warned: “Without myth, the neurotic dissolves into chaos.” AA’s failure to ritualize the hero’s journey leaves members stuck in Step 4.

So a week ago I met up with him for the first time. We didn't live that far away from each other actually, so he just took a train to my city.

Anyhow, we chatted over coffee and stuff and even hugged, which kinda surprised me. Although he had been acting clingy to me for a while now, I assumed he wouldn't be like that irl.

The third time we went for coffee again but decided to hang out for a bit longer, so we went on a walk to a nearby park. I remembered there being ponds with ducks in them, so I thought it'd be somewhat entertaining to look at them. Honestly anything was entertaining with him.

We talked about the upcoming Minecraft updates and stuff, and I couldn't help but notice how he was starting to hold my hand. I don't know why, but I got a bit flustered and whisked away his hand (gently). He just chuckled and said something like ""Don't worry man, it doesn't count (since we're straight)""

Throughout the conversation he kept getting closer to me, even laying his head on my shoulder. First I thought it was something casual, yet my brain kept jumping into conclusions. Just as I managed to tell my brain to shut up, he asked if I had had my first kiss yet.

I quickly answered no and told him it was because I wanted it to be with someone special. Then he said ""Aren't I someone special?"" And then pulled me closer.

First I thought ""No way he would kiss me"", until he did. He actually did, on the lips. I wasn't even fighting back, just sitting there in shock. I have literally never kissed anyone before, so I just tried to copy what I had seen movies.

I physically couldn't bring myself to talk after that, and according to him, I looked like a tomato. I tried telling him off and asking why the hell would he do THAT, and he quieted down for a second, before changing the subject back to Minecraft.

Even when he went back to the train station, I thought about him and the kiss. I didn't know kisses would be warm? I liked it I think? But I'm straight, and I have never liked a guy before. So what does this mean??

How am I gonna talk to him tomorrow, especially after that? If he's homophobic, why would he kiss me???? Was he messing with me? But he was looking at me so gently, I'm so confused",5,1743284623.0,whatdoIdo,8,0.86,False

One of my teammates—a woman in my group—has been giving off mixed signals that are honestly starting to distract me, and I’m unsure how to handle it without making things awkward.

Initially, she was quiet and disengaged. But one day when we were alone (others showed up late), the vibe between us shifted—intense eye contact, mirroring, even a bit of flustered energy on both sides. Since then, her behavior has been inconsistent. Some weeks she’s distant and keeps things purely academic, other times she hangs back after meetings, mirrors my body language, and engages more warmly.

There have been moments that make me question whether it's just friendliness or something more—like her brushing her leg close to mine under the table, leaning in closely when working on the project, and once gently moving my phone out of the way in a surprisingly tender manner. She’s also played with her hair frequently when we talk and made an effort to ask follow-up questions about my life, especially after spring break. Once, I even caught her staring at me while I was chatting with another group member, only for her to quickly look away when I noticed.

We’ve never talked about anything outside of the project, and I’ve kept things professional. But she seems to linger around me more often than necessary—once she stayed back to work on something she didn’t really need to, and ended up messing up her part, which I had to fix. She also gets quiet when her friend is around or when I speak with others in the group.

Lately, she’s started asking more personal questions again and leaning in while we work. I don’t want to overthink it, but it’s hard not to notice the shift. I’ve been debating whether to ask her out for coffee to clear the air and see if there’s something there—but I’m hesitant. If she says no, I don’t want the group dynamic to get awkward or the project to suffer.

What complicates it further is that she and I are the only two out of four who consistently show up to meetings on time and actually put in effort. If anything goes wrong between us, it could throw off the entire group dynamic, and that’s not something I want during a tough semester.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this in a grad program? How did you stay focused and avoid letting emotions complicate academic collaboration?

My friend had introduced me to her mutual friend that I had been interested in for awhile at a party. My friend had also made it clear that I was interested and asked if she was open to talking at the party(she said she was open to it). We talked a for a bit and exchanged instagrams shortly after. Before spring break I had asked if she would be down to get coffee or something sometime. This was right before spring break so she said she would be down but it would have to be after break since she was leaving the next day. Over spring break we had been slowly getting to know each other over text. When we came back from break I had asked her if she was still down to get some coffee. She said yes. We scheduled a day and we ended up meeting. We talked for 3 hrs straight, the convo flowed super smooth, and I thought it went really well overall. The convo wasn’t really flirty we were really just getting to know each other. After coffee I had texted her that it was nice talking to her and what not and said to lmk if she was down to do something again sometime. She didn’t respond until the next day and when she did she said that it was nice talking to me too but that she’s just not looking for anything at the moment. To add some context, this girl had just gotten out of a 3 yr relationship about few months ago and my friend that had introduced us even said to tread lightly and not come one too strong. I’m just curious why she agreed to go out and continued convos over text if she wasn’t looking for anything. Could it have been something I did? Thoughts?",1,1743284485.0,AskMenAdvice,6,0.67,False

I was on medication — and while it helped in some ways, I didn’t like how it made me feel. So I started looking for other ways to improve my health.

Over time, I began exercising, eating better, experimenting with fasting, and practicing meditation. Slowly, things started to shift. I got back to a healthier weight, got off the medication, and started feeling better overall.

Now I’m building a website — Wholeness Forward — to share some of the things that helped me, in case they might help others too. It’s focused on improving health in every area: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.

Like each of us, Wholeness Forward is a work in progress — constantly evolving and improving.

One of the first tools I’ve built is called GratiSphere — a gratitude tracker that creates a dynamic word cloud from your entries. The more you write, the more your cloud grows. Words you mention more often — like family, friends, or coffee — appear larger, giving you a visual reminder of what matters most.

# I’d really appreciate your honest feedback:

* Is this something you or someone you know would actually benefit from? Why or why not?
* What do you think of the design and layout of the gratitude word cloud?
* The overall experience — is it intuitive and easy to navigate?
* Any features or improvements you’d suggest?

Thanks for taking a moment to read. I hope this inspires something for you — and I’d love to hear your thoughts or feedback.

1jmwyj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1jmwyj4/why_most_people_freeze_before_closing_their_first/,Why most people freeze before closing their first AI deal (and how to fix it),"The team and I created [the instant AI agency book](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency) so you can start doing AI deals in the most “A-B-C”, step-by-step way possible…

…without having to risk a ton of cash.

Still, every day we get DMs from people who are overwhelmed, frozen like deer in the headlights.

Most of you are getting overwhelmed because of the same reason:

You’re thinking too far out in the future.

If you’re not getting on coffee dates yet, what sense does it make to spend all your energy on figuring out all the little ways the prompt could be optimized, or how you’ll get paid?

Just the other day, we had a conversation with someone from the [AAA group](https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-agency/about?ref=dd4c81059bd8476b97321ed2c58d9f9c)

Big C mentioned he closed a deal and got access to a database of 40k buyers. He knew how to set it up with Zapier, but he was wondering about hiring a dev to get [n8n](http://honeysyed.com/n8n) in place for him.

If this was golf, Big C’s ball is already on the green.

It’s time to putt.

We told him to just go for a small test of, say, 500 names, and see how it goes.

Hiring a developer to put together a system that will demand babysitting… that’s like taking the golf ball back 100 yards, away from the hole.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, at any stage, my kind advice to you is…

Follow the plan one step at a time.

Stick to the simple steps we give you with [the instant AI agency](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency) book.

And let the rest take care of itself.

1jmwy5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1jmwy5o/for_educational_purposes_i_just_needed_something/,"For educational purposes, I just needed something ran about also again this educational only","This is for educational purposes not for you freaks that actually read this to use, because if you do diddy is stretching your shit out in prison. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Also for all of y’all that want to become detectives this was created using research from all different serial killers and how they acted. No I’m not citing my sources because I’m not telling you where I got this information from, a man has his secrets 🤫
Now here’s how to kill someone and get away with it. 
0. This is the first step, finding where to take the person if you do have them. Whether it’s a cabin in the woods or a warehouse in an abandoned town make sure it’s not connected to you because if it is, your suspect number one. 
1. Find your target. When you are planning on finding your target you need to account on many things like WITCES (witness protection). You’ll never truly know if someone is in this because there won’t be any records at all, the original person will be fully deleted from the web and their new file will be created depending on why they are running etc. One of the many signs of someone in WITCES is if they are in a community that has over aware families(like cameras in every blind spot on that block). I don’t know the rest of the signs but if you even assume some one is in WITSEC don’t do anything stupid as for their protection, the Marshals watch the cameras making sure no one suspicious gets close to these people. Also depending on if they took training people in WITCES could beat your ass in 10 different ways and could have multiple fire arms all over their property. You just don’t want to mess with WITCES people okay. Back to identifying a target. No kids at all, if you even think about this I hope you get tied up in your sleep and have your skin cut off until you bleed out and die. Leave kids alone, they don’t deserve it even if they were your childhood bully. Now don’t do pregnant mothers either because that’s fucked up in so many ways I can’t even explain. Just do some man or woman that you don’t even know. 
2. Learn your target. You want to learn all about your target before you strike. The first thing you want to learn is their routine, if they go to coffee in the morning at a certain place or go to breakfast at their friend’s house. Where they go to work and how long their shift is. Do they have school (college because they aren’t kids) and what time and classes do they have. What’s their favorite foods and their favorite restaurants, Do they have any significant others? If they do learn all about them too so once you strike you know that they won’t be there. You also want to learn how they act, what they act on their body everyday. If it’s a gun learn how much ammo they carry and where they put the gun on their body. If they go on runs early in the morning expect them to have that gun on. You always want to prepare for the worst. If they need medication learn about that too. Learn their favorite bars so you can know when to take them if they pass out on the curb. Do they have anyone that lives with them? Learn all about them too. As Sun Tzu said “Know your enemy as you know yourself. In 100 battles you will never Peril.” Another big thing to know is if they know hand to hand combat and what type, things like jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, Karate, kickboxing, boxing, wrestling Krav Maga, and Judo. Those types of self defense will help the best with things like holds and grappling. Learn them yourself. You also want to know how much phones they carry why. Lastly you want to know all of their information like license plate, every family member, date of birth, things that will help you along the way with tracking. One of the many people that can help you learn these things are the targets friends or people that know about them. You can all do learn about them on their social media (just make sure you’re using an account that can’t be tracked back to you). Also in the process of this make sure no one can figure out your true motives or track anything back to you like finger prints or getting too close to the target. 
3. Learn the area your target lives in. One of the main reason a murderer gets caught is poor planning, they always get found out because a neighbor saw them or cameras in the area caught them. You want to learn the layout, all points of entry, escape and the quickest and most discreet route of escape if everything goes sideways. Learn your getaway plan and also learn where the target will go if they feel in danger. Another problem is obstacles and pinch points where the target can hold their position with a firearm or can get you cornered easily. Do they have a basement? Or is it a single floor house. Where are the windows and is there an alarm system hooked up to them? What’s the code? And one of the most important things is where they hide their firearms. You should be able to learn this by looking at the layout of the house. There will most likely be firearm in every room of the house if the person is paranoid. If they were once in the military they will know the areas in their house where they can put a firearm and have it in reach no matter what they’re doing. Whether it’s under a table, in a drawer, beside the bed, under the pillow, in a cabinet, under the counter or besides the sofa you need to know this so you don’t end up the one in danger. Next you need to learn every blind spot for every camera or surrounding areas. If someone sees you or a camera gets a look at you they can narrow you down. Even if you have a mask on they can learn what your car looks like, how tall you are how you walk, tattoos? Scars, hair color, foot size. How you stand, bend over, look around, or even if you limp. It would be hard to find you but the police would be able to build up a profile quickly on you. Once you’ve learned about the targets house, learn about the surrounding areas. You need to know if the neighbors is a cop or if they’re a family member of the target and watch over them at all times. You need to learn  if the houses have cameras where they are and what the blind spots are. Also learn the routines of those people too and learn when they will come and go. If they are going on a trip find that out because it could be a great time to strike. While in the process of this stage, use a vehicle with a fake license plate that connects to a whole different vehicle (you can do this by stealing the license plate off of a car thats the exact same model). Make to scratch off the vins and leave no fingerprints in the car. If you really need to in the event that you’re going to get caught burn your fingertips to the point where it doesn’t seem purposeful but your prints won’t come back. 
4. Setting an impression on the people in your area. You want to leave a lasting impression of the people in the area who know you. Make yourself come off as nice and caring, the type of person to see a cat on the road and nurse to health and keep it for the rest of yours or it’s life. You can also come off as small and submissive, making people think you couldn’t even hurt a fly. Make people think highly of you and don’t let them think anything else. You want the police to look over you, think that you’re the type of person that couldn’t even fathom doing this. If it even helps be something like a snitch for the police so they would never expect you to do this. Have a job that makes people think that you’re a Good Samaritan not a heartless killer. But don’t come off as too nice or it might get suspicious.        
5. Strong False ID etc. This is one of the most important things because if you have a fake record that doesn’t add up, someone is going to look into it and find out things they shouldn’t. If you need to pay someone do it, but make sure they know what they are doing as it’s the difference between prison time and being a free man. One big thing is having a past that adds up and you remembering this. If you’re really 25 but your file says you’re 32, practice saying this if someone asks you how old you are. Make everything about you look normal but not too normal.
6. Gathering the items. First you need all black clothing that’s 1 size to big (this is so if any cameras do see you the police think you’re bigger than you actually are or they think that’s how you dress). You want shoes that are cheap but reliable and have a common shoe print. Make sure these shoes are either 1 size small or 1 size bigger than your actual shoes. Don’t use your daily shoes or anything like that. Also the color of these shoes preferably be black. Next is a mask, you want a fully black mask that covers your head and is hard to take off but easy to breathe in. Covering it with a hood should also make the job of someone not taking it off easier. When it comes to clothing you 100% do not want to ditch it unless you have no choice. When you do ditch the clothing make sure to burn it so theres no trace of your DNA on it. Even 1 hair can narrow you down in seconds. Another thing you want is armored gloves so if you get cut on the hands they don’t seep through. Getting injured on any part of the body will cause you to bleed which means left over evidence. Next for the items you need on the first part of the plan. You need any reliable weapon that can kill if you need to. Preferably a handgun, but you’ll want to carry a knife that can be concealed easy and is deadly. For the weapons you want to find the serial numbers and remove them. One way is to file them off, this is easy and efficient but you can never be caught with this as it’s a felony and you can’t get the serial numbers back on. If you want to use the weapon in a crime this is the best way so if you drop it the police won’t be able to tie it back to you as you purchased the firearm. If you lose your weapon, get out immediately. If you the police catch you in the house or your target knowing you had a weapon sees you and they don’t know you lost your weapon they can still use it as they fear for their life. Make sure to have supplies on hand to stop any bleeding from your own injuries. If you want to incapacitate your target, the safest way without killing the target would be drugging them. That’s first thing you try if the target doesn’t suspect your motives. This means you don’t try this in their house unless you have a secure hold over them. You want to do this when they are alone and in an open area like the woods, an alley (if you do this you need your vehicle to be near by), on a run in the morning or the night, when they are coming home from work, Taking out the trash (if it’s later at night), just maker sure that if they struggle you can subdue them in time, get them in a vehicle, and get away before anyone can stop you. One of these drugs is called ketamine, it’s a fast acting anesthetic that acts in under 60 seconds and last for up to 30 minutes depending on the dosage. It’s not commercially produced so you’re going to have to find it in your own. The dosage also needs to be exact depending on the targets weight and hight which you should all ready know by now. If you want to take the target somewhere you need rope to start but for long term captivity you need a different material as depending on how you you tie them up and how tight the rope is they can escape if they have enough time. Another way to incapacitate the target is to choke them out by using a rope or you could put them in a rear naked choke hold and press on their carotid artery 10 seconds but not too long. For the second phase of the plan you need items for whatever weird shit you’re going to do to the target but one of the main things you need is a shit ton of bleach and cleaning chemicals so once it gets messy you can clean it up without chemicals like luminal showing the blood stains. Before you even start doing whatever you want to do you need to burn all of the clothing that you used in the first phase of your plan. Now if you’re going to do anything that’s going to get messy you need full cover clothing. Things like a full body cleaning suit. This isn’t like the TV shows, any clothes that you have on need to be able to block the splatter from getting on you. You also need 1 layer of surgical gloves that go under the suit and 1 layer that goes above the suit, A mask like the ones they used it covid. You also need the tools that you going to use during your session. Whether thats torture tools or a condom for you fucking weirdos. When it comes to torture tools it’s important you use things that will cause the most pain but leave the least damage. You should be able to figure that out on your own. You also need the tools to dispose of the body once you finish the 2nd phase of yo your freaky ass plan. This is the third phase. When disposing of the body you have many ways, dissolving the body in sulfuric acid breaking bad style, burning the body to the skeleton then crushing the bones into dust, lake dumping the body, just leaving it in the woods, leaving it in someone else’s house, burying it, or even exploding it. I didn’t list all of them because that would take too long but also because some of them would leave crucial evidence behind. No body no evidence. So the 2 best ways to dispose of the body are burning it and crushing the bones or dissolving it in sulfuric acid. The easier way would to burn it because you would need a lot of acid and it’s safer. But the downside is it would create smoke, you need to find a way to cover the smell, and you will have some ash left over in the fire with the bones. Now to dispose of the bones you need to crush them with a rock crusher but it will take time as industrial ones can do the job but you can’t access them and commercial ones are super small. So you might think dissolving them would be easier, but you need a way to get the sulfuric acid and you need to have a big enough of a plastic tub to put the body in and dissolve it but you also need to find somewhere to dump the remains of the liquid. One is expensive and one takes time, by whatever works for you I guess. You also need cleaning supplies and if you turn the bones into ash you need somewhere to put them. 
7. Making the plan. When making this plan you need to be precise and plan it out correctly. Any flaws can jeopardize you or cause the target to get away. The first part of the plan is you need to figure out what to use for the kidnapping. Then you need to figure out where you need to plan the kidnapping at. If you know everything about the targets routine by now then you can find the best spot that will give you an advantage on the target and be able to subdue them. When kidnapping the target you need a vehicle. DO NOT use your daily vehicle. If you do and you get caught that’s your fault ya fucking idiot. Use an old junker, scratch all the vins off and replace the license plate with a car of the exact same model but isn’t registered to you. Before initiating the kidnapping, map out the area that you’re kidnapping the target in. Learn all about the area, points of entry, points of escape, best time spot to act on the kidnapping, all choke points where the target can’t escape, any point the target can use to hold a position with a firearm etc, learn everything even if there’s a box on the ground learn it and memorize where it is. When acting make sure to subdue the target as fast as you can and make sure you can keep the target from using their phone. If all goes well and the target is subdued you need to count in the factors of someone seeing or anything going wrong and figure out solutions if things do go wrong. If things go overboard you need to have an escape plan and a route ready at anytime, one of the reasons for studying the area you are kidnapping the target at. If all goes well and you have target and get at least 3 mile out of range, find the area that you have planned before hand and has another vehicle there. Once there immediately restrain the target as fast as you can but well enough that they can’t escape. Once that is done you need to ditch that vehicle because if anyone or even a camera saw it the authorities now know what vehicle you’re in and will search for it until they find it. The best course of action is to have something ready to destroy the vehicle. These vehicles should never be registered you and shouldn’t even be able to be connected to you. Once the vehicle is destroyed move the target into the other vehicle and then leave the area. If no one suspects you then you go to the location that you planned out earlier. Once the target is in the building make sure to lock all the doors and windows so in the event that the target does escape the bindings they can’t get out. Now’s the time you do what you want to the target, for you weirdos that are going to do what we all know they would do don’t leave any evidence behind like semen especially if your target is female. So now that we’ve covered that and you hopefully covered enough tracks and there wasn’t even a speck of your DNA or anything that can be connected back to you then you should be able to proceed. I’m not telling you what to do but if you do anything make sure that you’re covered in a way that makes sure things like hair or skin particles can’t escape. Once you’ve killed the target it’s time to dispose the body. Use whatever you choose to dispose of it and get that done. Now it’s the cleaning process. You want to get all of the chunky stuff depending on what you did cleaned up and put into a bucket, you’ll need those for later. Once you have all the liquids and chunky stuff cleaned up you want to use chemicals. Start will all the cleaning products then finish with bleach. If you decided to burn the body, while you’re cleaning you let it burn until there’s only bones left then you crush them to dust. If you’re some freak that likes trophies then keep the ashes you weirdo but if you want to dispose of them then throw them into a large body of water. If you chose to dissolve the body then once it’s fully liquid you put it into buckets that can’t be dissolved by sulfuric acid and you dump the liquids into the sewer or a lake. Oh yeah and wear protective gear while dealing with the acid as it can burn through your whole hand in seconds. Once everything is cleaned up you want to remove everything from the house or everything that you used during the crime and dissolve all of it acid. But if you to do this more then don’t move anything but if someone starts catching on then dispose of them.  
8. Now’s the aftermath. You want to act as everything is normal, when people start asking things like “did you hear about that person that went missing” you say know and ask question as if surprised or sad. Depending on how people see you in your area you can offer the family condolences or volunteer for the search team if there is one. Whatever you do, you fly under the radar and act as if life goes on. If you do anything suspicious then people will start catching on immediately.
So that’s all I have to say. Many serial killers do these types of things and this isn’t the perfect plan. Also remember, this is for educational purposes so don’t use this actually. Killing people is wrong, but if you do kill someone and get caught expect to get bent over in prison for being a bad boy or girl. Adios",1,1743284319.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

It started out yesterday morning after I woke up around 10am and went back to sleep until noon. I got up, showered, and got dressed. After I got dressed, I just felt this low energy vibe of sadness and just felt down. I powered through it, got a coffee, went to the store, and came home. Around when I was out and about, I started noticing mild tingling in my hands and feet. I tried to ignore it but my brain has consumed the sensation and it's constantly there now.

I then decided to take beetroot juice and go to the gym for the first time in a while. I did 5 minute brisk cycling and then some seated leg curls. Nothing strenuous. During the activity, my heart rate got up to about 140 bpm and continued to hover in the high 90's low 100's for the rest of the night.

This morning, I woke up on 3hr 45min of sleep as I couldn't fall asleep until about 4am and had to be up to take my car someone at 8am. The tingly feeling came back when I started driving my car. I came back home after dropping my car off, took a nap from like noon-2pm and woke up with a pressure behind my left eye. My girlfriend brought me McDonalds for lunch which I'm regretting because I checked my heart rate like 30 mins later and it has been fluctuating around 109-114 bpm which probably has to do with how crappy the food it and the salt, etc.

All of this makes me feel weird like there's something serious going on with me. I have to get my B12, Iron, and Ferritin checked soon but other than that, my bloodwork came back normal. I had a previous CT of my brain scan taken in September and it came back normal.

I've been trying to do the anxiety 4-7-8 breathing exercises which helps but my mind still stays stuck on everything.

I’m a bit disappointed by J6 experience, but have to admit that even in leaking state it brews way better coffee than brand new Philips LatteGo. Decided to give Jura a second chance, looking at  GIGA 10 and Z10. The Z10, with its rotary switch, looks intuitive and quite similar to my old machine. At the same time, I like the idea of two grinders, but some features of the GIGA 10 make me hesitant.

  
1. I’m confused about the placement of the power button. It’s so strange that it’s hidden under the lid. Is it convenient to open this lid every time? We drink coffee throughout the day. If we leave the machine on, how soon does it turn off automatically? Is the standby power consumption significant?

2. The S-M-L sizes instead of milliliters seem incredibly inconvenient. How does it work? When changing the portion size from M to L, for example, does it only increase the amount of water, or does it adjust the entire recipe, including the amount of milk/foam and ground coffee?

3. I've searched through this sub and noticed that somebody said GIGA 10 makes americano in a different way than Z10. What's the difference?

4. GIGA 10 is supposed to have newer and faster UI. Is it really improvement over Z10? J6 interface was kinda slow, but after setting receipts it was a pleasure to use. Physical buttons for starting brewing and rotary wheel for quick adjustments. No idea how touchscreen experience feels. Can I still press something once and have a coffee, or it requires further actions each time?

5. How clean are your Z10 or GIGA 10 inside? With Jura machines you can't take out a brewing group for cleaning. After first year there was always damp mess inside my J6. Do newer machines run cleaner/drier inside? Does it have any fans inside to dry internals?

  
Thank you. Would love to hear any other thoughts on GIGA 10 vs. Z10 vs. older Juras. ",1,1743284051.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

The pastor encourages open discussions and they hold Q&A sessions toward the end of the service. It’s such a refreshing experience, especially if, like me, you’ve ever found yourself not fully understanding the message or wanting to share your thoughts on what was discussed.

The kids participate in short teachings with the adults, and then they get to play and hang out in a nearby room with other kids.

1jmwrhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jmwrhg/i_feel_like_my_marriage_is_unequal/,I feel like my marriage is unequal.,"Hi! I never thought I’d be asking strangers on the internet for marriage advice, but here we are. My (27M) wife (24F) and I have a good marriage overall. We love each other. However, I can’t help but feel as though it’s super unequal. My wife and I have two beautiful kids aged 1 and 2. They’re great kids, they’re happy kids, and we’ve been told multiple times that they’re “easy” kids if there’s such a thing. My wife is a SAHM. I work 7:30-4 in a blue collar field. 

A day in my life consists of going to work at 7:30, then come home. As soon as I get home I kiss my wife, greet the kids after washing up and changing clothes then I clean up the days mess. Dirty diapers on the end table, trash that couldn’t be thrown away three feet from the can, dishes that had been sitting since last night, and any other miscellaneous things. 

My wife will usually go to the bedroom to take a break, which I’m more than fine with. Then, she goes and hangs out with friends while I cook supper, give the kids a bath, brush their teeth, and get them to bed. Then, after they’re down I fold and put away laundry and usually do a couple of loads as well. My wife gets home around 10:30-11, and we go to bed. Our youngest wakes up several times a night as they’re going through a sleep regression. I am responsible for waking up and taking care of the little one since my wife is on multiple mental health medications for BPD, PTSD, depression, and anxiety and the side effects of those are an almost inability to wake after she takes them before bed. 

I’m fine with her having a social life, and I think it’s a good and healthy thing. I’m fine with waking up with our youngest. Heck, I’m even fine with doing 100% of the housework. 

But here is where one of our problems are. My wife spends money like crazy, mostly on DoorDash. Like she spent  almost $800 this month on DoorDash. I’m not a rich man. After taxes, I bring home $2600/mo which translates to roughly $31,200 a year. We live in a small apartment, both of our cars have over 220k miles on them, and we have $0 saved. Now, we are broke until I get paid again. I bought diapers, wipes, groceries, and paid all the bills. By the math we should have a minimum of $775 left over. But there’s nothing there. Not a damn dime. I’m trying to go back to school for computer science, and I’ve been trying to start for the past year online but I’m extremely cautious because 1. I don’t want to flunk out because I’m the primary parent from 4pm to 7:30am and all weekend 2. I’m not going to go into debt unless I can successfully obtain my degree. 

I’ve spoke to her about my concerns and what I get back always an arrival fallacy. Once the baby sleeps through the night. Once we live in a bigger place with more sunlight. Once this, once that. I want to do it now. I’ve been wanting to start for a year now. Last night I pulled an all nighter glued to my laptop trying to start with basic coding. I’ve been awake since 6am yesterday morning and I think the sleep deprivation is giving me some odd insight. 

The other side of all of this is I don’t have a social life. Trying to go do the things I enjoy is like pulling teeth. Today I had to fight like hell to just go out with my older brother to go shoot a rifle he just bought for a few hours. I’ve been trying to go for the past two weeks and it keeps getting moved back or I keep getting an excuse as to why I shouldn’t go. Today, I laid down the law. I told her that I’m going, and that I’d be back in a couple of hours. I didn’t raise my voice, I wasn’t aggressive in the slightest. I just said it in a normal voice after she tried to make me cancel for the upteenth time. She was angry. When I came home, she just got up and went back to the bedroom where she’s going to probably stay until it’s time for her to go to the gym to walk with her friend, then they’ll go do their crafting stuff. 

I guess it guts me that I have to piss my wife off to go do something I enjoy. I didn’t even enjoy it because all I felt the entire time was anxiety because I knew what I was going to come home to. 

Why is it that I have to fight tooth and nail to get a few hours of me time, but then I let her go off and do whatever it is she wants anytime she wants? Why do I do that? I was hoping that by loving her in a way that she not only felt free but also in a way that I wanted to be loved, that perhaps she would draw the parallel to reciprocate that love. Unfortunately not. 

To also add to it. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I take my own lunch that I make to work, or I fast until 4pm and I take my own coffee to work. I don’t spend money at work as my work brings me to residential homes and businesses and many of my coworkers blow a lot of money at filling stations or on fast food. However, their wives work so they can afford to do that. 

I’ve talked to my wife many times about rejoining the workforce, and she either gets defensive or gives me an arrival fallacy. Most of the time, it’s a defensive response. I’m worried that our two year old is falling behind. Don’t get me wrong the kiddo is sharp as a tack, but she doesn’t work with them. She usually is glued to a big comfy chair in our living room with her eyes on her phone scrolling social with simple songs, Ms Rachel, or Bluey playing on the TV. While I know our oldest is only two, I feel like the little one is falling behind on speech benchmarks and I am going to make an appointment with the pediatrician on Monday to have our kiddo assessed. I’ve even meal prepped a weeks worth of meals for all of us and they still often go untouched. I really feel like her being a SAHM does more harm than good not only to her, but also to our kids. 

I love my wife, but I’m tired of feeling like a single dad that happens to be married. I’ve also sent several emails reaching out to marriage counselors to start therapy for the both of us. 

What the heck do I do to equalize our marriage? How do I take the right path to better our lives?

I don’t know about you, but when growers are excited to share their work, it gets me fired up. The second he opened the container of Cap Junky it smelled up the entire place. That pungent fruit and spice aroma that I love so much told me I was about to enjoy the sh\*t out of this sesh.

After a few bong rips and laughs I noticed something I’d never seen before; the container he brought his flower in. The black aluminum canister with a dark translucent top definitely caught my eye.

“What’s that?” I said.

“That’s what I keep all my bud in now” Josh replied while showing me how it worked. By the time he was done showing off his new container, its construction, and functionality, I was sold. I immediately got three different types and sizes.

# Who is Planetary Design?

The first thing I noticed was that Planetary Design, the company, was located in [Montana](https://www.fatnugsmag.com/featured-nugs/the-montana-tour-fat-nugs-under-big-skies); one of the most gorgeous states we have in the country.

They’ve been producing products for storage for over 15 years for things like tea, coffee and just about anything else that needs to stay fresh. And their products are made with the idea of moving away from single-use plastics, which is exactly what everyone in our industry should be doing. [Cannascapes ](https://planetarydesign.com/cannascape-weed-storage/)is their cannabis-specific storage solution.

# About Cannascapes

Proper storage for cannabis is something that most of us look for these days and having containers like these that are created with humidity control and reduced light and air exposure in mind are going to win out.

There’s a mechanism inside each container that you press down on that pushes out almost all the air in the container, keeping whatever you’re going to store extremely fresh for very long periods of time. It’s a really cool idea and the first time I’ve ever seen anything like it for storing cannabis – it’s brilliant.

They have several sizes and types of containers for your cannabis, whether you’re just looking for a regular daily storage option, or a grower looking to store large amounts of cannabis for weeks and weeks at a time. Even as a retailer in situations where deli style is allowed, the large glass containers are perfect.

I’ve now been using all three of the containers for well over 9 months and they never disappoint. Easy to open, halfway stylish, and they even come with specialized markers you can use to write on each container so you know exactly what strain you have inside. The freshness aspect is unmatched – I’ve kept 2 lbs of kief in one of the containers for 8 months now and it’s still as if I got it yesterday!

There are very few things in cannabis that I use over and over again every single day, but these containers are one of them…actually all three of them. I highly recommend these containers for anyone and everyone who wants to keep their bud fresh. From the smallest to the largest container I have, all of them are perfect.

How much do I like these Cannscapes containers? The company had no idea I was doing this and did not pay me a single penny. (They didn’t even know I had any of their containers.)

# Using Cannascapes for Proper Cannabis Storages

If you follow some simple guidelines by using proper storage containers like these from Cannascapes, you can make sure that your Fat Nugs remain fresh, potent, and enjoyable for extended periods of time.

1. Cannabis should be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve its potency. Ideal temperatures range from 60-70°F (15-21°C) and humidity levels should be kept between 59-63% RH to prevent mold growth while keeping things as fresh as possible.

2. Light, especially UV rays, can degrade cannabinoids and terpenes in your cannabis. Storing it in opaque or dark translucent containers can help protect it from light degradation.

3. Exposure to air can cause your cannabis to dry out, killing the quality. The best thing you can do is to store your buds in airtight containers to minimize exposure and preserve its aroma, flavor, and potency.

4. Airtight jars are solid choices for storing cannabis as they prevent air and light exposure. Metal tins or ceramic containers are great choices as well, but plastic should be avoided for long-term storage as it can cause some unwanted flavoring and may not provide a perfect seal.

And I'm still depressed on them, they take the edge off but the price to pay is too much to the point being so dysfunctional on them I guess doesn't help feeling better or have better self esteem. I've also tried bupropion quite good for depression but feeling restlessness all the time my muscle get sore and gives me back pain. I can't hardly focus on it because it makes me to anxious. I've combined it with SNRIs and with lower doses and still too agitated. I don't want to feel like a zombie but I also don't want to feel like I've drunk 20 coffees.

The crime? Sending out his weekly ""5 bullets"" email with only four bullets.

The employee, whose name is being withheld to protect his dignity (or lack thereof), was known for his meticulous adherence to the sacred tradition of the 5-bullet email—a weekly roundup of tasks. But last Friday, chaos erupted when his email landed in OPM inboxes with a glaring omission: only four bullets.

""I opened the email and thought, 'Where's the fifth bullet?'"" said one distraught DOGE official.

The DOGE launched an immediate investigation. After a grueling 72-hour probe, they discovered the missing bullet had been replaced with a placeholder reading, ""Insert something clever here."" The employee reportedly forgot to update it before hitting send.

When confronted, the GS13 gang member claimed he was ""just having an off day"" and blamed the oversight on a particularly long coffee break. However, his excuses fell flat when investigators uncovered a pattern of similar behavior, including a ""3.5 bullets"" email sent the 1st week.

The arrest has sent shockwaves through the federal workforce. ""This is a betrayal of trust,"" said one coworker. ""If we can't count on 5 bullets, what can we count on?""

The employee now faces charges of ""gross negligence in email composition"" and ""failure to meet arbitrary workplace expectations."" If convicted, he could be sentenced to mandatory attendance at a corporate communication seminar.

Meanwhile, federal agencies are scrambling to restore faith in the 5-bullet system. ""We want to assure the public that this is an isolated incident,"" said a spokesperson. ""The integrity of our bullet emails remains our top priority.""

As for the accused, he has reportedly been placed on administrative leave and is considering a career change. Rumor has it he's eyeing a high productivity  job in the private sector—where bullet points are optional.",17,1743282992.0,FedJerk,6,0.95,False

I work for myself from home, which gives me the flexibility to for free time for the things I truly enjoy. I love experimenting in the kitchen, exploring new hiking spots, and spending time with my pet pups. I also enjoy traveling, finding new cafes to relax in, and appreciating the small moments that make life feel special. Whether it’s a quiet morning at a cafe with a cup of coffee, or baking something fresh to enjoy with a friend, working out, running or hiking, I find joy in the simple things. Over time, I have come to really value balance, not just in life, but in the people I connect with. I’m big on comfort, especially since I know Reddit can sometimes be a bit of a mess. But I like to create a space where things feel easy, genuine, and inviting. Being at ease in your surroundings helps you show up as your true self, and I’m looking to connect with people who value that same sense of comfort and authenticity.

I’m here to connect with people who share a similar outlook on life, those who value kindness, honesty, and the deeper things that really matter. No matter where you are from, if you’re someone who enjoys meaningful conversation, I’d love to hear from you. I’m not interested in small talk or shallow exchanges. I’m looking for conversations where we can naturally dive into lighthearted moments as well as deeper topics, chat about our day to day lives, and truly get to know each other. The goal is for it to feel natural and paced, to build a connection based on real, thoughtful interactions.

For me, the best connections are built on shared values like honesty, sincerity and making an effort. I want to connect with people who are comfortable enough to be themselves and are willing to invest in understanding each other. If you value real conversation, enjoy a genuine exchange, and are someone who appreciates authenticity in the same way I do, then I’d love to connect with you.

1jmw9ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jmw9ak/isolation/,Isolation,"I'm homeless. I've been living in a shelter in Germany for two years with two children under the age of six.

Sometimes, when I talk to people about it, I can see what they're thinking. There are some who don't hold back with all the prejudices, and others treat me like an exotic animal in a zoo. There are also some who are genuinely interested and see the bigger problem, which goes beyond ""my own fault.""

When I first tried to separate from my ex-partner, I stayed with an acquaintance. My ex accused me of kidnapping our children, called the police and I was too afraid to take them with me after that. The acquaintance didn't really say out loud that he didn't want me with him until weeks later, when he kicked me out of the apartment at 4:00 a.m. But the signs were visible much earlier. Loud video games until 3:00 a.m., even though I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. to go to work. Flirting, even physical assault, and yes, I even had sex for a place to sleep.

I eventually managed to escape and left with just a backpack, a pack of diapers, and €5 in my pocket. With children, of course.

What's it like living in a homeless shelter now? As if I'm being punished for something I didn't do. I'm now supposed to pay back money to authorities that I don't even have and never even received. Every cent went into my ex-partner's account.
Hot water only runs until 10:00 PM, laundry is only allowed Monday through Saturday from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM, with seven households having to share three washing machines, and some are allergic to certain detergent additives. The children aren't allowed to ride bikes or play soccer/volleyball/badminton in the garden. Anyone outside of the unspecified quiet hours is chased away by security. The organization of social work is confusing, and no one should believe that we're being treated as equals. The social workers just see me as pathetic and ""work."" And I'm supposed to constantly be grateful for what's being done for me here. Yet, in response to my desire for a bit more normality, each of these sentences sounds like emotional blackmail.
I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't go to a hair salon or have manicure s and don't even wear makeup. I always ""find clothes"" in the streets or in ""don't buy for anything""-stores. I go to the food bank and use the German kind of craigslist to look for free stuff and cheap things. And still I get nasty comments for having a phone or sitting in a coffee shop and eat a slice of cake. 

First, a violent offender lived next door to me who is now in prison; then a drunkard whose stepmother tried to get rid of his own child by unfair means; and finally, a woman with two children and an addiction lives next door to me who leaves the vacuum cleaner running for up to eight hours, considers everything her sole property, and regularly calls the police because she needs music as therapy until 3 a.m.

I keep my distance from the other women. Because even though alcohol and drugs are forbidden, that doesn't stop many people from doing it. When I once criticized them, I was the bad guy. The fact that some women want to finally get through rehab or (like me) have had bad experiences with addicted partners is dismissed as weakness and hysteria....

What hurts me most is being constantly alone. I don't talk to anyone about my living situation anymore, and I'm not looking for a new partner either. There are simply too many legacy issues, and I don't want to be ""rescued."" I want to get myself out of this situation, but I don't know how to handle it. There's no guarantee of an apartment, and the housing projects on offer continue to leave me dependent on the state.",1,1743282371.0,self,1,0.67,False
1jmw98h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmw98h,"As promised, A tribute to our big girl Fiona, we already miss you so much(Long read,please read)","-It breaks my heart every time I read a post about when someone loses a beloved pet, because they are our children and now it just happened to our family for the first time and we are all crushed.

-My wife and I had to let go of our pretty girl Fiona on March 26 due to a tumor on her spleen. This is our love story for Fiona..

-My wife and my son back in May of 2019 wanted to get a Frenchie and my wife that was waitressing at the time had a customer that was a breeder and sold them. The lady told my wife that she had a  3 year old that she couldn’t breed so the lady said she would just give Fiona to her for free.(Fiona is an American/Frenchie cross. She had the bigger frame of an American with all the facial features of a Frenchie).

-Fiona’s new life began on May 17, 2019 when my wife and son drove 1 hour from the Pa state line up to a farm in NY. When they arrived they met with the lady and walked them to a horse barn. While inside the barn my son said he saw two other dogs nipping at one another and then he said to the lady “ where’s the frenchie we’re supposed to be picking up”? She replied, “you just walked right past her”. My son said she was covered bad with barn hay and stench of feces and he just scooped Fiona up and got her right into the car and left.

-While driving home with Fiona, they had the windows down and hay was flying all over the place but they could already see in Fiona’s eyes that she thanked them for getting her out of that horrible place and saving her.

-Once they got Fiona home it took several baths to get her squeaky clean but she settled in real quick and she got to meet her two new beagle brothers- Bernie and Beaners. The home was now complete, Fiona had a new family to care for her and new brothers to play with. And in 2021 Fiona gained a little pug son(Frankie) after  my son got him as a puppy gift for Nan during the time she had cancer and then she passed away shortly after, Fiona became Frankie’s new mommy.

-The years that followed Fiona had the best life we could possibly offer her. She had the biggest fenced in yard to run around in , although it was for the other doggies because Fiona never left my wife or my side. 

-Fiona became the alpha female and became the guard dog of the house, it was like she felt like she had a need to protect us and alert us all or if someone was pulling in the driveway, I guess it probably had something to do with her big sonic ears..!

-Fiona had everything, from celebrating her birthday with party hats to swimming in the pool and sunbathing on the pool deck to getting treats while I barbecued during the summer months and rolled in the dirt while my wife and I worked on the flower beds and vegetable garden. Oh, and also Fiona loved biting on the vacuum cleaner and picking the whole thing up while it was running.!!

-Fiona had holiday clothes to wear and holiday treats for din-dins. Fiona also couldn’t wait till the first snow fall so she could roll in the snow and also eat it(the beagles had no interest in doing that), and she did this “every” winter until the snow melted. As much as I hate the snow now in life, I wish I could go out there and see her big footprints running through the snow. Fiona would also go nuts, as well as the other doggies, when I came back from harvesting a deer knowing that they all would be getting a special deer steak.

-Fiona was my coffee buddy every morning. After letting all four doggies outside Fiona would be the first one back in and sit next to me because she knew she could get extra treats before the others came back inside. So many times Fiona would run to the side door to trick the rest of the doggies into going outside again just to turn around and sit with my wife and I at the table for alone time and more treats to herself.

-Fiona had her 9th birthday coming up on April 1st and here we were thinking we can celebrate another birthday with Fiona and her buddies, but it is not going to happen.

-Last Friday night(March 21st) it was business as usual. The last time I let the pack out for the night is 11pm and as usual , all 4 of them bark to the top of their lungs right before I open the door and then BANG! 4 doggies trying to go out the door at the same time and then it’s a sprint race with Fiona usually in the lead. They do their usual barking at any scents that may arouse them and attack an occasional toad now that it’s toad season.

-Fiona seemed sick the next day and we thought she was maybe sick from eating a toad because that’s what happened to one of the beagles before. She ate a little for a couple days and drank water but she wasn’t bouncing back. My wife called the vet to get her in the next day(this past Wednesday) not knowing we would be making the decision to have to let her go. 

-My wife drove Fiona to the vet which is 7 minutes away while I was working on drywall with a contractor. My wife called crying and told me that the vet took an X-ray and found an inoperable tumor on her spleen and that surgery really wasn’t an option and that she was suffering. I left what I was doing and drove up to be with Fiona and my wife and Fiona perked up just for a minute when daddy walked in. I took my hoodie off and made a pillow for her and she rested her head on it. 

-My wife would always sing to Fiona from day one “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine” with the words altered using Fiona’s name within the song. My wife sang it to Fiona the whole time in a low tone soft voice. I held Fiona’s paw(we called it “holda hand”) and as I always whispered to her, “I love you pretty girl” over and over. We did this the whole time even after the first two anesthesia injections and then the final dose. After that she was gone in less than 30 seconds and Fiona left our lives and her poor little body didn’t have to hurt anymore. She was snoring so much right before that and I knew then she wasn’t suffering anymore. I had my phone on voice record just so in time I can play it back and hear her snore once again when I’m ready.

-My wife left the building to go get Fiona her bed and blanky she slept with to take her home in and I picked her up off the floor and held her close to my body and felt her warmth and I just wanted to hold her one last time and smell her head and hair and give her one more kiss goodbye. 

-To end my tribute to my big girl Fiona, All the pain that we have to endure when our pets pass is because they are not pets, they are our family and they are our small children that the Lord gave us to care and tend for and they are not with us for a long time, no minute should ever be taken for granted and no time should be left unspent without them. Take as many videos and photos as possible, because you never know when it will be the last. Give them all the best life you possibly can for these innocent souls.

-These were my final words to my big girl in the past, and in her final moments that I would always whisper Into her ear. 

-I start out real soft and I crescendo at the end. Here’s for you Fiona from mommy and daddy, Briar who saved you that day and the bad boy beagles Bernie and Beaners and to your little pug son Frankie who is missing his mommy Fiona right and your sister Fawnie the frenchie that came to see you from time to time:

       -(quiet)                      (softer)
     
          Fiona                     Fiona
“Feee-ohhh-nahhh , Feee-ohh -nahhh, 
  
                          - (louder)

I love you, I love you pretty girl, I love you pretty girl,  and I tell you,  and I tell you, AND I Tell YOU ALL THE TIIIIIIIME….!!!!”  ❤️

-Kisses big girl from all of us, I can’t wait to hold you in my arms again one day….🙏❤️.

1jmw8ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1jmw8ls/immigration_history_from_russian_poland_to_brazil/,Immigration History from Russian Poland to Brazil in 1890,"1976  
  
""I was 17 years old when I emigrated with my family to Brazil in 1890. My father, André Stawinski, was born in 1843 near the city of Kutno, not far from Warsaw. He married Verônica Wilicka and settled in Kutno, where he had a modest home. They had 5 daughters and 3 sons, all born in the Russian-occupied Polish region. The two eldest daughters married and moved to their own homes.

My father was an educated man. Besides Polish, he was fluent enough in German and Russian. He was a civil servant and, at the same time, ran a clandestine school for Polish children. At that time, the Russians had closed the Polish primary schools. To allow me to attend secondary school, my father had to send me to Warsaw. The Poles were living in times of harsh oppression. The churches were closed. Priests were either imprisoned and deported or forbidden to administer the sacraments of the Church. On Sundays, we held all the devotions at home that used to be held in churches, but without the presence of a priest.

My father's salary was enough to support the family. In the rural area, there were many poor people, homeless and without means of living. Often, groups of ragged and hungry children would knock on our door, asking for a piece of rye bread. The situation was becoming increasingly calamitous.

It was then that talk of emigration began. From all sides came echoes that in the Americas there was plenty of land available to anyone who wanted to emigrate.

Propaganda leaflets were spread everywhere. Then came the recruiters of emigrants. They offered conditions within everyone's reach. They knew how to exploit the people's misery and stir enthusiasm for emigration. From then on, there was only talk of the ""earthly paradise"" of the New World.

My father, at first, did not want to listen to that flashy propaganda. However, he ended up yielding to the persistent pleas of friends who had decided to emigrate to Brazil. He then sold his small property and agreed to lead the group of emigrants recruited in the Kutno and Mlawa region. All our belongings fit into 3 linen bags and 2 trunks.

The Russian authorities did not oppose our departure. They provided us with Russian passports relatively promptly. Officially, we would emigrate not as Poles, but as Russians. Our departure was scheduled for mid-October 1890. The journey had to be undertaken before the rainy and cold autumn season. The farewell to neighbors, relatives, and friends was accompanied by pathetic scenes.

Tears of those who were leaving mixed with those who were staying. It is impossible to describe the pain that tore our hearts. How difficult the hard separation was!

Sea Voyage

Our fate was sealed. We knew what we were leaving, but we could not guess what the future held. We had to leave, groping our way, towards an unknown homeland.

The first stage of the journey would begin in train cars. We were transported in carts to the nearest train station. Hundreds of emigrants, who had arrived there before us, were eagerly seeking accommodations in the freight cars. A Babel-like confusion reigned. The uproar was incredible. Each family looked for a corner inside the car to place their luggage and find a seat.

My father and I arranged our bundle by the entrance door. My two married sisters, accompanied by their respective husbands, came to the station to see us for the last time. That scene of hugs, kisses, and sobs remained forever etched in my mind. ""Z Bogiem! Niech Bóg was prowadzi""! (Goodbye! May God guide you!).

Finally, the time came for the train to leave the station. Packed like sardines in a can, we headed towards Poznań. We crossed Prussian territory, stopped for a few days in the city of Bremen, and from there continued our journey to the port of Hamburg. The ship that would transport us to Brazil had not yet docked. This forced the emigrants to stay for several days in the huge warehouses on the pier. My father had the nominal list of the families who were going to embark. He served as an interpreter with the Maritime company agents. He bought provisions at restaurants near the port. He tried to encourage those who had become impatient with the delay in the ship's arrival.

After long and tedious days of waiting, our boarding began. We were led to the ship's hold. Each family tried to settle as best they could. On the ship, there were many families of Italian emigrants, who were also heading to Brazil. They occupied a separate area. The crowding was great.

It was not easy to accommodate so many people in such a small space. What most distressed the emigrants was the absence of a priest on the ship. They were terrified by the thought that, during the sea crossing, they could get sick and die without the assistance of a Catholic priest. There was no other option but to place themselves under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, invoked under the title of ""Star of the Sea"". A makeshift altar was set up in the ship's hold with crates. Before the image of Our Lady of Czestochowa, placed on that rough altar, the emigrants made their daily prayers, singing the Godzinki praises and the antiphon ""Pod Twoja obroni uciekamy sie, Swieta Bozarodzicielko"" (We flee to your protection, Holy Mother of God).

Each Polish family brought devotional objects with them: the icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa, the rosary, and the blessed candle (Gronnica = large virgin wax candle).

The first days of the sea voyage passed without major events. As we moved away from the European continent, we began to rock at the mercy of the rough sea waves. Seasickness became widespread on board. Children and adults did not stop getting seasick. The discomfort increased with the sweltering heat at the equator.

The ship's captain allowed the emigrants to go up on deck to breathe some fresh air. Deaths of some children were recorded. The bodies were thrown into the sea. Consternation shook the passengers' spirits, filling them with panic.

After 20 days of suffering and desolation on the high seas, we felt immense relief when we sighted the Brazilian coast lined with mountains on the horizon. The ship docked at the port of Rio de Janeiro, from where we were transported in launches to Ilha das Flores. It seemed as if we had awakened from a nightmare. We found the tropical climate strange. In the barracks, we found accommodation and abundant food.

Many other Poles had arrived before us, who, the day after our arrival, left for Rio Grande do Sul on the steamer Rio Pardo. Our stay in the barracks of Ilha das Flores ended on December 6, when we boarded the steamer Vitória heading south. We arrived in Porto Alegre on December 17. From the Guaíba River pier to the Cristal barracks, women and children were taken in carts. Men and boys made the journey on foot. We paraded in single file under the gaze of many curious people posted along the way.

The people of Porto Alegre were already used to seeing many immigrant groups of other nationalities. However, they were not used to seeing Polish immigrants, who spoke such a strange language and wore such bizarre clothes. In the barracks, the strong summer heat and swarms of mosquitoes did not allow us to rest either day or night. Every day, we received visits from Polish families who, years before, had settled in Porto Alegre.

Heading to Colônia São Marcos Our stay was extended for a week. We learned that all the families in our group would be sent to Colônia São Marcos. The departure from Porto Alegre was scheduled for December 24. The Land and Colonization Board provided us with some rowboats. In the late afternoon of that day, we arrived in São João do Monte Negro. For the first time, we would celebrate Christmas in a foreign land. For Catholic Poles, Christmas is the main solemnity of the year. During the four weeks of Advent, Poles prepare for Christmas with fervent prayers and penitential acts. On Christmas Eve, each Polish family, gathered in their home, begins the celebration of the Savior's birth with a special rite. Recalling the angelic message ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will,"" the father and mother mutually apologize for faults committed during the year. Children reconcile with their parents and with each other. They then toast, mutually sharing the non-consecrated host, which they call ""Oplatek"". After dinner, without leaving the table, they sing Christmas carols, called ""kolendy"". We missed the Christmas celebrations in our homeland. Housed in barracks and surrounded by strangers, how could we celebrate Christmas according to our traditional custom? Making a virtue out of necessity, the families in our group gathered and, by the light of kerosene lanterns, sang ""kolendy"" (popular Christmas carols). The poor environment of the barracks was a living image of the Grotto of Bethlehem. Therefore, this Christmas vigil portrayed the birth of the divine redeemer more vividly.

On the 25th, we stayed in the barracks. Those who could, attended the festive mass in the main church. My father, on behalf of the entire group, greeted the vicar and presented him with wishes for a Happy Christmas. In the afternoon, the vicar came to visit us. Although he was German and did not speak Polish, he was received with visible demonstration of faith and contentment. Adults and children rushed to kiss his hand respectfully. Deeply moved, the priest gave us all his blessing. Such was our first Christmas celebrated in Brazil.

The next day, at sunrise, the Land and Colonization Board sent drovers and cart drivers to the accommodation. We received orders to continue the journey. The luggage was placed on the carts. Children were accommodated on top of the luggage. The drovers put the immigrants' trinkets in saddlebags, and in others, the provisions for 5 days: jerky, farofa, bread, ground coffee, and sugar. Without delay, the caravan began to move. At the front went the herd led by a guide. It was guided by 4 drovers, armed with machetes and pistols. The carts with the luggage and children followed. Women and girls, boys and men, forming small groups, began the walk under the scorching summer sun. A cloud of dust rose where this crowd of pedestrians walked. The drovers were experienced cowboys. They knew the entire long route and the stopping points, where there was shade and fresh water, inch by inch. Usually, they arrived at the stopping point an hour before the rest of the caravan. They unloaded the saddlebags, unsaddled the mules, gathered firewood, and lit the fire for the barbecue and coffee. After the frugal lunch, around 3 pm, the second stage of the walk began until the next stop, where there were huge sheds. We slept on the beaten earth floor, on tree leaves. The good German settlers, seeing us pass, offered us water, cornbread, and ripe bananas. They smiled at us with satisfaction when we said to them with a Polish accent ""Danke schon"" and ""Bóg zapłac"" (Thank you. God bless you). One could guess that these Germanic settlers had also gone through the same hardships when they were sent to that region.

With great difficulty, we managed to cross the Cai River. The hardest part of our journey was the ascent of the Feliz mountain range. We walked all day, and in the evening, when we looked back, we had the impression of still being at the starting point.""",0,1743282318.0,Genealogy,1,0.5,False

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743282265.0,WritersOfHorror,1,1.0,False

As a key suburb to the nation's capital, it was home to countless federal workers who made the daily commute to Washington, where the President resided in the iconic White House. Surrounded by the bustling neighborhoods of Arlington and nearby cities like Alexandria, Townsville flourished within the dynamic and diverse District of Columbia-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) area. Known for its cultural richness, the DMV offered boundless opportunities, from the world-class museums and monuments of D.C. to the rapidly expanding tech industries in Northern Virginia.

Situated along the scenic Potomac River, Townsville beautifully blended suburban tranquility with easy access to the fast-paced urban life of Washington, District of Columbia. Its prime location, with access to major highways and public transit options, including the Metro system, made it the perfect place for professionals seeking a peaceful residential life while remaining close to the nation's political and cultural epicenter. Families and young professionals alike were drawn to Townsville for its top-notch schools, expansive parks, and a growing economy that promised both opportunity and stability.

The DMV area, rich in history and home to diverse communities, offered a seamless fusion of modern innovation and tradition. The region's mix of government, politics, technology, and culture made it one of the most influential and vibrant in the country. Townsville's strategic location allowed its residents easy access to world-renowned educational institutions, cutting-edge tech companies, and some of the best healthcare facilities in the nation. Moreover, the area's diverse social landscape—from District of Columbia's thriving arts scene to the historic charm of Alexandria—ensured there was something for everyone.

Life in Townsville struck the perfect balance between suburban calm and urban excitement. The city embraced its proximity to one of the world's most powerful cities while maintaining a distinct local culture and a close-knit community atmosphere. Whether enjoying outdoor activities along the Potomac River, exploring the area's rich history, or indulging in the region's ever-evolving culinary scene, Townsville offered its residents a fulfilling lifestyle.

Thanks to the efficiency of the metro system, residents could easily commute to Maryland, Virginia, or Washington, District of Columbia, making the city a convenient and accessible home base. Over the years, Townsville had transformed into a thriving community, largely fueled by the economic prosperity of the DMV region. Much of this success, however, could also be attributed to Townsville's iconic trio of superheroes—the Powerpuff Girls—who not only protected the city but also became enduring symbols of hope and unity, inspiring pride in the hearts of its citizens.

Before Townsville introduced its groundbreaking Residential Treatment Program for villains, the city's crime rate had been spiraling out of control. Frustrated by the increasing violence and criminal activity, Townsville's leaders sought a more effective and humane solution to deal with its dangerous criminals. The city made the bold decision to establish a specialized residential treatment facility, where villains would be detained until they could undergo thorough evaluations by trained psychiatrists and behavioral experts. The program aimed not only to address the immediate threat posed by these criminals but also to provide a long-term rehabilitation strategy to break the cycle of violence.

To implement this, police officers were given the responsibility of capturing each villain and bringing them to the facility, where they would be assessed for any underlying psychological issues or traumas that might have contributed to their criminal behavior. In a city long accustomed to facing villainous threats, this initiative marked a shift in how justice was administered—focusing on rehabilitation over punishment.

The facility itself was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, providing a safe and controlled environment where experts could analyze each villain's behavior, motivations, and mental state. Along with the psychiatric evaluations, the program included counseling, anger management classes, and social reintegration training, giving villains a chance to reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens. This approach, while controversial, also aimed to reduce the long-term costs of incarceration, offering an innovative and hopeful alternative to the traditional prison system.

As Townsville moved forward with this initiative, the community began to question whether true redemption was possible for those who once wreaked havoc on their city. But the hope remained: with the right care and intervention, even the most notorious villains might one day become valuable members of society.

At the Residential Treatment Program for Townsville's villains, a diverse group of notorious criminals was housed for rehabilitation. Among them were familiar faces like Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, the Gangreen Gang (minus Ace, who had left early to join the band Gorillaz), Sedusa, Femme Fatale, and many others. This program was designed to help them confront their pasts, understand the concept of redemption, and ultimately transform their futures. The psychiatrists at the facility worked tirelessly with each individual, helping them grasp that redemption wasn't just about seeking forgiveness—it was about actively correcting past mistakes and changing their behavior for the better.

The facility wasn't just about one-on-one sessions; it also offered group therapy and various workshops designed to foster self-awareness and growth. One evening, Rob led an Anger Management group therapy session, where twenty familiar villains gathered in a circle, ready to face their inner turmoil. The room was tense, but there was a shared sense of purpose. Mojo Jojo was the first to speak, his voice sharp with frustration as he vented about the humiliation he felt from being repeatedly defeated by the Powerpuff Girls—his own sisters, no less.

Rob listened patiently, validating each villain's feelings and giving them the space to process their emotions. As the session continued, more villains began to share their painful stories, revealing the complex factors behind their descent into villainy. Mojo Jojo confessed the deep trauma he carried from witnessing the violent death of his mother while trying to protect her baby chimpanzee at a sanctuary in Louisiana. Ace opened up about the struggles his family endured growing up in poverty in the Bronx, New York. Snake shared his story of being expelled from a prestigious boarding school in McLean, Virginia, after a rebellious stint in vandalism with Ace. Arturo recounted how his father was jailed after his family illegally entered the District of Columbia-Maryland-Virginia area from Mexico, seeking a better life only to face heartbreaking consequences.

Femme Fatale, usually poised and controlled, tearfully revealed a hidden pain from her past—being sexual assaulted by a fraternity member while attending the University of Virginia, an event that left lasting emotional scars. Each villain shared deeply personal stories of hardship, loss, and betrayal. As they spoke, a sense of connection began to form between them—an understanding that their actions, however destructive, stemmed from unresolved trauma and pain.

However, as the therapy sessions progressed, it became clear that the road to redemption wasn't solely within their control. The villains had been heavily influenced by HIM, a notorious manipulator who had preyed on their vulnerabilities and pushed them toward even darker paths. HIM's sinister influence had shaped their decisions, turning them into tools of chaos and destruction. Mojo Jojo, Sedusa, Femme Fatale, and the Gangreen Gang had all fallen victim to his manipulative tactics—his promise of power and control had pushed them to make choices they might never have made on their own.

Despite this, the villains in the treatment program began to realize that they weren't entirely responsible for their actions. HIM had played a pivotal role in their downward spiral, and as they worked through their trauma, they started to find strength in knowing that they weren't beyond help. The road to redemption would be long and difficult, but with the support of the program and the willingness to confront their painful pasts, the villains began to see a glimmer of hope for a better future.

While the road to recovery wasn't guaranteed, it became clear that the program was more than just a containment facility—it was a place where even the most notorious criminals in Townsville had a chance to rebuild their lives, free from HIM's sinister influence.

Two years had passed, and many of Townsville's infamous villains had been successfully discharged from the Residential Treatment Program, their lives forever changed. Thanks to the dedication of their psychiatrists and the structured environment, several of them had made remarkable progress, shedding their villainous pasts and stepping into new chapters of their lives. The results were proof of the program's success—a testament to the power of rehabilitation over punishment.

The Gangreen Gang had disbanded. Ace, who had left the treatment program early to pursue his dream, had successfully joined the band Gorillaz, where he was living his dream of being a musician. Snake, once a troublemaker with little interest in academics after he met Ace, had turned his life around. He completed his GED during his time in the program and earned a scholarship to attend Stanford University in California, thanks to financial support from his wealthy family. Arturo, ever the family man, relocated to Silver Spring, Maryland, where he worked as a line cook at the Mexican restaurant his family had opened, building a stable future with his relatives. Grubber, always seeking a path beyond destruction, returned to the United Kingdom to follow his passion for writing. He enrolled at Oxford University to pursue a degree in literature, aiming to become a novelist and tell stories that could inspire change. Big Billy, finding a new sense of purpose, moved into a group home designed for special-needs monsters. There, he discovered fulfillment by helping others and contributing meaningfully to the community, finally finding peace and a way to give back.

Fuzzy Lumpkins, who had once been a force of destruction, left the program and returned to his cabin, where he found peace and joy in spending time with his grandchildren, reconnecting with the simpler pleasures of life. Sedusa, having discovered her talents outside of villainy, transitioned into a career in marketing within the beauty industry, using her charm and skills to help brands thrive in a new, positive context. And then there was one more…

\-----

Mojo Jojo, once the notorious foe of the Powerpuff Girls, was the first villain to enter the Residential Treatment Program. As the program's inaugural participant, he was also the first to confront his past in front of a group of twenty familiar faces, alongside his therapist, Rob. Over the next three years, Mojo Jojo committed himself to a rigorous process of self-reflection and healing. Through countless therapy sessions, he gradually worked through the trauma that had defined his early life.

Much like many other primates, Mojo Jojo's early experiences with humans were harsh and traumatic. Captivity, mistreatment, and neglect had left deep emotional scars that shaped his behavior and his view of the world. The most painful memory that haunted him, however, was the tragic loss of his mother. As a newborn chimpanzee, he had witnessed her death at the hands of humans who shot her while she tried to protect him. The trauma of losing her in such a violent and unjust manner became a defining moment in his life—one that fueled his rage and hatred toward both humans and himself.

Through his time in therapy, Mojo Jojo slowly began to untangle the complex web of grief, anger, and abandonment that had driven his villainous actions. Although the path to healing was long and fraught with setbacks, the once-feared villain began to see that the pain of his past didn't have to dictate his future. The more he opened up, the closer he came to understanding that redemption wasn't just about seeking forgiveness; it was about acknowledging the pain and taking responsibility for his actions, no matter how far gone he had once felt.

Mojo Jojo's story didn't end with the loss of his mother. After the tragic death of his original companion, Joe, who succumbed to an allergic reaction caused by Chemical X, Professor Utonium—his surrogate father—rescued a newborn chimpanzee from Louisiana. The Professor named him Jojo, and the young chimpanzee, though no replacement for Joe, brought a glimmer of joy back into their lives, helping to heal some of the emotional wounds from the past.

However, the traumatic events of Mojo Jojo's life didn't stop there. Along with the emotional scars from his early experiences, he also had to contend with a serious health diagnosis. As a result of being exposed to Chemical X at such a young age, Mojo Jojo was genetically mutated, which led to his diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes when he was just 13 months old. The memory of that time was fuzzy, but he recalled Professor Utonium taking him to a veterinary hospital in Washington, District of Columbia, for a series of blood tests. The results were devastating. The tests confirmed the diagnosis, and a veterinary assistant explained to Professor that, as an animal, Mojo Jojo was classified under specific medical guidelines.

Thanks to the Professor's pet insurance, Mojo Jojo was able to get the insulin he needed to manage his condition. But the diagnosis added another layer of complexity to Mojo Jojo's already tumultuous life. He had to learn to live with both the physical limitations of his illness and the emotional burden of feeling different—isolated from others, even in the midst of a family that loved him. The weight of his mutation, his illness, and the past he couldn't escape all contributed to the anger and resentment that had defined his later years.

Despite everything, the support of Professor Utonium and the presence of Jojo provided Mojo Jojo with some semblance of stability in an otherwise chaotic life. But as he entered the Residential Treatment Program, he began to realize that healing would require more than just managing his diabetes or finding comfort in family. It meant confronting the deeper wounds within himself and finding a way to move beyond the darkness of his past.

During his time in the Residential Treatment Program, Mojo Jojo focused on preparing for the SATs, with the goal of being accepted into the bioengineering program at Virginia Tech—his surrogate father's alma mater. The idea of following in Professor Utonium's footsteps gave him a sense of purpose that he had never known before. As he studied and worked hard, he began to picture a future where he could use his intellect for something good, rather than relying on his former life of villainy.

However, when Mojo Jojo was finally released from the program, he was confronted with an unexpected blow. His lair, the place where he had spent one year plotting his schemes, was set to be demolished. The city council had approved a plan to raze the building, leaving Mojo Jojo with no place to call home. With nowhere else to go, Mojo Jojo was forced to swallow his pride and return to the Utonium household.

Gone was the supervillain garb—he traded his iconic uniform for a simple T-shirt, khaki shorts, and brown Birkenstock sandals, embracing a more humble lifestyle. Mojo Jojo knew that if he was truly going to change, he needed to leave the past behind. To support himself and start saving for his future at Virginia Tech, he took a part-time job at a local bookstore. It wasn't the life he had envisioned for himself when he was bent on world domination, but it was a start. He focused on doing the work and saving money, determined to build a new life—one that didn't revolve around villainy.

But just when Mojo Jojo thought he was making progress, the past caught up with him. One day, a former ally from his villainous days reached out, with an offer that seemed almost too tempting to refuse. The old, familiar pull of power and control was there, and for a moment, Mojo Jojo found himself torn between the life he was building and the life he had left behind.

Nine months had passed since Mojo Jojo was discharged from the Residential Treatment Program. He sat in the kitchen of the Utonium household, dressed casually in a gray ""Virginia Tech"" T-shirt, navy blue twill shorts, and White Adidas Ultraboost DNA 1.0 Sneakers. His Apple Watch rested on his wrist, and his AirPods played some calming music as he sipped from a mug of hot coffee. The soft hum of the kitchen filled the space, a stark contrast to the chaotic life he used to lead.

Just then, Professor Utonium entered the kitchen, as always in his signature white lab coat, pens tucked into its pocket, with a shirt and tie underneath. He held a large envelope in his hands and smiled as he approached Mojo Jojo.

""Good morning, Jojo,"" Professor Utonium said, his voice warm. He extended the envelope. ""I think this might be your acceptance letter.""

Mojo Jojo's heart skipped a beat. He eagerly tore open the envelope and scanned the letter inside. As his eyes quickly scanned the words, a smile spread across his face. His eyes lit up as he turned toward the Professor, beaming with excitement.

""I got accepted to the bioengineering program at Virginia Tech!"" Mojo Jojo exclaimed, his voice filled with joy and disbelief. He could hardly contain his happiness.

Professor Utonium's face lit up with pride. He stepped forward and, without hesitation, enveloped Mojo Jojo in a heartfelt hug. For a moment, they stood there in silence, the weight of their shared journey heavy in the air. The embrace was more than just a congratulation—it was a symbol of how far Mojo Jojo had come, from the villainous, angry chimpanzee he once was to this moment of triumph and transformation. It was a quiet yet powerful recognition of redemption and the possibilities of a new life.

In March 2025, most college students were embarking on their spring break adventures, heading off to their various destinations—whether it was to sunny beaches, adventurous road trips, or quiet retreats to recharge before the end of the semester. The typical buzz of excitement filled the air as campuses emptied, with friends and classmates making plans for their week-long escapes from the stress of exams, assignments, and the daily grind of college life.

Snake, now known by his real name, Sanford Ingleberry, had been looking forward to a much-needed spring break with his girlfriend, Kelsey. The two had planned a dream trip to Japan, eager to explore the bustling streets of Tokyo and indulge in their shared love for the country's culture and cuisine. However, just days before their departure, Snake received unexpected news: he was required to attend a two-week therapy session with Rob, the same therapist who had worked with him during his time at the Residential Treatment Program.

The news came as a shock. He had been hoping for a relaxing getaway to recharge and enjoy some time off with Kelsey. But instead, he found himself booking a last-minute flight from California back to Virginia to fulfill the required updates following his release from the program. Although the therapy sessions were an important part of his continued progress, Snake couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. Japan had been the perfect escape from the stress of academics and the constant pressure of rebuilding his life. But now, he had to put those plans on hold.

Despite the setback, Snake was determined to make the best of the situation. He explained the change in plans to Kelsey, who understood the importance of his therapy sessions and supported him. While the trip to Japan would have to wait, Snake knew that continuing his journey of self-discovery and healing was just as important as any vacation. He boarded the plane back to Virginia, ready to reconnect with his former fellow villains and face whatever challenges lay ahead in those two weeks of therapy. It was just another step in his ongoing effort to move forward, to truly leave his villainous past behind, and build the future he had always wanted.

At Dulles International Airport, the former members of the Gangreen Gang waited eagerly near the baggage claim, holding up a colorful banner that read, ""Welcome back to Townsville, Snake and Grubber!"" The sight of it made Snake's heart swell with nostalgia, knowing that even after all this time, his old friends were here to support him.

Ace stood proudly at the front of the group, dressed in a white tee, a black leather jacket, black skinny jeans, and sleek black boots. His usual air of cool confidence was unmistakable. Arturo was next to him, wearing a burgundy hooded sweatshirt, black joggers, and his trusty white and black Nike Air Force 1 sneakers. Big Billy, ever the gentle giant, wore a green t-shirt with yellow stripes on each sleeve, paired with a dark green zippered hoodie, blue jeans, and white/navy blue Avia Quickstep sneakers from Walmart.

The sound of footsteps echoed through the terminal as Snake emerged from the baggage claim area. He was dressed casually but with a unique style that set him apart. He wore an olive green thrifted sweater under an antique green army jacket, black Dickies Double Knee Utility jeans, and black Vans SK8-Hi sneakers. His Apple AirPods Max hung around his neck, and his signature brown Kangol hat was perched backward, adding to his effortlessly cool appearance. In one hand, he carried a cream canvas tote bag emblazoned with the words ""Stanford, Stanford, Stanford, Stanford"" in bold lettering, while his other hand held a black Calpak carry-on suitcase, a subtle nod to the progress he had made since his time in the program.

The moment Snake spotted his old friends, his face lit up with joy. Without a second thought, he rushed over to them, throwing his arms wide for a group hug.

""Ace! Arturo! Big Billy!"" Snake shouted with excitement, his voice full of warmth and happiness. The three of them wrapped him up in a tight embrace, laughing and catching up in the way only old friends can.

In that moment, all the years of distance and the changes they'd gone through seemed to melt away. The bond they shared was still as strong as ever, and Snake knew that no matter where life took him, these friendships were ones he'd carry with him forever.

On the road from Blacksburg, Virginia to Townsville, Virginia, the car cruised smoothly along the highway, with the landscape of rolling hills and lush forests unfolding around them. Professor Utonium, focused on the road ahead, gripped the steering wheel with his usual calm precision. His glasses caught the light as he glanced occasionally at the rearview mirror, ensuring everything was safe and steady.

In the passenger seat, Mojo Jojo sat in the shotgun position, his eyes drifting from the passing scenery to the occasional glance at Professor Utonium. Although he had been working hard on moving forward in his life, there was still a hint of uncertainty in his posture, as if he were both eager and nervous for what lay ahead. His hands rested on his lap, his fingers lightly tapping against his knee as if subconsciously processing the long journey that had led him here.

The silence between them was comfortable, filled with the hum of the car's engine and the occasional sound of tires rolling over the pavement. There were no words needed—the distance they had traveled, both literally and figuratively, was something they both understood deeply. Professor Utonium glanced over at Mojo Jojo and gave him a small, reassuring smile.

""You've come a long way, Jojo,"" he said, his voice soft but filled with pride. ""I know you've got a lot ahead of you, but I'm proud of everything you've accomplished so far.""

Mojo Jojo returned the smile, albeit a little reserved. He was still adjusting to the idea of being someone new, someone different than the villainous persona he once embodied. The road to redemption, though long and difficult, was a path he now walked with purpose.

""Thanks, Professor,"" Mojo Jojo replied, his voice carrying a mix of gratitude and determination. ""It feels good, you know? Not just to be out of the program, but to know I'm... changing.""

As they drove closer to Townsville, the city looming just on the horizon, the road ahead felt wide open with possibility—one that Mojo Jojo had never imagined would be his.",1,1743282245.0,powerpuffgirls,0,1.0,False

1jmw6vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1jmw6vu/my_food_service_job_is_killing_me_slowly/,My food service job is killing me slowly.,"I've been working at the same job on my college's campus for over a year now. It's a pretty simple job, at least when I have coworkers... which now I don't. I am the longest standing employee besides my supervisor.

It's a food service job, think of it like a combination McDonald's and Chipotle. We have a grill side, where we do burgers, fries, chicken sandwiches/tenders, and a Chipotle inspired side where we do burritos and rice bowls. It works fine so long as there are 3 people back there. One to work the grill, one to make burritos, and one to take orders and drop fryer baskets. Plus a fourth person is necessary to work the cash register, and a fifth to run the coffee corner. I can make it work with just me and one other person behind the food counter, because I'm pretty efficient at multitasking now.

This used to be a pretty chill place to work. We were allowed to do our homework and study on the job, so long as we weren't ignoring customers, and since our hours were flexible, we were always properly staffed. The supervisor was friends with most everyone and we all got along. 

Nowadays, the management runs the place like the army. One of our baristas has a heart condition and can't stand for a long period of time. She was not allowed to sit. So she quit. One of the cooks has a super pregnant girlfriend and dared to answer his phone when she called. The manager singles him out constantly  because of it, so now so he's quitting. The other cook and the cashier got sick of having to overextend themselves and quit. Now it's me and one other guy who is constantly high and good for almost nothing. The supervisor, who used to be chill and helpful, now sits in the back on her phone. She's been reported 3 times and nothing has been done. 

But IMO, the biggest issue with the place is the pay. I was getting $15 an hour and the new ad they put up is hiring people from $16 to $18. AND the guy who's high and JUST GOT HIRED 3 weeks ago, is getting $16.

They promoted me and promised a raise a month ago. The raise finally came through. 45 cents. I'm convinced this was just a ploy to get me to stay longer/to the end of the semester. I will not be taking this lying down. If I quit they are absolutely screwed. I'm not being self-important, I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point besides go straight to the manager, who hates my guts. Oh well.",3,1743282183.0,work,3,0.8,False
1jmw6f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1jmw6f9/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743282148.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

Howsoever I try, I still feel suffocated. Will it ever end?","I am quite strong, survived multiple tough situation, but this one fuck-up in life is like a never-ending-struggle. We are a social animal and friends, people around us are damn important to everyone. Howsoever you read and listen to those self help talks and listen to Ekala Chalo re shit, the ultimate truth is we all need a companion/partner as well as the group where you can be yourself. I do not understand where I belong. I am 30+ single Male, Gay and being in India, I am kinda closeted. I am out to my family and even few friends, but still there is hardly any of them who understand what do I long for. They have accepted my decision of not getting married, and finding the right guy has its own challenges in the gay community. But living a respectful life is still so tough.

1. Most of my college friends, colleagues got married, date, talk about their hinge dates and what not, those who get married hangout with married friends. I kinda feel left out.  
2. I make new friends, but again when we spend more time, go out for drinks, trips eventually there is a comfort level and they start asking me about my dating life and either I have to make up some stories or just divert the topic, And I kinda lose all the comfort level or the good bond that had started to develop. Eventually feeling alone.  
3. I am just like another straight guy in terms of life, thoughts, hobbies. Except for the fact that I kinda get attracted to men. The way my friends long to have a good time or date or coffee or movie or some special time together with a girl, I also long for all of it but with a guy.  
4. There is so much that it is hard to explain. Where to start. It feels like everyone else is living in different world, even if I have to tell someone my desires, how strongly I also want to be a father, have a family - there is so much mis-conception or wrong stereotype (of LGBT) in the society that it is scary to even share my true self with my close people and expect things to be normal (forget better)  
5. 20-30 is a big struggle for every gay and I am way beyond that, but even the other person is going through struggle and chances of getting the right loyal partner is way fucked up.  
6. Even if I have to rant and explain my side, I am like, fucking these people will not even completely understand my side and I have no energy left to put my side correctly.  
7. I have had enough hookups, I do not regret the body count which must be at least 500. But that's not I want for forever. I want some Mr Forever.  
8. I want to explore other aspects of relationship, beyond sex.  
9. Just like everyone else, I too have other challenges, Careers, Personal life, Parents expectations, stability.   
10. After a decade of struggle, I am at much better place but still it feels there is so much still there.

I do not know, if I can explain everything that's on my mind. But at least writing something would make me feel lighter. 

And, I will not say be kind to me, but I would rather say, just be honest. Because everyone's honesty in the comments, will reflect the reality of the society. 

Just imagine, one of your close friends, close school friend, college friend, colleague, gym buddy, society buddy - whoever come to you and kinda says that he has this desire to settle with a guy, have a family, have a kid, stay in the society, attend your functions with his plus one, go out for trips, movies, concerts with his plus one, have same fun, chat, conversations, drinks, nightouts, roadtrips, with same group but with his plus one. Hold his partner's hand, have a lovy dovy caring, affectionate talk about his plus one - just that plus one is a guy. Will you be understanding, accepting, caring enough or will you get confused, shocked and make fun of it, not just once but for forever later.

IDK what I am writing. There is so much to talk. May be I should just sleep and get up tomorrow morning and plan again to face this cruel side of my life. Oh yeah, there are many other good aspects of life, I do enjoy all of them. But I need to win this battle as well. I will win someday for sure.

1jmw4wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1jmw4wq/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743281915.0,WritersGroup,1,1.0,False

After the fast, I had a massive bowl of bone broth and some scrambled eggs with cheese and a little bit of Frank’s hot sauce on top. In the bone broth, I also dropped in two eggs. That was my evening meal and I was satiated and in heaven. The next day I had pretty much 3/4 of a pack of bacon which I got from Costco. It was low sodium and had no sugar in it. I also had a couple scrambled eggs. For lunch I had a burger patty with some sliced cheddar cheese on top and about 10 chicken wings with hot sauce. I cooked up a sirloin steak for dinner and had some Genoa salami has a snack later in the evening.

This morning I had four scrambled eggs and one of Costco‘s Harvest Smoked Farmer's Sausage. I also take one packet of electrolytes in the morning and have a cup of coffee with a little bit of cream inside or some butter.

I’m not a big organ eater, so I just want to make sure I’m getting enough nutrients. I could take a multivitamin each day I’m thinking.

Going forward I’m going to have lots of ground beef, burger patties, more steak, bacon wrapped chicken, which I purchased recently from local butcher, and more bone broth.

Am I on the right track or am I missing something essential?

Also, do I need to be worried about taking too much salt? Is there such a thing?

And the close friend also likes her. He knows that I liked her and asked her out and she rejected me telling she isn't looking for something like this.
And I just got to know they are really close now, they go on dates drink coffee and study together. 

I am extremely heartbroken 
I feel the shittiest I have felt in so long. I feel so shit about myself, as much as he is my friend I have started to envy him 
He is better looking than me, he dances well, he is so smarter than me, he is thinner and more muscular than me, heck he speaks better than I do
I feel so bad about myself
He is academically very acclaimed and has got recognised by a lot of ivy colleges.

Me and him along with some of my friends are building some tech thing as well and we work very closely. Seeing him getting verything I failed to get I find it really hard to just exist. It is inevitable to face him smiling at his phone texting her, sharing memes with her - with the same girl who I liked. She laughs at his jokes a lot. I am really hard to process everything.

When I was in school my ex gf cheated on me with someone who i knew again. I had to deal with it and see them for some time. Right now I see my friend and my crush together all the time and tbh it's not even their fault. It took me a lot of courage and around 4 years to build and pick myaelf up to stand. I also had built up a habit to self harm for a very long time. It was just around a year back since I stopped. 
For my ex gf i knew she was the wrong and I was being in denial.
Today I stand at a place where I know they didn't do anything wrong. I have started to envy my friend since he is like that harvard guy, that ML guy 
Since day one I rooted for him but seeing him with her it just shows me about how I am no one and I lost her again. I lost someone who I had a crush on again. 
I hate how it is going on. it took me so much time the last time to move on.
I want to cry my heart out. I am really not able to process how I will have to see him everyday and work with him around 1 2 hrs a day. It's those small things like notification popping up and it s her text to him about some stuff. I am not able to deal with that. It's just that I initially thought they were just talking but to know they are soo close, I have not been able to process a lot of stuff. 
Please help me how do I get right? I don't want to do what i did before and get onto self harm and worthless grind. I don't want to remain in a feeling of jealousy and envy. How do I stop feeling so so so super insecure about everything and seeing that I have some worth as well?

Tldr: I liked a girl and now my close friend and her are very close and dating. We work on a proj together everyday for 2 hrs atleast. So I am finding it hard to process.",1,1743281453.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1jmvvx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1jmvvx0/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743281356.0,story,1,1.0,False
1jmvvep,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1jmvvep/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"My (now ex) 44m, but we are on-off, has two sons, 11m and 8m. Im 34f. 

Every other week he dives in head first to be with his kids. Every other week was great, he had some sporadic contact with his kids here and there but nothing that felt out of the ordinary. 

But yes, back to the weeks he has custody:

1. He could rarely hang out just him and I, not even for coffee (he offered for me to hang out with the three of them, but since we were so shaky \[me contributing with my anxiety, but thats a separate story\], we both agreed to hold off meeting the kids again - I met them a handful of times). In the beginning of our relationships we did lunches 1-2 a week but that fizzled out. So essentially our relationship was every other week.

2. He couldnt leave the kids to even come to run club Sundays (or common interest). Run club is 1-2 hrs right by his house. 

3. He did most chores. He could call me when he was cooking for the kids, since they would be playing video games then. I questioned this, and he said that ""its getting better"" and that they now take their plates away for the most part. I noted a few times when spending time with them that they didnt take their plates away from the table. But I think there has been some small improvement. His eldest seems to take some responsibility and gave away paper notes with ""chores"" to his dad for Christmas.

4. He spends 30 min-45 min putting the kids to bed, reading stories for them. 

5. He sometimes complained over lack of sleep, because the youngest came in at 6 AM and disturbed his sleep schedule.

6. He would never ask his ex to take care of the kids (e.g. if I asked him to attend a wedding with me) - because he didnt want their schedule to be made flexible. Sometimes she would bring the kids over on his childfree weeks, and he would accept if he was available.  

7. Weekends were revolved around the kids deciding on activities. They had 2-3 extracurriculars during the weeks. 

8. He said if him and I get kids, it would be 50-50 when he doesnt have his kids, and likely 75% (on me)-25% (on him) when he has his kids, realistically speaking because he has to be with his kids, and I have to take greater responsibility for new kids, due to his time constraint. That kinda rubbed me the wrong way. 

9. I complained about a lot of this, and have asked him to meet me half way, and he said that he could maybe improve his situation by 20%, (i.e. freed up time, by putting more responsibility on his kids) but not more. And also that his own kids will get older = hence better.

Should mention that his youngest has some type of adhd or similar, regularly starts tantrums, screaming etc. So my ex is exhausted due to this. We broke up for many reasons - my own responses to this contributing, but yeah, I couldnt deal. 

Are the above green flags? Or red? Why I cringe is because my own parents were so strict. I cant tell if I dodged a bullet or just a great dad and partner.",1,1743281317.0,stepparents,19,0.6,False

1jmvsgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1jmvsgq/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743281086.0,spooky_stories,1,1.0,False

Have you ever noticed how no one escapes the most basic form factors of humanity? How early childhood traumas shape peoples entire lives? Especially the wealthy and influential. So many people live swiss cheesed lives with gaping delusional holes. Delusions they hold dear. For instance, the belief that not only is one special but that they can *show* how special they are to their aggressor so hard that their aggressor will agree with them. And not only to agree with them, but that they'll change their wicked, and even show them affection. A beautiful fantasy, a wonderous thought, but that's not how life works is it? More often the victim is dragged forward through time with an aggressor continuously victimizing them. 

Just something I've noticed. I'm always noticing things, I'm rather clever, have you noticed how clever I am? I hope so. I'd love to chat BTW, would you like to meet sometime for coffee? But silly me. We're both Mormons and we don't drink coffee, do we? Sigh. Nevermind then.  
  
I was also thinking the other day, if David Attenborough were to make a documentary on ""Millionaires - and How They Push Society,"" *what* would it be like? David is a classy guy. He's English! And his Winnie-The-Pooh-esque voice draws me into a place filled with wonder. Sadly, I am not a classy guy, I'm just a fricking American. But despite my shortcomings, I'm going to give this a shot but I have to go back a bit.  
  
Since childhood, I've known a surprising collection of ""Millionaires."" For instance, my Mission President was a ""Millionaire."" Like you, we could barely stand each other. Quick caveat, when I say ""Millionaire"" for convenience sake I include ""Multi-Millionaire,"" ""Billionaire,"" and ""Multi-Billionaire. I do this because the average person doesn't understand the difference between a mere millionaire and a billionaire. But to be transparent, if we break down dollars into seconds, one million seconds is roughly 11.5 days while 1 billion seconds is roughly 31.5 years. As you can see President, in comparison, a billion is a plethora of gargantuan things. While you officially make nearly 2 million dollars a years, you're still far from a billion (officially). #lifegoals - as the kids say.  
  
But back to MY story. My Mission President found me to be a foreign object which they deemed too alien to be an effective missionary/worker. While I respected my Mission President very much (How could I not? He had all the power), he was always trying to send me home every other month. Sometimes quite spontaneously. In these moments had to remind him the Church frowned kidnapping and other like things. These conversations always upset him because he was one of these people that was always ""right."" And if there were moments were he was shown to be incorrect he would gaslight the living spuds out of the situation. Despite his sorcerous powers, I couldn't help but notice, almost every missionaries he considered stalwart (Assistants to The President, Zone Leaders, District Leaders etc.) often fell away from the church shortly after returning home. Which is a contradiction I still don't understand, because, while I don't fit the mold of ""A Good Mormon Boy,"" I never fell away. Surprising many. Did you have a positive relationship with your Mission President? I hope so. But enough reminicsing about ancient history.  
  
Let's review the success of the human race and how ""Millionaires"" fit into it. This chart is rather boring, no pretty colors and I'm citing no sources, because, like me, it's basic.  
  
[SEE BASIC CHART HERE!](https://ibb.co/Z6Z6pHgX)  
  
Until recent times (being the past 200 years) humanity has had a rather pitiful and drudge-like existence. We barely hung on with a high birth and high mortality rate. Times were bad. Mommy's and Daddy's were always sad and babies were always dying, or worse, growing up to replace their parents and become sad Mommy's and Daddy's themselves. The Human race would often war upon itself like primitive pigs. Slavery. Rape. Atrocities. These were common. Still are now that I think it. We still war on each often don't we? But can that be held against us? There's a lot more of us and war is quite profitable so I guess that's okay. Regardless, despite our infighting, humanity became an extremely successful organism. So successful that we outnumber and out-compete everything. Nature can't hold us in check anymore, we're too intelligent.  
We evolved to fix problems but never moved beyond our basic limitations to handle stress, desires for revenge, or lust to become better than other tribes. Which is why we still have war, and rape, and revenge, and stress, and all the other human things. We like to live in a civilized world but it's not, everyone is an asshole. Everyone.   
  
For instance, to show we were smarter than others, Americans dammed mighty rivers forever and put dune buggies on the moon. As a cherry on top, humanity, being unstoppable, decided to have a population explosion (because that's what happy people do). And now we we have no predators. We are that successful. No dangers keep us in check, aside from felons and societal deviants, which we'll ignore. Why dwell on troubling topics? 

So we became our own predators. Predators not (usually) in the organic manner (like a lion, a wolf, or a bear, etc.) but in a higher form, inescapable power. Business. Businesses with HR to protect the business from the inside, PR to promote the business, and lawyers to protect the business from litigation or to attack and litigate other businesses. Then, naturally, there are laws for the rich and laws for the poor. Democracy helped spread success with it's declaration of ""Equality For All"" and ""Millionaires"" (or what passed for them in those days) quickly financed politicians which complicated many things and still do. Yes, if Democracy has anything going for it, it is truly the best of all the worst choices. Truly, look at our Republic. Power and money and ""Millionaires"" show society for what it is. LOOK! LOOK at the INTERNET! It's filled with JERKS. Jerks everywhere. I can't fix it. I've tried! But that was when I was young and virile. Filled with solutions until I learned there weren't many. What's the answer? I'm not sure yet. I'm still working on it, but I know humanity is tired of it. Why? Because of numbers! Historically, it's always numbers that always makes make humanity happy or sad.  
  
Behold! The next chart! Unlike the last chart it's not basic! I swiped it from [HERE](https://population.gov.au/sites/population.gov.au/files/2025-02/2024-un-world-pop-prospects.pdf).   
[INSERT AWESOME, PRETTY CHART](https://ibb.co/zTwBN4J4)  
  
It boasts many pretty colors and words. It shows evidence that all people everywhere, don't want to be here except the wealthy, by virtue of the fact that we (as I mentioned in my last letter) are having dramatically less babies. Not that humanity stopped having sex, no we're having much more, we're just not having children. Sex is fun, children are work, and why pass the future forward when we b0rked it up so bad?  
Many see the broken world for what it is. It's a lot like believing in Santa Clause. Oh my God. Santa. A  beautiful fabrication to impel belief in something that doesn't exist and most people still buy into it.  
But instead of Santa they believe in people more powerful than them, they don't even believe in themselves. They believe in their boss, or their Trump, or Elon, or Barbie-Shaped-Celebrity. They wait on the Ubermencsch to save the day. Superman. Santa. ""Millionaires.""  
  
These times man.  
  
Honestly, if I had a time machine, I'd go back to the middle stone-age. A horrifying time when life was worth living. I'd knap out arrowheads like a boss, learn how to to hunt and gather, make fire, make babies, make peace, live in an awesome tree-fort and be rightfully terrified of predators instead of the people I take care of. Then die young saving the tribe from a pack of saber-toothed tigers with a spear. HELL YEAH. Pass the world onto the next generation. I would be such a sexy primitive badass! And that's exactly what the world was for so, so, so long... but not anymore. Now we have stresses to replace the predators and we're unable to handle them. And we have really WEIRD technology that shouldn't exist because some dreamer created a science fiction movie and Steve Jobs decided to make all the nerds create the devices he loved in the movie.  
  
Sigh. President, remember when the Internet was invented? I thought it was a fad and I waited for it to die out. Instead, like the bullies in Elementary School, the Internet grew up with me and became central to society. The fantastic idealized world I believed in simply became a place where bullies had more opportunities. A ""Millionaire"" is a bully of sorts, and they wouldn't have it any other way.   
  
But now that I think of it, perhaps my entire commentary above is needless as David Attenborough HAS documented a creature parallel to ""Millionaires."" I'm not inserting a video, you can google it ""The Royal Blue Caterpillar."" David's documentary documents the behavior of a carnivorous caterpillar which poses as an ant queen. It's entire desire is to be abducted and taken to an ant colony. To this end, the caterpillar bribes an ant with a drop of honeydew, then bellows a noise similar to an ant queen in distress, and instead of being eaten, the caterpillar is taken to the nest and taken care of. A stunning turn of events. The caterpillar then eats the larvae of the colony until it metamorphizes into stunning ""Royal Blue"" butterfly.  
The Royal Blue is beautiful. Behold it! Behold how it shimmers in the sunshine, how prettily it flies! Note how majestic and peaceful it is? Yes. It's a symbol of peace and pollination and strength. It just had to eat entire generations of ant larvae to do so. Is that it's fault?  
  
But like we discussed, ""Millionaires"" are not ""biological"" predators, they lean more into psychological, financial and spiritual predatory realms. As you know, becoming a ""Millionaire"" requires sacrifices and a pragmatic level of domination. ""Millionaires"" have no need to eat ant caviar, though I don't know why they don't (it's buttery and delicious) no, they've evolved to use other tools. They simply EMPLOY their dominion. And then quite suddenly everyone in society needed a job instead of needing to hunt or grow crops. Now chunks of humanity are religiously loyal to promoting ""The Brand."" This requires the purchase and selling of talents, time, will, loyalty, and how people spend their lives. This exposes VALUE. If there's anything of value, that valuable things can be traded for at cost of the perceived or promoted value. This includes tangible and intangible products, including people themselves. Not because the people are ""owned"" per se but because they are controlled by the product they produce and if you own the talents that produce the product, it often equals the same thing. Why buy when you can lease, cheap? If you get tired of them, they can be fired and someone else can own their talents. Synergistic fiduciary requirements aren't going to support themselves amiright?  
  
""Millionaires"" require society to perceive survival in terms of ""job"" and if one works ""job"" well enough, then they too can self-identify as ""Millionaire,"" but it's not that easy is it President? That is a treasured and conveniently placed morsel of propaganda. ""Be a peaceful and perfected Royal Blue, like me. Show me what you've got. It's all about dedication to the brand."" But you're not peaceful, in reality, ""Millionaires"" are both butterfly and caterpillar depending on the situation. It's awe-striking. When most people realize what is required to be a ""Millionaire"" they quell, not because it's difficult but it requires pragmatic objectivity. Say what you will about the human race, but many have instincts that are non-predatory. But as the saying goes, ""If God didn't want them shorn, he wouldn't have made them sheep,"" right?  
  
But this subject is making me tired now, let's switch topics.   
  
I've been thinking... while being Machiavellian is nice and all, I think you and I could use a better mentor. The BEST mentor. Yes, the one our religion always talks about. Now, I know religion offers convenient handles to control others but we're not focusing on that right now, we're talking about something pure. God. Not personal power.   
  
President, do we lean on our God or do we lean on the popularity we seek in our peers? I know what the bullies from Elementary School would say. They were good church members too. Such powerful testimonies they would bear in Church on Sunday. Emotional tears running down their face. I'd cry too, but it was always on Monday  after they'd steal my ball, pin me down and punch me in the face. Hard. I would have done anything to make them like me. I tried to tell them. Truthfully, they were good Christian boys. Solid corn-fed young men. Bastions. Good Mormon Boys. And they became highly successful. Unfortunately, I opted for the wrong story-line, I believed in Santa Clause for a very, very long time.  
  
Yes. It's the popularity of our peers that wins over Christ standing there lonely, asking if we want to play Scrabble. And, President, who doesn't want to play Scrabble with Jesus? WHO!? Who would pass that up!? I do. All the time. God! He stands there so lonely, shunned by everyone, his great heart just... breaking.  
  
""Guys? Hello? C'mon guys I made lemonade? It's WAY easier than wine. Guys? Hey! Wanna? Wanna spend some time with me and play Scrabble? Mebbe a nice game of Uno? I've so much I want to tell you. I... I misss you so much.""

(I'm sure you've noticed the irony of AI generated images. I wish AI would do the work I didn't enjoy doing instead of making all of the art I wish I were. Now that you and I have replaced all the painters in the world what will we move onto next?)  
  
And, we leave thinking we'll make it up to him next week but like a rancid cigar, the weeks burns down to Sunday again. And, I sit in church, smug, Baptismal Covenants renewed. Born Again, yet again. With the Holy Sacrament burning a hole in my stomach. And I realize... Shit. I crucified Christ again this week.    
And we have to face Monday. With my eyes holding back a river and my pants freshly cleaned and pressed.  
I face so many horrid Mondays. When will I become greater than the very little that I am now? Why do I keep comparing myself to others? WHY MUST I REPEAT ALL OF MY MISTAKES!? I have to wonder if you ask yourself parallel questions.

What good are you or I doing if we only serve our selfish desires and pull others down with us?

1jmvpqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepeater/comments/1jmvpqb/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743280875.0,sleepeater,1,1.0,False

Some jobs are mundane, tedious, meant to pass the time until something better comes along. But others—others exist in the spaces between, where the rules of reality bend and break. This is the story of Solomon Vance and the job he should have never accepted.""

Solomon Vance had nothing left.

His savings were gone, his eviction notice was taped to the door, and the job market had chewed him up and spat him out. He had sent out dozens of applications, walked into businesses with a forced smile, and shook hands with managers who never called back.

That night, as he sat outside a 24-hour diner nursing a cup of coffee he could barely afford, he felt the weight of his own failure pressing down on him.

And then he saw him.

A man standing beneath the buzzing streetlight. Tall. Dressed in a pristine black suit. A wide-brimmed hat casting his face in shadow. But it wasn’t his attire that unsettled Solomon. It was the way the man's hands were positioned—backwards, twisted at the wrists as if reality had made a mistake in shaping him.

Solomon blinked. The man was closer now.

No footsteps. No sound.

The man extended a black card, its golden lettering catching the dim glow of the streetlight.

Solomon hesitated but took it. The card was cold.

There were only a few words.

""Graveyard Attendant – 146 Blackwood Road.""

No interview. No contact info. Just an address.

When Solomon looked up, the man was gone.

He should have walked away.

He should have torn the card in half.

Instead, he went to 146 Blackwood Road.

The graveyard was too large for the town. It stretched on for what felt like miles, headstones jutting out of the mist like broken teeth. The office was a small shack near the front gate, with a single yellow light glowing dimly in the window.

Inside, a key and a notebook sat on the desk. No one was there to greet him.

The notebook had only three rules:

1. Lock the gate at midnight.

2. Do not answer if someone knocks on the office door.

3. If you see an open grave, do not look inside.

That was it.

Solomon laughed under his breath. “Weird, but whatever.”

The job was simple—walk the grounds, check the perimeter, and stay in the office until sunrise.

For the first hour, nothing happened.

By the second hour, he heard shuffling footsteps beyond the graves.

By the third, something knocked on the office door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Solomon stiffened.

The knock wasn’t urgent. It was slow. Rhythmic. Expectant.

He checked the time. 3:13 AM.

Do not answer if someone knocks on the office door.

His breath caught in his throat.

The knocking continued.

Then, a voice. Too familiar. Too wrong.

""Sol… Let me in, man.""

His stomach twisted.

It was his brother’s voice.

But that was impossible. His brother had died three years ago.

""Come on,"" the voice insisted, still calm, still patient. ""Just open the door.""

Solomon clenched his fists. He didn’t move.

Minutes stretched into eternity.

And then—the knocking stopped.

Soft footsteps shuffled away.

Solomon didn’t sleep.

At dawn, he grabbed the notebook and scribbled four words beneath the rules.

""DO NOT SPEAK TO THEM.""

He left the graveyard, the black card still in his pocket.

And when he got home, he tried to throw it away.

But the next night, when he checked his jacket, the card was still there.

Waiting.

The job wasn’t over.

It would never be over.

""I am The Witness, and I remember Solomon Vance. He was given a job no one else would take. A job that will follow him for the rest of his days. Because some jobs don’t let you quit.

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743280280.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

We get along really well, I like her son, she seems to like my kids (more on this below) and we live together. 

The issue I'm running in to is there seems to be less and less equality in our relationship as time goes on. When she first moved in, about 7 months ago, we agreed she would pay a share of the rent and utilities proportional to her income. This saved her well over a thousand dollars a month,  as a I pay 80+% of the bills. Additionally, she would bring home some groceries and such every so often, but I still paid the lion's share. We also merged our phone plans. She received almost all the savings, but with the understanding she still needed to pay her, now reduced, bill. I had to remind her several times to pay Feb's rent, which came in early March. She still hasn't paid March. I'm confident won't pay at all unless I hassle her about it, which almost isn't worth the trouble  She's also two months behind on her phone bill. I could fairly easily pay everything; but it's not about the money, it's about the principle of her having ""skin in the game.""

Additionally, I wake up every morning and make all our kids' breakfast and pack their lunches. I brew the coffee and usually bring her a cup. She will come out of our room when it's all done and grab her son's lunch box, fill it with his lunch and leave my two kids' lunchboxes just sitting there, for me to go retrieve. The thing that set this off the other day was that I woke up with a bit of an upset stomach and couldn't finish making lunch, but had to run to the bathroom. I came out and she had made her son lunch, but didn't bother making any for my kids. I had the time and I took care of it, but the effect had stayed with me for days. I just can't seem to get over it. Since then, all manner of little things in which she will care for her son, but my kids are my problem, seem to be popping in to my head. 

For reference, I'm her son's only father figure and I try VERY hard to act like it. I treat him like my own, enrolling him in sports classes, making sure he gets there, paying for them etc. 

Another straw was that her car broke down a few weeks ago. I have two cars, one luxury SUV and a small economy gas saver. I drive apx 5000 miles a month, so gas is a big expense. While I fixed her car, I let her drive my efficient car. But now her car is all repaired and she's fallen in love with the gas bill, and the thought of giving me my car back is not even discussed. 

All these things are small in themselves, however I can't help but feel taken advantage of... Is this just the way relationships are?  How is the best way to address this without feeling like I'm forcing her to treat me with equity?

1jmvdi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScaryStory/comments/1jmvdi3/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743279939.0,ScaryStory,0,1.0,False

1jmv9fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1jmv9fu/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743279623.0,scaryshortstories,1,1.0,False

It’s about a story I’ve been working on—a tale that feels less like fiction every time I think about it. It’s called ""The Book Without a Name,"" and it starts with a guy named Gustavo stumbling across something he never should’ve touched.

  
Picture this: a dusty old bookstore, shelves packed with forgotten books, the air thick with the smell of mold and ancient paper. Gustavo finds this one book—cracked leather cover, no title, no author, just time clinging to its edges. Something about it pulls him in, even though every instinct screams to leave it alone. He opens it, and there’s a faded warning scratched on the first page: ""Don’t read aloud."" Of course, he does. And that’s when it starts.

  
Whispers follow him—verses from the book echoing in the subway, in his dreams, in the silence of his apartment. The words twist his reality: reflections that don’t match his face, coffee stains forming cryptic lines, walls whispering back. By the end, he’s scratching those verses into his walls with blood, his eyes hollowed out like something sucked the life from them. And the worst part? The book’s gone. Vanished. Waiting for someone else.

I’ve turned this into a full video, narrated by me, and it’s dropping on my new YouTube channel on April 1st. No fooling—this is the real deal. If you’re into stories that crawl under your skin and stay there, I’d love for you to check it out. I’ll be posting as ""Cronista do Oculto"" (or ""Occult Chronicler"" in English), and this is just the beginning.

1jmv8gh,https://i.redd.it/syh1lmd4tore1.jpeg,Paranormal Perfumes Review!!,"Hello all!

I got my package in front Paranormal Perfumes (Etsy) the other day and wanted to review them here!

First and foremost, I do want to mention that the shipping gave me some trouble. USPS lost the first package and seemed to take a bit longer to deliver the replacement package. The seller isn't at fault here, but the reviews also warned of long TATs, so it wasn't just my order. That being said, the perfumes were still pretty good and well worth the wait! The packaging was also super thoughtful and really complimented the overall vibe of the shop!!!

Another note: These smell so unbelievably different on skin than they do in the bottle. Straight out of the bottle, they were fine. On skin, they absolutely transformed into strong, unique, beautiful scents! 

Whimsigoth (A witchy, boho blend of patchouli, clove, cardamom, star anise, cinnamon & nutmeg. Earthy notes of fennel, cedar, geranium, and sandalwood. A bright, magickal touch of sweet orange, violets, and resins.) - Do y'all know about those store-bought cinnamon/spiced pinecones that are sold around Christmas? That's exactly what this perfume smells like. So spicy, so Christmasy, and so nostalgic! 

Necromantia (Damp earth misted with fog. Fresh, overturned dirt. Burning frankincense and myrrh. Dark patchouli.) - This smells like those bags of decorative natural moss. I can't say it really get the smoke, frankincense, or myrrh, but still pretty true to its name regardless. Just like wet moss and dirt!

Midnight in the Graveyard (Cool rain and fog. Damp dirt and mossy headstones. White funeral lilies. Dark patchouli.) - This one is very very very similar to the last. Still very mossy and earthy. This one has more of an airy, rainy smell to it, but I don't get the floral notes at all. Very atmospheric though!

A lullaby for the dark (A black oak tree in the night. An abandoned campfire with wisps of embers and smoke. Gooey marshmallows and toasted vanilla spice. Black patchouli & black amber.) - While I can't say this really smells like a realistic campfire, it's definitely warm and woody. It reminds me more-so of sitting next to a fireplace in a warm cabin. Still a nice, somewhat masculine, cozy scent!

Forgotten memoirs (A cold cup of black coffee with a dash of whiskey. A smoke out on the balcony. Dark cocoa and a drizzle of maple. Vanilla and spicy clove.) - This is straight up coffee!! Like a coffee shop or really good coffee candle! Very realistic and comforting!

Mothman (A bushel of pimento berries. Cooked pistachios drizzled in caramel and sprinkled with cinnamon, clove, and saffron. Earthy shaved carrot & vanilla bean. A small bouquet of roses and orchids. Sandalwood trees.) - Full circle back into Christmas vibes with this one. This smells like bright red Christmas berries and nostalgic, dusty Christmas decorations being pulled out of an attic. It doesn't smell dirty though, it smells like experiencing Christmas as a child! I love it!!

I do reccomend this shop if you want something nostalgic as more than one of these samples gave me that vibe. The spicy scents are especially incredible!!",14,1743279547.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False
1jmv8eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Money/comments/1jmv8eq/some_advice_related_to_money_and_a_little_tip_to/,Some advice related to money and a little tip to earn more,"Just like someone wanting to lose weight needs to know their starting weight, you need to understand your financial starting point to improve. A good way to do this is by analyzing each of your expenses to determine their necessity. You have to understand their priority: high, medium, and low. Here is an example:

**High:** Utilities like electricity

**Medium:** Entertainment like Netflix

**Low:** Non-essentials like daily Starbucks

Alright, now that you get this, the very first thing, and I mean *the very first* thing you should be thinking about, is getting rid of all that debt. Seriously, clear it out. Now, there are a couple of ways to tackle this, and it really depends on your personality. You could try the ""snowball strategy,"" which, honestly, works well. You start with the smallest debt, knock it out, then move on to the next smallest, and so on. It's great because you get these little wins along the way, and that keeps you motivated.

And, hey, while we're on the subject of debt, you have to understand that not all debt is created equal. There's ""good debt,"" like, maybe a mortgage for a house, *in certain situations*. And then there's ""bad debt,"" like borrowing money for a car, which, let's be real, is a liability most of the time. The key is to only buy things you can actually afford.

Now, let's talk about building a safety net, an emergency fund. Think of it as your financial cushion, the thing that keeps you from falling flat on your face when life throws a curveball. We're talking about aiming for three to six months of your living expenses somewhere safe. It's your peace of mind, it lets you take those calculated risks without constantly worrying about the bottom falling out.

And let's be real, emergencies happen. The car breaks down, the fridge dies, or, you know, life just decides to throw a wrench in your plans. Without that fund, you're looking at potentially having to resort to those awful predatory loans with sky-high interest rates, and nobody wants that. Plus, when something unexpected happens, having that money set aside gives you the mental clarity to actually make good decisions. You're not scrambling, you're not panicked. You have the breathing room to, say, find a new job that's actually a good fit, instead of just grabbing the first thing that comes along. And, maybe most importantly, it stops you from having to pull out your long-term investments at the worst possible time, when the market's down, and you end up losing money. You're protecting your future self.

You've finally tackled those debts, you've got that emergency fund sitting pretty, and now it's time to really get organized. We're talking about building a solid monthly budget, something that actually works for *y*our needs, your bills, and all that stuff.

Okay, so, let's talk about getting your finances in order, because, honestly, it can be a real headache. You've got to build yourself an emergency fund. You want to have at least three months' worth of your basic living expenses tucked away, and it needs to be liquid, meaning you can get to it quickly. So, sit down and figure out what you absolutely need each month – rent, food, utilities, the bare necessities. Then, take that number and multiply it by three. That's your target. You want that amount sitting in a savings account, something you can access easily if, say, your car breaks down or you lose your job.

Now, while you're building that safety net, you really need to focus on getting a solid, reliable income. I know it's tempting to chase every little side hustle, but having one stable income stream is key. It just makes everything else so much easier to manage. You know, paying the bills, saving, all of it. And look, I get it, sometimes you need a little something extra to get by. Personally, I've found that taking online surveys can be helpful for that. I've been using [this website](https://heycash.com/register?ref=9d86a34a-cfa2-4862-a9e6-ce96aa283b6f) for about three months now, and it's actually made a difference. It's not going to make you rich, obviously, but it can definitely help with those little daily expenses, the things that can really add up. So, yeah, focus on that main income, but don't be afraid to explore small, manageable ways to supplement it.

And it's not just about you, either. I've found that using money to help others, even in small ways, can be incredibly rewarding. It could be donating to a cause you care about, or even just treating a friend to coffee when they're having a rough day. It just feels good to know you're making a difference, even a little one.

Basically, it's about being intentional. Don't just spend money because you can. Spend it because you want to, because it aligns with your passions, your goals, and your values. It's a tool, yeah, but it's a tool for building a life you actually love living. And that, in my opinion, is the best way to use it.",17,1743279543.0,Money,1,0.94,False

1jmv53i,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1jmv53i/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743279291.0,RedditHorrorStories,1,1.0,False

I recently moved to SF and have been trying every recommended coffee spot in the city. I have found that compared to the east coast, most coffee shops don’t have flavors haha and I love vanilla iced lattes. So far the best vanilla iced latte I have found is at farleys. Does anyone have any additional recommendations? 

My least favorite coffee so far, and I know this is a hot take but just my opinion (this is probably controversial and I’m sorry) has been coffee movement & Andytown (Fidi) and I know people love those spots, they’re just not for me. 


Any and all reccs for my fellow sweet tooth coffee lovers is appreciated!

I’m getting married soon and I’m planning a special start to our party, after chatting a bit with all guest. I’d love to kick things off with a custom mix of two songs:
	•	Start with “Valerie” (Steve Winwood original)
	•	Then transition into “Call on Me” by Eric Prydz

The idea is to start with that soulful, feel-good energy, and then seamlessly ramp things up into the dance vibe of “Call on Me” — sort of like an audio “gear shift” to let everyone know the party is on.

I’m not a DJ myself, and I won’t be mixing live — I’m just looking for a high-quality MP3 file I can play on the night.

If anyone’s down to help or point me in the right direction, I’d be incredibly grateful. Happy to shout you out at the wedding, send a virtual coffee, or whatever feels fair.

Thanks so much in advance!

1jmv1xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_story/comments/1jmv1xq/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’

Do you want a cup that pours more on to the counter than what you’re actually trying to pour into? Do you want a cup that chips and breaks easily? 

If you answered yes to all those questions, then buy a coffee mug. 

Recently I’ve been using a keurig and have different sizes of coffee mugs, so I’ll measure out the water inside the mug before putting it in the machine (to make sure I don’t make too much or too little) and every time I try to pour it in the water tank I get more on the counter than in the keurig. 

“Pour fast and steep” nope, the coffee mug will still make a mess

“Use a different cup” like what, a measuring glass? How does that help me portion according to the size of my mug? Why would I want to drink HOT coffee from a different type of cup (glass) with no handle? 

I suppose I could switch to paper cups (like they use at coffee shops) but to me it seems like a waste. The main appeal of a coffee mug is the little design or whatever on the side. They’re somewhat of a collector’s item because of it. 

They’re just all around inconvenient and I can’t for the life of me understand why no one has come up with something better. 

How did this abomination of a cup get so popular? They suck!

Edit: now I’m starting to remember why I left this sub. 

Me: *has an unpopular opinion on a common household item*

This sub: “You have Parkinson’s! You have an overbite! Skill issue!”
