Usually this model is made by Cassina, but this one doesn’t have any branding on it. The seller told me that it was his father‘s. It should be dated around the 70s or 80s. 
I really don’t know if the no brand is a good thing or not. Could be an original or from back in the days or just a copy.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1750716639.0,VintageFurniture,0,1.0,False

1litwdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1litwdm/what_do_i_do_at_this_point/,What do I do at this point?,"This guy at my gym kept staring at me, trying to engage with me in subtle ways for many months. I fancied him too, but he seemed like an introvert, so months later, after seeing him constantly orbiting around me I decided to give me my number on a piece of paper with an open invitation ""if he ever felt like grabbing a coffee"" and he messaged me within 10 mins and admitted finding me attractive all along but scared of rejection. We had a cute, awkward date. However, on our second date, he started acting cold towards me and told me he had broken up 3 months ago and wasn't looking for anything serious. I was a little taken aback because he kept orbiting around me, trying to interact with me, even saying that he thought I wasn't interested at a different point (when he had a gf). Anyway, I wasn't enjoying our date and after a while felt like going home, which I think he picked up on and completely flipped from being cold and distant to being very engaging and tried to impress me hard. I don't remember someone trying this hard to impress me, and we ended up spending the whole day together, and things started to look up in the second half of our date. I ignored his earlier behaviour because he started being sweet.

At the end of the night, we were back at his place, and he got sick, like puking in the bathroom etc, I didn't know what to do because he looked embarrassed, so I went home and told him to rest up. I checked up on him a couple of days later, and he said he was ""mortified"" by the ending of the date.

I tried to keep it light-hearted, but he stopped texting me and stopped showing up at the gym as well. After a couple of days, I messaged him saying I hope he was fine and he doesn't need to be embarrassed at all, and it was a good date. He ghosted me, didn't say anything, didn't come to the gym. Nothing.

He kept watching my stories which pissed me off so I removed him and just decided to move on with my life. I even thought he left the gym, but ironically, after two months, my friend told me she saw him at the gym, and he kept looking over at her and seemed kind of nervous. He is aware she is my friend and has seen us together many times, so I assume that he was nervous I was going to come in anytime.

I dont know how I feel, mad, pissed, heart-broken, blaming myself for choosing someone so emotionally immature? This was the first time I gave my number to someone with a cute note, ready to be rejected if I had to be, in the hopes that nothing could be worse than a rejection, but getting ghosted feels like a stab in my stomach, and the fact that he kept nervously looking over at my friend after enough time has passed by makes me feel weird and mad.

Like being done and owning it, was he going to run if I bumped into him? lol I don't know what I did to be treated like this. :(",1,1750716232.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

(Arcane Exfil Chapter 35),"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gs72m9/why_isekai_high_schoolers_as_heroes_when_you_can/)

\-- --

**Blurb:**

When a fantasy kingdom needs heroes, they skip the high schoolers and summon hardened Delta Force operators.

Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.

**Arcane Exfil Chapter 35**: Interview (2)

\-- --

“Have you aught need of me before I depart?” Lisara asked, wiping her hands on a small towel.

“I think we’ve seen everything we need,” Cole said. “Thank you for coming in. We’ll be in touch through the registry soon.”

He escorted her to the door, opening it to find a college-aged guy already waiting outside. The young man stepped aside respectfully to let Lisara exit before offering a polite nod.

Looking at the guy, it really seemed like his file fudged the age; the kid barely looked old enough to buy his own liquor, let alone run caravans. But the eyes… they weren’t some sophomore’s anxious stare. No, the gaze was centered, holding Cole’s own like he’d faced down bigger problems than an interview and had learned to keep his nerve. 

His coat was dark wool, well-kept but not new, worn over practical canvas trousers. His outfit ended in boots that looked like they’d seen more road than polish, but were cared for. Solid gear, chosen for use, not show.

All in all, the kid carried himself like he belonged there – not like he was asking permission or trying to impress or placate. Maybe the file hadn’t entirely bullshitted about the ‘delivery network’ part after all. Competence was competence, no matter the package. Cole could work with that.

“Darin Lars?” Cole extended his hand after Lisara left.

“Sir Cole.” Darin shook with a firm grip. “It is an honor.”

“Come on in. We just finished testing our cook candidate.” Cole led him back to where the others waited, making quick introductions.

“Sit yourself down,” Miles said, kicking a chair out with his boot. “Our cook just made somethin’ you ain’t never tried before.” He nodded toward the plate of burgers. “Might have a notion for you to consider.”

Darin glanced at the food items, curiosity winning out. “Beg your pardon, sir?”

“They’re called burgers,” Cole said. “Don’t exist in this world, as far as we know. They’re from ours. Try one.”

The kid picked one up, lifting the top bun to peer at what was inside before carefully setting it back down. “Hmm… simple, and not entirely foreign. Interesting.”

Darin took a bite, already smiling as soon as the flavors set in. He didn’t hesitate for the second bite. “The spicing is familiar, but the sauce is rather unique. Goennate, isn’t it?”

“If you’re talking about that reddish fruit, then yeah. Plus sugar, vinegar, and some other stuff,” Mack confirmed. “Simple ingredients, but it’s all the chef’s magic.”

Darin nodded. “This meal’s clever, it is – convenient, no plate nor knife nor even a table needed. You could eat it walking, or at a stall. And it’s rather good.” He looked up, smirking like he’d just figured it all out. “There’s certainly coin in it, done right.”

It’d be far-fetched to expect the kid to arrive at fast-food off of a single taste, but if he managed to get there, then all the better. “And why do you think so?” Cole asked.

“Comes down to two things, most times: ease and flavor. If a meal’s quick to hand *and* good on the tongue, folk’ll line up twice ‘fore dinner bell. What you showed has both.”

Cole glanced over at Mack and the others. The kid more than met expectations, based on their suppressed smiles. But just how far would he exceed them?

“Depends on where you sell them, though. Ease and flavor are just half the battle,” Mack pressed.

“We might set a stall near the Commerce Association. That district’s tight-wound – clerks and officials with no time to sit, scarcely time to breathe. Come midday, they queue at taverns or else make do with a cold and meager pie off the street.” He raised what was left of the burger. “This’d turn the trade on its head. Folk in haste would pay for such a fix, and glad of it.”

“Vendors usually have their pies pre-made,” Ethan mentioned. “A cold burger won’t do that much better.”

Darin squinted at his burger for a few seconds. “Aye, it won’t do cold. Folk’ll stomach a pie chilled, for they know the taste. This needs heat, or it turns heavy in the mouth.”

The toaster in the corner drew his attention. “But maybe there’s a fix – keep the meat hot in a sort of contraption, wrap the rest separate, put it together as they order. And you don’t need a seat to eat it, though you could have a few, if there’s room. Point is, you’re not waiting on plates, not waiting on lads with trays. Just a counter, quick hands, folk fed in minutes. That’s the trick.”

If Cole hadn’t known better, he’d have thought the kid used to work at McDonald’s – maybe not the register, but somewhere in corporate, buried in logistics. He didn’t, obviously. McDonald’s didn’t exist here, and Darin didn’t even know what a burger was ten minutes ago. But somehow, he still landed on the shape of it.

Cole had never worked fast food in his life, didn’t know how the backend ran, but even he could tell that Darin had clocked the core of it. He was probably missing pieces – stuff Cole wouldn’t recognize anyway – but still, for someone with no frame of reference, getting that close was pretty damn impressive.

Miles caught it as well. “Well, I’ll be damned.”

The kid glanced down at the compliment. Nothing in his reaction suggested he was surprised by it, but he seemed to appreciate it all the same. “Naught clever about it,” Darin murmured, half-smiling as he gestured with the remnants of his burger. “Merchants have done much the same for years. Know your buyers, suit the goods to their needs – that’s all.”

Cole was already starting to like the guy. Competence without the ego to match? Now *that* was a rare combination.

“Still,” Mack leaned forward, “shows good instinct. So you’re with the Commerce Association. What exactly do you do day-to-day?”

""Officially, I carry urgent items – contracts, sealed letters, rare wares. Less official? I smooth matters when the usual paths falter.""

‘Smooth matters,’ huh? Interesting that someone who operated in the gray areas was officially on the Commerce Association’s payroll and in the OTAC registry. Either the system here was more flexible than it seemed, or Darin had connections that let him work both sides. Worth keeping in mind.

“And how’s that gonna help us, specifically?” Cole asked.

Darin didn’t rush to answer. He took another bite of the burger first instead of spouting the immediate bullshit that an amateur might fall back on.

He looked up, meeting Cole’s eyes. “Well, truth told, I’ve not worked with high nobility before, much less Heroes. But I’d wager you’ve wants our market has no name for. That’s where I might help – my ties run deep, and wide besides.”

“What services,” Elina put him on the spot, “would you imagine our household might require that others would not?”

Darin inclined his head towards her, showing more reverence than he’d shown Miles. “Lady Elina, I’d not claim to know the fine points. But I’ve seen things done by other means, when doors stay shut. Folk see the wares, never the workings. And Heroes, I reckon, deal in needs our ledgers have scarcely beheld.”

“Fair enough,” Cole said, rubbing his chin. How would he test him? A single glance at Miles gave him an idea. “Now, back home, we had this drink called coffee. Dark, bitter, keeps you awake and focused. Some teas can do that, but this is made from a certain type of bean and does the job a hell of a lot better. Anything like that here?”

“Coffee? Not by that name, no. There’s kaff beans down south – bitter, taken hot, said to sharpen the mind. Rare here, though. If it’s a manner of stimulant, then aye, it might be the one. The Botanical Exchange keeps samples; I could fetch a few for you to try.”

Mack nodded. “Yeah, you can do that. But uh… the registry shows you’ve been with the Association for a few years now. How’d you land in the pool for a household logistics role? Seems like quite a different skillset to me.”

Darin didn’t seem fazed by the question. “Truthfully, it’s an arrangement. I’ll still see to your needs, proper and full, but the Association’s keen to know what sorts of things Heroes seek that our markets scarce provide. They’re quite aware of the coin to be made from the contrivances Heroes bring across – like that ‘Japanese’ Hero in the Aurelian Empire.”

Cole had to respect the honesty, even if it took a direct question to get there. Better than fake deference – and his team felt the same way. 

Mack gave a decisive nod, which Elina and Ethan both mirrored. Miles offered a shrug – ‘Looks okay to me.’

“Think we’ve covered what we need to,” Cole announced, pushing his chair back. “Any other questions before we wrap up?” 

Silence was his cue to stand. “Alright, then.” He shook Darin’s hand and walked him to the front door. “We’ll be in touch soon. Appreciate your time today.”

“The honor was mine, Sir Cole,” Darin replied.

When Cole opened the front door, it revealed their final applicant: a man with serious NCO vibes – Melnar Hartwell. His profile *had* mentioned prior service as an officer serving directly under General Galahad, but Cole knew there was more than met the eye. 

The authority rolling off the man wasn’t that of a kid doing his eight years before enjoying a free ride; Melnar had seen shit. And all of a sudden, he became a gardener? The official transition felt like skipping chapters, maybe the most critical ones. People with that kind of intensity didn’t suddenly switch to pruning bushes without a damn good reason – or someone’s thumb on the scale.

“Mr. Hartwell,” Cole said, extending his hand.

“Sir Cole.”

Melnar’s handshake was firm and calloused – the permanent kind only obtained from daily work with tools, and not the weekend warrior blisters from some suburban dude’s Home Depot project. Personal history mystery aside, this was a guy who did damn good work.

“Thanks for coming in,” Cole said, bringing him to the room. 

Based on both Melnar’s profile and his current demeanor, the guy seemed like he appreciated practicality and straightforwardness over setup and foreplay. So right after introductions, Cole got straight to the point. “Mr. Hartwell, I’ll be frank. You don’t seem like a gardener type. Says on your profile that you used to be an officer – high-level combat mage at that. What changed?”

Melnar didn’t flinch; he must’ve expected that they’d cover the gap in his resume. “A campaign in Ossern Forest, Sir Cole. Year 585.” His posture remained fixed – straight, but not rigid. “I commanded a task force against an Archdemon. Overexertion of my mana gland precluded my continued service.”

“Against an Archdemon?” Mack whistled. “Shit, coulda been worse, I guess.”

“Indeed so, Sir Mack. I’d have struck it down myself, but I held my casting for Father Lorcan. A priest’s magic leaves nothing behind.” Melnar raised his head. “It was a necessary sacrifice.”

“And then General Galahad arranged your position as a groundskeeper after that?” Ethan asked.

The man simply nodded in response.

Oddly enough, the file mentioned none of this, though Cole could guess why. A mage powerful enough to contain a Level 19 archdemon must be level 19 himself, give or take. The Kingdom must’ve buried it to hide the fact that they’d permanently lost such a powerful asset.

“The matter is sealed in the official record,” Melnar said, probably catching something in Cole’s expression. “Your standing as Heroes grants leave to speak of it – in private counsel.”

That explained the gap between the bland service record and the man standing before them. But what about the gift?

“Why this position specifically?” Cole asked. “I imagine General Galahad could’ve placed you anywhere for your uh… ‘retirement.’ I’m sure there’s at least one tropical paradise among the colonies.”

Melnar gave the barest hint of a smirk. “Palms and sand hold little appeal, Sir Cole. Too much… leisure.” He pronounced the word as if it were a mild disease. “The General understands that men of action wither in idleness. Better to have a blade in hand – though it be for hedges.”

Cole glanced at Miles. Seemed like the two were already on the path of becoming best friends.

“As it happens,” Melnar continued, “my background affords uses beyond tending hedges. Your prominence invites scrutiny from various quarters – some benign, others less so. Should counsel be wanted, I stand ready to give it.”

“You mean the General’s keeping an eye on us,” Ethan stated.

“Yes, though not for ill cause. A gardener sees much – and is himself seldom seen. And while I prefer solitude, my experience remains available at your behest.”

Not bad on the General’s part. This wasn’t some retirement sinecure but a deliberate placement – one that was, as far as Cole could tell, mutually beneficial. The question was whether this arrangement primarily served their interests or Galahad’s.

“And if our interests and the General’s diverge?” Cole asked directly.

“My duty is to God and Country first, as all our duties ought. But I serve the hand that hires me – in good faith, and in full. The garden I tend is the garden I protect.”

Cole had known enough soldiers to recognize when someone operated from genuine principle rather than expedience. Melnar struck him as the former – a man whose personal honor wasn’t situational, an honest guy who lived by a code.

Elina had still yet to speak, but perhaps she didn’t need to. She gave a nod, approved by the others.

“Well, Mr. Hartwell,” Cole said, rising to his feet, “I think we’ve covered what we needed to. We’ll be in touch through the registry.”

Cole showed Melnar out. By the time he made it back to the drawing room, the rest of the team had already launched into their assessment. They’d all seen the same interviews, drawn the same conclusions.

The unanimous decision to hire all four was as easy as expected – the candidates were just that strong to begin with, and only needed a final confirmation to seal the deal. The process wasn’t as exciting as the prospect of teaching Fotham how to cast plasmaballs, but it was about as important. They’d just finished their next step in helping their new home actually feel like a home.

[$500],"I'm planning some overdue updates to my coffee bar at home and am considering a new grinder while I'm at it. Right now I have a broken Rancilio Silvia and an Aeropress but I'm going to add a dedicated pourover machine - probably the Fellow Aiden - and put the Aeropress away. Then I'll either repair the Silvia or replace it with something else - possibly the Fellow Espresso Series 1.

My current grinder is a Rancilio Rocky that's a little beat up but generally works well and I'm happy with it. The main things I dislike about it are its high retention (solved-ish with a bellows) and the placement of its power and grind switch that make it annoying to fit into a tight space on my bar. I have \~36"" total space edge to edge.

So I'm wondering if I should explore new grinders. I'm very much not picky about performance for pourover, I'm really only picky about performance in espresso. My only other requirement is that it be low-retention and designed for single doses (and of course reasonably attractive and compact). However, most of the single-dose espresso grinders I can find are either described as having really bad results for other uses or have a capacity of 30-50g which is too small for a full pot of coffee.

I was attracted to the Fellow Opus - and can essentially get it almost 50% off if bundled with the Aiden - but long-term reviews on Reddit are pretty poor overall. Otherwise maybe the Encore ESP (I used to own an Encore and liked it, but I swapped it for the Rocky for espresso) or the Sette? The Lagom Casa seems perfect except that it can't fit 100g of beans at a time.

Is there a grinder that makes sense for both uses and would be an obvious upgrade over the rocky I already have?",1,1750715964.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

What would you recommend I could do with this? I could rip the tiles off an re-plaster it? A colleague suggested I simply plaster over the top of the tiles, but I'm unsure that would work? I also considered some vertical white wood panelling to match the ceiling.

Would appreciate any and all advice!",1,1750715958.0,DIYUK,2,1.0,False

1litpid,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1litpid/did_you_have_complicated_feelings_around_changing/,Did you have complicated feelings around changing your name? How did you work through them?,"I am curious if trans people ever get ""cold feet"" about their name change, or otherwise feel weird about it, have trouble deciding, or having trouble getting used to it. What are the different ways of thinking about this problem and working through these feelings?

Why I'm asking: It's not because I'm trans. I am considering de-anglicizing my name. My ancestors were colonized and they made our language illegal, and now it is endangered. I have been learning the language for a couple of years, now, and many speakers use their de-anglicized name to reclaim something that was stolen from us. 

The thing is, I have been avoiding committing to a decision on the change. I can't tell if it is just ""cold feet"" or if it's because I am not *used* to it. I have been in communities where trans friends ""trial run"" new names and pronouns, but there are not really environments where I can do that. There are speaking groups, but I'm in the U.S., where it is a rare language, so opportunities are rare. I have tried using it at coffee shops, but it's not a very effective way to get used to being *called* by a name. Further complicating things is that it has a sound in it that is not used in American English. 😭

I came here because I can't find anyone to talk to about it so I can work through this problem. Trans name changes is the closest analogy I could think of, and it's been suggested by more than one person that I try asking trans people. I know it's not exactly the same. But if you think you have personal experiences that might inform how I approach this, I would love to hear them. And if you have any writings on the topic to share, I would love that as well. I'd especially like to hear about how this goes down professionally, as I work in a field where there's a lot of writing and publishing and your name is at the top of everything you write.

And as an aside, although my situation is different, I think I've gained a little empathy for just how scary this kind of change can be for trans people. And how awkward or annoying it can be socially. As I have started to learn the language, I've gotten a lot of pushback (internalized colonialism) from my family. ""Why don't you learn a more 'useful' language like Spanish or Mandarin?"" etc. I can't imagine what I'll have to deal with were I to ask them to call me by a different name. I don't plan to force anyone to use the new name, as it doesn't invalidate my identity the way it might if I were trans. But it has definitely occurred to me, what that might be like. I can imagine them saying ""Why don't you just stick with the name we gave you? Don't you love us?"" It bothers me that there are people in this world who think that that is what love means.",1,1750715760.0,asktransgender,0,1.0,False

Help me troubleshoot?,"Got my Mini R in March 2025 brand new, and a new Niche Zero. In the morning the second shot I pull using identical puck prep is always 10-20% faster than the first one. There is a small but noticeable difference in taste. Info below on equipment, workflow, etc. Can anyone help me think through why this might be the case and how to avoid it? When I got the machine, one of the selling points was consistency. I'm not sure if this variance is within the realm of what's considered ""consistent.""

There is a small but noticeable difference in taste with this variance. Not a big deal but when I pull a solo shot later in the day for my second cup I prefer it to the second shot first thing in the morning (first shot always goes to my wife, ha!).

Workflow and setup:

* Beans:
   * Using fresh-enough beans shipped from Joe roasters in NYC, the beans typically reach me within 7 days of roast and I freeze them in 200g portions. Beans out of the freezer are brought to room temp and stored in an Airscape container.
* Puck prep:
   * Grind with a Niche Zero, use Introvert bellows after grinding, invert La Marzocco bottomless portafilter with a Big Bang basket onto the catch cup, shake around a bit, flip over, use Normcore dosing ring after removing catch cup
   * Subminimal Flick for WDT
   * Tamp with a MHW-3Bomber self-leveling spring loaded tamper
* Shot
   * Pull 24g of coffee to a 1.75:1.0 ratio (preferred for these beans, so 24g in to 40g out) in somewhere between 25-30 seconds.
   * Portafilter heats up in the machine before the first shot, and I put it back in while prepping the second shot.

Almost every day, the first shot is somewhere between 27.5-29.5 seconds, and the second shot is usually 26-28 seconds. Is that still within the range of ""consistent,"" or does this point to something with my grinder/puck prep/machine being off? There is a small but noticeable difference in taste. Any thoughts on what could account for the difference/variance? Is this within a range you all would consider normal/acceptable? What might account for this consistent variance? It's never the other way around-- the first shot is never faster than the second. Curious what folks here might have to say!",1,1750715758.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

👏 To the team of lawyers who cleaned her out like a post-Thanksgiving fridge — may your briefcases stay heavy and your bills unpaid. You convinced her to pay for “packets” that would get people arrested. Omg. Genius! 

👏 To TikTok, working overtime like a cyber pest control team, banning each recycled account faster than she can say “live battle.” Every account gone is a child saved from the trauma of being asked to “throw roses” while she wails off-key. 

👏 To Jamestown, a town that looked at her antics and said, “Not in this zip code, sis.” A community united in rejecting chaos. Inspirational.


👏 To the guy she met last Friday night, who spotted her chaos from five feet away and read her like a Yelp review — zero stars, would not recommend.

👏 To Karma — no notes. You’re doing amazing, sweetie.

👏 To DoorDash for sacrificing a million spilled coffees when you delivered to her billion dollar duplex with no furniture. 

👏 To Clapper, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, FarmersOnly, Craigslist Missed Connections, and any other platform that took one look at her vibes and said, “We’re good.”

👏 To the accused of crimes by her — all 1,037 of you. Thank you for your patience, resilience, and restraining orders. 

👏 To her teachers, who may or may not have purposely misinformed her about the economy, civics, pronunciation, and how volume control works. Your long game? Genius.

👏 To her mom, whose pies I’m sure are delicious — but even more so, your quiet exit from the nonsense. You’ve earned peace and no more mid-live meltdowns.

👏 And of course, a special thank you to the black shorts — the real MVPs. They've clung to her body with the strength of a thousand industrial clamps, defying physics and decency. I’m convinced they could survive a nuclear bomb and a hurricane all at ones. If fabric could file for emotional distress, these shorts would already have a class-action lawsuit.

I thought I had checked everything and was about to give up but I kept hearing something click in the glove box. This guy keeps on clicking and i couldn’t find much online about it. I was wondering if the relay could click and still be bad and what is even is its purpose ?

The first licks of smoke from a campfire before it turns charred or bitter. A stick of cinnamon toasting in a pan. A spadeful of dirt overdue for rain, almost peppery in its minerality.  Underneath all of this, a layer akin to beeswax or unsweetened vanilla.  On me, it became a skin scent relatively quickly, but I couldn't get enough of it.  9/10 easily, or 10/10 on the off chance this is an EDT and they're able to increase the concentration.  If they release it, I'll be getting a bottle.  Really hoping this goes into production!

**Faun Forest (notes given are pomegranate, blackberry, fir)**: FRUIT! Wow, this opening is the first bite of a plum that's been sitting out for days and is about to spoil.  It's THAT realistic and juicy.  After a minute, the floral quality fades and a celery note emerges - at least, that's how my nose seems to be interpreting the combination of blackberry and fir.  (Anybody remember ants on a log?)  As the aromatics diminish, it becomes a dark compote - think pie filling, where you get those concentrated stewed berries.  There might be just a touch of musk under it all but the fruit dominates.  This has real projection, as I can smell it drifting up from my wrist while I'm typing over an hour after applying.  8/10 for that truly delightful opening but might be 6/10 if you're concerned about how strong this is for the people around you.

**Holy Cross (notes given are bluebell, watercress, lichen):** Chopped herbs, black pepper dust, tomato vine. Within the first minute, the medicinal mint-family smell fades into dried, crushed basil - or perhaps marjoram as there's nothing anise-like about it. To me, there's nothing floral about this, nor does it smell lush or damp. That's not a bad thing, just not what I expected from the notes. After about 10 minutes, it became a very clean close-wearing (but not skin) scent that reminded me of an Renfaire apothecary.  One that doesn't sell incense or candles - nothing smoky or waxy here.  8/10 for me, but your mileage might vary.  I think it's well-balanced and I applaud an herbal scent that isn't reliant on rosemary or thyme, but after the opening there's not much development, which could be either reliable or boring depending on your point of view.

**Lorien (notes given are pine, eucalyptus, moss):** Starts with super bright pine, the height of New England summer. A very juicy lemonade aspect (probably the eucalyptus, but it's lacking the sharpness I usually associate with that) which has no sourness or bitter pith, so that it borders on sweet. I don't know if this makes sense, but the vibe gives me Snoqualmie (another Pineward scent) in late summer; sunshine on dense pine boughs, no earthiness.  Within about 30 minutes, the moss note goes from an underlying hint to being dominant, though it goes through a ""fresh laundry"" phase while the citrusy aspect sticks around. 7/10 because although I really enjoyed the opening, I can't tolerate the sweet soapiness of the moss destination, but perhaps you can!

**Mournhold (notes given are coffee, leather, fir):** Immediate note of medium roast black coffee - no sour component but nothing nutty or sweet about it either. This cup has been brewed early in the morning when you're out camping and everything is still wet from last night's rain. There's an undertone of pine that gets stronger as you finish your cup and the coffee fades, until your leather jacket warms and you pull your tent stakes up from the mud. Nothing about this suggests that the cloud cover will break; about 15 minutes in, a very dark undertone arrives, making me think of water sitting in a lightless cave.  Even later, the overall effect morphed into something akin to oud. 6/10 in that I enjoy how it feels super-masculine without resorting to strong smoke, pepper, or leather, but I wish the coffee note persisted a little longer and it's not something I'd reach for on a regular basis.

**Northwild (notes are lavender, fir, moss):** The lavender is strong upfront but quickly gives way to something simultaneously sweet and animalistic (not barnyard, but musky). After that point, the lavender exists as a licorice-adjacent background note. It's almost like someone washed with lavender soap and then worked up a heavy sweat. At least on me, this was projecting like a beast, and I could still smell the musk aspect on my skin the following morning.  While I didn't find it offensive / I didn't scrub it, to me it wasn't very enjoyable either and didn't reflect what I expected from the notes. 4/10.

So, there you go.  I'm hoping to see notes from somebody out there who got the gourmand set!",1,1750714689.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1lit7y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lit7y8/is_this_too_petty/,"Is this too ""pet""ty?","When I (then F, 35) was in grad school, one of my roommates was from Turkey (M, 27ish); I'll call him Jon.  Our third roommate (""Maria"") was from Russia (F, 27ish), so culture clashes were inevitable.  I've lived overseas am bilingual, and grew up with brothers.

As a grad student, I wrote a lot.  This happened before students stopped learning cursive and before every student had a laptop.  I was very picky about my pens.  Call it a quirk or an odd pet peeve, but the pen had to feel a certain way in my hand and the ink needed to have a certain look on the page.  Neurotic, perhaps, but at least my favorite pens were cheap.  Not every store had them, but they were cheap.

Jon had somewhat limited English skills.  I had learned that if I tried to call him out for doing something wrong, he consistently called me ""crazy.""  So when someone started chewing on the ends of my pens, I knew I couldn't confront Jon directly, though Maria encouraged me to.

I've always loved animals.  I usually sought out housemates with pets to enjoy the perks without the commitment and expenses.  I knew about various puppy training products.  So I stopped at the nearby Petco and purchased a bottle of ""Footy,"" which, according to the bottle, was the ""foulest tasting stuff on earth.""  I picked up some fresh pens at the drug store next door, sprayed them copiously, spread them out on the coffee table, and waiting excitedly.

A few days later, I thought I saw a small tooth mark in one of them.  My pens were never chewed on again.

Yes, the Fooey cost more than many packages of pens, but I didn't care.  It was one of the few times I was able to change his behavior without uttering a word, and it was glorious.",4,1750714574.0,AITAH,1,0.83,False

I’m having an issue with my Breville Precision Brewer suddenly having huge craters in the grounds bed and making an awful cup.

I haven’t changed anything recently and it is all of a sudden making a terrible cup of coffee. I’m using a Baratza encore grinder at about the 19-20 grind setting.  Local tap water is extremely soft, so I’m using bottled spring water. 

I’m descaling the brewer now in case there was something clogging the showerhead nozzles.

Any advice on how to troubleshoot this? My next guess would be to use a finer grind setting. 

Thanks for any advice!

1lit2j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1lit2j7/who_the_heck_did_i_marry/,Who the heck did I marry?,"oh man, do I have one for you.. I've been holding back posting because we are still in the midst of the custody and divorce battle but I'm at the point where I'm ready to move on with my life and want to get it off my chest and out of my mind.. as much as I can anyways.

My husband, ""Toby"" and I met in 2018 when we were 27. We were only dating for a couple months when he moved in. He was great, so sweet, thoughtful, helpful, kind.. and I fell in love hard. We got engaged after only 7 months, we did the whole ""when you know you know"" justification.. anyways, hindsight is 20/20.

We got married near our one year together anniversary in 2019. It was only two months in when I got pregnant with our daughter ""Suzie"", we moved in with my parents to save money, and luckily we did as the world shut down when I was 6 months pregnant. I had to have a c section, this is important later. Due to that time in history, when I was on maternity leave, Toby was also off work, we spent the entire first year of Suzies life off together every day. When she was about six months old, we moved into the townhouse I am still in. 

The bickering started around then, little things would set him off and I started walking on eggshells. We would fight over money, personal time, division of housework, parenting, everything... I chalked it up to being around each other every day all day.
When I went back to work, I started a new job and excelled at it. I started making a lot more money and quickly became the breadwinner. I got him a job where I worked and he slacked off and changed jobs after 6 months (I hadn't noticed that he frequently changed jobs every 6 to 9 months until much later).
 
We were more like roommates at this point, miserable roommates who slept in the same bed. He frequently demanded alone time, I was happy to oblige because he was always so miserable to us, it gave my daughter and I time to be able to be ourselves. 

We, by a miracle because it was only once in 5 months, got pregnant with my son ""Frank"" in early 2022. During my pregnancy, I had a lot of issues, my body was not doing well with pregnancy, we fought constantly and the stress was so bad that I had to go on sick leave a month before my due date. It was to the point that I could barely sit, had a hard time standing, could hardly walk and laying down was agony - he was more helpful than before, but he would frequently guilt trip me and make me feel like I owed him and should worship him for doing everything for me.

I had my second c section at the beginning of 2023. 10 days after I had Frank, Toby was yelling at me (I have a recording), that I no longer have an excuse, I'm no longer pregnant, I need to get off my a$$ and contribute to the house, to clean, cook and do laundry. I started recording all of his tangents because he would gaslight me that he didn't say that, I didn't hear him right, I'm crazy.

Money was tight while I was on maternity leave, he had switched jobs and worked from home, constantly telling me I was lazy because I wouldn't do anything but take care of Frank and Suzie. My post partum depression was so bad, the intrusive thoughts were bad and intense and, looking back, he made it so much worse. I put Suzie in daycare so I could manage Frank easier. A year that was supposed to be magical and beautiful, it was miserable and I hated it. He was cruel and rude all of the time. I ended up going back to work 4 months early, hoping that making more money would lessen our fights because that must be whats causing our issues. I always justified his behavior. This is when it gets messed up.

Time line is important to this, so I'm going to do my best to keep the info organized here, it gets messy..
October 2023, I went back to work, we fought a lot and he avoided hanging out with us on the weekends, he had another new job at this point, working in a family arcade place, this is important. We happily avoided him on the weekends, it was more stressful if he was around anyways.

end of November 2023, I had ordered us a shed and checked the security cameras frequently to see when it arrived so I can run home and move it to the backyard to avoid it getting stolen. One day, I looked on the camera and Toby's car was home - weird because he left when I did and he dropped Suzie and Frank at daycare - I got the app notification confirming that. I called and texted him, no answers, I got worried. I got off work and got the kids, rushed home and he was making dinner - i asked him about being home, he told me he went to work and they said he deserved the day off.. it didn't sit right but arguing didn't feel necessary. That evening his brother, sil and their baby came to stay for the weekend. I couldn't shake the feeling he lied to me, the next morning I called my mom when I ran to get everyone coffee, she said to trust my gut and to check the cameras for time stamps and the other days.. well, I did.  he didn't go to work that entire week, the timing wasn't going to work and coming home, it was dropping the kids and coming straight home.. every single day that week.

I got back to the house with coffee and was fuming. I asked him to come outside and chat. I asked him, he lied, I called him out, he lied again and again..  finally he ended it with me being the reason, he needed some alone time and didn't tell me because I would react like this to him taking time off work. This time his gaslighting didn't work, trust was broken and it had to be repaired. His brother and family left that day, and the next day, my kids and I went out shopping with my mom, giving Toby some space. 

now its December 2023, On our way to her house, I realized I forgot something at home and so we stopped and I ran in. Toby wasn't downstairs but the baby gate was up, odd because I have the babies. I go upstairs, the top baby gate closed.. also odd.. then I noticed he rolled towels at the bottom of our bedroom door.. I was a teenager once, I know how to stop a certain smell from moving to other rooms. 
I opened the door and he was standing at the end of our bed wearing VR headset smoking w33d in our room - where we and our babies sleep - it isn't illegal here but I lost it, not because he was smoking it, but because he didn't do it outside and chose to breath it all over our babies beds. Much much after this happened, my friends point out what else he could be doing - my best guess is watching VR corn and the shock he had was because he thought that was what I would be mad about... anyways, back to the storyline.

I was mad, I left and told him as much. The kids and I went to my mom's for dinner, when I came home that evening, he had moved all of his stuff into his office and locked himself in. Turns out he created a whole room for himself, had a twin bed set up, went through the whole house and put everything he felt was his into the room and locked the door whether he was in there or not. After 2 days I asked him and he said our marriage was over.

Over the next month he would have violent and terrifying outbursts, he wouldn't help with the kids, he'd lock himself in the room, he'd take food and eat in there, there was no dishes left downstairs and a smell was coming from the room. I called his brother and he came from the island and convinced Toby he needed to take a vacation and go stay with them for a week - this was my idea to get him away from the kids and I, I had never been afraid but was now and needed him out. my mom and I got into the room and it was disgusting, we cleaned it up. while he was gone, his brother had him call me daily and he was sweet and kind and apologized and said he wanted to make our marriage work, I agreed he could come home.. it was all a lie, it was worse when he came home. I have audio recordings of him screaming and yelling and threatening the kids and I. I won't get into detail because most of it is a part of our court stuff now.. 

but skipping to Christmas eve, he went to work, I was sick of him locking himself into his room, I changed all of the locking door knobs to non locking ones because our daughter spent an hour crying outside his door while he ignored her, I had decided he wasn't a tenant anymore and he needed to contribute to parenting and everything else, or leave.

the kids and I went to my mom's for Christmas eve, when Toby got off work, I knew, because that's when the phone calls came. he screamed - screamed at me that I would regret removing his lock, that I dont deserve privacy, that he needs it and I need to stay out of his room - he said he went and got a lock and that I can do the whole magic of Christmas by myself and I'd be lucky if I ever saw him outside that room again. needless to say, I was choked. I went home and snuck out all the presents for the kids, got us clothes and what we needed and the kids and I spent the night at my parents house and did Christmas morning there. I had texted him informing him and said he could come if he didn't start a fight.. anyways, he ended up moving out December 28th and stayed with his brother for a few weeks while he looked for a place.

January through July 2024 I essentially forced him to spend time with our kids, I had gone to court without him (he didn't reply to being served, its a thing that because he didn't bother doing paperwork, he didn't get to go), I got a really good order from the judge which included a conduct order because I showed her texts and videos he sent meant for the kids badmouthing me.
now this is where it truly goes off the rails...

July 2024, we had been getting along quite well for a few weeks and he invited me to go with him and the kids to visit his family on the island, it didn't go great and we fought and, without going into detail, he broke the conduct order by calling me horrible things in front of our kids. I put in an application for enforcement for the conduct order and had him served. 

meanwhile, I had found my old tablet while cleaning up the house to turn Toby's old office into a room for Frank. I charged it up and turns on, Toby's Gmail was logged in. I got nosy and noticed there was current photos, I scrolled, and scrolled and what I found made me rage. 

There were photos, so many photos.. some of his junk (while we were married - you only really take those to send to people and he sure wasn't sending them to me), photos of him trying toys in his umm rear... photos of him in women's underwear.. so many photos.. but none of those sent me into my rage.. it was the photos of his SIL, while holding his brothers hand and her baby, of her rear end zoomed in and cropped in some photos, there were some of our daughters soccer coach, with Suzie cropped out thank God, there was our cleaner, my tattoo artist, some patrons of the arcade he worked at.. all of their rear ends and all from Jan 2023 (when I had our son) until current.. I documented it and moved on. 

I had a tattoo appointment with my friend, who was in the photos, later that week - I told her about them and we laughed, gross but whatever right? then her husband laughed and suggested he posted them on some ""public butt"" reddit forum and I should check the reddit on the tablet.

well folks, if you're still here, I apologize for the length and thank you for sticking it out, because it all honestly needs to get off my chest.. here's the thing..
I didn't see any of the photos I had found. instead, I found candid photos he took of my mother in her house while she was changing our then newborn daughter (dated 4 years ago) - of her face and cleavage. they had titles that still makes my body shake with rage. the worst of the six posts said ""I'd like to come all over these tots"" with certain words spelled differently for censor sake. 

I documented and deleted them but maaaan I was angry. I confronted him via text. his response? ""how did you find these, where did you get these, I feel so exposed"".. A few times since I found them, he tried to tell me they didn't exist, they do - I have them in a secure folder on my phone and my lawyer has them incase the divorce goes sideways. I never got an explanation about any of the photos and I likely never will. I'm sure he cheated on me but at this point, would it even matter? 

over the next few months we would continue our custody battle with me trying to organize and get things sorted and him ignoring me and weaponizing incompetence. I have filed for divorce, I currently have the kids 99% because ""his schedule doesn't work to have them"" and moving in with his girlfriend and changing jobs for the third time since we split has made it hard for him to give them time.

I plan on moving on with my life with the nicest guy I've ever met, who adores my kids and wants them around however much we can. 
court is imminent but I'm confident because Toby has made it clear where his priorities are. he doesn't pay child support still but there's a government program to enforce so I dont have to chase him, I dont really have to even deal with him at this point because the parenting time we have in writing doesn't work for him so he has to request taking them, which I would never prevent it, but he simply doesn't try to see them and I'm done forcing it. 

anyways.. thats my crazy story, which I don't think will ever have a conclusion, until the kids are old and moved out anyways..",2,1750714215.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

So, let me paint a picture for you. A few months back, I found myself in a never-ending cycle of exhaustion. I was tired of being tired! Sound familiar? 😩 It felt like I was lugging around a backpack full of bricks all day, and every time I thought about starting my retirement planning or picking up a new hobby, I just… couldn’t. 

But then, I stumbled across something that changed everything for me. It was like finding the secret door to Narnia, except, you know, *without* the talking animals. Just a clean energy booster! 🌟

Here’s what I discovered:

1. **Goodbye, caffeine crashes!** Seriously, no more mid-afternoon slumps where I’d attempt to convince myself that three cups of coffee was a “balanced breakfast.” 🙈

2. **Sustained energy levels:** It’s like someone sprinkled a bit of magic dust over me. I now feel awake and alert without feeling jittery or wired. Who knew clean energy boosters were the adult version of going to bed early and sleeping in?

3. **Focus mode activated:** I actually have the energy to dive into my retirement strategies and dream about my future adventures (hello, beach therapy!). 

4. **Mindfulness over madness:** Less stress means more clarity. I’m not just zipping around aimlessly anymore; I’m finding joy in each moment.

So, why am I sharing this? Because we all deserve to feel energized and present in our lives—especially as we’re gearing up for retirement! Plus, I came across a link that said, ""We believe in meaningful results."" How inspiring is that? And guess what? Here’s a little *boost* for you: [check this out](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb) (affiliate disclosure.) 

If this sounds familiar or you’re thinking about trying out a clean energy booster, chime in! What do you do for energy? Any tips for fellow tired folks who are ready to ditch the sluggishness and make the most of this one precious life? 💪✨

I just hit the year mark on my current job search and feel pretty demoralized with all the rejections and ghosting. I actually got a job offer at the State Department in December but it was rescinded by DOGE and I've been back at it ever since. Over the course of 300 applications, 70% ghosted me outright, 15% rejected me outright, and 15% have invited me to some sort of interview which ended up in 1 offer (rescinded), and the rest being rejections after interviewing.

I've been targeting jobs in public policy, international development, and consulting, across the defense industry and general corporate strategy. I live in D.C. and have been applying to jobs here and in New York, but I'm really open to almost any location at this point. I feel like I have tried everything, from tailoring my resume and cover letter meticulously to match the job description and ""beat ATS"", leveraging the far reaches of my network and having coffee chats with people I haven't seen in years, or just spraying and praying, and nothing has worked.

I recently revamped my resume layout and added a professional summary for the first time, but I welcome any harsh feedback regarding the layout, wording, or any information that is unnecessary and should be removed, etc. Is there some major glaring issue with my resume?

1liswo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1liswo9/the_modern_lunch_2_nyc/,"The Modern, lunch, 2*, NYC","Just back from NYC and a couple very enjoyable meals. First one was lunch at the Modern. My son & I decided to do the 3 course prix fixe. 

Our choices were as follows:

[Menu](https://preview.redd.it/08frfuz1oq8f1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=2368ff724a598fe0338e4f77de274b0b9f59eb5c)



https://preview.redd.it/37voeyimoq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b7ecc1f850a011033b86be15a5132dcb5bd885d

The meal started with a little amouse, a tarte with a sort of fish-dip and cucumbers over the top. Definitely a tasty starting bite, though I thought the cukes kind of overwhelmed the fish. 

[Eggs on eggs on eggs](https://preview.redd.it/8uejzoypoq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00751196944a003702668587d35757ae394c6fc0)

We opted to add on the Modern's signature dish, and it did not disappoint. Caviar, creamy egg, and dill over fried brioche is a sinfully delicious combination and I'd happily eat this every day. I was thinking about trying to figure out how to make this at home myself but I'll be candid with you; it's a lot of work AND it's about a 90% overlap texturally and flavor-wise with JG's egg toast with caviar which I DO know how to make and which isn't that hard. Add dill to the herb mix and it's more like a 93% overlap. Still, this dish is incredible and you'd be a fool not to add it on if you go to The Modern for lunch (it's a standard part of the full dinner tasting).

[Sourdough, whipped butter](https://preview.redd.it/e3b0uycopq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0eaa22e2d0d520043761a78ce6cbe81ec65edf40)

Appetizers came with warm sourdough and whipped butter. This didn't last through the appetizers it  was so good, which was a problem as the mains had lovely sauces to mop up as well. The staff brought us additional bread for the mains. Seriously delicious bread.

[chilled tuna, foie, mushroom vinegrette](https://preview.redd.it/grvrwt62qq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95b1709fa97cc0411fbd89ab632de3c83c014874)

My son picked the chilled tuna appetizer. We both thought it would be the best one of the selections. It wasn't. It was delicious, but I felt like it was missing something. Maybe a firmer texture element? A grain or two of additional salt? Maybe a hint more acid to brighten it up? Whatever. It was good and I'd gladly eat it again, it just fell short when compared to my app...

[asparagus, avocado, peas, basil](https://preview.redd.it/tm74ebtlqq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25858ad11e620782baf68564a53be3d2500f4206)

The waiter recommended this as being a perfect season-representing dish and he was not wrong. This is just one of those great examples of simple components treated and combined properly landing as an elevated bite. Completely delicious, perfectly balanced in flavor and texture. 

[lobster, smoked eggplant, zucchini](https://preview.redd.it/dlqwkqt0rq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccbad6e5cffe23579f2bbea017a67179e7daa7c2)

I thought this dish was completely winning. I am, generally speaking, pretty meh on lobster. It's fine, but IMHO rarely special. Just presented with the lobster sauce they're swimming in I'd have likely said the same thing about this dish, but when you added a dollop of the smoked eggplant the dish really came together. The creaminess, seasoning, and smoke of the eggplant really complimented the perfectly cooked lobster. In frank honestly I think the zucchini was there for color contrast more than flavor as they didn't add much on the palate.

[lamb, hazelnut, mushrooms](https://preview.redd.it/ih3nzl6mrq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=821a64b1a50e6927dca1ccf08cc8d591b65c9779)

Fuck yea, who doesn't like perfectly cooked lamb and mushrooms? My son liked this better than the lobster, I leaned more towards the lobster since it was more of a surprise. Regardless, perfectly cooked lamb so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. Well seasoned. No notes.

[Pineapple pavlova](https://preview.redd.it/xsrc419xrq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b59969b5e56f66a0f348bb8fe26c1e03aacf3342)

My son picked the pavlova. What's the deal with pavlovas these days? I've had them here, at Atera, Valhalla, and similar things at Aramburu, Jeong, and Ever all in the last 2-3 years. Anyhow, it was good. Pineapple works well in it. The shaved pineapple on top was maybe a little fibrous and tough to eat? Not a huge deal. A nice finisher.

[banana sabayon](https://preview.redd.it/x65vorcbtq8f1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39ac270fe785edbf7c10b5e95cdabdd9f14f003c)

Banana sabayon. If you like a banana pudding with coffee you'll love this. Another well-balanced and tasty dish.

Tasty little finishing treats. Nothing special to mention here apart from the dehydrated raspberries which provided a pop of flavor in a bite that mostly read as ""marshmallow"" until I hit it.

Don't sleep on the wine program. I had a lovely half-glass of champagne they recommended (Larmandier 1er), and an interesting Portuguese white to go with the meal which went well with pretty much everything.

Service was NOT brisk, and that's probably my fault. When we showed up at noon and were asked if there was a time we needed to be out of there, I said ""6 PM"" as we were going to a musical that night. It was an hour before we saw the first bite of food. We didn't feel neglected, but it was a luxuriously non-rushed lunch. I'd recommend being honest with them about how quick you want to be in and out of there as I saw food going to other tables at a much faster pace, so they appear (to my eye) to pace service to the individual table's urgency. Other aspects of service were very good - attentive but not fussy, never an empty glass. Routine check-ins but not hovering. Had a few nice short chats with service staff about food and with one guy about the MOMA, which led to their delivering a pair of free museum tickets to our table.

Topics included discussions of Daniel's hobbies like swimming and posting things on Instagram. He praised himself for his great work organizing a Super Bowl. He made plans to pickup trash with student interns on the weekends. And is looking forward to visiting water/wastewater infrastructure facilities in the future. He made a point to bring up housing and that he wants to build more of it. He took it upon himself to mention that a majority of SF employees are on site full time and essentially used that as the lead in to justify it being better for everyone to eliminate telework and bring everyone back 4 days a week. 

""*Yeah. I mean, listen, we, most of us, are in the office five days a week. Now, 70% of city employees are in office five days a week. I thought it was important to lead by example. And we, you know, I know some people is hard for but you know, we're going to be coming back August for four days a week for everybody. And I will say most of the companies I'm talking to are moving that way. COVID changed a lot of things. I want people to be able to have time with their families and their kids, but I also I firmly believe that we do better work when we're around each other, that we're learning from each other, we're talking to each other. Young people coming up get to have mentors, and that's tough to do from a coffee shop or, you know, in your kitchen, working from behind a screen. And I think there was a time that was, that was appropriate, and now it's a time for us. You know, New York City I mean, most people are back for five days a week. We are really lagging behind, especially downtown, in terms of economic activity, and we're getting better, but August 18 is going to be a big moment for us.""*

(Worthy Satire) - Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood, now 95 years young and fueled entirely by black coffee and raw grit, has made it clear he’s not riding off into the sunset anytime soon. “Retire? I don’t even know how to spell it,” Eastwood growled at reporters, before squinting so hard the microphone turned to dust.\
\
The “Dirty Harry” icon announced he’s prepping for his next film, tentatively titled Dirty Harry: Assisted Living Justice. In it, he’ll reprise his role as a no-nonsense cop who forgets where he parked his squad car but never forgets a perp’s face.\
\
Sources say Eastwood still insists on doing his own stunts—though now they mostly involve standing up without groaning or remembering why he walked into a room. “He wanted to fire a .44 Magnum, but we had to switch it out for a Nerf gun after the recoil dislocated his shoulder and cracked three ribs,” said one stunt coordinator.\
\
When asked what keeps him going, Eastwood simply muttered, “Criminals, liberals, and prune juice.”\
\
Stay tuned: rumor has it the sequel is already in the works—Gran Torino 2: Bingo Night Reckoning.\

Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

1listxs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1listxs,Pietro vs Femobook A4Z vs ZP6,"I wanted to give the A4Z more time to season - but my DM’s are getting blown up with A4Z questions - so I figured I’d jump the gun and do a preliminary back to back tasting comparison of the three. I have around 2-3lbs of beans through the A4Z at this point - so I reserve the right to update my opinion/thoughts after I’m over the 10lb mark when the burrs should be mostly if not fully seasoned. 

Coffee used: 
Sorellina Vinka Washed Sidra from Ecuador (grown 1,700 meters above sea level) - roaster supplied tasting notes = Raspberry Poptart, Hibiscus, Lemon Custard, Cherry, Bright. 

Process: 
Metal Hario V60, Cafec Abaca filters, 1:16 ratio, 197F TWW treated water. 3 pours: ~50gr 30 sec bloom, then two equal pours. 2:30 total draw down time - all three brews within 2 sec of each other (photos of each brew bed and stats posted in order). 


PIETRO:
Nosing notes: Red fruit, earthy notes, hibiscus 

My Tasting notes: Very pronounced acidity when hot - highlighting the lemon and hibiscus as the primary top notes. Solid terroir flavors - close your eyes and it’s easy to daydream of slurping on this brew at its farm in the green Ecuadorian mountains. When cooled to around 90-100F - things settle and find more balance. Very velvety and buttery mouthfeel, unctuous and immensely satisfying, but overly harsh/acidic and unbalanced at temps over 120F or so. Leaves a complex, oily, inky finish on the tongue that lingers and slowly fades. 

Wife’s tasting notes: Diluted dirt. 

FEMOBOOK A4Z:
Nosing notes: Sweet raspberry, wheat, caramel custard 

Tasting notes: Clear but managed non-description acidity, sweet raspberry jam, wheat (I can now make sense of the raspberry pop tart tasting notes on the label, but still think it’s a bit of a stretch) and the soft custard notes are definitely present. Much brighter and softer cup than the Pietro - less terroir flavor, and more fruit - and as the cup cools, the acidity becomes more defined and the lemon and softer cherry notes become quite clear - but the hibiscus note never enters my palate. Silky, yet cleaner and dryer mouthfeel - lacks the buttery, unctuous component of the Pietro - yet retains enough weight that it is quite satisfying and couldn’t be called tea like. Leaves a dry and clean dissolving finish on your tongue, which takes you on an interesting ride of quickly morphing flavors before it disappears into the ether. The A4Z takes you on a lovely ride across the tasting notes in an easily approachable and beginner (and expert) friendly manner. 

Wife’s tasting notes: Raspberry “regular” dirt with some slight sweetness 

ZP6:
Nosing notes: Wheat and caramel custard - but the fruit notes aren’t jumping out like the A4Z. 

Tasting notes: Before my brain can process any flavors - I’m forced to ponder the wildly different mouthfeel. While there is a smooth texture to the brew - it has almost no weight, and is the classic definition of “tea like brew” in that from a textural standpoint, you could literally be drinking black tea. After the inky Pietro cup, and the silky A4Z - it’s a surprising departure and I didn’t expect such an apparent night and day difference. For comparison purposes, if we rated the Pietro a 10/10 in mouthfeel, the A4Z would get an 8.75 and I’d rate the ZP6 a 3.5. The finish is extremely dry and fleeting, lasting mere moments of a citrusy punch. In terms of flavor it is far and away the least complex cup of the three. The ZP6 really puts a magnifying glass on the Hibiscus and lemon notes, buttressed by light wheat notes - and largely ignores the rest. The cup tastes laser focused, yet simple, and at least for this particular bean - not terribly satisfying. Had I been served this cup in isolation - I would consider it good, but after having brews from the Pietro and A4Z, I tossed the remaining 50% of my cup in the sink after writing down my tasting notes. 

Wife’s tasting notes: she tapped out and wasn’t interested. 

Individual Grinder Taste Summaries: 
Pietro: If you’re focused on just the raw terroir notes of a coffee - the Pietro is likely going to be your best fit. The Pietro provides a more “in your face” intensity over the A4Z and its mouthfeel is unquestionably the best of the three - if you prefer earthy notes - it’s hard to beat. 

Femobook: That said, the Femobook A4Z gave me a clear taste of the terroir, but toned it down substantially such that the more delicate flavor notes could clearly rise above and stand out. Picking up the coffee roasters tasting notes on the package was immediate and as if they had been carefully laid out for you. Flavor separation and presentation was beautifully defined, and if you like delicate fruit, berries, floral and citrus notes - the Femobook will provide a level of separation and definition the other two simply can’t match. 

ZP6: I love the ZP6 and have recommended it to others countless times. It’s an amazing grinder, a stellar value and it offers a very different cup than the A4Z (the burrs are not identical when you pull them out and compare them BTW). All that said - the ZP6 feels like a bantamweight in a heavyweight fight. There are certain coffees where I actually prefer my ZP6 over the Pietro (mainly fruity naturals), but for most washed coffee’s the Pietro dunks on the ZP6 and it often isn’t close. I also cannot imagine a situation/coffee where I’d prefer any ZP6 cup over the A4Z. Given this - unless it is an issue of cost/affordability - I see no reason to consider this in the mix of these other two grinders, nor should it be, it’s less than 1/2 the cost. 

Overall:
In summary - after a week of drinking at least 4 cups a day on over a dozen different beans from the Femobook A4Z, the actual “in cup” flavor is the most versatile of the three. The workflow is also far and away the best of the three, and the size and footprint of the Femobook are similar to the Pietro (although it weighs more) and given it is powered by internal lithium batteries there’s nowhere the Pietro can sit on your counter where the Femobook can’t. 

If I could only own one - without hesitation it would be the Femobook. I really like the easy button for tasting notes, I do like a fruity/delicate coffee and/or Gesha in my regular rotation and the workflow and satisfaction of using the Femobook is the highest of any grinder I’ve experienced to date, where as the Pietro is the lowest. That said, the Pietro still reigns supreme when it comes to rich earthy coffees. It isn’t that the Femobook isn’t exceptional for them, because it is - it’s just that the Pietro is better and offers a richer and more luxurious mouthfeel - period. If that is the one specific problem you are solving for, and don’t mind the notoriously bad workflow - the Pietro is still the grinder. 

Final note (for now):
The Femobook A4Z is much better than I expected it to be. It is quick, clean and effortless to use, and it makes roaster tasting notes simple and easy to pick out, even for novices. So far, I really haven’t uncovered any negatives or caveats and it’s done a stellar job with washed coffees, naturals, a co-ferment I tried and even on a medium coffee on the cusp of being considered dark. If you like trying lots of different types of coffees and especially if you enjoy delicate coffees/flavors and Gesha’s - it’s really a sensational tool. It’s also a tool that has that unique, unspoken characteristic charm that makes it delightful to use and interact with and is something that improves your overall experience. All of this combined, makes it my favorite of the three, and in fact - my favorite coffee grinder as a whole (and I own over a dozen), that is - at least for now. 

Does the Femobook A4Z make better cups than a Pietro? Well, for this particular bean, highlighting the specific delicate roaster notes and for my palate - yes, it was. But without question the script could/would flip with different beans and the Pietro certainly has a superior mouthfeel. 

In conclusion - in cup, between the two there isn’t a “better” option, it will depend on the specific coffee and individual taste preferences. In my opinion the two are certainly peers (in cup) - but without question the Femobook is vastly better to use and as a result would be my go to for $500, and would be my easy pick over the Pietro.

1list1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1list1m/cash_tip_splitting_and_the_coworkers_who_take_em/,Cash Tip Splitting and the coworkers who take em all,"I work at a store that's primarily sort of a general purpose corner shop, I guess. (like a grocery section, local businesses sell their products here, drug store stuff, records, etc) that also has a full coffee bar, and a soft serve machine. Our card readers don't have a tip function (if you're buying eggs and a scented candle, I didn't really do much to earn a tip there), so any tips are cash in the tip jar at the till. It's meant to be pretty give and take, honor system yknow? And everyone has a stash pot so when you're dividing tips, you can put someone else's share in their pot. 

There's 3 separate people out of a total of 10-15 of us who, consistently, when their shift ends, dump the entire jar into their bag, take all of the tips by hand, or pretend to split tips evenly, but intentionally short another person even if the other person had a longer shift, or whatever. The one that infuriates me the most is one girl who will spend almost her entire shift stocking shelves (or pretending to stock while actually being on her phone or something lol), and then takes the entirety of the tips.

Some longer term employees have brought up prior concerns with management being a little too willing to fire someone for smaller things, and I don't want anyone to lose their job because I'm a snitch, but like, none of us are making a livable wage here, and the rest of us are so careful about making the tips split equally. Like, even if you were on shift, but you weren't on bar at all, but you were still here, you're getting an equal half of the tips, if I'm splitting them. 

I don't know, anyone dealt with this at their place? Is there a way to get it to stop without getting management involved? ",0,1750713566.0,barista,1,0.33,False

https://old.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1594uz8/update_worth_reaching_out_after_25_years/


After our conversation in 2023, I respected her boundaries and went no contact as promised. I moved on with my life - traveled, dated (single currently, nothing worked out, and I'm so busy with work I'm kind of glad I don't have time to pursue a relationship because that shit is exhausting), and focused on personal growth (piano is very fun apparently!). I genuinely thought that chapter was closed. I was pretty happy.

In spring 2024, her family member (who she was caring for) passed away. I attended the funeral to show support along with mutual friends, knowing that her support circle is very small. Does it count as breaking no contact? I don't care tbh - I did my part as a decent human being. I was told she appreciated me being there very much, and that was enough for me. Then I went back to no contact.

By November 2024, something shifted. Our mutual friend told me she'd been asking about me - how I was doing, if I was seeing anyone - and told me that she was thinking of inviting me to a gathering at this friend's house. It didn't affect me very much. I was fresh out of a fling and I got a bit hopeful but it passed after 2-3 days, and the invitation never came. I was pretty happy with the progress I'd made, I'd be a mess years ago.

Fast forward to the start of June. We were grabbing late-night coffee with my friend, and out of the blue he asked me if I'd be OK with her joining us since he'd been talking with my ex. I told him that I needed to think about this, and after pacing for 20 minutes I decided that I was OK with it. Even if it would affect me worse then I though, I've survived worse. How bad would it be?

Then she came. We talked for 2.5-3 hours. The connection was still there - but that's natural, right, after 11 years? We'd both grown since 2023. During our conversation, she mentioned still having a plate of mine from the funeral (here you bring something you make to a funeral house, and I'd made her some treats but forgot the plate) that she wanted to return someday soon. She also said her friend had been wanting to invite me to a gathering at her house and asked if I'd be interested in going. I said yes to both. I don't know if it was the right call or not.

But then... silence. Three weeks now. And I'm kind of OK with it. Not completely, of course, I have some expectations. But I know the old me would go furious and anxious all over this in an unhealty way. Now, I'm good. Definitely not a mess.

What will I do if an invitation comes? I'll go. Do I have a plan on what to say there? No. But one thing is very clear: this time, I'm not chasing. I'm letting her process whatever she needs to process. She mentioned concrete next steps (returning the plate, the friend gathering), so the ball is in her court.
 
If she wants to explore this, she knows how to find me. One thing is clear to me though, I can't be friends with her. But that's progress too, right?

I really don't know what will come out of this, just wanted to write to get it out of my system. Will update if anything develops.",1,1750713284.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

While it's not directly related to your craft, it's related to wood. One common thing! 

I'm trying to find a manufacturer who can produce IKEA-level quality wood products either with plywood (preferred) or particle board (need to be in acceptable quality).

I'd like to get 2 in 1 transformer table manufactured, 3-5qty first month and 10-20qty next.

I was looking for something like this for my own home but the cheapest one were around 1300 USD. What I want to do is, I want to manufacture it at lower but acceptable quality, and sell for 250-350 USD.

It might be impossible, I'm not sure, but I'd like to explore this idea and would love to get it manufactured in USA if possible.

She said it was “for the best,” but I knew it just meant I was one less thing to deal with. I’ve been by myself in one way or another ever since.

No one tucked me in. No one came to school plays. I learned how to be quiet, how to take up less space, how to stop expecting warmth. That year, I started sleeping with a rolled-up jacket beside me, pretending someone was there. Not because I was weak, but because I didn’t know what it felt like to be held just because I mattered.

I’m 32 now. I have a good job. A quiet condo. I text my niece every week about her tests because she says she’s bad at them, and I know what it’s like to grow up believing that no one’s really watching. I return shopping carts. I let people merge. I say “text me when you’re home,” even though they almost never do.

Women tell me I’m safe. They say I listen like I mean it. I’ve been called “emotionally rare” and “what men should be.” One woman told me I felt like home, then ghosted me a week later. I didn’t argue. I told her I understood. Then I sat on my couch and cried into a hoodie that still smelled like her shampoo.

I’ve never cheated. Never lied about my intentions. I don’t play games. I make playlists for people I miss and never send them. I remember birthdays, how people take their coffee, and the name of your dog, even if you only told me once.

But lately I’ve been wondering: is that the problem?for wanting love that doesn’t need to be earned through pain? For believing in affection that doesn’t expire the moment it’s no longer convenient?

I’m not bitter. I’m not broken. But I’m tired. Of being someone’s soft place to land, just before they go running back to the chaos they say they hate.

I know I was built for love, steady, quiet, everyday love. I just don’t know if anyone sees it. Or if they ever will.

If you have felt the same please consider to send me a message (DM) for an indepth conversation as to why. I want to understand.

I just got my bambino and am having a fun, if a bit frustrating time getting everything dialed in. I am a long time AeroPress user, so generally understand coffee and extraction, and am a bit puzzled by a section of the bambino manual. Many sources, including this sub's wiki, seem to believe what is also generally true of AeroPress coffee: more coffee=less extraction. For some reason, however, the bambino manual seems to say the opposite, and that a higher dose will increase extraction.

I am a bit confused by this. Is this because other extraction assume you are doing coffee in and water out, and since the bambino doses at the pump the physics are different for some reason?

And before people get on me for using the default settings and using the manual, I know you can get in the weed in espresso and plan on being there eventually, but after a similar experience with the AeroPress, I don't want to get burnt out doing too much all at once, so figured getting something decent from the manual to start would work best.

Supporting small businesses should mean supporting good values—fair wages, safe environments, and equity for all. It shouldn’t mean turning a blind eye because someone owns a cute building downtown.

Curious if others in the Frederick area have had similar experiences. We need to be honest about where our dollars go, even (especially) locally.",9,1750712111.0,frederickmd,72,0.54,False

Add in cultural differences and time zones, and you’ve got the kind of challenge that makes most people swipe left before things even start.

But if you're in it? If you've found someone who speaks to something real in you?

Then trust becomes the most important currency you’ve got.

Not flowers. Not promises. Not fireworks. Just the slow, steady kind of trust that doesn’t flinch when things get weird.

**You Grew Up Learning Different Rules**

In some cultures, trust starts with shared values. Eye contact. A calm tone. Showing up on time. In others, it’s built through warmth, closeness, softness. It’s not about what you say, but how safe someone feels around you.

Neither is right nor wrong. But if you're building something across those lines, you have to learn each other’s rules without turning it into a checklist.

That means you’ll mess up. You'll think you're being clear, and they'll think you're being cold. Or they’ll hold back, and you’ll read it as disinterest. It takes time to know what’s “normal” and what’s actually a red flag. Don’t assume. Ask. Ask even when it feels awkward. Ask especially then.

**Time Zones Will Test Your Patience**

One of you is having morning coffee while the other’s crawling into bed. Plans get pushed. Messages land too late. And even when you both want to connect, life gets in the way. This isn’t just inconvenient. It chips at the foundation if you’re not careful. You start asking, “Why didn’t they reply?” Then, “Are they still as into this as I am?” And suddenly you’re spiraling over a delay that had nothing to do with love and everything to do with poor Wi-Fi or a work deadline.

***Here’s what helps:*** rhythm. Not rigid schedules, but consistent rituals. A goodnight voice note. Sunday morning calls. Little routines that remind you both: we’re in this.

**Trust Isn’t Grand Gestures**

It’s not about sending surprise gifts or planning a dramatic meetup. Those are lovely. But trust? Real trust?

* It’s texting when you said you would.
* It’s being honest when something feels off.
* It’s staying kind when you’re tired or jealous or scared.
* It’s showing them your regular self, not just your curated highlight reel.

No relationship survives on charm alone. Especially not one stretched across miles and cultural gaps.

**Get Comfortable Saying the Wrong Thing**

You’ll offend each other at some point. Not intentionally. But because something small gets lost in translation, or your sarcasm doesn’t land, or their silence feels cold when it’s actually respectful. The couples who make it don’t avoid these moments. They name them. They say, “*That didn’t sit right with me*,” or “*Did I hurt you just now?*”

Vulnerability is where trust starts to grow roots.

**Build Your Own Third Culture**

It’s not about one person folding into the other’s world. It’s about creating something new, your way of doing things. Your own phrases. Your shared inside jokes. A private space that belongs to neither culture entirely, but feels like home to both. That’s where the magic is. In the in-between.

Like two people trying to dance to different rhythms and eventually finding a new beat altogether.

**A Note on Digital Trust**

Screens can bring you closer, sure. But they also make it easier to pretend, to hide, to check out emotionally without leaving a trace. If you’re serious about this, show up fully. Use video. Let them see your eyes when you talk. Be consistent. Be a little boring, even. Trust doesn’t grow from intensity. It grows from presence.

**When Doubt Creeps In**

Maybe your friends don’t get it. Maybe your family’s skeptical. Maybe you have moments when you wonder if any of this is real, or if you’re just romanticizing a fantasy. Here’s the truth: if the connection is based on honesty, if you feel more grounded than infatuated, if both of you are doing the work, then it's not a fantasy. It's just hard.

And that’s okay.

Sometimes trust builds slowly, like watching paint dry. Other times it hits all at once, like a warm light switching on in a dark room. Either way, it needs attention. Not constant reassurance, but care. Intention. The choice to keep choosing each other, even across distance, culture, and time.

Because love like this doesn’t come pre-assembled. You build it with your bare hands.

Any long-distance love stories you'd love to share? Let's live vicariously through you.

Who else has experienced the ""**Dolby Atmos Stems of Doom**"" delivery? You know the one. You download the files, filled with optimism, then you bravely **drag them into your DAW**... and that's when the **REAL HORROR** **MOVIE** begins.



Suddenly, your perfect session is a dumpster fire: files with **wrong sample rates** doing disco dances, **bit depths** that make your eyes twitch, or the classic ""**surprise!** here are **3-4 stems** merged into an unholy alliance"" when you needed everything separate. Or perhaps, a file count so **astronomically high**, you realize you're about to exceed the **Dolby Atmos object limit** before you've even had your first coffee. And then, the grand finale of despair: after pulling an all-nighter, your masterpiece mix gets **gloriously rejected** by Apple Music and other streaming platforms because the stereo master's **timecode** decided to go on a solo vacation. It's enough to make you consider a career in competitive noodle eating.



**I've been in that digital purgatory more times than my DAW's crash report history is longer than**. The sheer, soul-crushing moment of realizing you're not mixing, you're just debugging the universe. All that wasted time and emotional energy could have funded enough acoustic treatment to build a small fort.""



So, instead of just screaming into my vocal booth (**which, let's be honest, I still did a little**), I decided to channel that existential dread into something productive. **I spent my spare moments (mostly fueled by caffeine and spite) building FSATC – a web-based, pre-flight tool specifically for Dolby Atmos music**. My aim was simple: intercept these digital gremlins before they hijack your entire workflow.



And the best part? **It's 100% FREE! No hidden fees, no subscriptions**, just pure, unadulterated help. Think of it as my contribution to the collective sanity of audio engineers worldwide.



Why FSATC is about to become your new favorite obsession:

* **Privacy Mode: Activated!** All processing happens locally in your browser. Your sensitive audio files never leave your machine. No uploads to my non-existent servers, no data collection. Just pure, local magic.
* **Speed Demon on Steroids: Seriously!** it chews through hundreds of stems in literal seconds. Get your results faster than you can say ""incorrect sample rate.""
* **Atmos Music Whisperer**: Fine-tuned for the crucial 24-bit/48kHz requirements of major streaming platforms. No more guessing if you're hitting the specs!

It Solves Your Biggest Headaches (Automatically!):

* **Master & Stem Spec Compliance**: Catches those sneaky format, sample rate, and bit depth issues before they throw a fit in your DAW.
* **Timecode Sync Superpower**: Ensures perfect alignment with your stereo master, so Apple Music doesn't give you the digital boot.
* **Object Count Insight**: Instantly reveals if your total channels are playing nice with Dolby Atmos limits.
* **Professional Reports**: Export sleek PDF/TXT reports for your records or to politely inform clients where their files went wrong.
* **Hassle-Free Drag & Dro**p: Just dump your individual files or entire chaos-folders in.

This tool is ridiculously lightweight **(<600KB)**. Proof that even small things can prevent massive meltdowns. While a dedicated desktop app is my future dream, this web version is **fully loaded and ready to rock your workflow**.



I'm still tinkering with tiny text bits (**because perfectionism is a curse**), but the **core functionality is solid** and has already saved my own skin multiple times. If you give it a whirl, I'd love your feedback or any truly wild stories about ""minimalist"" stem deliveries.

Another one I was considering was similar. 20g of coffee to 250ml scaled up, 18 to 24 hrs in the fridge, then filter with AeroPress XL.

The results are astonishing; really complex flavor, zero bitterness and a delicious strong cup of coffee. I’m been dialing a recipe that emulates the ratio/output ou a double espresso and I’m pretty happy with it. 

At least for now, it has been satisfying my crave for a home espresso machine with a tenth of the cost (at least).

I'm drowning here.,"Was recently diagnosed with autism level 1, nearly three years after being diagnosed ADHD at age 32 (will turn 35 this year). I'm now learning all of those episodes of ""depression"" as an adult were actually neurodivergent burn out that my brain never fully recovered from each time, like a battery that gradually no longer has full capacity and can't charge beyond x%. I also have a physical disability that limits mobility. Combined, I struggle intensely with executive dysfunction that mostly manifests in my house turning into a goddamn disaster. Right now, it's the worst it has ever been. 

I have surgery on my dominant hand Thursday and won't be able to use it for two months so I'm really in a pickle. I've been beating myself up about the state of my apartment for months and really need to deal with it now.. 

My main priorities are:
1. Unearthing my bed area which is surrounded by general messiness and dirty laundry 
2. Getting couch area clean and comfy again; there's a big pile of recycling next to it coffee table height that just makes me want to cry. Plus my coffee table itself is covered in crap as is every surface around my couch. 
3. Getting kitchen to a place I can have someone come over to finish up. There's a fruit fly infestation because I started cleaning it out but had a bad pain flare and couldn't get the trash with food in it to the dumpster. Then the overwhelm and task paralysis took over and it's like a mini landfill in there. I don't think a general cleaner would be able/willing handle this mess because of the flies.. and they're now coming into my living room which makes me concerned about healing. 

Does anyone have any tips or words of encouragement to help me battle my own brain and the timeline? I deal with so much shame around this. My biggest issue is not being able to take multiple trips downstairs to my building's dumpsters because it's painful for me and I have to rest between trips. If I could just get my place reset I could maybe afford a once weekly cleaner to help with the things I struggle with before they snowball, but right now I'm drowning and external motivators don't work for me anymore when it comes to cleaning. 

Any words of encouragement would be immensely appreciated.

Michael didn’t sleep that night. He couldn’t get the images of Viperlash’s corpse out of his mind. Yes, he had seen worse while working with Saw, but it was one thing to dispose of a body and a whole other thing to kill them yourself. At least with Donie and Saw’s deaths, he could convince himself it was an accident. That he didn’t mean to kill them, but he stared Viperlash in the eye and made the decision to end her life. He knew he didn’t have another choice. That she would have killed him or made him into her plaything if he hadn’t done it, but that only slightly lessened his grief.

He sighed, watching the sunrise atop a lifeguard tower on the beach. “She deserved it,” he muttered with a twitch in his lip.

Several hours later, he found him sitting on a rooftop with a hot cup of coffee. He had watched the news report about what had happened last night, and they were still trying to ID the charred corpse and the handgun. Or at least that was what the news had said. Michael doubted they hadn’t found out it was Viperlash. He assumed they were not reporting that to keep people from panicking.

Michael sighed and pushed those thoughts from his mind. He was still trying to find anything to focus on rather than figuring out what was happening with his precognition.

He blew out a long breath. “You got this.” He activated his precognition power and watched as the apparition of the old lady manifested.

She again took on a half-rotted form and began walking toward him.

“They took my son!” she cried.

He winced, remembering what had happened to him. “I know, and I know it won’t bring him or you back, but I promise to make Raymond pay for what he did.”

The apparition stopped and stared into Michael’s eyes. “You promise?”

“I do.”

“My power help?”

“It would, if you don’t mind me using it.”

“Use it. Use it and kill Raymond. Promise?”

“I promise.”

The apparition looked up at the sun, then back to him, and nodded. “Thank you. I entrust it to you.” She faded away.

Michael felt strange, and instinctive knowledge entered his mind. Every test, every trial, and every time, the old lady had used her power. He looked up, understanding everything there was to know about her power, and a beacon blazed to life in his soul.

“All to you.”

He heard her voice one last time. He activated the power again, but this time, everything clicked correctly into place, resonating with the beacon. He watched as three branching timelines stretched out before him. While they only spanned 10 seconds, it fixed Michael’s most significant problem with the power. He could now see how his actions would affect the situation, even if there were three possibilities.

“Thank you,” he said, looking up to the sky.

Excited by the prospect that had just been laid out before him, he activated his mental library. He quickly realized that they wouldn’t all be as easy to convince as he now sat in front of the ghost of a disheveled man throwing a tantrum, because he could no longer see his library.

“Can’t see!” he yelled.

Michael sighed. “How the hell did you even end up on Raymond’s hit list?” he asked.

“Raymond?”

“The guy who killed you…”

“Oh, saw murder. Went to the police. End up dead. Unable to see. Unable to read. My library.” The apparition curled up on the ground and began sobbing.

Michael sighed again. “If I get some books for you to read, will you let me use your powers in peace?”

He stopped crying and sat up. “If good book.”

Michael nodded and thumbed through the money he had left. “Alright.” He deactivated the power and flew down to a nearby bookstore before reactivating it. “Show me which one you want,” he whispered.

The apparition nodded and thumbed through the different titles before pointing to one. “This.”

Michael pulled the book from the shelf, giving it a quick glance before walking to the checkout counter.

“Just this?” the man running the counter asked.

Michael nodded and paid for the book before flying back to the rooftop. He activated the mental library again. The apparition appeared, and Michael tried handing it the book, but it passed straight through the ghost’s arm and fell to the ground.

Michael facepalmed. “Of course,” he sighed.

He picked the book up again and signaled for the apparition to sit next to him. He opened the book to its first page.

“How about–” he trailed off as he watched the apparition read the first page before sticking its head into the book. “Can you read it that way?”

“Yes,” the apparition answered. Michael shrugged and began using the library to practice his kickboxing.

He also used it to help him formulate a new workout routine. He didn’t have the money to spend on a gym membership, and there was no chance he was going to show his face in the same place too many times again. He ended up going heavily into calisthenics, as he did not need any equipment to get a good workout. When he was happy with it, he deactivated the skill and went into the routine.

It started with three sets of 15 inclined pushups, then continued with three sets of 30 situps. While he did not have a pull-up bar, he gripped onto the edge of the roof access outcropping and did three sets of eight. Finally, he finished with three sets of 20 squats and three sets of 15 lunges.

He finished his workout and made his way to sit down and watch the busy city below. An explosion echoed out less than a block away, and with no hesitation, he jumped off the roof and flew toward the epicenter. He found the ground floor of a high-rise burst into flames, and a message was scrawled into the sidewalk. “The attacks will continue until Flare is released.”

“God damn cultists,” Michael muttered, hardening his skin and bursting into the building.

It looked like some type of bomb had gone off, scattering the furniture and collapsing part of the floor above. Michael frantically looked around the room but couldn’t find any survivors.

“Help!” a woman’s voice cried from the floor above.

Michael flew through the hole left by the bomb and found a woman holding a child trapped. He landed, his skin mostly returning to normal, and a pair of wings sprouted from his back.

“I got you,” he said, grabbing the woman’s hand.

He smashed through a nearby window, lifted the woman into the air, and jumped out, gliding to the ground.

She thanked him and moved to the other side of the street.

Michael nodded and dashed back in.

Half an hour later, he sat on the side of the road watching as the flames were extinguished. He had managed to save 13 people from the building, but three were still unaccounted for and most likely lay somewhere beneath the rubble.

“The Flare again, huh?” one firefighter said, reading what had been carved into the sidewalk.

“Every year like clockwork,” another said with a sigh.

“How does he keep getting more cultists?” Michael asked.

“Oh, I’m surprised you don’t know with your occupation.”

“Uh, I just started last week.”

The man let out a nervous chuckle. “Sorry about that. I saw you on the news with the Crimson Accord last week and just assumed you had been doing it for a while.”

Michael shook his head.

“Well, anyway, Brainwave, the superhero responsible for designing and sending out the frequency that allows power dampeners to work, has to recharge whatever runs the system once every year.”

“So, there is a short amount of time where villains can use their powers?”

“Bingo. Normally, it wouldn’t matter as it’s only a 30-second window, and he changes the time every year, but somehow, since he has been locked up, the Flare has noticed the opportunity and used it to get his hooks into as many unsuspecting victims as he can.”

“Why haven’t they given him the death penalty already?” the first firefighter asked.

“Believe me, I hear that, but rumor has it Solaris won’t let them, still convinced he can bring his friend back or something like that.”

Michael held back his disdain. *Thousands of people are killed every year, and he is still holding on to some sentiment instead of putting a stop to it?* “Thanks for the chat, but if there is nothing else you need, I should be on my way.”

“Yeah, you’re all good. Thanks for the help.”

“Yeah, thanks,” the second firefighter added.

Michael gave them a slight wave and blasted into the sky.

* **❌ Ephemeral Libraries:** Services disappearing with your payment.
* **❌ Ghost Support:** Chatbots and dead email addresses.
* **❌ Channel Chaos:** 50,000+ channels, but 40% offline or duplicates.

I needed a **best IPTV provider** offering:

* 🔮 **True HD/4K Stability:** Zero artifacts or buffering.
* 🏰 **Longevity:** Established infrastructure with legal compliance.
* 🧑‍💻 **Real Support:** 24/7 human assistance.
* � **Curated Content:** Quality > quantity.

1lird8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxietyprogress/comments/1lird8z/update_went_to_a_festival_alone_for_5_days/,Update: went to a festival alone for 5 days,"So last time I posted I talked about how I gave compliments to start conversations. My next big project was a 5-day festival (gaspop) where I went alone. I thought: I'm going by it day-by-day.

TL;DR: It was an amazing festival, great people, experiment has ups and downs, but overall I did better than I thought I would. Especially Day 4 and 6

Day 1: So it begins  
Day 1 was a travel day. I left home at 11:00, was awake by 07:00 feeling nervous and anxious, so I checked if I had everything three times over, if not more. And even on the train, I had a feeling I forgot something. But, spoiler alert, I didn't. The first day there aren't any shows, but the bar is open, so that's where I went. It turns out: when you have some alcohol in your system, it's way easier to talk to people. I had a nice chat with a magician and some Germans. So all in all: day 1 of my experiment was a success.

Day 2: First real festival day  
I slept horribly... I awoke 5.000 times during hte night. So this day it was just me sitting in the grass, looking at the stages from a distance... Alone. At the end of the day, during one of the last shows, someone sat next to me and we talked for a little bit. She didn't want to sit alone, because everyone would walk around her.. Fair... All in all: I don't really count this, so day 2 is a failure. And if it's a precursor of what's to come, this is going to be a tough weekend. 

Day 3: New day, new chances  
When I woke up, I made a vow (but a little less dramatic) to do better. Both for my experiment and my experience. During the festival I came across a colleague of mine. We talked for a bit, but it doesn't really count, since he's not a stranger. In the morning I talked to some people who were selling food and drinks. If they usually listen to this kind of music (Graspop is a metal festival, in case I haven't told you yet). They usually didn't but they were open for new experiences. When I talked to them at the end of the day, they said it had been a long one. I also gave it more effort to stand closer to the stages and be more in tune with the crowd. Which was quite nice. While bands were setting up, you could talk to the people. It's easy when you have an opening. You're all there at the same festival, so you probably like the same music. A bit of a side note: at one time people started putting arms around each others shoulders. I hate physical contact with a passion. I just wave to people, or give them a high five. In my friend group they always want to hug... Fucking stop..... Sorry, end of the side note. All in all: day 3 was more about the music than the experiment. So it was somewhat a success... But also, I just went from stage to stage, so there weren't any long conversations. So take this success with a grain of salt.

Day 4: Does heat equal more sociability?  
Day 4 was awful temperature-wise, amazing for my experiment. It started in the morning, where I met two dudes who were having their morning coffee. Super sociable. They talked with everyone, but their I instigated(?) the conversation. They gave me some recommendations for bands to watch and general festival survival tips. We talked for a good 2 hours (from the opening of the festival area to the start of the first shows). Later, when I was refilling my water (which you had to do every two seconds), I was talking to people in line in front of me or behind me. Had good 5 - 10 minute conversations, depending on how fast the line went. I had to do that a lot of times, so had a lot of conversations. All in all: super duper success on day 5.

  
Day 5: Nothing noteworthy  
I am trying so hard to remember any conversations I had yesterday.... But I can't. So I'm not gonna call this a success.

Day 6: Back to normalcy  
Today I traveled  back home. It was bright and early, cause guess what: I slept like shit again. So my plan was to talk to someone to keep me awake. Thankfully someone had to go the same way until like one train station before mine. So I talked with him all morning. Plus a few other still on the festival site. Someone who needed to go to school for his final exam right after, someone who had been to the doctors because of overheating and this dude who apparently lives near me and goes to two other festivals in the coming weeks.   
Plus I talked a lot to my cat when I got home.

  
Parting words:   
It wasn;t a perfect experiment, but I never expected it to be. My main focus there was still the music. Still, I have had some great conversations, lasting knowledge and fun times. It was mad scary at first, anxiety went through the roof. To anyone who wants to do anything similar: I suggest to do something you're super passionate about. For example: let's say after two days I gave up, I'd still have a good time with the music which I'm passionate about.   
Also... to quote Shia LaBeouf: ""Just do it. Nothing is impossible."" Plus something about toothpaste, but you can skip that part.

I'm sure my style of writing can be chaotic, cause that's what I am, but I'm glad you found it intriguing enough to read to the end.

Just putting out feelers to see if anyone would be interested in this kind of arrangement. I was a professional house cleaner for 5 years and cleaning is always been something I have enjoyed. 

  
Currently I get my hair done every 6-8 weeks-ish and my stylist is just getting hella expensive (not that she's not worth every penny! but im just trying to revive the good ole barter n trade system to save some $$). 

I'd prefer to dive into the specifics of my hair/the trade details in DMs or just meet up for coffee or something around town. But the short of it is my hair appointments usually take about 3-3.5 hours and cost around $300. What I'm looking for does involve root bleaching and applying fashion color in a 2 color ombre, just so you have some scope. 

  
I'm looking for an equal trade, you provide the hair services( I provide the hair products), I provide the house cleaning (you provide the cleaning products). We can discuss what the equal trade looks like, expectations, etc so we both feel good about it. I am open to any kind of house cleaning or organizing, I used to clean frat row so there's nothing that scares me now lol.

They are slightly sensitive from time to time. I fear translucency means I'm going to loose them soon? Is that true? Isn't it too soon for my tooth to be turning transparent and loosing enamel? 

What can realistically be done to continue with my natural tooth as long as possible without damaging them further.

 I am somebody overly anxious about teeth, the anxiety comes and goes from time to time. Currently very anxious over teeth. Not including pictures because it makes it feel very real. Used to drink black coffee, stopped for better care of teeth. Drink and smoke occassionally. ",1,1750709943.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1lir8h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1lir8h7/expectations_for_cleaners/,Expectations for Cleaners,"We hired a new cleaner a few months ago. Prices are very reasonable but I’m feeling like I’m getting what I paid for. We provided some feedback after the second cleaning because I was pretty disappointed in some of the things that were missed, the next time was great and now we’ve fallen back into the mediocre territory again. Just want some other opinions on if I should complain, quit using them or just deal. 

It’s $105 a cleaning - she’s doing 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, living room, family room and stairs. We pick up really well for the most part and I vacuum almost every other day and mop in between visits but we do have 2 dogs and a toddler. 

She doesn’t dust anything in the bedrooms, I intentionally clear my desk in my office and she still doesn’t touch it, no dressers or decor type stuff. Spots on the floors are consistently missed, like where a bit of scrubbing would be needed. She uses a little dust mop thing which I think is the culprit. If there is anything on say a coffee table she won’t move it to dust under. I keep finding dog hair in corners or like beside the toilet where it’s harder to reach. Fronts of cabinets get missed regularly.

I know this is a great price and to be honest anything helps but I’m debating if it’s still worth it. Are other cleaners more thorough than this? Do I just need to deal? We’ve only had one other consistent cleaner who was amazing but she moved out of state sadly. ",1,1750709935.0,workingmoms,17,1.0,False

I met a local autistic person on a dating app. Our chat was great! They love gaming, they have overlapping communication style (long deep messages) and pretty much seem like a great match. They are more like experienced and ambitious; studying a master’s degree. I kinda feel like I’m ambitious; but have fallen into a funk. Mental health and live with my parents still; but they do too. Neither of us can drive (I medically can’t; dyspraxia. They have a  medical issue)

They were thrown-off by my lack of dating history …and they had to have a long-hard think about things when I told them I’m long-term unemployed. In the end they came back to me with an answer. It’s worth a date—and if there’s no-chemistry; they’d be happy to be friends ☺️

They asked my potential date plans. I threw out a few ideas: I’d travel to their town; which I’m unfamiliar with. I think I might have not been assertive or decisive about where we should go) so I found a indie coffee shop and proposed a walk and a chat as an activity. I didn’t wanna tell them where to go; I’d rather it was collaborative (especially as they are local)

They replied:

*”Not ghosting just have no energy today x”*

That was sent on Saturday Evening. I replied back with an understanding message; but after Sunday and now Monday; I’m wondering… how long does “no energy today” go on for? Is it a genuine thing and I should give them space; or am I being gently let-down? I’m bad with overthinking things. (I’m 32 and from the 🇬🇧 if that’s relevant; AuDHD & OCD diagnosed)

This always happens when the ejaculate is thin and watery. Symptoms include:

* Penis becomes stiff/rubbery while flaccid. Doesn't hang down.
* Irritated, itchy urethra. Tight and contracted scrotum.
* Urination stream is weaker and doesn't fully empty.
* Burning anus after bowel movement. (Pelvic floor muscles tight?)
* Muted senses, anhedonia, derealization
* Bad anxiety, cognitive fog, muscle tension
* Increased stimulant cravings. Feel like I reach for more coffee.
* Temperature dysregulation. Always feel an agitating overheating sensation.
* Weak, hoarse, breathy voice.
* Vivid dreams, bad sleep

BUT—all of this disappears after a very *satisfying* orgasm with high arousal. Then everything works perfectly: rich sensory perception, no anxiety, perfect urination/digestion, deep voice, etc.

I've been experiencing moderate insomnia for around two years now. At first, we thought it was a side effect of a high dose of Prozac and admittedly that's probably what triggered this. But now it's a whole different monster. I finally saw a sleep specialist and they ruled out sleep apnea and want to do further tests because the specialist believes I may have something more complex going on. The thing is, I now sleep in 3-4 hour chunks so they can't run a good sleep study if I don't get more sleep consecutively. So the doc put me on 2mg Lunesta.

I've taken it for 3 nights now and I wake up super groggy, but I also still only sleep in 3-4 hour chunks. I'll admit that the chucks of sleep seem more restorative, but it's hard to tell with the grogginess. It's gotten to where all I do on the weekends is sleep around the clock because I'm just so exhausted. I got to work today with such terrible brain fog that I just stared at my computer for a few hours. After an iced coffee with extra espresso, my prescribed dose of Ritalin, and an Alani I am finally able to string two sentences together. Now the nausea is kicking my ass.

Will it always be like this? Or is there a transitionary period that I should wait these side effects out for?",1,1750709686.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False
