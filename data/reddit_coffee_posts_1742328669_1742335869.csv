1jehdzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jehdzk/my_mil_told_me_shes_been_battling_the_tail_end_of/,My MIL told me she’s been battling the “tail end” of her flu for weeks while visiting. I’m 14 weeks pregnant.,"I get sick, and I mean really sick 3 days after she’s gotten here. I stay in bed instead of hanging out and she finds out I’m sick and tells me she’s been battling the flu or some sort of sickness for weeks but is at the end of it.. and tops it off with “hope you didn’t get anything though”

My pregnancy is already stressful and I’ve already had 3 losses in the past so I’m just pissed off that she came here knowing everything. 

My husband has had enough and has since told her she’s going to be returning back to her house early and how pissed he is about it. He bought her an early ticket back. 

She’s pouting and honestly I don’t care. The last few days have been hell with her. My husband has been handling the bull shit though when she’s said insane stuff to me… like 

1. Telling me, who is mixed; that she’s surprised the name we picked out for our daughter wasn’t Shaniqua when we picked out Valerie (just a beautiful name) and middle name Nicole (my sister is my best friend and that’s her name). Hello racism though lol. 

2. Has been on my ass saying I’m not doing enough for the pregnancy and guilting me for having a small coffee or soda 

3. Comments about my clothes nonstop, apparently new mothers can’t wear tank tops because they are too revealing! 

4. Hears my stepdad on FaceTime with me earlier and he was cussing a lot (just how he talks and he’s hilarious) and tells me she’s hopes “her baby” isn’t around him at all. Mind you, my stepdad has been constant in my life since I was 3, and even stepped up when my mom wasn’t around. We are extremely close. 

Luckily my husband handled it all. He has better tact than me because my response to all of this was about to be me catching a charge. The only reason we’ve been nicer is because his little brother came with her, him and my husband are so close, and rarely see each other. If it had just been her, it would have been different, but to us this trip of them coming was all about little brother. He’s the sweetest cutest kid. 

I’m just mad. I hate this woman. I love my husband for cutting her trip short after everything. 

She calls herself a *boy mom* and does everything to act like one with my husband and then throws the biggest fit when he calls it out or doesn’t play into it

That is all. This woman is too much. ",1,1742335675.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False

1jehcpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1jehcpv/what_would_you_expect_after_a_pretty_terrible/,What would you expect after a pretty terrible stay at a luxury hotel?,"We spent one night at an Auberge property and pretty much every opportunity there was for service was a miss. To make matters worse we were planning on getting married at this property and had already toured it twice and were about to sign the contract.

Here’s a quick rundown of what happened:

* The reservations team told us they’d call at a specific time to collect payment details but never did.
* During check in we were told dog beds and bowls would be sent to our room. They never arrived and a few hours later when we asked for them, only the beds arrived.
* Since the reservations team knew we were celebrating our engagement, we were a little surprised that there wasn’t even a small acknowledgment in our room—something as simple as a note would have made a big difference.
* When we went put our names down for dinner they told us they couldn’t find our room reservation, and instead wrote down our number and told us we’d get a call when the table was ready. After an hour of waiting, we called the front desk and were told they were checking on our reservation. We never heard anything back and after another hour passed we went over in person—there were plenty of open tables, and no one had any record of us on the waitlist. The staff was very apologetic, but nothing else was done to make up for the mistake.
* During dinner, a staff member (maybe a manager) came by and when he found out we were celebrating our engagement said he’d be sending out a special dessert, which never came.
* The next morning, we went to the café, and while our coffees came out, our actual breakfasts were forgotten.
* When we were leaving, there was no one at valet, and we had to wait about 10 minutes and finally just got our own car.

I understand that hotels can have off days and that mistakes happen. However, given the level of service Auberge is known for and the investment we’re making in our wedding, these repeated misses were surprising. I will say both times I went to this property for tours of the wedding venue the service was fantastic, and everyone I've talked to who has gotten married there raves about it.

I'll be reaching out to our events contact today to discuss the situation. My question is, what would you expect the hotel to do rectify the situation? No need to comment that we should find another venue. That's definitely an option as well, but I'm curious what I should expect or if anyone has ever been in a similar situation.",1,1742335583.0,LuxuryTravel,0,1.0,False
1jehcbc,https://i.redd.it/j8amies4uipe1.png,The Nightmare of the Red Grave.,"A terrific chain of events fell in the darkness of the latest night in 3:40 AM. A local stinky and filthy businessman with an anonymous origin, no money, in a red coat he had probably taken from scrapyard, had been spotted entering the club and bringing the chaos upon people's souls. ""I can't... He really did this..."" — one of the witnesses reported — ""I'm scared of the dark future of this city"".  
  
Our investigation group arrived to the place in time and checked the cameras for more information. In 3:40:12 AM we can notice a man mentioned above entering the building, looking around, raising a finger and yelling ""ONE!"". The disastrous impact of the joyful scream from the psychopath caused an intensed and immediate reaction from customers, forcing them to run in circles and hide. ""I was trembling, when he was there. Every second felt like an hour"" — says one of our group's member, coffee machine, unluckily being among victims of the tragedy — ""he had yelled at me ONE so hard I had accidentally pissed double espresso instead of cappuccino"".  
  
Gladly, the police was there too so we could listen to the chief's opnion: ""Ugh, yes, it's not the first case of this happening. Before we had the same precedent of a very nervous teen with a bit of punk attitude swearing in Spanish at people. Rumors say he had a large moustache under his nose, as if he tried all his best to summon a sombrero on his head with such a ritual, which failed miserably. But we recommend you stay at home and don't leave it, or you might see his finger raised above your nose and hear the «ONE!!!» from this... Prostate exam maniac.""  
  
We also asked his brother what were his thoughts on what had happened. ""I was just fooling around with my dearest brother... I never thought he could... Count"" — our mass genocide expert, Vergil, said.  
  
See how our investigation ends next week. Will we stop him before he learns arithmetics or be counted EVEN by him?

1jeh439,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1jeh439/starbucks_ordered_to_pay_50_million_after/,Starbucks Ordered to Pay $50 Million After Delivery Driver Suffers Severe Burns,"*A* Los Angeles County jury has awarded $50 million in damages to Michael Garcia, a delivery driver who suffered third-degree burns from a hot tea spill at a Starbucks drive-thru. The verdict comes after a years-long legal battle over the coffee giant’s handling of scalding beverages and sets a new precedent for similar cases.

Garcia, who regularly picked up orders for delivery services, alleged that in February 2020, a Starbucks employee handed him a cup of hot tea without securing the lid. When the cup spilled, the liquid caused severe burns to his hands, arms, and legs. Court documents detail how Garcia endured multiple skin graft surgeries and now faces permanent injuries that impact his ability to work.

“The jury sent a clear message that companies serving dangerously hot liquids have a responsibility to ensure customer and worker safety,” Garcia’s attorney said in a statement following the ruling. Starbucks, which argued in court that the spill resulted from an accident rather than negligence, has not announced whether it plans to appeal.

This case echoes other high-profile lawsuits involving hot beverage spills. The most famous occurred in 1992, when Stella Liebeck successfully sued McDonald's after suffering third-degree burns from their coffee, leading to a landmark product liability case. However, Garcia’s $50 million award is **25 times higher** than past related settlements, seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dEuKT8qYj2jR7iVkZbceZPVZjFNgvlBrtC4G-lkeyw4/edit?usp=sharing), setting a **new legal precedent** that businesses should take seriously. Reports indicate Starbucks had the opportunity to settle for **$3 million** but chose to take the case to trial.

The case also highlights the importance of **worker safety training** in the food and beverage industry. Experts say comprehensive training programs on proper handling of hot beverages, securing lids, and ensuring safe hand-offs can significantly reduce risks for both employees and customers. Workplace safety advocates argue that consistent reinforcement of safety protocols can help prevent similar incidents, protecting workers and avoiding costly legal battles for businesses.

Legal analysts suggest that this ruling could **increase the risk for businesses facing similar lawsuits**, pushing companies to reassess their safety measures, employee training, and settlement strategies. The verdict underscores the growing expectations for corporate responsibility and the potential financial consequences of neglecting safety protocols.

i was with my (now ex) boyfriend for a year, and for about two months we were in long distance (which was to continue). during our time apart, i started my first year of uni and moved into halls, so i was making alot of friends and socialised a lot. after about two-three weeks, he broke up with me via a pdf letter (he said he didn’t have the courage to do it over call). 

the reasons he gave, i feel, are absolutely ridiculous. probably the most lamest reasons for a break up. 

about four days after the break up, we decided to talk over the phone. he said that in long distance, while i was going out and having fun with my new friends, he felt like a ghost from the past. he felt like he wasn’t a real person anymore, and every weekend he’d face the fact that i’d go out with them, and he’d be in the corner with nothing to say. 

some of these friends were guys, but i’d hang out with them in a group, and with my girl friends as well. we’d go out and play pool, go ice skating, etc. I had reassured him that I didn’t have feelings for any of them, and if I was to find out that any of them had feelings for me, I would be quick to end the friendship. mind you, there were two guys i’d hang out with regularly in a group, with one having a girlfriend, and the other i told him i was sure if anything, was interested in my friend and not me, (i should also add, that he himself has friends that are girls. during our relationship he’d sometimes go out for coffee one on one with her. another girl he meet up with one on one during long distance. i do believe that both of them are just his friends, so i showed him my trust). 

and so in his mind, the right thing to do was to let me go, because he couldn’t be there for me in “the way i deserved” anymore. he said i deserved someone that could give the same energy back to me, closer in my vicinity, somebody more attuned to me. he said he couldn’t be, because he felt like “death was inevitable.”

i told him i truly have no idea where he got any of this from, because i never saw it this way, only he did. i feel like the break up is being put on me, where this is about “doing the right thing for me” but i never felt like this was the right thing ??? i seriously have no idea where he got that from ??

so i asked if he believed i deserved better then why couldn’t he have been better (because honestly yeah in long distance he hadn’t been that great). he said he’d lost all will to become better, because he couldn’t bare me being around these guys, so he’d just sit there and show his disapproval, so it was right for me to move on.

uhh i don’t understand because this is just normal life. that was just me making friends, and doesn’t mean anything to me, even now. 

am i right to say that his jealousy killed the relationship? or idk just self sabotage ?

he ends it with saying “you deserve the best and it’s not me, you were so good to me, but i feel the best way to repay you is to let you go.”  brah and saying that he still loves me and wants to remain friends ??? 

PLS SOMEONE GIVE ME ADVICE I AM JUST BEWILDERED.. also the break up was four days ago :((

extra notes 
- this is not because of the appearance of another girl in his life, so yay

- our families always had issues (my dad didn’t approve of him and his family would tell him to leave because he shouldn’t stay where he is not welcome) - to evaluate more on this, he explained that my dad’s disapproval had weighed heavy on him throughout the relationship. he said he believed we both deserved to have someone who our families cherish. i do understand him on this front, but he did say this was “the reason we don’t work” but “not the reason he left at this point in time” ",2,1742334897.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Like, I've seen probably a hundred thousand women in my life, but none even came close to how beautiful she was.
The first times I made eye contact with her, I got beet red. The last time this happened with a girl I just met was in Kindergarten, and that was 14 years ago.

Turns out this store was hiring, and I don't like my current boss, so I decided, ""Hey, why not?"" and applied. The pay is lousy and I was forced to work in the back while she works in the front, but I couldn't have been happier. I didn't have to talk to her and could build up a resistance to her beauty (yes beauty she is the beautiful)

I learn a lot from our little conversations we end up having, found out we have a lot in common, and even have a Spotify playlist together. But now that we've gotten this close, I wonder if this is some crazy, elaborate manipulation to date this girl and I could be ruining what she thinks is just a normal friendship.

As someone who's had friends confess to them, I know it feels awful afterwards on the recieving end. It feels as though the entire friendship was a lie, and I know I'm doing the exact same thing to her. Now that we're friends, I feel awful for being her friend just to date her. Anything more than friends feels like it would be manipulative at this point and I worry that any signals I think I'm getting from her that she's interested may be wrong and I could now lose both my friend and job.

1jegyj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jegyj1/wtaf_is_wrong_with_me/,WTAF is wrong with me,"Going to try and keep this brief, but for the entirety of my life, I have dealt with some mysterious health issue(s) that have come and go, which, most prominently, completely zap my ability to think and concentrate on anything. One thing important to note is that my wellbeing and mental acuity seems to have always been closely tied to my cardiovascular health i.e. in the times of my best health, when I felt my best, my cardio system was also supercharged, I felt very clean and clear, with the capacity to really push myself.

For background, I am a 28 YO male, I'm in very good shape, workout 4-5 times a week, lift weights, run, etc. However due to mysterious health issues I have never quite felt as if I was living up to my full potential. I take Vitamin D3/K2 drops, multivitamins, creatine, fish oil, and whey protein. Additionally, I have to take adderall in order to focus due to my ADHD-like symptoms, I absolutely hate it and candidly it's not all that effective for me after Monday/Tuesday in the week but it is unfortunately necessary to function in my career (finance).

When I was in college, I discovered Dr. Josh Axe and Bulletproof while trying to figure out what was wrong with me - I suffered from horrible brain fog, anxiety, etc. that totally handcuffed my ability to succeed as a person both socially and academically in the ways I knew I could. Fortunately for me, my mom is a yoga teacher and has a background in holistic medicine, so I had advanced knowledge in how to go about researching health issues, the benefits of supplements, eating well, etc. Throughout the course of my junior year, I discovered Candida, I began taking anti-fungal supplements e.g. clove oil and oregano oil, eating very clean and avoiding sugars and carbs, etc. and I also got into the habit of fasting. Now, weirdly enough, before I began eating clean and began taking the anti-fungal supplements, when I tried fasting, I felt absolutely nothing - just starving, wired, shaky. Once I began this anti-Candida protocol, whenever I'd fast, my body would enter into this hyper focused, energetic state and for the first time in my entire life I could focus without prescription stimulants. Coincidentally, when I would mix in a fast or two per week, only drinking coffee and water, it seemed to really benefit my cardiovascular system; the runs I went on were incredible, I could really feel all of the blood pumping throughout my body, it was incredible. I went on to do very well in school and this lasted about 8-9 months, in which I got the best grades I had ever gotten before and I felt just totally clear mentally and completely in control, until I started getting lazy with my diet, drinking more (I was in college, after all), and one day I woke up and it was just... gone. I felt like Bradley Cooper in Limitless after he had run out of NZT 48. Whenever I would try running, it just wasn't the same, even if the workout itself was the same; there was a profound difference in the pump I was getting, I would barely even sweat despite very much physically exerting myself.

One of the things that has always weirdly stood out to me throughout my health journey is that during times of good health, whenever I would drink coffee, like during the time I described above, it seemed to absolutely kick my ass in a good way; hours of energy, good mood, increased libido, etc. and it also made me go to the bathroom routinely and almost immediately. It's almost as if my digestive system was clearer? And able to more granularly digest what I was consuming? In times of poor health (like the last several years), coffee did absolutely nothing for me, it was just anxious energy in a cup which had no positive impacts, in fact, it made me feel tired, run-down, and I usually would feel absolutely terrible the day after drinking it.

Now, I have taken antifungals intermittently since, not as harshly as I did the first time, and generally eat very healthy - although I'm not great at altogether avoiding carbs and do indulge on sugar in the form of fruits, but I haven't been able to reach anything close the level of clarity I once had. In the spring of 2019, I randomly, after spending hours and hours in the gym, as I was about to graduate and only in 9 credit hours, I randomly worked my way out of this - no idea how, but I ate a very normal diet and suddenly coffee worked for me, I was able to focus, and I felt so strong physically when running and lifting. Notably, I started having very regular bowel movements, and my digestive system just felt ""lighter"" compared to the normal bloated feeling I usually have (even when fasting I rarely actually feel hungry). Of course, western med doctors have just suggested I try to eat more fiber (which I have) and it had little to no impact. Unfortunately, while fully employed, it is not practical nor possible, especially working in finance, to workout 2-3 hours per day.

The last number of years I have been in a complete rut - while I appear to be in great shape physically, do okay at work, and eat relatively healthy, I don't feel anywhere near my best. I am reliant on adderall to focus, which usually doesn't work at all by the middle of the work week, I can't drink coffee, I do cardio but don't recognize any of the amazing benefits I've had from it in the past, fasting does nothing for me, etc. The primary issue here is my lack of mental clarity; the ADHD symptoms which I know are directly tied to whatever health issue(s) I am having.

I've run scenarios in my head thousands of time, trying to figure out what went wrong, what I need to do to fix this, trying reverse engineer the things I was doing right, etc. and I have no idea so I figured I would ask Reddit. Does anybody have any clue what is wrong with me? Recognize any symptoms? Relate to any symptoms? Is it Candida? SIBO? Why the difference in how it feels digesting/drinking coffee? Why do I never feel hungry? Why does fasting not work for me like it once did?

He has spent his time after college getting settled into a good job with hopes of eventually marrying and being able to support a family. In the meantime he's heavily involved in church and volunteers a lot of his time in various ministries and is plugged into a good bible study/community group of other young adults.

Recently he asked out a friend's sister on a date. My son already socialized somewhat with this family as he and this family are all involved in the same ministries and everyone in his friend group noticed they were growing friendlier. He was happy she said yes.

But then during the date he learned this girl (and her parents) have all these rules. No physical contact at all (no hand holding, cuddling, kissing) until marriage.  No engagement until at least 2 years. My son also devoted to purity but this was extreme to him.Then the dad grilled my son on all sorts of things, pointing out little things (some negative) he's noticed about our family. It was strange since they literally just had coffee to visit?Turns out this dad is well known by the elders of being a big legalist and a previous suitor of this gal was also overwhelmed by the legalistic response (pointing out his sins). I am really concerned for my son because in spite of sort of liking this girl he's feeling like he wants no part of this situation as a casual ""get to know you"" coffee date has now turned into an inquisition. 

I don't know how to handle this as I feel my son and this girl (also mid-20's) are godly adults who should navigate this relationship on their own. But now that this father has brought up criticisms of even us I am feeling defensive (we too are involved in ministries) and have a negative few of them.  I am afraid my son is going to get stuck feeling he has to defend himself against their confrontations of his ""sins"" and will get sucked into this legalism.

This all started when I was 19. A woman had a 20-year-old son who wanted to get married, and she wanted me as his potential wife (her friend had told her about me since we have mutual acquaintances). My mom started talking to the guy’s mother, getting to know her, and giving her hope that I would be okay with marrying her son—even though my mom never even discussed it with me. She visited the woman, spent time with her, and had coffee together.

I knew what was happening, but I felt extremely uncomfortable. I wasn’t ready for a relationship. I had just started university and was struggling mentally—I cried multiple times a month, gained weight, and was dealing with the loneliness of the pandemic.

Naturally, I was angry that my mom was making all these plans behind my back without even asking if I was ready for marriage. One day, she suddenly told me everything and said that the guy’s mother was coming to our house and that I had to meet her. I was furious—how could she do all of this without even considering whether I wanted to get married?

In the end, I was forced to meet his mom because “it would be rude to turn her away.” After that, my mom declined the proposal, but I was still frustrated that everyone—including my older sister, who is seven years older than me—knew about it before I did. They only told me at the last minute and forced me to meet the guy’s mom.

After that incident, I made it very clear that I wasn’t ready for marriage and that nothing should happen behind my back—nothing.

More Interference

Then came another woman my mom had met during Hajj the summer before I started university. My mom took me to visit her to congratulate her daughter-in-law on having a baby and her daughter on getting engaged. While there, she started talking about me—saying that I had many potential suitors but refused to meet them.

I was annoyed but didn’t say anything until we were on our way home. I told my mom it was completely unnecessary to bring that up, and she and my sister (who was also there) told me I was overreacting. They claimed they only said it so the woman wouldn’t think I was jealous of her daughter’s engagement.

That woman then took it as a sign to start sending random men our way.

I kept rejecting them because I wasn’t ready to get married and was extremely overwhelmed with my studies. My mom kept pressuring me to meet them, but I refused. I didn’t see the point in meeting someone I had no intention of marrying. Most of these men weren’t even religious.

One time, I told my mom to ask the woman if the guy even prayed, and she responded, “He’ll learn after marriage” (the women told my mom that). I told my mom that was ridiculous, but then she backtracked and said, “I never said that. Do you think I’d accept a son-in-law who doesn’t pray?”

I told my mom that this woman she trusted was incredibly disrespectful for sending me men who weren’t even religious, expecting them to “fix themselves” later. My mom and sister dismissed my concerns, saying she meant well and thought things would “work out.” She even lied about men’s backgrounds—saying someone had studied engineering when he had only completed high school.

Eventually, I told my mom that I would never accept a man sent by this woman.

One time, my mom and this woman even planned for me to meet a guy without telling me. My mom had been pressuring me to go with her for coffee, so I finally agreed. When we arrived, I saw that she had brought along a guy (with his mother) that I had already told her to reject.

Right away, I could tell we wouldn’t be compatible. We sat down for coffee, and my mom ended up paying for everyone’s drinks because the guy didn’t even offer. Later, I looked him up on social media and saw that he was nothing like my family—he had female friends, went to restaurants that served alcohol, attended festivals, etc.

Thankfully, they never contacted us again. During the coffee meet-up, the guy left after a few minutes, and it was mostly his mom talking to the woman my mom knew. But once again, I was furious that my mom went behind my back.

Other men were sent my way, and I continued rejecting them because they were completely different from me, and I wasn’t emotionally ready. I was struggling too much to even consider getting to know someone.

Then, last year, another potential match came along. My mom claimed a woman at the mosque had asked about me. This time, I wasn’t entirely against the idea—I was open to it, and my mom knew that.

I asked her, “What do you know about him and his family?” and she replied, “I know nothing. You’ll have to meet him and ask yourself.”

But then I saw a text she sent to my sister saying, “I need to plan this better so she says yes.” I also saw her sending my sister all the information about him—despite telling me she knew nothing.

(When my sister was getting married, I wasn’t told anything before her. I barely even got to see a picture of her husband. But now, my sister gets pictures of the guy and all the information before I do. When I brought this up to my sister, she said, ‘Do you think we mean you harm? Stop thinking like that about us.’ I told her that I don’t care about that—I just want to be involved from the beginning. But then she said, ‘You always reject them anyway and get angry.’ This is because they never accept it when I simply say I’m not interested. Instead, I have to give them a long explanation, even though I’ve already said I’m not ready.)

I was furious. I pulled my dad aside and told him I wouldn’t tolerate anything marriage-related being done behind my back. I said that since it concerns me, I should be involved from the start. I told him that if I even suspect she’s withholding information in the future, I’ll end everything immediately. He promised to talk to her.

That’s when I also found out she had sent a picture of me to the guy without asking me first. Eventually, they lost interest. My mom first claimed she had rejected them, but it turned out they weren’t interested after the guy prayed Istikhara and felt it wasn’t right. I was furious—this was near the end of university, and I was finally okay with considering marriage, but once again, my mom had done things behind my back.

At this point, I felt like I could never trust my mom when it came to these things because she always lied about small details.

After that, my mom brought up another potential match and asked, “So, are you rejecting him too? Just tell me what I should say to the woman so people stop sending men my way. I’m tired of rejecting them on your behalf.”

I was actually open to the idea this time, but she refused to answer any of my questions about the guy’s family, like what his father did for a living. She just kept insisting, “Stop playing games, just tell me what to say to reject him.”

I lost it. I’m not proud of it, but I yelled, “Do you even understand me? I told you for four years that I didn’t want to get married while I was studying, yet you kept pressuring me to meet men I didn’t want. And you constantly lied about things! And guess what? Every single man you pushed me to meet turned out to be unsuitable anyway.”

My mom just responded, “I don’t understand what you want.”

Recently, another potential match came along. At first, everything seemed okay—we exchanged pictures and information. Then, his mom called and said, “If everything looks good, maybe they can meet soon.”

My mom panicked and said, “I haven’t talked to my daughter yet, let me ask her.” even though I had already said I was fine with it.

They ended up ghosting us. Later, I found out that this guy had physically assaulted his sister (She was bleeding) when they were teenagers (at 17/18 years old) because she was with a guy. The incident happened at a train station, and it was well-known in their city.

When I told my mom, she brushed it off, saying, “We shouldn’t have exchanged pictures, you should’ve just met him.”

At this point, I just feel like I can’t trust my mom. She lies and manipulates situations because she wants me to get married, and I think she’s embarrassed that one of her daughters is still single. Now that I’ve graduated, I don’t even know what she’ll try next.

Honestly, I don’t even want to meet anyone anymore because of all this.

I’m someone who likes to take things slow and not rush into anything. I’m very particular about who I want to be with because I live in a non-Muslim country, and it’s important who the father of my children will be. I don’t want to get married just for the sake of marriage—I want my husband to also be my best friend.

But after everything that has happened, I find this whole process exhausting. Anything related to marriage makes me feel bad, and I’ve almost started accepting the idea of living alone. Which is unfortunate because that was never what I wanted. I was simply going through a difficult period, and instead of understanding me, people kept pressuring me to meet potential matches.",1,1742334022.0,MuslimCorner,1,1.0,False

1. Should I offer to pick her up? It’s still pretty early on so I don’t want to make her uncomfortable by asking. 

2. We didn’t really have any physical contact after the first date. I do regret this and want to make sure I change it next time around should I try and kiss her at the end of the date, or should I just go for a hug. Obviously this is situational and assuming it goes well, if I do end up picking her up holding hands is probably on the table as well. 

3. Should I plan something after supper as well, like getting a coffee? This would work a lot better if we drove there together, I’d imagine driving separately to different place wouldn’t be as good.

We could chat about the existential dread of misfiled documents, debate the merits of office coffee (the correct answer is 'desperate necessity'), or, if the mood strikes, engage in some delightfully naughty banter that would make a Victorian accountant blush.
However, let's be clear: I'm not here for a one-sided PowerPoint presentation. I need someone who can volley wit like a pro, not just lob conversational softballs. If you're going to ghost me after two messages, just send a carrier pigeon with a 'sorry, my keyboard exploded' note and save us both the trouble.

I'm looking for genuine humans, or at least convincing robots with a good sense of humor and knowledge of the company intranet.
Let's build a digital playground of witty repartee, shared laughter, and maybe a little bit of delicious mischief. Who knows, we might even accidentally have a meaningful conversation amidst the chaos of unanswered emails.

He came home and temporarily strung it up with wire and we took it to the shop after dinner. On Friday it was in the shop, and Saturday I asked if they had reached out to him, he said no but then realized they had texted him saying it is unfixable, (and recommended not driving) until I get body work done ( surprise surprise a 19th salty winter ate the shit out of the frame) 
Or I should scrap it. Either way we could come pick it up...

Saturday evening on a walk in the neighborhood while the kids rode bikes, I asked my husband if we could go to the grocery store for a few things and get dinner on our way to get the van. He said I should just pick something up for dinner and bring it home after I had the van and he took the kids back in their carseats in his car.
I made the trip to Moe's alone in my jaloppy and ordered our 4 meals(steak for Husband steak for daughter veg for son and tofu for me). When I came home, we all ate our borrito bowlss and taco's together and discussed getting a new car vs. repairing mine which is worth less than the repair will probably cost as well as how he needs to get her from her afterschool functions while he has his car at work...

Sunday we had scheduled as our St.Patricks day dinner so we didnt have to do it on a school night and I spend the entire afternoon prepping the meal... then my daughter felt Ill and went to bed at 4:30pm without dinner.

 There I was with half cooked Tangy Red Cabbage and Green Apple Salad, half cooked Stovies with bacon and a Corned Beef that had been in the oven for 2 out of 3 hours...

I stopped cooking as we didn't want her to miss out on the special meal, and the rest of us ate... I dont even remember but... leftovers.

Later that night she puked. 

Monday (St. Patrick's Day) she stayed home from school  with a temp of 102, ate soup sparingly and had plain pasta noodles for dinner, While the rest of us ate ours with tomato sauce, and the Corned Beef and sides sat in the fridge.
She still had a temp. 
My husband slept on the couch to be closer to her room on the 1st floor if she needed him. 

Tuesday morning, my son ran out of his room and hugged me good morning. As I changed his diaper I saw red sauce on his pjs, but he hadn't been wearing the pjs at dinner...

I walked into his room to a massacre. Piles of vomited-upon stuffed animals and blankets throughout the room...

I started cleaning up what I could into a hamper and figuring out how he would take a bath while I scrapped vomit out of the carpet. My husband came up and took the hamper...

Apparently he had also gotten whatever it is and was taking a sick day after throwing up 3 times that night. (And another time after his morning coffee)

We are still not sure if it was something they ate from Moe's that I didnt, or something she picked up from school, but so far I haven't been affected. 

Well... I am prepping the Corned beef and Cabbage salad and stovie potatoes for dinner tonight (March 18th) because... well if I don't cook it, it will all go to waste.

We still have chicken noodle soup and plain pasta noodles left over from the previous 2 days lunches and dinners if they don't feel they can handle the meal, but I really want the Corned beef and sides I spent 5 hrs prepping...

I am stuck in the cycle.

I have admitted to myself that I am an alcoholic semi-recently and I am finding it very hard to find the willpower to stop.

A day in the life:

  
The abrupt jolt of waking early with a foggy head and regret from the day prior. My brain immediately calls for my ""Morning coffee"", which is a shot of vodka just to level out the shakes and regulate my brain chemistry. After that first drink, relief. I can finally get out of bed, trundle to my bathroom and start my ""day"". I watch TV for an hour or so before opening my work laptop and checking emails and messages. The day starts once again. The first shot wears off and my aching body desires another to keep the monster at bay. I work throughout the day consistently drinking while working from my room. I join meetings, complete my tasks and am respected by my co-workers who are oblivious to my condition. I know I should not be working from home with my volatile condition. When the leftover drinks from the night before go, I find one of the many liquor stores in the area that I haven't gone to in a few days (they all know me by name). I know that I have to quit. I want to quit more than anything, but there is some demon in my head that says just one more every hour of every day. It is ruining my body, my finances, and my entire life. I am full of shame and regret & I want to live my life without this horrible addiction.

  
I thought I was already quite bad but I feel recently that things are slipping further and further down the rabbit hole. I want to stop making excuses why I cant drive my loved ones around. I want to start saving for a house with my partner. I want to remove my debt, and I want this all to stop.

  
Any advice would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you in advance and soon I hope that I will be posting daily IWNDWYTD <3",1,1742333035.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

I’ve been at this ""job"" for about two weeks now, and guess what? STILL waiting for my physical card. In the meantime, I'm using the glorious digital card, which—surprise!—is apparently only accepted in *some* locations. So, naturally, my batch availability is *super* limited. Because, apparently, I'm not trusted to have real, grown-up access to the world of shopping deliveries. 

I’ve managed to snag exactly two batches so far, and I gotta say, they were both just… *something*. First customer? No tip. Second customer? No tip. The first one had me bring 30+ items inside, unpack them, and put them on her counter.  Not a ""thank you"" in sight. The second lady didn’t want bags—cool, no problem. So, I leave all her stuff on her front doorstep – like she asked. Guess what? No tip. Because apparently, delivering groceries on a cold winter day is just *what we do* for fun now.  I’m starting to think that ""Instacart Shopper"" is just a fancy term for ""unpaid delivery servant.

And let’s talk about the batches themselves. I’m making a whopping *$8* per batch, and that’s before the *generous* bonus of zero dollars in tips. WHO are these people that don’t tip?  Am I supposed to just be happy with my $8, doing *literally* all the work while they sip their coffee inside, chuckling at how I’m on my knees praying for a tip?

Oh, and my absolute favorite part: The hours of waiting. Hours. Just sitting there, like some desperate, digital ghost. I refresh my app every 30 seconds, willing a batch to come through. It’s like stalking someone but with less dignity and more parking lot. I move closer to what the app *promises* will be a good batch, only to end up hanging out in a sketchy lot, looking like I’m about to make a shady deal or be featured on a true crime podcast.

And before anyone says ""you don't have to do this you know"" or ""if you don't like it just get something else"".....newsflash - I'm fully aware of all of this, but needs must.  So yeah - there's that.

1jeg2un,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jeg2un/figures_in_the_mist/,Figures in the Mist,"I’m not entirely sure why I responded so quickly to the email I received from work that day. Maybe it’s because I wasn’t thinking straight or because I desperately needed a change, but when my job with the Maine national parks service requested a lighthouse keeper for a few months I applied immediately. Usually the lighthouses on the rocky cliffs of Maine were automated but this particular one was damaged and now needed someone to make sure it continued running while the replacement parts were shipped in. The lead time was anywhere from 2 to 6 months but that didn’t bother me. The truth is I just needed to get away. Away from anything familiar, anything that would remind me of the emptiness I have been feeling. So once the approval came in I started packing anything I thought was vital for the extended stay at the light station. The location was isolated to say the least, at least 15 miles from the nearest town, the only way in or out was on a poorly kept dirt road engulfed in a sea of pine trees.  So I packed accordingly, warm clothes, my laptop, park issued radio just in case my phone lost reception and of course our dog Rook. I had nobody to watch the poor boy and I felt bad leaving him in a boarding facility so he was coming too. With all the creature comforts I could fit in the bed of my old beaten down ford ranger and Rook in the passenger seat as co pilot I began the winding 3 hour drive. 

Rook got comfortable and passed out pretty quickly, he was a greater Swiss mountain dog and loved his car rides. He was pretty old, blind in one eye and a little lumpy but he was my wife’s dog before we got married. She babied him so of course he was a little spoiled. I remember that she told me that if I didn’t look after him as good as she did then he was trained to poo in my shoes. We both shared what felt like a rare moment of lighthearted laughter, punctuated by a solemn, knowing silence that quickly fell over us. We held hands silently after that as the beeping of monitors that crowded the room droned on. I snapped myself out of it, trying not to think about how things had turned out only a month ago. I gave rook a gentle pat as the gloomy sky darkened with the setting sun and we came to our turnoff down the muddy road. The trees seemed to stretch endlessly in all directions and the giant evergreens seemed to cup the road like a child trying to hold a bug in their hands. The forest was so dense that until you came to the clearing where the lighthouse was, you wouldn’t have even known the ocean was there. 

I put the car in park and I looked out at the overgrown lot. “Some job we  did with upkeep on this place” I thought. The grass was tall and overgrown and the paint on the lighthouse was chipping off in huge pieces. Clearly none of the rangers or staff have been here to do maintenance in what seemed like a year or two. And of course the light itself hadn’t been turned on yet which was first on my list of duties to complete before the sun set. I opened the door for Rook to hop out of the car and he followed behind me, sniffing the plants and shrubbery as we made our way to the entrance. The lighthouse was run down but still boasted living quarters in the form of a small colonial style house adjacent to the front of the towering spire that warned mariners of the coastline. The house was white with cedar plank siding that was definitely in need of repair, the paneling missing and strewn across the front of the home. The lighthouse was concrete, painted white with a black stripe along the center. Three tall rectangular windows adorned the side of the tower spaced every ten feet above the next giving you a spectacular view of the ocean as you ascended. The structure itself was poised about twenty feet back from the cliff face. Waves broke incessantly on the rocks jutting out of the sea, the loud crashing of the impact is always followed by the low hissing of the sea foam as it melts back into the water, creating an oceanic symphony that would play on repeat for the next few months. 

I walked behind the home and up to the lighthouse, the heavy steel door locked up tight. The lock is rusted and it fights me as I try to turn the old key until with a loud clunk it gives way, opening with a metallic creak that echoes off the walls. I try the light switch to my right and to my amazement the dim room is immediately flooded with light from a singular bulb above the door. In the center of the room is an old iron circular staircase and as I ascend higher and higher the walls close in as the tower tapers for structural integrity. Above the entryway is a storeroom for spare parts and tools. Above that is the power room with thick conduit rising through the floor connecting to a huge motor. Emblazoned on to the side of the machine is the start up process. It takes a couple of seconds to prime but once it’s ready it roars to life. Gears connecting to the motor that shoot up into the next room grind forward, rotating like the gears of a clock. I follow them up another two floors into the lantern room where the large lamp is now burning brightly and spinning at a nice steady pace. I take a moment to admire the engineering of the old technology and the large lens that focuses the light into a concentrated beam that cuts through the night sky. The low hum of the generator is almost blocked out by the heavy concrete floor as it vibrates with the machinery. I step out onto the gallery deck, the cold autumn wind now whipping through my hair as I look out over the ocean. What was once a rich and bright copper viewing platform was now an oxidized green and splattered with years of seagull droppings while a rusted weathervane creaked stiffly in the breeze. I looked out over the ocean as a blanket of fog is blown lazily in towards the shore. It was going to be a long night so I had better get settled in. I made my way back down the stairs to see Rook resting his head on the bottom rung of the steps. I gave him a few good pats as we both headed back outside to see the state of the house. 

As we make our way up to the front I notice one of the panes of glass on the front door is smashed in. Probably some stupid kids doing some “urban exploration”. The next thing I notice is a smell, the putrid smell of decay. I cover my nose with my hand and I turn the old brass doorknob allowing the door to creak open. I peek inside and the house is a complete mess. I get to add tidying the place up to my already long list of work. Rook, wining behind me, tears inside as door opens. “Hey get back here” I call after him as I chase the old dog inside. The smell is strong, my eyes begin watering as I make my way to the kitchen where I hear a loud crunching noise. To my shock I see Rook chewing on the carcass of what looks to be a rabbit. He swallows the darn thing down before I can even get to him. I grab him by the collar and take in my surroundings. There are the bones of small animals everywhere. Animal pelts hanging from the ceiling as they dry over pools of coagulated blood. The pungent smell assaults my senses as I dragged rook to the back door and tied him up outside  so he didn’t eat any more rodents. 

“Some idiot must be using this place as their own personal hunting lodge” I thought. With a sigh I went out to my truck and grabbed some cleaning supplies and began throwing out everything that wasn’t tied down or a part of the decor. Bones, squirrel, rabbit, and bird carcasses and even an odd assortment of animal skulls went right out to the trash as I did my best to scrub the place clean. Disconcertingly the animals ranged in decay from bones to almost freshly killed, maybe a day or two at best. I did my best to try not to worry about the implications as I cleaned out the building. Finally after three hours of scrubbing furiously and dousing the house in febreese it no longer smelled like death. In fact without the macabre decorations the place was quite charming and the place reeked of old world charm. Sure it creaked and groaned with every step, and there was a draft the source of which I couldn’t quite find, but it was cozy nonetheless. I opened the door and brought Rook back inside just as the fog started to roll in and I brought all my things inside. After settling in and laying out Rooks bed in front of the old cast iron wood stove I headed back out to the lighthouse to make sure everything was still in good order. I threw my coat back on and pulled a beanie over my head to ward off the cold, remembering to grab my flashlight as I made my way outside. 

As I marched over the lawn I was flanked by the thick evergreen forest to my right. The sea of trees seemed just as deep, endless, and mysterious as the ocean to my left, made even more foreboding by the blanket of fog that had rolled in. The beam cast by my flashlight barely penetrated the haze and only succeeded in making the surrounding space murky as a silty puddle so I turned off my light. Now the only thing visible was the dark silhouettes of the trees that cast looming shadows in the mist and the dim light above the lighthouse door only 10 yards away. Then from the forests edge came the sharp snapping sound of a stick. I whipped my head and scanned the murky gloom that towered over me like an endless tidal wave. My blood ran cold and I was filled with the paranoia of being watched. My eyes darted back and forth into the abyssal fog as the ghastly wind swept fingers of mist swirled around my feet with each slow tentative step towards the lighthouse. With all my senses on high alert I began walking briskly towards the faint light only 10 feet away listening intently for any other signs of movement. My heart was pounding and as soon as I was close enough I lurched for the doorknob, throwing my body into it as the heavy iron door gave way and slamming behind me. I locked the deadbolt and breathed a sigh of relief. Once I gathered myself I thought “What a chicken” and chuckled wearily as I ascended the spiral staircase to the maintenance room. 

The next few hours were uneventful, greasing bearings, checking power levels, blowing the fog horn every 30 minutes or so while the fog was low over the cove. I finally went out to the deck to get some fresh air. I leaned up against the tarnished railing and let out a sigh. I was tired, and I hadn’t slept well for the past month, only getting an hour or so of sleep sporadically. I simply hadn’t been able to. After sharing a bed with someone for eight years an empty bed just felt so hallow and unnatural. There was no more warmth, comfort, or safety, only an aching lonely void that nags at you until you’re too distraught to sleep. So on most nights I would watch tv or scroll through social media to pass the lonely hours before getting up and going to work, fueled only by coffee and gas station sandwiches. The lines in my forehead got deeper and the dark circles under my eyes only darkened. I felt as though I had aged ten years in the span of a few months. At least i wouldn’t have to worry so much about sleeping at night now that I had something to keep me occupied. I looked out over the ocean and the receding fog as the sun began to come up over the horizon. I watched as the sky was washed a deep red hue and the now waking sea birds started to squawk noisily as they woke. The serine scenery gave me a fleeting sensation of calm as the brisk morning breeze fluttered against my coat. Once the sun was high enough on the horizon I started down the stairs and switched off the strobing light. 

Walking back to the house I noticed that there was a matted path of trampled grass leading from the forest to the front door, and that the trash from my hours of cleaning had been ripped into, leaving bits of garbage and decayed animal strewn across the unkempt lot. I cursed myself for being so stupid, not thinking that an animal would absolutely root through it. As I got down and began picking up scraps of trash I noticed something in the mud nearby what used to be a squirrel. It was a footprint. Not from a raccoon or a possum, I would have even been relieved if it was a bear print. Instead I saw what seemed like a partial human footprint. I looked around at the forest, scanning over every branch and bush but saw nothing in the early sunlight accept the bristling of branches in the ever darkening forest. That’s when I remembered I hadn’t checked on Rook yet. The door was locked but with that missing windowpane you could practically let yourself in. Nervously I dug around my pocket for the keys and I fumbled to get it into the lock. When the door finally opened a wave of relief washed over me as I saw the old dog right where I left him in front of the fireplace sound sleep. He was probably going blind and deaf I thought to myself as I patted him on his scruffy greying head. “Come on buddy let’s go outside” I said as he got to his feet with a huff. 
I walked with Rook as he did his business in the bushes somewhere. I was still on edge from the footprint though, watching the trees as if at any moment something or someone would spring out at me. I walked back to my truck and opened up the glove box where I had stashed my revolver. I opened up the cylinder making sure it was loaded and tucked it into my pocket so I could hide it in the house somewhere. I called for the dog and we headed back for the door, my eyes still scanning the forests edge as we went.

When I let Rook back inside the fur on his back stood up straight and he slowly crept towards the living room. He growled, ivory teeth bared which was very out of place for a friendly dog like him as he stalked his way to the corner of the living room with a seemingly violent intent. Then he began a crazed fit of barking. His eyes directed intently to the corner of the room where an old dilapidated bookshelf and antique armchair sat. His hyper fixation on the empty space was the most recent in a long list of things that made me uneasy today. I did my best to calm him down and after i got him to sit he just stared, not taking his eyes away from the corner as if he was the only one who could ward off his invisible intruder. I shook off the strange feeling I had and chocked it up to him being a little senile and made my way upstairs in hopes to get some tiny bit of sleep. It had been 24 hours without my customary hour of slumberous respite and my body was feeling the effects. I was sluggish, weary, and my eyes hung heavy on my sea salt battered face. I shed my clothes, my pants making a heavy thunk when the revolver hit the splintery hardwood floor and rolled free and as I lay in the old bed that adorned my room I took in my surroundings. This was the first time I had really had the opportunity to lie down since my arrival. The ceiling was cracked and had stains here and there from water damage, the curtains that shut out the light were dusty and reeked of mildew. Across the room above a nightstand that couldn’t have been less than two hundred years old was an oil painting of a ship. As I stared at the picture through the dim light it almost seemed as though the waves of the old beaten down brigantine keeping the ship aloft were churning right there on the canvas. I rubbed my weary eyes knowing I desperately needed to get some sleep and as I lay there on what was still mentally my side of the bed the feeling of ever increasing isolation welled up within me. My hand drifted to the empty pillow across the mattress longing for what was only to be embraced by the cold sting of disappointment. I rubbed my now glassy eyes again, trying not to focus on the pain or the memories flooding back of the hospital bed that held my wife’s withering body. I tried not to think of the doctor’s solemn face as he relayed the earth shattering news that would haunt us for months. I tried as hard as I could not to think about the weak smile of the woman I held dear as she slipped off into the dark uncaring void of eternal unconsciousness while I could only watch helplessly. I lay there in silence for what felt like an agonizing eternity until I could take it no longer. I threw the blankets off of me and got dressed again, headed downstairs and prepared myself for more of this unending work. The hours ticked by as the sun wandered across the sky. The wind blown landscape whistled and howled as it pushed the trees around with its unseen force. The waves, crashing violently against the jagged cliff face, spewed its icy tendrils of greenish opaque water across the granite coastline as breaker after breaker continued its unending assault on its earthen barrier. Seals could be seen breaking through the waves, dashing and turning as they evaded some unseen predator, witnessed only by the buoy standing guard as a sentinel of the deep as its crimson light flashed hypnotically in the Atlantic. 

I set my paintbrush down and wiped my white smudged hands on a rag.  The lowest chips around the lighthouses decrepit paint job were filled and I would continue my upkeep of the property while Rook happily kept me company. His calm demeanor and trusting gaze was a relief of sorts to me and as I sat in the grass for a rest he lay his furry head on my leg. As I pet him for a little i heard a faint sound. The creaking of rusted hinges and the dull thudding of old splintered wood being forced against something hard. I stood up to investigate the noise, following it out towards the very furthest edge of the property. There, concealed by the overgrowth where the tree line met the cliffs edge, was an old run down shed. The door, which was opening and closing with the frigid autumn breeze, was the source of the sound I had been hearing. As I opened the shed,  flooding the damp interior with light that had long since abandoned it, I took stock of what lie here in this forgotten ruin. Old rusty farm implements ranging from tongs, hammers, screwdrivers, and even an old sickle hanging above the door lended to the age of this derelict shed. After kicking around the old muddy floorboards I heard what sounded like a hollow spot. I continued tapping my foot all over the floor, and began kicking out the matted dirt and carpets of moss that had taken up residence on the wood floor when I uncovered an old rusty iron handle. I pulled up on it and a hatch revealed itself cut out in the floorboards. I peered into the inky blackness of the passage, and a rotten wooden staircase disappeared into darkness below. At some unknown distance far into the earth was the faintest glimmer of light. I looked at Rook who was stoic as ever and told him to stay, then I glanced around the surrounding forest before returning my gaze to the passage. With a sharp inhale I patted the back of my pants feeling for my revolver before remembering I had left it on the floor of the bedroom. I cursed myself but began my descent anyway, my boots carefully finding their footing and my hands clawing their way down the grimy rock walls. The smell of the tunnel was briny, and now there was the loud crashing of waves echoing through the chamber as I made my way towards the light at the bottom end. The stairs creaked and buckled with each step and the soft rot of the wooden boards bowing underfoot made me second guess this stupid venture. Finally as I got closer I could see the tunnel turned out towards the ocean and the passage opened up into a huge cave. The tide was still high and washed up close to the wooden boards I was standing on but the view was magnificent. Giant stalactites that glistened with the oceans spray hung from the ceiling as the waves crashed into the boulders at the mouth of the gaping rocky maw while little crabs scurried quickly into the cracks and crevices of the slick granite boulders holding the cave up.  After having satiated my curiosity I turned to head back up, but etched in the walls was something I had missed on my descent. The words “get out” were etched over and over and over into the wall behind me. They weren’t worn down and beaten by the elements after years adorning the wall, they looked fresh, very fresh. I felt a pit in my stomach and hurried back up the defunct steps, dropping the trap door back in place and shutting the creaking door, locking it with a mossy wooden board that swung down over the front with a dull thud. At that moment I heard the ravenous barking of Rook coming from the house. He must have run off back inside. Already feeling on edge I hurried in to see him in his spot at the living room, barking and snarling at the corner. I breathed a sigh of relief, running a hand through my hair as my weary eyes felt the weight of my fatigue. I went over to Rook and calmed him down again, his judgmental eyes still shooting dirty looks at the corner. I sat there with the dog feeling my exhaustion finally overwhelm me and I fell asleep on the hard wood floor. 

I was awoken just over an hour later by the alarm on my cell phone signaling the night watch. I groaned as I got to my feet, wiped the drool from my face, and headed back out into the dusky evening to fire up the lighthouse once more. The exhaustion was excruciating and with only an hour of sleep between the past 32 hours I felt hazy mentally as though I had been drinking all night. I made my way up the towering lighthouse to the power room and completed my nightly ritual of booting up the power until the machinery hummed to life. And not a moment too soon, because the sun was now down and the sky was dark. I had my foggy mental state to thank for the tortuously slow speed I was working at, but at least I had gotten everything started. I climbed up to the next floor just below where the light was held, there was an empty room with a single chair for the lighthouse keeper to keep watch in. I didn’t even bother to turn the light on, I just hobbled weary eyed over to the chair and flopped down into it, the uncomfortable wood creaking strenuously as I sat. I closed my eyes for a moment before gazing out the old warbled window pane, my sight illuminated only by the light of the now full moon. As I looked through the old distorted glass I sat bolt upright in my chair. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief straining to look closer at the sight of a black shadowy figure standing out on the ocean, his long thin arm outstretched and pointing at me with a gnarled accusatory finger. I was far off but I could see him plain as day, his inky blackness melding in and out of the dancing shadows that smattered the waves. I got up for a better view and ran up to the viewing platform to see unobstructed, however when I got there he was gone. A chill ran through my spine as the spectral image of the dark figure replayed in my mind. I had seen someone standing out there hadn’t I? But that would be crazy of course. I looked around paranoid, suspecting the lurking presence of some sinister being. Nothing felt safe, I could feel the piercing prescience of watching eyes that lay in hiding, the wind was a biting cold, the clouds looked ominous, even the trees moved in a way that seemed distorted and horrid. I closed my eyes and gritted my teeth, hands clasped around the iron railing. As I steadied my breathing I opened my eyes slowly and everything seemed to return to normal. I shook myself off and headed back inside, the only trace that anything had been wrong was my heart that was still pounding in my chest. I sat back in the creaky wooden chair and try as I might to fight it my eyes eventually closed and exhaustion finally set in around me. If I had only known this was just the beginning.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/8oRlNGpQm0


HEY TATERS! I'm in a much better mood about my situation! 
First of all, thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and give me some feedback on ways to go about the conversation at hand! You guys really are amazing, and I'm so glad I decided to post here.

 For those who just said to cut her off or something along the lines of hard-core blow up the situation....that was never my intention. Our relationship may not be of a parental one but my mum and I are working on being ""friends"" I guess you would say. We are not perfect but no relationship is. We have had our ups and downs and like I said in my original post, we are trying to communicate. I will take acknowledgement on the fact I haven't always gone about conversations in a civil manner. However, I am not one to give up what I want. If there is a way to find common ground with a good constructive conversation, I assure you...it's worth at least trying. Here is a great example of why.

TIME FOR THE UPDATE!
So we had a long phone conversation, and I didn't just immediately jump into things. We talked about random things, and eventually, I went in for the hard talk. 

I told her that my fiance and I talked about the wedding planning situation, and here is how we would like to do our planning going forward. 

First of all, we will be separating who gets to do what for the big day. We have loving fanily from both sides, and I would love input from all. We are a mixed culture couple, and I think everyone should get a little part of our day that they can be included in. She knows this and wholeheartedly agreed!

She told me that she had a talk with my dad. GO DAD! He did in fact have a talk with her about how wedding planning is going. And did so without making a huge fuss or trying to start drama. They had a great talk. She said that if we feel overwhelmed by the planning of all of this, then they would like to offer to pay for a Vegas elopement. They are even wanting to  pay to fly out his family so they are a part of this and let us chose whatever crazy elopement we want! I did not prompt this part at all....that was just an idea they talked about last night as an option. So great communication without putting each other down! I'm so proud! 

I told her that I love the offer and we might have had some suggestions from a few friends that make Vegas sound really fun. (Thanks potato family for the ideas lol) But I would like to give the wedding planning a shot with some new changes.

I laid out the fact that we are going to let everyone help make decor for our fun and funky reception. That way everyone just gets to come up with something they think fits our personalities. I love this idea and can't wait to get a few more people involved in that. And you know what....SHE AGREED! Said that she understands but she was excited about planning the fun part because she ""thought we had a good thing going"". Lol. (This was a joking manner, not her being rude)

I then told her that we want the craziness of the party but we agreed to tone down the wedding portion of the big day. This isn't technically a compromise, as we already don't care much about that part. 

I offered her the opportunity to have full control over the wedding portion. We have only 4 rules that she is to follow. Everything else, we honestly couldn't care less what it looks like. 

1- we will wear whatever we want. Period. And she even sent me some suggestions for dresses that we can add the iridescent fabric on top of. YES! WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR THE IRIDESCENT!!

2-pastel colors only. If she wants to sprinkle in some muted tines, I'm fine with that...just understand that if it is too much, then we will stand out like a sore thumb. So if we get crazy looks for why the colors clash so much to our outfits, it's on her 🤣.  AND SHE AGREED ALL PASTEL!

3-we want our arbor to be a big ass triangle and decorate how we want. Since that is the important part.(pictures and all)
And she said that's a great idea as well! I even told her she could HELP design it, but in the end it was our choice on this. She had no problem only putting in a small input and letting us have that.

4- she has to pick a very nice dress for this event. I told her that she can rock up in a pink wedding dress and that would just thrill me to bits. Just not a muted dusty pink one. And she got re excited for the encouragement on spending some money on herself to feel special too.

Now to address that last one. I left out in my last post but she is a bigger woman. She's also 50. She feels very insecure in certain dresses. And that's totally understandable. She dresses she wants to wear are very out of date looking and very muted. I saw many people trying to point out that I needed to tell her not to wear white...she never planned on anything like that. She knows that white is a HUGE NO NO to wear to someone else's wedding. She sees that as very disrespectful. Quite the opposite. She is trying to wear a dress that draws as little attention to herself as possible. And now let me clarify this! I am not a people pleaser. In the end I get what I want. I have our best friend enthusiastically agreeing to take on the duty of ""Dye Guy"". Anyone who shows up in white is getting hit with a handful of colorful chalk. This will be on the invitation, so if they chose to test me...they deserve it 🤣

But for our big day, we want everyone to dress up. This is a time of celebration in our eyes. It's about 2 families coming together and having fun. We want people to feel encouraged to dress up as much as they could ever dress up. Ball gowns are 100000% welcomed. As long as it's pastels. We want everyone to feel beautiful and fun. However much they want to dress up, its welcomed! I plan to make around 10 different photo backdrops, so we will have a blast seeing all the fun pictures of everyone! 

We had a great talk about how this was so much easier, and when it came down to it, I never had to confront her about how she was acting. It was just great open communication!

We talked and she is very much excited to be able to have freedom to do whatever she wants. She even said she is going to make a whole new Pinterest board and add us on it so we can stay in the loop and tell her when we don't like something she is planning. I was so proud of her when she offered that! 

Also, to add. I saw a couple of comments that hinted at the fact that maybe she feels like she missed out on her wedding. It was very small. She wore a $75 dress from the nearest store, and it was just a basic ""get it done"" sort. So I brought up to her that maybe we could start planning a vowel renewal for their 35th anniversary, and Rico and I will help fund that as a thank you back to them. Really give her a chance to have the wedding she wants. She did agree that hers was not what she wanted but did not actually want any vowel renewal. She very much appreciated the offer, though. So thanks again for suggesting that as a talk we should have.

What it boiled down to is. My mum and dad are very happy about this. My mum just got carried away trying to help plan. She struggles with that. But it took a good conversation for us to get back on the same page. 

I can't wait for my wedding. I get to marry the love of my life, my best friend, my person. I had another dream last night of me walking up to see him. And the decorations around us for that moment do not matter to us. It's that momment that I'm excited for. And our wedding feels even more love now that we have this sorted out. I can't wait to walk down that catwalk right up to the man I love. And it is special to us that my family wants to help this much. We will love whatever she chooses. 

I will always come back if there is any more drama. But honestly, there is none. We managed to get on the same page entirely. I'm so thankful for some of the talking points in the comments. It really helped a lot. I'm going to call my dad now and thank him for helping steer her enthusiasm in the right direction. I'm so thankful for all of you helping me get through this. 

P.S. sorry for any mistakes, I had to type this fast, and I'm cracked up on coffee right now. 
And also. I want to add again... you can have conversations with people. Sometimes, it does work out in everyone's favor. Even when they are as difficult as my mum. Sometimes, it works out. 
(Not all the time... but it's at least worth a shot to avoid any wedding drama lama)

Thanks again everyone❤️",5,1742332274.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Like many in Miami Beach, it's Hotel/pool/path/Beach. 2 pools, one behind the hotel and one above the bar area plus a hot tub. Usually a mixture of old/young and a family or 2.

Fees get you 2 chairs, on the beach but not the umbrella(+$30), bikes and something else i can't  recall. The waiters wander the pool and beach for orders but apart from one or 2 on the weekends, they tend to jump around and miss you. Food is very basic.

I've had good luck getting upgraded to direct ocean as opposed to side view ocean. I've also gotten 4pm checkout. I take points instead of breakfast since we like to walk and get bakery/coffee. They have some activities like Yoga, a DJ and there's a MVC person in the lobby. Lobby bar and coffee shop too.

Ive noticed there 1 of 3 elevators still not working from months ago. The carpets getting worn. The rooms look OK and bright, but then you sit and stare at the wall patch, the misaligned dressor/tv/adjoining door, strange high tub or just  wear and tear.

Anyway, had decided to move on and found out it's closing in May/June for a year long renovation. It will be interesting to see how it turns out.

I’ve developed a fear of drinking liquids. Yes, I know it sounds silly and crazy. I had a scary experience where I almost aspirated a big gulp of coffee about a month ago and now I can’t stop being afraid of drinking out of fear of aspirating/drowning. I keep overthinking the swallowing mechanism and it’s quickly ruining my life. Sometimes when I go to drink I subconsciously second guess and then I almost aspirate and it feels really scary. There’s nothing physically wrong with me, this is purely from anxiety. It started out with food and now liquids. I can only take tiny sips now. I’m dehydrated and I miss drinking all my favorite drinks. I’ve always heard it doesn’t take much water to drown so I’m just wondering what the real danger is if I were to accidentally choke. I hate thinking I’m about to die every time I eat/drink. Obviously everyone chokes on a little water from time to time but I’m more concerned about big gulps. It doesn’t help that I have had real, scary moments of feeling like I’m about to choke because it just instills the fear further.

About me: I work as a bartender, I am very good at getting people drinks lol, I like to memorise all their usual orders or the way they drink their coffee, rather than remembering their names. I sing (tenor) in a church choir, we sing liturgical music, things like Mozart and Haydn and Palestrina and Gounod and Franck. I play the organ, I have a harmonium (a pump organ) at home for practising. I am writing a novel or at least I am trying to.

Dear AQA,

I write to you not as a mere student but as a battle-worn survivor of your exam halls—those barren wastelands where the cries of the fallen echo unanswered. You, the orchestrators of our suffering, sit high upon your ivory towers, wielding your exam papers like merciless blades smoking with bloody execution. Have you no pity? No scrap of human kindness left within your blackened souls? You watch us struggle, detached, assured that a man has to mind his own business, and so you wash your hands of the broken minds left in your wake.

Your exams descend like the fog and filthy air, an oppressive force as inescapable as fate itself. You have us slaughtered upon the altar of your *specifications*, our pens bleeding ink like soldiers in No Man’s Land, our minds trapped in the trenches of mark schemes, desperately clawing for survival. Even the hardest hearts must quail at the sight of our ranks, shaking and quaking before the examiner’s all-seeing eye. Must we wade so deep in blood that returning were as tedious as to go o’er?

Have you no warmth in your chest? Do ghosts not rattle their chains in your sleep, whispering of the futures you have stolen, the spirits of students past who still wander, unfinished, ungraded? We suffer at your hands, yet you remain unmoved, like a cold, unfeeling charge, blindly driving us forward, demanding we *do and die*, never stopping to question whether we *reason why*.

But soft! It is not mere cruelty that drives you, but something fouler. *Vaulting ambition*, perhaps? A desperate need to push us beyond human limits, to force us to wring blood from the withered stone of our exhausted minds?

And what of Christmas? Oh, you are no Fezziwig, no jovial merchant bringing mirth and merriment. No, you are Scrooge before the hauntings, hoarding every mark like a miser, deaf to the pleas of the shivering scholars who beg, just beg, for an extra half mark on a PEE paragraph. ""Are there *no* resits?"" you sneer. ""Are there *no* mercy grades?""

You may pretend we are not members of one body. But let me warn you—if you do not learn your lesson, you will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish.

I hope when you try to plug your phone in, you can't find the right orientation. I hope when you go to sleep at night your pillow is warm on both sides. I hope when you try to plug a USB into a computer It snaps the inside piece off. I hope that you stub your toe every day for the rest of your life. I hope the little clips on your toilet seat are broken so that you slide around when you try to shit. I hope whenever you try to watch anything the audio desyncs with the video. I hope every time you get comfortable you feel the urge to pee. I hope the next time you sit down on the couch you can't find the remote. I hope the next time you watch anything it stops every five seconds to buffer. I hope the next time you wear socks you step in water. I hope you wake up every day a few minutes earlier than your alarm. I hope at night whenever you sleep you have to sit at an odd angle because your charger is too short.

And finally, I hope your coffee is always lukewarm.

Yours sincerely,",6,1742331378.0,GCSE,5,1.0,False

Now getting this thing to shoot out hot black espressos I’ve been struggling with for a while. 

I have a smart plug which turns it on 30 minutes before I get up, so the machine is warm however I feel after it getting to 96 degrees for half an hour, espressos come out a little cool. For reference I could swig one go no problem without burning myself 

Story was today I accidentally left the steam button on so when it auto turned on, it was steaming for 30 mins. I realised this too late and quickly put some more water back in the boiler too cool it down. Whoops it happens no biggie 

But then I made a black coffee and the temperature/extraction was the best I’ve ever had. 

So legends of the rancilios’

1. Do your machines get hot enough without accidentally over heating it  ?
2. Or do I risk over heating in the future for best extraction? 
3. Or is my machine a bit faulty and it should always be hotter without the steam mistake/trick?

Coferments are new to me insofar as brewing goes. I've heard of them, but this is the first time I've spotted a bag in the wild, and though there's a recommended recipe on the Detour website I'm not placing all my eggs in that basket. Hence I'm here.

So, when it comes to cofermented coffee what's the general recipe y'all follow? The website recommended a 1:17 or so ratio (20g coffee to 340g water) and to do it over the course of three minutes, but there's no further detail, and while the cup I just pulled is remarkable I can't shake the feeling it could be better.

I’m a first time mom and I see a lot about how people spend their time after giving birth and it ranges a lot.

So I wanted to ask here, for anyone who has had kids, what items did you get for yourself after giving birth that really helped you out in terms of your own comfort and convenience. This could be literally anything. And I’m not talking about medical supplies. I feel like I have put so much of myself into things for the baby and not much for myself and I’m worried about taking care of myself as well. I know all too well that taking care of family means making sure that I am taken care of as well.

1jefdyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Final_Canary5374/comments/1jefdyy/the_guest_who_never_left/,The Guest Who Never Left,"It was supposed to be a simple side hustle. My friend Clara had been hosting Airbnb guests in her spare room for years, and she always raved about how easy it was. ""It's just extra cash,"" she said. ""Most people are in and out, and you barely even notice they're there."" So, when I found myself struggling to make ends meet after losing my job, I decided to give it a try. I had a spare room in my small apartment, and the idea of a little extra income was too tempting to pass up.

The first few guests were exactly as Clara had described—polite, quiet, and gone before I even had a chance to learn their names. But then *he* arrived.

His name was Daniel, according to the booking details. He was a tall, thin man with hollow cheeks and eyes that seemed to stare right through you. He arrived late at night, long after the sun had set, and I remember feeling a chill when I opened the door to let him in. He didn’t say much, just a quiet ""thank you"" as he handed me his suitcase and followed me to the guest room.

The first night was uneventful. I heard him moving around in his room, the soft creak of the floorboards as he paced back and forth, but I chalked it up to jet lag or restlessness. It wasn’t until the next morning that I noticed something strange.

I woke up to the smell of coffee brewing. I hadn’t set the coffee maker the night before, so I assumed Daniel had made it himself. But when I walked into the kitchen, the pot was empty, and the machine was cold. The smell lingered, though, strong and unmistakable. I shrugged it off, thinking maybe I’d imagined it, and went about my day.

Daniel didn’t leave the apartment that day. I worked from home, and every time I passed by the guest room, I could hear him inside—muttering to himself, pacing, or just sitting in silence. I tried to ignore it, but the feeling of unease grew with every passing hour.

That night, I woke up to the sound of footsteps in the hallway. I lay still, listening as they grew closer, stopping just outside my bedroom door. My heart pounded as I stared at the door, waiting for it to open. But it never did. The footsteps retreated, and I finally fell back into a restless sleep.

The next morning, I found a note on the kitchen counter. It was written in a shaky, spidery handwriting that made my skin crawl.

*""Thank you for your hospitality. I’ll be staying a little longer.""*

I frowned. Daniel had only booked for two nights, and he hadn’t mentioned extending his stay. I checked the Airbnb app, but there was no update to his reservation. I decided to confront him, but when I knocked on the guest room door, there was no answer. I tried the handle, but it was locked.

The days blurred together after that. Daniel never left his room, but I could hear him moving around at all hours of the night. The smell of coffee returned, stronger than ever, even though the machine remained untouched. And then there were the notes. They started appearing everywhere—on the fridge, on the bathroom mirror, even tucked under my pillow.

*""You’ve been so kind.""*

*""I feel at home here.""*

*""I think I’ll stay forever.""*

I tried to contact Airbnb, but they were no help. They told me to ask Daniel to leave, but every time I knocked on his door, there was no response. I thought about calling the police, but what would I say? That my guest was too quiet? That he left creepy notes? It sounded ridiculous, even to me.

The breaking point came one night when I woke up to find Daniel standing at the foot of my bed. His hollow eyes stared down at me, and his lips were curled into a faint smile. I screamed and scrambled out of bed, but when I turned on the light, he was gone.

I packed a bag and left the apartment that night, staying with Clara until I could figure out what to do. When I returned a few days later, the apartment was empty. Daniel’s room was spotless, as if no one had ever stayed there. The notes were gone, and the smell of coffee had finally faded.

I thought it was over. I thought he was gone.

But then I started hearing the footsteps again. And the notes began to reappear.

*""You can’t get rid of me that easily.""*

*""I told you I’d stay forever.""*

I don’t know what Daniel is—or if he’s even human. All I know is that he’s still here, lurking in the shadows of my apartment, waiting for me to let my guard down. I’ve tried everything to get rid of him—cleansing rituals, exorcisms, even moving to a new place—but he always finds me.

And now, as I write this, I can hear him in the hallway, his footsteps growing closer. The smell of coffee fills the air, and I know it’s only a matter of time before he appears again.

He’s not just a guest anymore. He’s a part of my life. And I don’t think he’s ever going to leave.",1,1742330605.0,u_Final_Canary5374,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the National Invitation Tournament, where dreams of March Madness glory go to take a breather. We've got the Saint Bonaventure Bonnies hosting the Kent State Golden Flashes in a matchup that promises to be as thrilling as a lukewarm cup of decaf coffee. But hey, it's basketball, and anything can happen!

The Bonnies are strutting in with a 22-11 record, which is like saying you almost won the lottery but forgot to buy a ticket. Their non-conference play was impressive at 12-1, but let's be honest, that was probably against teams that couldn't dribble without tripping over their own shoelaces. They average 69.0 points per game, which is just enough to keep their fans from dozing off in the stands.

On the other hand, the Golden Flashes are also 22-11, but they come from the MAC, a conference known for its ability to produce teams that are slightly better than average. They score 73.7 points per game, which is like bringing a slightly sharper knife to a butter knife fight. Jalen Sullinger and VonCameron Davis are their top performers, and they’ll need to be on their A-game to outshine the Bonnies.

The bookmakers have the Bonnies as favorites with odds of 1.5, while the Golden Flashes are the underdogs at 2.65. Given that underdogs win about 25% of the time in basketball, Kent State has a fighting chance to flash their way to victory.

Now, for the best bet: With the spread set at 4.5 points in favor of the Bonnies, and considering Kent State's recent scoring spree averaging 81.7 points over the last 10 games, I'd say take the Golden Flashes to cover the spread. They might not win, but they'll keep it close enough to make the Bonnies sweat through their jerseys.

So, grab your popcorn, or maybe just a strong cup of coffee, and enjoy the game. Who knows, you might just witness the Golden Flashes pull off a surprise and make the Bonnies wish they’d stuck to non-conference play.",1,1742330473.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1jefajv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1jefajv/im_at_a_loss_for_words/,I’m at a loss for words,"So I am/was mono… or solo poly? Idk, I pretty much casually date while also on the lookout for a compatible long term partner. A little over one week ago, I connected with a married man in a ENM marriage, dating solo and together allegedly. There was originally talks of a group situation I was exploring with a play partner of mine, so we connected with him and his wife. Ultimately my play partner changed his mind, so I exited out of the conversation. However, by then, I had already planned to meet for coffee with the husband (due to scheduling conflicts, my play partner and his wife couldn’t meet, but he suggested we do one-on-one). I had actually really enjoyed our conversation but apologized to him saying that I wasn’t really exploring those types of experiences on my own. He expressed disappointment and said they did actually mostly date solo if I would be open to exploring that. I had no experience dating someone who is ENM (plenty non ethical though haha) but we really seemed to vibe so well, I agreed. Met him for coffee, and there was instant chemistry, and conversation was great. He explains that his wife has one other partner that she dates consistently, and he’s looking for the same thing. I ask lots of questions, being new to this, and he answers all of them (allegedly honestly). 

Nothing physical happens on this first meeting, but he immediately texted me upon leaving to say he enjoyed meeting me so much and wished he had kissed me. He sets another date immediately for the following Monday (coffee was Thursday). He proceeds to consistently text me every single day. We go on our Monday date, we end up sleeping together. Connection feels off the charts. I keep self checking if this is love bombing, but it feels super genuine. I had told him that one thing I look for in any relationship is security in the sense that I am never second guessing how someone feels about me and they are communicating consistently. He is giving me that.  The consistent communication continues throughout that week. One day he CALLS ME.. just to say hi, chat, etc. This is probably normal for some people but I don’t receive calls much anymore. Then he asks me for a spontaneous spa date (Thursday so one week to the day from our first meeting). We had also set up a date for Saturday (so just
over one week from our first meeting). If you are keeping track, that is 4 dates in just over one week and consistent comms, all initiated mostly by him. He’s telling me he’s thinking about me a lot, etc. I’m not pushing him for dates or to text/call me, he’s doing it of his own accord. Mind you, I’m down BAD for him, but I am trying to process the whole EMN thing, doing reading, and also going on other dates bc I just know I can’t get fully attached to a married man so if I’m going to do this, I too need to lean into the non-monogamy side. 

Saturday, we go on our 4th and what would be final date. Great date, great convo, lots of making out. We go back to mine. We have sex. I unfortunately make the mistake of doing this unprotected bc he couldn’t finish last time, and I wanted him to, and based on what he’s giving, I’m thinking he’s not throwing it around like that. (I know this is very very dumb, please be nice to me). That’s all great. He gives me deep kisses goodbye. He’d love to see me this week. He’ll text me or maybe even call me again. 

Sunday I don’t hear from him, which is the first time since we’ve met but I figure he has a family day (he and his wife have 2 kids). I knew communication cadence had to drop off at some point so this doesn’t really bother me. 

Last night, I receive the following text:
“Hi there. I hope you're having a nice day.
I'm feeling like we're not as compatible as we wanted each other to be. And I think the interesting circumstance we met under fueled a lot of desirous feelings.
But I think we'll want different things and I'm prone to call it out as soon as I see it. I'm sorry and I hope that doesn't feel to abrupt or I hope that maybe you were feeling the same thing.
Either way I really enjoyed our lustful week and getting to know you. And wish you the absolute best.”

I’m so shocked and traumatized by this whole experience. It truly feels very sinister that he feigned to develop a genuine connection with me, and then broke it off so abruptly without ever communicating what it is he would really want out of this and giving me the agency to decide if I was on board or an opportunity to process what I would want out of it. It’s really left me spinning, and honestly so mad at myself for opening myself up to being hurt like this. Can someone please tell me if I’m being crazy? This really doesn’t feel like an ethical way to go about non monogamy. 

So sorry for the long windedness. I just wanted to provide context for any signs I may have missed. I mean clearly I missed the biggest one, which was the love bombing. I just feel so incredibly hurt and misled. ",14,1742330374.0,nonmonogamy,13,0.94,False

My family is Muslim and completely rejected my sexuality and freedom. They even went as far as to declare me dead because I traveled alone without a male guardian. I never found happiness in religion, so I left it, along with my country and family, and sought asylum in a European country out of fear for my life—both from my family and my home country, which is hostile to religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights.

I met my girlfriend (27) at the asylum reception center, where she works as a security guard. Our relationship became romantic, but I kept it secret because it's against her work regulations to engage in personal relationships with residents of the center. That being said, around 70% of the security staff there have similar relationships, and no disciplinary action has ever been taken against them.

She didn’t have her own apartment, so for eight months, we slept in her car every night. When I moved out of the reception center and got my own place, I quickly settled into my new life—joining a volleyball club, working online, and taking language classes. She started spending most of her time at my apartment, which I initially loved. But now, I feel like that’s all our relationship is.

After a year and seven months together, we have never gone out for a walk, never had coffee outside, never gone on a dinner date. She doesn’t want people to see us together and hasn’t told her father that she’s with a woman. I don’t know if it’s shame or if she’s just not serious about us. Whenever I try to talk to her about it, she gets defensive, saying that being with me puts her job and social status at risk.

On the other hand, her mother and sisters know about our relationship, but only because a friend of hers saw us together and told them. A week ago, she sent me a message, stressed out, saying her workplace found out about our relationship (which I honestly think is normal—most people in town already know). She was panicking, saying, *“Oh my God, I can’t trust anyone anymore! Who ruined my life by telling my job?”*

Another thing that bothers me is that she does nothing to help with household chores. I’m not exaggerating—she doesn’t even wash the dishes she uses. I do all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and ironing.

I’m mentally exhausted from thinking about all of this. Am I putting too much pressure on her because I lost my family and expect too much from her? Or am I in an unbalanced relationship? Is there anything I can do or any steps I should take?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",3,1742330319.0,whatdoIdo,3,0.8,False

I don’t even know where to begin, but I feel like I need to get this out somewhere, and maybe hear from people who have been through something similar.

The past several months have been nothing short of brutal. Since last summer, I’ve lost two family members, had my long-term relationship fall apart in the worst way possible, learned that my mom’s cancer came back, and then got laid off unexpectedly from a job I thought was going to be my next big step. On top of that, I’ve moved back in with my parents, and while I’m grateful to have a place to stay, it just feels like my independence has been stripped away completely.

I’ve been job searching nonstop since November, and I feel like I’ve applied for everything under the sun. I keep getting rejected, or worse, completely ignored. I’m trying to do what I can, but it feels like nothing is working, and I’m just stuck in this limbo where my life isn’t moving forward. It’s numbing at this point.

Some days, I can push through, I get out of the house, go to a coffee shop to try and feel somewhat normal, run errands, do what I need to do. Other days, I wake up, lay in bed for hours, and feel like there’s no point in doing anything. Even things I used to care about, like dating, gaming, or even just talking to people, feel completely meaningless now. I feel disconnected from everything, like I’m just floating through life without any real direction.

I know that logically, things won’t stay this way forever, but it’s hard to believe that when nothing seems to be improving. How do I pull myself out of this? How do I get unstuck? If you’ve been through something like this, what actually helped you? Because right now, I feel like I’m running on empty, and I don’t know where to go from here.

1jef77x,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGnd5dQpuK0/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==,Reconsidering “Coffee” dates? Why you should….,"Some self serving reasons men push for coffee dates and how it shifts the Polarity

They Kill Polarity and Waste Your Time

Coffee dates are low-effort, low-investment, and tell you everything you need to know about a man’s level of interest. Here’s why they rarely lead anywhere meaningful:
	1.	Convenient for the wrong men. Married or unavailable men love coffee dates—they’re easy to sneak in during work hours without raising suspicion. A quick coffee doesn’t leave a trail like a restaurant bill or a romantic evening out. His ego gets a boost, but his conscience stays clean (for now). He’s not looking for a real connection—just a fleeting thrill.
	2.	A numbers game. Coffee dates are cheap and efficient, making them perfect for serial daters. Some men even stack multiple dates in a day, turning dating into a revolving door of faces. When meeting you requires little time or money, he’s not valuing the experience—you’re just another slot in his schedule.
	3.	Public, impersonal, and low-vibe. Coffee shops are neutral ground. He doesn’t have to impress you, plan anything thoughtful, or create an intimate atmosphere. You have no control over the environment, and it kills the spark. Worse, the polarity flips: you become the pursuer, eager to prove your worth, while he casually receives your energy with minimal investment.

Coffee dates may seem harmless, but they’re actually one of the quickest ways to sabotage polarity and stall any romantic momentum. Here’s why:

1. You Become the Masculine Energy

Polarity thrives on the dynamic tension between masculine and feminine energy. Masculine energy leads, directs, and pursues. Feminine energy receives, attracts, and inspires pursuit.

When you accept a coffee date, you subtly step into the masculine role:
	•	You’re agreeing to a low-effort, low-stakes meeting, signaling that you’re willing to be “interviewed” rather than courted.
	•	You show up with the hope of being chosen, subtly seeking his approval, while he passively observes.
	•	You’re in a neutral, shared space with no intentional ambiance—making it difficult to drop into your feminine essence.

Meanwhile, he’s receiving. He’s relaxed, detached, and holding the frame. With minimal effort, he still gets access to your beauty, presence, and energy. This dynamic slowly but surely drains the charge that creates attraction.

2. No Tension, No Spark

Polarity is about creating emotional tension—the feeling that draws you toward each other. Coffee dates are flat, transactional, and uninspired. They lack the charge that builds chemistry. Plus, he probably will choose a Starbucks or another large chain that’s busy busy. 

A man who genuinely wants to experience you will create a setting where you can both feel the tension of attraction:
	•	A dimly lit cocktail bar with cozy seating creates intimacy.
	•	A dinner date offers a slower, more sensual experience.
	•	An activity date builds shared memories, sparking emotional connection.

Coffee dates, on the other hand, are rushed and functional—leaving no room for desire to build. You’re essentially “getting it over with” rather than creating a memory.  Also, they are very open ended which means the man is interested in you spending 3-4 hours with him and not eating!!! Be fr. Yes, sometimes they end up at another location, but a first date should be around 90-120min…if it’s a meet and greet like Coffee, it should be 30min. This leaves a “rushed” feeling. Anxiety. Leave him wanting to experience MORE of you. 

3. No Room for Feminine Radiance

Feminine energy flourishes when it feels safe, seen, and cherished. Coffee shops are busy, public, and impersonal. You can’t soften into your feminine radiance when you’re surrounded by the clatter of cups and laptops.
	•	There’s no ambiance to draw you into a relaxed, sensual state.
	•	You’re likely dressed casually, rather than embracing your feminine allure.
	•	The rushed nature of a coffee date makes it feel transactional, not romantic.

Without space for feminine expression, the attraction becomes platonic or forgettable. Women LOVE beautiful experiences, sure coffee dates appeal to a man’s logical and self serving nature, but a woman desires a hint of romance..atmosphere, we are sensory women..we are the gatherers. Let us blossom so you get the best of our radiance. 

4. A Man’s Investment Reflects His Intentions

Masculine energy values through investment—of time, effort, and resources. When a man offers a coffee date, he’s signaling that he’s keeping his investment minimal.
	•	Low effort = low interest.
	•	High interest = deliberate planning and thoughtfulness.

A man pursuing with strong masculine energy will create an experience. He’ll select a place, make a reservation, or add a thoughtful touch that shows he wants you to feel desired and special. He is vetting you over the phone for likes, dislikes and is planning something you’d enjoy. It can be as simple as..what’s your favorite meal. A nice lunch is also acceptable. 

5. Don’t Reward Laziness With Your Presence

When you accept a coffee date, you reward minimal effort. You train men to offer less while still gaining access to your time, energy, and beauty.
	•	If you’re constantly saying yes to coffee, he has no reason to step up. It’s the same as going to his house. You will have plenty of time to “hang out in marriage. Dating should be fun, an experience and an overall growth experience. Not “comfort” 
	•	You become “convenient,” not captivating. Who wants to be the “just there” girl. Listen, a man will do what you allow and they will accept you as a convenience. This is devastating to a woman’s self esteem. Don’t do it. 
All the risk is on the woman…what’s the reward? 

By declining, you’re setting a boundary that demands intentionality. If he’s genuinely interested, he’ll rise to the occasion. If he’s just browsing or keeping you in rotation, he’ll fall off. Either way, you win.",1,1742330144.0,u_PolarityLoveCoach,0,0.66,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the National Invitation Tournament, where dreams are made, and brackets are busted. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (17-16) are set to take on the Jacksonville State Gamecocks (22-12) in what promises to be a showdown of epic proportions—or at least a decent Tuesday night distraction.

The Yellow Jackets are favored with odds around 1.38, which means if you bet on them, you might be able to afford a large coffee at your local café. Meanwhile, the Gamecocks are sitting at 3.15, which is tempting if you're feeling lucky or just enjoy living on the edge.

Georgia Tech's paint game is as strong as a freshly brewed espresso, averaging 33.0 points per game in the paint. Baye Ndongo leads the charge with a solid 9.8 points, while Lance Terry adds some spice with 14.5 points per game. On the other hand, Jacksonville State's Mason Nicholson is grabbing rebounds like they're going out of style, averaging 7.5 per game.

The Yellow Jackets have been averaging 69.3 points in their last 10 games, while the Gamecocks have been slumping a bit, averaging 66.7 points, which is 7.2 fewer than their season average. But hey, who needs consistency when you have unpredictability?

With Georgia Tech's recent form and home-court advantage, they should be able to cover the -6.5 spread. But let's not forget that underdogs win 25% of the time in basketball, so if you're feeling adventurous, a small wager on Jacksonville State could be your ticket to glory—or at least a fun story to tell your friends.

For the best bet, consider taking Georgia Tech to cover the spread at -6.5. And if you're feeling extra daring, sprinkle a little on the over 140.5 points, because who doesn't love a high-scoring affair?

In conclusion, whether you're rooting for the Yellow Jackets or the Gamecocks, remember that in the world of sports betting, the only sure thing is that nothing is ever a sure thing. Enjoy the game, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",1,1742329822.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

## Miel ⁤coffee Recipe: Your ‌Step-by-Step Guide

Ready to embark on your miel coffee journey? Here's a foundational miel coffee recipe to⁤ get you started:

**Ingredients:**

* ⁤  double shot of espresso (or 1/2​ cup of strong brewed coffee)
*  ⁤ 1-2 tablespoons of high-quality honey (adjust to your preference)
*   1 cup ⁣of steamed milk (dairy or non-dairy)
* ​  Pinch of cinnamon (optional)

**Instructions:**

1.  ⁤**Prepare your ‌coffee:** brew a double shot ⁣of ‍espresso using your espresso machine. Alternatively, brew a strong cup of coffee using your preferred method (French press, pour-over, etc.). For ​the best espresso for miel, consider medium to dark ‌roasts with chocolate⁣ and nutty notes.
2.  **Warm the honey:** Gently warm the ‍honey in a small saucepan or ⁤in the ‌microwave ⁣for a ​few seconds. This will make it easier to dissolve in the coffee. You can also create a honey simple syrup coffee by combining equal parts honey and hot water, stirring until dissolved. This prevents the honey from clumping at ​the bottom of your drink.
3.  ⁤**Combine coffee and honey:** Pour the‌ warmed honey into‌ your cup and add the espresso (or brewed coffee). Stir well to ensure the honey is ‍fully dissolved.
4.‍  **Steam the milk:** steam your milk using an espresso machine or a milk frother. If you‌ don't have‌ either, you can ⁢heat the milk in a saucepan and whisk⁣ vigorously until it becomes frothy.5.  **Pour and ⁣garnish:** Gently pour the ⁤steamed milk over‍ the coffee and honey mixture. If desired, sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon ​on top for a warm and aromatic ‌finish.[[Explore Top Rated miel coffee on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=miel coffee)

anyway i support her either way but I'm finding myself not really getting the carnivore diet. If meat is so good for us because it's ancestral food, does that not mean all forms of milk are also out?

I figured it would be good to learn a new skill, and join a community. It has been so much fun and I have started to make new friends through class. They have social dances where you can come to dance for fun and get to know people in the community. People from the general public, and other local dance studios will come to these social dances. They are super fun, a great way to practice the skill you have learned, have the opportunity to talk more with people, and dance with people who might be above (or below) your skill level.|

In February I went to a social dance and met Jessica (fake name). The moment I asked her to dance, there was immediate chemistry. She immediately looked at me, smiled, and told me she liked my mustache. I smiled back and told her that I liked her face. She is absolutely gorgeous, in great shape, and a good dancer. She is someone that I would consider ""out of my league"". At the same time, I felt like I had known her forever already. We joked a lot with each other, and I made her laugh so much.  I had butterflies.

Ever since then I have been trying to get to know her more, while taking it slowly because I am still healing from my previous relationship, and being chill because I haven't fully been sure how she feels about me. The reason for my uncertainty is because it has felt like she only wants to see me at the dance studio. She initiates conversations, and she even bought classes at my studio. She came to a beginners class when I was still part of it, even though she her skill level is way past that, seemingly so that she could see me again. I asked her out a few times, and she agreed to coffee with me once, but then canceled the date the very next day with little explanation. Part of me thought she had a boyfriend and I was just someone she enjoyed flirting with at dance.

Things have gone on like this since then until last week when I finally just decided to be straightforward and ask her. I sent her a text message saying that I've enjoyed getting to know her a bit through dance, and I felt a vibe between us. That I have been wanting to spend time with her outside of dance but had been getting the sense that she wasn't interested in that. I told her it was ok either way, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't misreading things.

She responded with an apology, saying she didn't mean to be confusing. That she would be interested in spending time with me but that she has been prepping for a move, and that she should free up after that. She mentioned that she would be going to a lesson at my studio that Wednesday, which she ended up missing.

Fast forward some time, she went to a social dance that I missed this past Saturday. She texted me to tell me that she had fun, but she was sorry I missed it. I asked her how moving was going and if she was ready. She said that she was feeling sad about the move, and some other things. I told her that I understood, and that a new place means new memories, even if moving can feel like the end of a chapter. I told her that if she wanted someone to chat with to take her mind off things that she could give me a call.

This lead to an hour an a half phone conversation where I learned a lot more about her. She also wasn't sure how I felt about her, mainly because she knew I was much younger than her. Now, based on how she looked, I assumed she was 42-45 maybe. After a lot of hesitance she told me that she is 52. We actually ended up on another call even later in the evening and in total talked for nearly 4 hours yesterday.

There are a few things from that conversation that worry me. But the biggest thing that I have been getting in my head about is the age gap. I haven't felt such strong chemistry with anyone since my recent breakup, and before that I was single/dating for nearly a decade. I can't get out of my head (or maybe out of my own way) about the age gap. I am super attracted to her, and we vibe so well. We have things in common. We can communicate with each other. I don't care all that much about having children, and would probably want to adopt if I did. 

How do I decide if this is a deal breaker for me? Am I crazy for entertaining this? I need advice or perspective surrounding these questions. Input from other people in relationships with similar age gaps in their relationship would be appreciated.

(19F),"Okay so basically, about a week ago, my heart was beating at around 100bpm(highest was at 110) whenever I took a measurement of it on Welltory(heart rate app.) I double-checked it by measuring it manually and it wasn’t wrong. I figured I maybe had too much coffee, as I wasn’t experiencing any other symptoms.

Well, this weekend, I developed a sore throat with some occasional coughing and body aches, which I figured what just a simple cold. I treated it with some rest, tea, and throat drops. Before I developed the sore throat, I had a depressive episode where all I did was sleep. I had no appetite on that day, so I only ate some cereal.

Today, my pulse is back to normal, and is around 84bpm. Usually it measures lower 60-70, like yesterday. I just noticed an hour ago that I have a strawberry tongue, and I find that weird, as I finally have my voice back and my throat doesn’t hurt nearly as much as before. 

Is it possible I had strep without knowing? I heard a 100bpm RHR could be a symptom for rheumatic fever. In addition, I had whole body aches this weekend, and some dizziness when I would try to get up.

Edit: I currently have no rash, so this situation is just so weird imo. I’m also unsure if I have any white spots on my throat as usually seen with strep. I tried looking but I can’t tell if the ones I’m seeing are normal.",1,1742329437.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I want to know if there is some kind of gateway/router firmware setup that will allow a coffee shop owner to restrict access to wifi in a time based way.

my idea is for a code to be generated with each receipt, and when the user tries to login to the wifi they are asked somehow to enter the code on their phone and then internet will be cut off for that user in a set number of hours depending on the time they chose initially.

  
if anyone has a better idea to solve this problem let me know, otherwise please suggest what software I should use and any specific guides that could be helpful.

We're talking 6k calories/day. Slowly, with butter coffee and intermittent fasting, I've been able to bring that number significantly lower. The problem is that it got so low (1k calories/day) that I think something flipped in my brain and I just wasn't hungry at all anymore. 

I was also addicted to seeing the numbers on the scale (literally) plummet. It was so rewarding! But then I realized I'm probably losing TONS of muscle by eating such small amounts. I've also started exercising regularly (every day) and found it was starting to be a struggle to finish workouts. I needed a way to get more protein in my diet. 

So I tried eating more...more chicken, more pork, more eggs...but I just couldn't do it. I'd finish a thigh and look in disgust at the next one. That wasn't sustainable so I started looking into protein powder to help supplement. 

At Costco I found the Isopure Zero Carb w/25g protein per scoop. Adding it to my butter coffee in the morning is decadent and I've noticed my energy levels are back! Yesterday I took 3 scoops throughout the day (pre and post workout scoops are just with water) and this morning I started adding collagen and a raw egg to the butter coffee as well. I've had 2 of those for 62g protein and 54g fat so far in the day.

Total protein intake yesterday was around 130g, with 75g being from protein powder. I guess my question is...is this okay? To get half your protein from powder? Anyone else struggle to eat enough protein on keto? What were some strategies that worked for you? I'm sure whole foods are a better way to get protein but just couldn't stomach the idea of shoveling more food in...any tips? Is it a phase?

Naturally people went there since it was significantly cheaper. They claimed people should support local and it’s unfair.

Look, I love some of the local businesses in my area and I know not all of them are bad, but can we stop acting like every SLB deserved our support simply because they’re local? A lot of this SLBs have super overpriced stuff that I cannot justify spending money on.

A new burger place opened up in my area and this place charges $18-$20 for burgers. Like why should people spend $18 on a fucking burger? And it was mediocre and tastes the same as a burger half that price (I tried it). Breakfast places can also be terrible too. Tell me why I’m spending $50 on breakfast with me and another person and we only got two sandwiches/sides and two drinks? And you could argue “Oh it’s because it’s way better quality” but for the most part it’s really not. I could get stuff like this at a chain restaurant with the same quality for a lower price. Coffee shops be charging like $7-$9 dollars for a 12oz iced coffee that tastes mediocre as fuck and I can head to Dunkin’ and get a better coffee for like $3. 

Respectfully, if you want people to support your SLB, your business should be good. If you sell shitty products/services at a shitty price, I will gladly take my business elsewhere. That’s basic business 101. And I know this because there are some SLBs that also have somewhat high prices, but the product is so good I actually will come back! Local cafe sells these breakfast avocado sandwiches that are like $11 but they are extremely delicious. That’s a place I’d go back to.

So to the entitled SLB owners, if you want to charge a high price, fine. But when people don’t buy it, don’t hide behind the excuse that “people hate supporting local” no we do not. We just want quality products for a quality price. If your SLB is failing, it’s not because people won’t support local, it’s because your business sucks.",2,1742329128.0,PetPeeves,1,0.67,False

It’s alive! Super chuffed to have gotten this far. A few hiccups along the way. A short somewhere in a power cable almost caused a melt down (literally) 

I am not using the image that is in the repo as I want a bit more freedom to do what I want with this, so I’ve had to figure out how to rotate the screen with a command (echo 3 | sudo tee /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate) in my .zshrc file (installing zsh, ohmyzsh, git, mc and a few more bits)

I had a bit of a nightmare with key maps too. I wanted to be able to use the pipe character for the above command but no matter how hard I tried I could not get it to show. Turns out it was an issue with the locale being UK and not US, so whatever key I mapped always came out wrong.

My keycaps are temporary while I get used to things, I have a “clean” set of nicer ones and am considering ordered a custom set with all the layers on them from https://yuzukeycaps.com/playground once things have settled.

But once again, huge thank you to /u/Background_Ad_1810 for his incredible work, I did send you a coffee! And hope to contribute to the repo with some of the lessons I learned along the way.

1jeer14,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1jeer14/pitaka_pinbutton_case_second_revision_can/,Pitaka PinButton case (second revision) - can recommend now,"Got a package from Pitaka yesterday – the PinButton Case and MagEZ Grip.

The new revision of the case is finally on point. They’ve fixed the edge fitment and improved the NFC buttons – before, each one needed a different amount of pressure to press (at least on my unit), but now they all feel the same and have a nice, satisfying click. The aramid fiber back is, as usual, covered with a rubberized coating that gives a better grip, though it does pick up fingerprints (all my aramid cases do this). The matte silicone sides now sit flush. I feel like they could extend just a bit more over the frame and screen, but they do stick out enough to protect the glass.

The camera protection is well done – the ""big"" lenses have an extra ring around them made of the same material as the sides, while the ""small"" lens and sensors aren’t buried too deep, so you can wipe them easily when needed. The volume and power buttons (or Bixby, if anyone still uses it) have a solid click and don’t require too much force.

Now for the best part – the programmable (NFC) buttons. I honestly didn’t expect them to be this useful. Turning on the flashlight, taking a screenshot, switching sound profiles, launching a set of apps, running an app in split-screen mode – super handy. I thought I’d mess around with them once and forget about them, but now I don’t want to switch cases (even though I’ve got a few other great ones, but they don’t have NFC buttons).

MagSafe – the magnet is CRAZY strong. No way the phone is falling off a car charger or magnetic ring. But there’s a catch – when an accessory is attached (only then, no issues without one), it creates a dead zone on the screen where the S Pen doesn’t work (touch still works fine). Apparently, all magnetic cases for the S25 Ultra have this issue.

MagEZ Grip – does the job, and the ring opens with a nice bit of resistance. You can position the phone at different angles, both vertically and horizontally. Finally, I don’t have to use a coffee cup for this. That said, using it daily isn’t super convenient because it makes an already big phone even bulkier. I just keep it nearby and slap it on when needed.

Bottom line – Pitaka delivered. The first revision was disappointing, but they ironed out all the early issues with this one. Props to them for swapping out the old case for the improved version hassle-free. If not for that, things wouldn’t be so great, and this post wouldn’t even exist. 😉

Damn, these buttons are a game changer (and camera of Nokia X30 is not that bad).

Grace Bay is the heart of Providenciales, the most developed island in Turks and Caicos. If you’re wondering whether it’s possible to navigate the area without a car, the answer is yes—especially if you’re staying in the central part of Grace Bay. While Turks and Caicos as a whole isn’t known for pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, Grace Bay itself is an exception, with a collection of shops, restaurants, and services conveniently clustered within a compact, walkable area.

# The Layout of Grace Bay

Grace Bay is relatively straightforward when it comes to navigating on foot. The main stretch of the area runs along Grace Bay Road, which is lined with resorts, restaurants, shopping plazas, and a few grocery stores. Most of what you’ll need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay is within a 10- to 15-minute walk, depending on your exact location.

# Central Grace Bay: The Most Walkable Area

If you're staying at a resort or villa near Grace Bay Road—such as The Regent Grand, The Palms, Seven Stars, or The Sands—you're in the most walkable part of the island. Here, you'll find:

* **Grocery Stores:** Graceway Gourmet, the main supermarket in Grace Bay, is centrally located and easily accessible on foot from most accommodations. It’s well-stocked with fresh produce, snacks, and essentials for those who want to pick up a few items without needing a car.
* **Shops & Boutiques:** The Saltmills and Regent Village shopping areas are home to an array of boutiques, art galleries, and souvenir shops, all within a short walking distance.
* **Restaurants & Cafés:** Dining options are plentiful along Grace Bay Road, from casual spots like Shay Café for a morning coffee to more upscale restaurants such as Coco Bistro and Infiniti at Grace Bay Club. Many are within a five- to ten-minute walk from each other, making it easy to explore different options without needing transportation.

# West of Central Grace Bay: More Space, Fewer Shops

As you move west past The Palms and The Somerset, walkability becomes a bit more limited. Resorts in this area, such as The Ritz-Carlton and Wymara, are still within a reasonable walking distance of Graceway Gourmet and some restaurants, but options start to thin out. You’ll find more beachfront resorts and fewer commercial spaces, so while the walk is pleasant, it may require a bit more planning for dining and shopping.

# East of Central Grace Bay: Quiet and Residential

On the eastern side of Grace Bay, near The Shore Club, things become even less pedestrian-friendly. Long Bay Beach, located here, is beautiful and far less crowded than the main Grace Bay Beach, but it’s not as walkable. If you're staying in this area, renting a car or using a taxi might be a better option for accessing grocery stores and restaurants.

# Sidewalks and Street Safety

While Grace Bay Road has sidewalks in the main commercial areas, they can be inconsistent in some sections, requiring pedestrians to walk alongside the road. Traffic is generally light, but it's important to stay aware, especially at night. Street lighting is limited in some spots, so if you plan to walk after dark, a small flashlight or using your phone’s flashlight feature can be helpful.

# When You Might Need a Car

For most first-time visitors staying in the central part of Grace Bay, a car isn’t necessary. However, if you plan on exploring beyond Grace Bay—to places like Chalk Sound, Sapodilla Bay, or the less-developed beaches on the island’s western side—a rental car is recommended. Taxis are also available, but they can be pricey, especially for longer distances.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a traveler who enjoys walking and prefers to explore at a leisurely pace, Grace Bay is one of the few areas in Turks and Caicos where that’s possible. Staying in a central location will make your experience more convenient, allowing you to easily walk to restaurants, shops, and grocery stores.

I'm pumped because I love me some cold brew in the summer. I have a 64oz Yeti french press I was gifted for christmas and I now want to make a week's worth of brew in it to save time in the mornings. 

I care about controlling my caffeine intake, I aim to have no more than 160mg caffeine in the morning to make sure I sleep well. 

I leveraged our friend Chat GPT to make this recipe. My goal is to have each serving contain roughly 155mg of caffeine. I'm using caribou coffee medium roast here. I'm seeking feedback on it based on everyone's experience here. 

  
121 grams of coarse grind coffee beans with 58oz of water. I plan on steeping in the 24 hour range. I'll pour it into a glass pitcher, clean out the yeti, then put it all back into the yeti and put on my Yeti normal pitcher lid to store. Pour out 7oz every morning for a fast brew. 

Thoughts/opinions? Thanks in advance!",1,1742328858.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False
1jeenlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/S25Ultra/comments/1jeenlj/pitaka_pinbutton_case_second_revision_can/,Pitaka PinButton case (second revision) - can recommend now,"Got a package from Pitaka yesterday – the PinButton Case and MagEZ Grip.

The new revision of the case is finally on point. They’ve fixed the edge fitment and improved the NFC buttons – before, each one needed a different amount of pressure to press (at least on my unit), but now they all feel the same and have a nice, satisfying click. The aramid fiber back is, as usual, covered with a rubberized coating that gives a better grip, though it does pick up fingerprints (all my aramid cases do this). The matte silicone sides now sit flush. I feel like they could extend just a bit more over the frame and screen, but they do stick out enough to protect the glass.

The camera protection is well done – the ""big"" lenses have an extra ring around them made of the same material as the sides, while the ""small"" lens and sensors aren’t buried too deep, so you can wipe them easily when needed. The volume and power buttons (or Bixby, if anyone still uses it) have a solid click and don’t require too much force.

Now for the best part – the programmable (NFC) buttons. I honestly didn’t expect them to be this useful. Turning on the flashlight, taking a screenshot, switching sound profiles, launching a set of apps, running an app in split-screen mode – super handy. I thought I’d mess around with them once and forget about them, but now I don’t want to switch cases (even though I’ve got a few other great ones, but they don’t have NFC buttons).

MagSafe – the magnet is CRAZY strong. No way the phone is falling off a car charger or magnetic ring. But there’s a catch – when an accessory is attached (only then, no issues without one), it creates a dead zone on the screen where the S Pen doesn’t work (touch still works fine). Apparently, all magnetic cases for the S25 Ultra have this issue.

MagEZ Grip – does the job, and the ring opens with a nice bit of resistance. You can position the phone at different angles, both vertically and horizontally. Finally, I don’t have to use a coffee cup for this. That said, using it daily isn’t super convenient because it makes an already big phone even bulkier. I just keep it nearby and slap it on when needed.

Bottom line – Pitaka delivered. The first revision was disappointing, but they ironed out all the early issues with this one. Props to them for swapping out the old case for the improved version hassle-free. If not for that, things wouldn’t be so great, and this post wouldn’t even exist. 😉

Damn, these buttons are a game changer (and camera of Nokia X30 is not that bad).

1jeem6a,https://i.redd.it/o3r04s7u9ipe1.jpeg,Coffee Dipped Adidas,"Love how these turned out. Added dark brown laces. 

Step 1. Buy all white Adidas Rivalry sneakers. (I got mine on sale for $22)

Step 2. Grab one of your Mothers-In-Law’s bricks of Cafe Bustelo.

Step 3. Acetone the entire exterior of both shoes. Remove laces and insert.

Step 4. Add enough boiling water to fully submerge the shoes in a big Home Depot bucket. Mix in the Bustelo brick.

Step 5. Add Adidas Rivalry’s and make sure they are fully submerged. I used a big plate to keep them from floating.

Step 6. Soak the shoes for 2.5 hours. 

Step 7. Remove from water and thoroughly rinse with water. Get all the coffee grounds out.

Step 8. Air dry the sneakers for 2 days. ",5,1742328725.0,Sneakers,0,0.86,False
