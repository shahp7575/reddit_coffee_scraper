Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 21st, 1993

The hum of the Rust Bucket's engine is a constant, grating buzz against the drumming in my ears. This isn't the usual low thrum of road trip anticipation; it's the high-pitched whine of anxiety, a sound that's become far too familiar these past few days. The meds help, or are supposed to, but lately it's like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose.

I initiated the ruse this morning. The Bulletin Board System, bless its digital heart, allowed me to reach Soror XI with some carefully crafted prose. I framed my message as a desperate plea, a confession of impending mental collapse. \[Three-week sabbatical,\] I typed, my fingers clicking against the keyboard in a nervous rhythm. \[Need to…regroup. Reassess. My mind… it feels like a broken radio, tuning into too many frequencies at once.\] I threw in a few dramatic ellipses for good measure.

The truth, of course, is only partially there. Yes, I feel it, the familiar clawing at the edges of my sanity. But it's not the breakdown she imagines, at least not yet. It's the sheer weight of what I've been uncovering, the unnerving puzzle pieces that have been falling into place – or not falling into place – these past days. What I'm feeling is a pressing need to address the situation at hand.

Soror XI, bless her rigid, bureaucratic soul, bought it hook, line, and sinker. She responded immediately, her message a flurry of concern wrapped in her typical clipped tone. \[Jim,\] she wrote. \[Your request is approved. We will air re-runs of your broadcast to maintain the schedule. Focus on your well-being. Really. This time off will do you a world of good.\] That last part was almost gentle, which, coming from her, is practically a hug. A hug that made me feel like a scoundrel for lying- for using my mental illness to manipulate. But I needed this, needed the freedom to move without scrutiny. She's probably relieved, I think, that I seem to have finally dropped the line of questioning pertaining to the previous Saturday's broadcast.

Leaving Scrimbus was like shedding a skin. I packed my faithful Datsun with the usual gear – camera, recording equipment, my expensive laptop with satellite link – and threw in a couple of weeks' worth of supplies. I drove east first, heading towards Anson. I needed to see Manny, needed to have a closer look at those photos that sparked the initial alarm when he called me at four in the damned morning.

The meeting with Manny at the gas station where we first met was brief and tense. He handed me the envelope containing the photos without a word, his eyes darting around like he expected someone to emerge from the shadows. The images were more disturbing up close, particularly the ones on I-35 right outside Waxahachie. The blurred, indistinct symbols, the unnatural distortion of light; all of it reinforced my belief that this was tied into the anomalies that wormed their way into my show. He also had another photo, one of the figure I had seen on my live broadcast, but this one was much clearer, with the distinctive red robes and pointy capriote as plain as could be.

The drive towards Waxahachie felt wrong somehow, a feeling that seemed to gather like static electricity around me. I kept glancing in the rearview mirror, the red-tinted lenses of my spectacles distorting the road and the sky into something vaguely sinister. I stopped at a truck stop in Thurber about halfway, the kind with greasy burgers and stale coffee. I needed to eat and get gas (Hah! Fart joke. Don't judge. I need to find amusement where I can.). The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a discordant harmony to the anxiety gnawing at my insides. I was just digging into my meal, having applied a generous amount of A1 sauce to my burger when a payphone on the wall next to the john began to ring.

It's for me again. I know it. I hesitated, a strange sense of dread prickling my skin. But the ringing persisted, insistent, and I found myself reaching for the receiver.

""Hello?"" My voice sounded tight, even to my own ears.

A frantic voice crackled on the other end, a voice I recognized immediately. ""Jim, it's Suzie! They're everywhere! NAORC, they're all over Santa Fe! They're like... like cockroaches, crawling all over the place! And... and... "" Her voice broke, a choked sob cutting through the static. ""This has never happened previously; they're everywhere!"" And then the line went dead. Previously, she said... like the unfolding events were a movie she'd seen many times before. Was she watching the director's cut this time?

I stood there, the phone receiver still pressed to my ear, the grease in my fries instantly congealed. New Mexico. NAORC. This wasn't some isolated incident; this was a coordinated movement, a deliberate breach, and Suzie had just confirmed what I feared all along: that this wasn't just about the 'Other' presence. It was something far bigger, something far more insidious. The NAORC were never this bold in the past, usually sticking to their cloak-and-dagger routine. They are tenuous allies to the EOTO, but their goals are, to say the least, sinister.

My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat a frantic drum against the rising tide of panic. I couldn't go to Waxahachie. Not now. I needed to see what was happening in Santa Fe. I needed to meet this mysterious Suzie. I slammed the receiver back into its cradle, my mind racing, calculating. I grabbed my things, my appetite suddenly gone. The greasy burger remained half-eaten on the table, a monument to my abruptly derailed plans.

I was back in the Rust Bucket within minutes, the engine roaring as I tore out of the parking lot, heading west. The road was a blur, the landscape flashing by in a dizzying rush. The anxiety was still there, but it was now laced with a cold, focused rage. My hand tightened around the steering wheel, the ouroboros ring on my right hand feeling like a burning brand. The EOTO had taken me in, given me purpose, and I'll be damned if all they've done for me has gone to waste, even if they secretly knew something was going down.

It was well past sunset when I crossed the state line. The sign read: ""Welcome to New Mexico, Land of Enchantment."" But there was no enchantment here, only a chilling sense of foreboding. As I drove onwards into the vast expanse of the New Mexico dark, I glanced in the rearview mirror. There, for just a fleeting second, was a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold; a red figure, robed and indistinct, standing at the edge of the darkness behind me, its very presence an echo of the chilling image from my broadcast. I could feel its gaze on me, and it sent a shiver down my spine. It could just be a trick of the dim lighting, or the exhaustion of the long drive. But I knew one thing, without a shadow of a doubt; I wasn't alone.

And whatever this 'thing' was, whatever its purpose, had followed me to New Mexico.",1,1737634648.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1i820km,https://i.redd.it/6yrmzndojqee1.png,The Kaleidoscope of Self: Navigating the Landscape of an Extraordinary Personality • [Click to Expand],"## Embracing the Extraordinary: A Journey Through Adventure, Creativity, and Intellect



Let's dive into a world where personality isn't just a static concept, but a dynamic, ever-evolving landscape of human potential. Imagine a person who doesn't just exist, but truly lives – someone who embodies the perfect blend of adventure, artistry, intelligence, creativity, drive, and wit.

At the core of such a personality is an insatiable curiosity that refuses to be contained by conventional boundaries. Picture someone who walks into a room and immediately transforms the energy – not through loud proclamations, but through a subtle, magnetic presence that hints at deeper layers waiting to be explored. This is the essence of a truly remarkable individual.

Adventure isn't just about physical journeys; it's a state of mind. For the adventurous spirit, life is an ongoing exploration, a continuous process of pushing boundaries and challenging personal limits. It's about seeing the world not as a fixed landscape, but as an infinite canvas of possibilities. Think of those moments when you've stepped outside your comfort zone – maybe it was striking up a conversation with a stranger, learning a new skill, or taking a spontaneous trip to an unknown destination. That's the spirit of adventure.

Artistic sensibility adds another rich dimension to this personality. It's not about being a professional artist, but about seeing the world through a creative lens. Every experience becomes a potential masterpiece – the way light catches a coffee cup, the rhythm of a city street, the intricate dance of human interactions. An artistic personality finds beauty in the mundane, transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences, and approaches life with the same creativity one might apply to painting or composing music.

Intelligence here isn't just about academic achievements or IQ scores. It's a dynamic intelligence that combines critical thinking, emotional depth, and adaptive creativity. This is the kind of intelligence that asks profound questions, connects seemingly unrelated ideas, and approaches challenges with both analytical precision and imaginative thinking. It's the ability to look at a problem and see not just obstacles, but opportunities for innovation and growth.

Creativity flows through this personality like an electric current. It's not confined to traditional artistic expressions but manifests in problem-solving, communication, and approach to life. Imagine someone who can turn a mundane work meeting into an engaging storytelling session, or transform a simple meal into a culinary adventure. Creativity is about seeing potential where others see limitations.

Drive is the engine that propels this extraordinary personality forward. It's not just ambition in the traditional sense, but a deep-seated passion for growth, learning, and making a meaningful impact. This isn't about relentless hustle, but about a genuine commitment to personal and collective progress. It's the difference between merely existing and truly living – between going through the motions and creating ripples of positive change.

Wit adds the sparkling layer of humor and intelligence. It's not about making jokes, but about a quick, sharp understanding of human nature that can turn any situation into an opportunity for insight and laughter. Wit is intelligence in its most playful form – the ability to see the humor in life's complexities, to lighten serious moments, and to connect with others through intelligent, nuanced communication.

These qualities don't exist in isolation. They interact, blend, and create a personality that is greater than the sum of its parts. It's like a sophisticated jazz ensemble, where each instrument (or quality) has its unique voice, but together they create something truly magical.

But here's the beautiful truth – this extraordinary personality isn't some unattainable ideal. It's a potential that exists within each of us. We all have the capacity to cultivate these qualities, to become more adventurous, more creative, more intelligent, more driven. It's about making conscious choices, embracing growth, and refusing to be limited by our current circumstances.

The journey isn't about perfection, but about continuous exploration. It's about being kind to yourself, embracing your unique quirks, and understanding that personal growth is a lifelong adventure. Some days you'll feel like you're firing on all cylinders, and other days you might feel stuck – and that's completely okay.

Ultimately, this extraordinary personality is about authenticity. It's about having the courage to be genuinely, unapologetically yourself – complex, evolving, sometimes messy, but always fascinating.

1i81xhx,https://youtu.be/i7t8V_eY3LY?si=wLeDZSYq_QOJz9W5,I CURED MY SIBO/SIFO/HPYLORI/ GUT WITH A CARNIVORE DIET & A 7 DAY BONE BROTH FAST,"It makes me so incredibly happy to finally make this post. I’ve been suffering with severe digestive problems for over 2 years. Symptoms consisting of bloating, gas, diarrhea and constipation, malnutrition, anxiety and many more. I had legitimately tried everything. 4 different doctors, 5 different anti fungals and antibiotics. I spent over 1k in doctor visits, medication and supplements. Some supplements suppressed my symptoms, but none of them actually eliminated the problem all together. 

Once I could only eat egg whites and potatoes without feeling bloated to the point I felt like I was going to pop, I switched to a carnivore diet. Switched to eating beef, eggs, butter and bacon and within 3 days I noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in my symptoms. About 75% of my symptoms were gone and for once I had some sort of relief. After about 3 months my symptoms slowly started to come back, so I knew I had to do something else. I tried more supplements and tried a 5 supplement protocol that I found on this Reddit page. 2 weeks into the protocol I felt great! But once the protocol was done my symptoms came back. I knew I needed to starve whatever was in my body. 

Came across a video on YouTube from Matthew Armstrong where he said he cured his digestive problems with a 12 day fast. It was the fastest video I had ever clicked on lol. I followed exactly what he did and did a bone broth fast (not technically a fast, but still starving the bad bacteria while repairing the gut lining). Video link below 

https://youtu.be/i7t8V_eY3LY?si=wLeDZSYq_QOJz9W5

I drank 32 ounces of store bought bone broth a day, (1 jar lasted me a day, would split it up into 3 portions). About 2 days into the bone broth fast, I began to have rashes 
all over my body, mostly my back and was extremely itchy. This meant that whatever was in my body was dying off rapidly. Instead of doing the 12 days, I ended my bone broth fast after 7 1/2 days, breaking it with 1 hard boiled egg with butter. Waited about 2 hours and had a cup of sauerkraut to add good bacteria back into my gut. A few hours later I had a bowl of vegetable soup ( BEFORE I COULDNT EAT ANY VEGETABLES WITHOUT BEING BLOATED AND IN PAIN FOR OVER 24 HOURS) and after eating the soup I had no bloating, no side effects, and felt great. This was the first time in over 2 years that I had ate something that would normally mess me up and had no problems. Complete game changer. 

I am happy to say that I am back to eating a keto diet consisting of animal based products with light fruit and veg and feel absolutely amazing. I did loose a little bit of fat and muscle during the fast but I’m okay, being that I had a good amount of muscle to start. 

If you want to do this, you first need to see if your in a position to do this. If you are severely malnourished to begin with, this might not be safe for you. Contact your doctor first to get the green light. first get carbs and sugars out of your diet. Next stop drinking coffee. This will help you with headaches during the fast. If you use vapes or smoke, STOP. The nicotine can throw off the PH level in your gut and you won’t make progress. ",1,1737634239.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

Well, you're in luck because I'm about to share my expertise on the most reliable coffee makers out there. Before we dive in, just a heads up: I'm not affiliated with any coffee maker brands, so you can trust that my recommendations are unbiased. Also, keep in mind that even the best coffee makers can have occasional issues, so don't say I didn't warn you.

### What Makes a Coffee Maker Reliable?
To me, a reliable coffee maker is one that consistently produces great-tasting coffee, is easy to use, and can withstand daily wear and tear. It's like having a trusty sidekick in the kitchen - you know it's got your back, even on the most chaotic of mornings. In my experience, a reliable coffee maker should have a few key features, including:
1. Durable materials (think stainless steel or high-quality plastic)
2. Simple, intuitive controls
3. A robust heating element that can maintain a consistent temperature
4. Easy cleaning and maintenance

### Top Picks for Reliable Coffee Makers
Now, let's get to the good stuff. Here are my top picks for reliable coffee makers that you can count on:
1. **Bonavita BV1900TS**: This 8-cup coffee maker is a favorite among coffee enthusiasts, and for good reason. It's got a sleek design, a powerful heating element, and a simple, one-touch interface. Plus, it's made with durable materials that can withstand daily use.
2. **Cuisinart DCC-3200**: This 14-cup coffee maker is a workhorse that can handle even the busiest of households. It's got a range of features, including a built-in grinder and a customizable brew strength, but it's still relatively easy to use.

### Things to Consider When Choosing a Coffee Maker
Before you make a purchase, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, think about your budget - coffee makers can range from under $50 to over $500, so it's essential to set a price point before you start shopping. I typically recommend spending at least $100 to get a reliable coffee maker that will last. You should also consider the size of your household and how much coffee you drink on a daily basis. If you're a solo coffee drinker, a smaller coffee maker might be the way to go, but if you've got a big family or like to entertain, you'll want something with a bit more capacity.

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Finally, let's talk about maintenance and troubleshooting. Even the most reliable coffee makers need a bit of TLC to keep them running smoothly. I recommend descaling your coffee maker every few months to prevent mineral buildup, and cleaning the brew basket and carafe regularly to prevent bacterial growth. If you do encounter any issues, don't panic - most coffee makers come with a warranty, and many manufacturers have great customer support. Just remember, a reliable coffee maker is like a good friend - it's got your back, but you've got to take care of it too.

In my experience, with a bit of research and maintenance, you can find a coffee maker that will become your new best friend. Just remember to do your research, read reviews, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Happy coffee brewing!",1,1737633296.0,ConsumerCuriosities,0,1.0,False

I am unsure if the moka pot extracts all 400mg but I suspect that it does not. As I also use caffeine pills and 400mg in caffeine pills feels radically different than my morning coffee.

I am also take magnesium, selenium, zinc, vitamin e and vitamin a in varying levels depending on my diet in order to max out all rda’s. I use chronometer to figure out what all I'm missing, I cook almost all of my own food from scratch so this is pretty easy.

But don’t let limited square footage compromise your style or comfort. The right [small sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) can transform a cozy living room, studio apartment, or compact corner into a functional and inviting space. Here’s how to choose the best compact and stylish [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) that fits your lifestyle.

# 1. The Versatility of a Two Seater Sofa

A [two seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) is the ultimate space-saving solution. Perfect for smaller living rooms, it provides ample seating while maintaining a sleek profile that doesn’t overwhelm the room. Its size and versatility make it ideal for apartments, dorm rooms, or even as a secondary seating option in larger spaces.

**Style Tip:** Pair a [2 seater couch](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) with a stylish coffee table and a rug to create a cohesive look. Opt for neutral tones like beige, gray, or pastel to make the room feel more open and airy.

# 2. Compact Sofas with Built-In Storage

In small spaces, multifunctional furniture is a game-changer. A small sofa with built-in storage compartments helps you maximize your space. Store extra blankets, pillows, or books in the hidden compartments to keep your living area tidy and organized.

**Pro Tip:** Look for sofas with sleek armrests or armless designs to save even more space.

# 3. Modular Sofas for Flexibility

Modular sofas are another excellent choice for small spaces. Their customizable sections allow you to rearrange seating based on your needs. You can use a two seater sofa as the base and add or remove pieces as your space evolves.

**Best for Small Homes:** A modular 2 seater couch can double as a lounge or even a guest bed by rearranging the modules.

# 4. Sofa Beds for Dual Functionality

If you’re short on both seating and sleeping space, a sofa bed is a practical solution. Modern designs combine the aesthetics of a small sofa with the convenience of a pull-out bed, ensuring your guests have a comfortable place to sleep without sacrificing your decor.

**Style Tip:** Choose a fabric or leather finish that complements the rest of your home furniture for a polished look.

# 5. Slim Profiles for a Minimalist Aesthetic

For a truly compact option, choose a two seater sofa with a slim, minimalist frame. Designs with narrow arms and raised legs create the illusion of more space while maintaining a contemporary vibe.

**Design Tip:** Add decorative throw pillows or a cozy blanket to soften the look and add personality.

# Key Features to Look for in a Small Sofa

When shopping for a small sofa or 2 seater couch, prioritize the following:

1. **Size and Proportions**: Measure your space to ensure the sofa fits comfortably without overcrowding.
2. **Material**: Choose durable and easy-to-clean fabrics, especially for high-traffic areas.
3. **Color Palette**: Light colors make small rooms feel bigger, while darker tones add coziness.
4. **Storage Options**: Opt for designs with built-in storage to maximize functionality.

**Why a Two Seater Sofa is Perfect for Your Home**

A two seater sofa strikes the perfect balance between functionality and style. Its compact size allows it to fit into small spaces, yet it’s big enough to accommodate two people comfortably. Additionally, it pairs seamlessly with other home furniture, such as accent chairs or side tables, to create a complete look.

**Where to Find the Best Sofas for Small Spaces**

Whether you’re looking for a classic 2 seater couch or a contemporary small sofa, exploring a wide range of options ensures you’ll find the perfect fit. In addition to visiting local showrooms, online retailers offer an extensive selection of compact sofas in various styles, fabrics, and price points.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding the perfect sofa for a small space doesn’t have to be complicated. With thoughtful design and smart features, compact sofas like a two seater sofa or modular options can enhance both the style and functionality of your home. Whether you’re redecorating or furnishing a new space, these tips will help you choose the ideal home furniture to maximize comfort without compromising style.

A well-crafted woodworking plan ensures your project goes smoothly, saves time, and prevents costly mistakes. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about making woodworking plans, from design basics to drafting a detailed blueprint.

# Understanding [Woodworking Plans](https://freepage.pro/Didarfree/Teds-Woodworking-)

Woodworking plans are detailed instructions and diagrams that guide you through building a specific project. A good plan includes dimensions, materials lists, and assembly steps. Whether you're crafting a simple shelf or a complex piece of furniture, the plan serves as your roadmap.

Key components of a woodworking plan include:

* **Project Overview:** A description and visual representation.
* **Materials List:** All the wood, tools, and hardware you'll need.
* **Cutting List:** Details on how to prepare your materials.
* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** A clear guide to assembling the project.

There are several types of woodworking plans, including furniture, outdoor structures like pergolas, and decorative items such as wooden carvings.

# Planning Your Woodworking Project

Start by defining the purpose of your project. Is it functional, decorative, or both? Choose a project suited to your skill level and available tools. Beginners might opt for a basic coffee table, while seasoned woodworkers could attempt intricate cabinetry.

Assess your resources:

* **Skill Level:** Choose projects that challenge you without being overwhelming.
* **Tools:** Ensure you have the right equipment, from saws to sanders.
* **Budget:** Plan for the cost of wood, hardware, and finishes.

# [Design Basics for Woodworking Plans](https://freepage.pro/Didarfree/Teds-Woodworking-)

Successful woodworking starts with a solid design. Pay attention to:

* **Measuring and Scaling:** Precision is critical. Use a ruler, tape measure, and scale to ensure your dimensions are accurate.
* **Wood Types and Grain Directions:** Different woods behave differently. Consider grain direction to avoid splitting.
* **Joinery Techniques:** Common methods include dovetail joints, mortise and tenon, and pocket screws.

# Tools and Software for Creating Woodworking Plans

Traditional methods, like graph paper and a pencil, are great for beginners. For more complex designs, digital tools such as SketchUp or Fusion 360 allow you to create precise 3D models. These tools also let you visualize your project from all angles, ensuring accuracy.

# Steps to Create a Woodworking Plan

1. **Sketch the Initial Design:** Start with a freehand sketch to map out your ideas.
2. **Draft the Blueprint:** Use tools to create a detailed drawing with dimensions and joinery details.
3. **Materials List:** Include everything needed, from wood to screws.
4. **Step-by-Step Guide:** Break the project into manageable steps.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid pitfalls like:

* **Overcomplicating the Design:** Keep it simple, especially for beginners.
* **Inaccurate Measurements:** Double-check your numbers to prevent wasted materials.
* **Ignoring Wood Movement:** Account for seasonal wood expansion and contraction.

# [Practical Examples of Woodworking Plans](https://freepage.pro/Didarfree/Teds-Woodworking-)

Start with projects like a simple bench, a bookshelf, or an Adirondack chair. These projects are beginner-friendly and provide valuable experience in measuring, cutting, and assembly.

# Tips for Beginners

For those new to woodworking:

* Choose simple projects.
* Invest in quality tools.
* Learn from existing plans, modifying them as needed.

# Resources for Learning and Inspiration

Explore platforms like Etsy and Instructables for pre-made plans. YouTube tutorials and books such as *The Complete Manual of Woodworking* are excellent resources.

# Conclusion

I thought it was a draft of a book he’s been working on. He hand writes drafts in notebooks. It was not his book. It was a journal, and I opened to a page where he was discussing his desire to have a relationship with a student. He teaches college. 

He wrote things like not wanting to forget an outfit she wore to a meeting. They had over coffee. He also wrote about some email exchanges. They had where he was looking forward to more conversation. I know who the student is, and I’ve met her. In his journal, he wrote about how he was disappointed that she had written in an email something along the lines of “say hi to [OP] for me.”

Obviously, I confronted him about this. This is not the only issue in our relationship. Shocking, right? I’d be mad if it were about another real adult, but the power dynamics and grooming issue here make me feel disgust. He downplayed the whole thing and suggested I was overreacting and that he was just writing, but had no intentions. I obviously don’t buy that and I’ve never written about a student in the way he wrote about this student.

I had been asking him for about two years before this to either see a counselor with me or see a therapist on his own. We both have our own high functioning, mental health issues, but I’m the only one to admit it. Our issues impact our ability to communicate and our relationship generally so I wanted some help with a counselor in figuring that out, or at least a therapist to help us both individually work on ourselves. I’ve been doing that on my own with a therapist.

I’m so fed up with him avoiding any sort of outside help. I told him that I want a divorce. He says he doesn’t want one. I think his reasons are really just about our child and optics/embarrassment. He thinks it’s better to stay married for our child. I disagree and worry about how our son may be internalizing what it is to have a marriage from our broken one.

When I first found the information (8 months ago), I again asked him to do marriage counseling which he did for about four weeks. We had some individual sessions with the counselor. She told me in an individual session that she did not feel he was invested in the work.

Here’s my question, or why I came here: I gave him an ultimatum a few days ago. Find a therapist (just for him) and see one weekly for six months, starting in two weeks’ time. We have access to therapists in our area and the resources to cover this. I told him I will definitely file for divorce if he didn’t see a therapist. He is going to think about it (is seeing a therapist really so bad that divorce is a better option?!)… is my request just stupid? Is forcing him to see one, if he actually does, just a waste of time?

I  developed anemia after 3 years of having an eating disorder and soul-crushing stress. My hair all broke drastically and I lost so much length but when I started fainting and my heart was beating extremely fast out of the blue that's when I went and got checked. I had very low hemoglobin (6g/dL) and low ferritin (0.3) so the doctor gave me iron infusions I really don't know what their dosage is but it was one pack. Then I started taking  80mg supplement of ferrous sulfate. I also took a variety of vitamin supplements for a month then I only kept taken the iron and vitamin c for almost 5 months. I also started eating alot more mostly iron rich foods. I don't know if it's only psychosomatic or not but I could feel my body feeling more grounded and okay. I no longer faint unexpectedly and my heart beats don't feel very fast like before. I also started getting more normal periods since i used to not have them for several months or just get spotting. I still occasionally hyperventilate sometimes (it's probably just small panic attacks) 

I took the blood tests today again and my hemoglobin is 14.7 but ferritin is 5.9. The ferritin is still very low for me a 21 female. I have no other disease and no heavy periods. Is this ferritin slow growth normal? I took a stool test too after my doctor recommended it and apparently I have no problems with absorption.  I'm still taking my 80mg supplements but I'm not sure they're enough. 
Tbh I drink maximum 30mg of caffeine a day because it makes me feel good (I lowered the doses because the heart palpitations were freaking me out but just one mug of 1 teaspoon of ground coffee feels okay)
So could the coffee be the problem with this or is ferritin growth just this slow? I've read here some ppl who got it back on track after few weeks only.. also the hair shedding and thining has plummeted my mood and self esteem so I really want more advice to get my iron back on track to make my hair as thick as it used to be years ago. Should i be taking a different type of iron supplements?

It’s not just about weight loss—it can stabilize cholesterol, improve digestion, and even enhance your sleep!

When you fast, your body taps into its fat stores for energy, helping to shed those extra pounds. While it’s effective, losing belly fat specifically takes a bit more effort. Combine fasting with a balanced diet, portion control, and consistent physical activity to see lasting results.

During your fast, stick to water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea to avoid breaking the fast. And when it’s time to eat, focus on nutrient-dense meals with lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains.

[Mocha iced coffee](https://gomehedi.com/what-is-a-mocha-coffee/) combines the rich flavors of coffee and chocolate. It’s the perfect drink for warm days or when you need a cool caffeine boost. Making this delicious treat at home is simple and quick. You can control the sweetness and strength to suit your taste.

Plus, you save money by skipping the coffee shop. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to make your own mocha iced coffee. Get ready to enjoy a delightful, homemade beverage that’s sure to satisfy your coffee cravings.

# Ingredients Needed

Making a delicious mocha iced coffee at home requires the right ingredients. Each component contributes to the perfect balance of flavors. Let’s explore the key ingredients needed to create your ideal mocha iced coffee.

# Coffee Selection

The foundation of any great mocha iced coffee is the coffee itself. Choosing the right coffee can make a big difference in taste and aroma. Here are some options to consider:

* **Espresso:** A strong and bold choice. Espresso offers a rich flavor that stands up well to chocolate and milk.
* **Cold Brew:** Smooth and less acidic. Cold brew provides a mellow taste that blends well with sweeteners and chocolate.
* **Regular Brewed Coffee:** Convenient and versatile. Use your favorite ground coffee and brew it strong for a robust flavor.

For a detailed comparison, check the table below:

|Coffee Type|Flavor Profile|Strength|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Espresso|Rich and Bold|High|
|Cold Brew|Smooth and Mellow|Medium|
|Regular Brewed Coffee|Versatile|Varies|

# Chocolate Options

Chocolate is the heart of a mocha iced coffee. It adds sweetness and a depth of flavor. Here are some chocolate options to consider:

* **Cocoa Powder:** Unsweetened and versatile. Mix it with sugar to control sweetness.
* **Chocolate Syrup:** Convenient and easy to blend. Provides a consistent sweetness and rich flavor.
* **Chocolate Chips:** Melt them for a thicker, richer chocolate taste.

Choosing the right chocolate can impact the final taste. Consider these factors:

|Chocolate Type|Sweetness|Ease of Use|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cocoa Powder|Low (adjustable)|Medium|
|Chocolate Syrup|High|High|
|Chocolate Chips|Medium|Low|

# Milk Choices

Milk adds creaminess and balances the flavors in mocha iced coffee. Here are some milk options:

* **Whole Milk:** Rich and creamy. It provides a full-bodied texture.
* **Skim Milk:** Lighter option. It has less fat but still offers a creamy feel.
* **Plant-Based Milk:** Almond, soy, or oat milk. Great for those who are lactose intolerant or prefer a dairy-free option.

1i810ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i810ea/the_role_of_furniture_in_creating_a_cozy_and/,The Role of Furniture in Creating a Cozy and Inviting Atmosphere,"[Furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) is the cornerstone of any home’s design. It not only defines the functionality of your space but also sets the tone for how inviting and comfortable it feels. By carefully selecting and arranging your furniture, you can create a warm, cozy atmosphere that’s perfect for relaxation and welcoming guests. Here’s how the right furniture can transform your home into a haven of comfort and style.

# 1. Comfort First: Creating Spaces That Feel Like Home

Cozy spaces prioritize comfort without sacrificing style. Plush sofas, ergonomic chairs, and well-padded seating encourage relaxation. Adding complementary furniture like a [large coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) in the center of your living room can create a focal point, making the space feel more cohesive.

**Tip:** Choose a table with natural wood tones or a sleek [metal coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) for a balance of warmth and contemporary design. These pieces can add a mix of textures that enhance the cozy ambiance.

# 2. Layering with Multifunctional Pieces

Incorporating multifunctional furniture is a smart way to make your home feel cozy while optimizing space. For example, a large coffee table with built-in storage keeps your living area tidy and clutter-free, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere.

**Design Insight:** Look for [contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) that combines aesthetics with functionality. Modern designs with clean lines and neutral tones lend a sophisticated yet cozy feel to your interiors.

# 3. Balancing Textures and Materials

The materials of your furniture can significantly impact the overall ambiance of a room. Mixing soft fabrics with harder surfaces like glass or metal creates a visually interesting contrast. A metal coffee table, for instance, can add an industrial-chic vibe while complementing the softness of a plush sofa or textured rug.

**Pro Tip:** Combine contemporary pieces with natural elements like wooden accent chairs or woven poufs to create a space that feels balanced and inviting.

# 4. Creating Intimate Gathering Spaces

Furniture placement plays a crucial role in fostering connection and comfort. Arrange sofas and chairs around a large coffee table to create an intimate seating area where conversations can flow easily. Keep the furniture layout close-knit but avoid overcrowding to maintain a sense of openness.

**Styling Suggestion:** Add soft lighting with floor lamps or table lamps, and accessorize with cozy throws and cushions to enhance the warmth of the room.

# 5. The Importance of a Welcoming Entryway

Your entryway sets the tone for your home. A well-placed bench, console table, or storage ottoman creates a functional yet inviting space. Contemporary furniture in neutral tones works beautifully in this area, ensuring your guests feel welcome as soon as they step inside.

# 6. Incorporating Statement Furniture Pieces

Statement pieces like a **metal coffee table** or an oversized armchair can anchor the room and add character. These elements can make the space feel thoughtfully curated while enhancing its overall coziness.

**Design Idea:** Choose a large coffee table with a bold finish or unique shape to serve as both a functional and artistic addition to your living space.

# 7. Adding Personal Touches to Complete the Look

While furniture creates the foundation of a cozy atmosphere, accessories bring the space to life. Add personal touches like family photos, vases, or books to your furniture surfaces to make the room feel lived-in and welcoming.

**Quick Tip:** Decorate your metal coffee table with a stack of design books and a textured centerpiece to strike a perfect balance between style and functionality.

**Why Contemporary Furniture Is Perfect for a Cozy Home**

Contemporary furniture is all about simplicity, clean lines, and functionality. Its versatility allows it to fit seamlessly into a variety of decor styles, from modern minimalism to rustic charm. By blending contemporary pieces with softer textures and warm lighting, you can achieve a cozy yet sophisticated aesthetic that works in every room of your home.

**Final Thoughts**

The right furniture can transform any space into a cozy retreat. Whether it’s a large coffee table that becomes the heart of your living room or a sleek metal coffee table that adds a modern edge, choosing furniture thoughtfully can create an atmosphere that’s both inviting and functional. By combining textures, layering materials, and arranging pieces to foster connection, you’ll create a home that’s a true reflection of comfort and style.

I am third-year student at a university with hybrid learning, alternating campus and online sessions. I had a charismatic and engaging lecturer in their first year, who provided valuable insights into my career and my path to professionalism. However, in my second year, new lecturers introduced unfamiliar material, making it difficult for all students to ask questions and stay informed. So I was popping up to old lecturer to ask about materials because he was learning this modules previously.

So sometimes we popped out for cheeky coffee or beer after my classes, and therefore different backgrounds (I am Eastern European, he is Southern Asian, not Muslim leaving over 30 years here without any Asian fellows) and we do shared common interests. We have been hanging out 2-3 times on every single semester, but on last meeting he questioned me about ""official dating"" due to potential instability. But I do believe and responded him straight away that our relationship is more of a friendship stage, with a power imbalance, and I do have ethical concerns about close relationship between lecturers and students.

Both of us after this conversation get upset and he asked if he refuses to learn in my class will be possibility to date and for future relationship, and I told him that he can refuse one-two time to his manager but if that will be too frequent he can get fired, and when our relationship will came out citing ostracism will be on both sides, but he can destroy his own career because of it. So we went in different directions. And he started to ignore me in campus lessons (tbh I am not surprised, that was on my wish), despite his previous questions.

The worst is that my Uni release the timetable for next semester and he will be again learning my class.

1i80ttg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i80ttg,My result with dilute henna on light brown hair,"I made some recent posts about wanting to dye my hair a red tint, and I'm really happy with the results!

Before hair was virgin light brown, which would slightly lighten in the sun, but especially in mid winter looked very desaturated and ashy. I took the before picture a few days before after doing a cleansing mask and adding a small amount of hair oil.

I saw a previous post about doing 7 cassia / 2 henna / 2 amla, and started there. I needed a bit more for free shipping where I ordered the amla, and bhringraj was on sale, so I got that. And the cassia is mostly there to dilute the henna, and while there's conflicting information about if they have any effect, since I was just looking to dilute, I looked in my spice drawer for older (expired ???) stuff. I also used coffee as the liquid because I had some old coffee that tasted weird. So those were, for me, ""free"" - if you want to recreate this you can probably just replace the kitchen spices with cassia and use water. I was curious if the spices might make the mix smell better, but they did not.

Recipe:
5 cassia, 1 amla, 1 bhringraj, 1 henna, .5 tumeric, .5 coriander, .1 cayenne, .1 nutmeg

Henna and cassia was from Jacob Hooy.

I made the coffee in a french press and let it cool down to just below drinking temp. I stirred it in until the mix was cake batter, then covered in cling wrap and put it in the freezer for 4 hours. I then took it out and let it thaw fir 12 hours (overnight).

I took a shower and double shampood with a vinegar rinse. I wrapped up my hair to dry, and added a bit of sugar (one of those restaurant packets also clogging my spice drawer) and a big blob of the yellow Nature Box conditioner.

The yellow ""nourishing argan oil"" conditioner from Nature Box is, honestly, a bit crap. I got it from someone trying the CGM, who gave up on it, and I'm willing to test new things. But whatever argan oil is in there must be emulsified to non-existence, as the conditioner basically disappears after you apply it. I compared it on my hand to another conditioner, and it felt like water and disappeared. I added it to try to make the mix easier to apply and maybe help raise the pH a bit. 

I wasn't seeing a color change in the mix, and I think maybe it was just too cool for the henna to really start developing. But I applied it and wrapped it up with a winter cap over it, and after about 2 hours I sprung a leak that was a dark reddish brown.

 I left the mix on for 6 hours, and the leaks got a bit darker after 4 hours. So I think it continued to develop on my head. Which I'm fine with. There's a lot of conflicting info about peak release timing and demise, and I think getting the release on my head was fine for what I wanted. Keeping the head warm, like with the plastic bag and wrap and winter cap, also speeds up the process of dye release.

I rinsed in a bucket of water (which got dumped in the toilet to flush the mud), then I rinsed in the rebrewed coffee from the french press, then scrubbed in a lot of the crappy nature box conditioner and rinsing that got a lot of the mix out. Then I shampood with silver care shampoo, did a vinegar rinse, then coated my hair with a silver care hair mask. I already had the purple products, and thought they might help tone down the immediate brassiness. But once my hair was dry, it was still copper penny where the light would hit it, so I don't know if it did anything, but maybe it would be even brighter without?

My hair was very fluffy when dry, so I worked in a couple pumps of hair oil. The pictures are in the same diffuse natural light. The after is after 24 hours of when I started applying it, and I haven't washed out the hair oil.

I am VERY HAPPY with the results. I hope the copper penny sheen will darken up, but it's not very noticeable anyway. I have a deeper, richer color, and all of my color dimension and natural highlighting are still there. Even after putting in the oil to reduce the dry fluffiness, my hair feels bigger. Stronger, and smooth. It looks very natural. Cheaper than box dye, and much better results, win-win.

Since I'm not changing the color much, I think I'll use my leftover mix in the freezer to do this again in a few weeks. Now that I know it's going to develop on my head, I might do it overnight. My hair is so fine, there wasn't much weight on my head, but dealing with the occasional leak as I went about my day was annoying.

Next time I make the mix I might change up the recipe a bit, not sure.

My goal was just a subtle change, but I do think I'm in the camp of shampooing and conditioner is fine, and oiling afterwards. I do have fine hair, but I also wanted this process to nourish my hair, and leaving my hair dirty and dry seemed counterproductive. I also think adding the conditioner to the mix was a good idea, especially if it's a crap product that doesn't feel oily, a small amount won't interfere. Other, better, conditioners might have a different effect.",2,1737629802.0,henna,3,1.0,False

Single pods contain approximately 7g of coffee.  I bought one to test it out and it arrived yesterday.  This is a first report.  Bottom line, it's decent.

I pulled several shots of single espresso using Caffe Crema pods, which Lavazza makes for the machine and describes as medium roast (or sometimes, light to medium) with notes of biscuit and jasmine (or flowers and cereal).  Not surprisingly, the first shot, pulled at factory settings and yielding about 35g of liquid was thinner than the espresso I brewed at a 1:2 ratio in my Breville Barista Express.

I set the Lavazza machine to pull 20g shots from the same pod.  This coffee was thicker and sweeter, and recognizably espresso.  I'm not an expert and won't pretend to be. I can say this with confidence:  The pod doesn't have a lot of nuance.  It is a straight down the middle, traditional espresso shot with some bitterness.  I picked up no floral or cereal flavors.  But as a straight shot it isn't bad.  It compares to the best I could do with my Barista Express and requires 1/20th of the work and time, and none of the cleanup.

I used two shots of the Lavazza (40g) and frothed 4 ounces of milk using a Subminimal NanoFoamer Pro Gen 2.  With a teaspoon of honey, I made a decent caffe latte that definitely is at Starbucks levels of adequacy.  No godshots or transcendent experiences, but a satisfying milky drink I made in my own kitchen in less than ten minutes, with light-duty cleanup.  

The nearest coffee shop is at least a 45 minute drive from here. Lavazza pods are just over 60 cents each and the cost of the milk is minor.  So I made a decent latte for well under $1.50.  That's what I hoped for and I'm calling it a success.  I hope this report is some help to others trying to decide on mini machines.",1,1737629419.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**Understanding Why Loose Skin Happens After Weight Loss**
----------------------------------------------------------

### The Elasticity Factor: How Skin Adapts to Changes

My friend, skin is like a rubber band. It stretches when we gain weight. **Collagen** and **elastin** are the *special things* that make skin flexible. When *we get very big* quickly these fibers can break and become damaged. When you lose a lot of weight, the skin has to go back in. If it goes back too fast, it can leave you with *loose skin after weight loss*. That is why it is important to go slowly. This keeps the fibers safe. *Natural remedies for skin elasticity* can also improve skin.  
*Natural skin tightening* is possible.

It's served me well considering it was $300 about 5 years ago. 

After much research, I think I like the reviews, look and size of both the ECM Casa V and the La Pavoni Cellini Mini, but I'm having a hard time deciding which one. I like that the Cellini has an E61 group head and from the little reviews I've read it makes cafe quality equivalent coffee and has been revered for being a magnificent machine for it's price range. However, the Casa V has thousands more reviews online and most of them, fantastic. The biggest difference I suppose, as neither has PID, is the button vs lever mechanism. Is there an advantage to one over the other? I've been told lever machines take longer to heat up? I can't find much information on the cellini so I'm reaching out if anyone can help me here.

The biggest thing holding me back here is the difference is price, being about $500. Do I really need to spend the extra on the Cellini for a home set up? I mean, will I really notice the difference in the taste? If I make say, 4 coffees at once for guests, is one going to be faster than the other? Outside of performance, is one going to last me significantly longer? All things to consider! Grateful for any advice or reviews from this lovely community.",1,1737629246.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

You want to show you care but don’t want to come on too strong, right? Here’s a handy guide to help you navigate that balance and make your Valentine’s Day extra special without overdoing it.

# 1. A Thoughtful Gesture Goes a Long Way

Instead of splurging on something extravagant, focus on something meaningful but simple. For example:

* A **handwritten note or card** expressing how much you enjoy spending time together.
* A **small bouquet of flowers** (bonus points for choosing their favorite blooms or colors).

# 2. Share an Experience Together

Creating memories is far better than gifting something materialistic early on. Some ideas:

* **A cozy coffee date** at a cute café you’ve been wanting to try.
* **Tickets to a fun event** like a comedy show or live music performance.
* **Plan a mini adventure** like a picnic or a short hike if you both love the outdoors.

# 3. Sweet but Not Over the Top

Edible gifts are universally appreciated and light-hearted. Consider:

* A **box of artisan chocolates** or something unique like chocolate-covered strawberries.
* Their favorite **snack or dessert** from a local bakery.

# 4. Personalized Yet Subtle

If you’ve picked up on something they love, lean into that:

* A **book they’ve been meaning to read** or one you think they’d enjoy.
* A cute **mug or water bottle** in their favorite color or design.

# 5. Keep It Lighthearted and Fun

If humor is a part of your dynamic, add a playful twist:

* A **fun pair of socks** or a quirky keychain.
* A lighthearted **board game or card game** for your next date night.

# A Word of Advice

Avoid overly personal or overly extravagant gifts this early on (like jewelry or luxury items). The goal is to show you care without overwhelming the other person.

Dxd ADHD in the summer, and on one of the stimulant methylphenidate meds. 

My BP first thing in the morning is fine, at 110/64 or lower, but after taking the methylphenidate, it can zoom up to over 140/80, which is not normal for me. 

I’m also getting headaches, presumably because of the increase in pressure. 

The meds have made a *massive* positive difference to my ADHD, my energy and productivity, my mood, my confidence, and apparently make me more calm, so binning them off and going back to life with untreated ADHD isn’t a viable option at this point. 

I don’t drink, I gave up smoking before Christmas (which weirdly hasn’t made a scrap of difference to my BP, even when I’m not using any NRT products, which would obviously push it up), and since starting meds last July, the 8 coffees a day I needed to even vaguely function were easily reduced to just 2 with zero effort or withdrawal symptoms. 

I eat clean, I keep hydrated, we cook from scratch and use organic where we can, don’t eat processed foods, aside from the occasional Jaffa Cake Bar. 😇

Looking at garlic and beetroot as potential helpers in lowering my BP, and can’t find much info about beetroot powder dosing. 

Have just bought the Old India beetroot powder on Amazon, which has no dosing info that I can see on the packaging.

1i80dfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1i80dfa/first_25mg_pen_down/,FIRST 2.5MG PEN DOWN,"Thought I'd share my experience so far in case anyone is interested. FYI I'm not a doctor or scientist, this is just my experience (able-bodied, cis white woman, aged 32 with no history of ED's).

I've just injected my 4th 2.5mg dose having lost a stone so far. I feel more confident in my body and my clothes already and I find it easier to get up in the morning, I feel excited to eat nourishing foods.

Something I hadn't fully confronted in myself before hearing about mounjaro, was that food choices were often based in anxiety for me. I was/am a stress eater who seeks comfort in food. I hadn't really identified this in myself because my understanding of comfort eating was based on the unhelpful picture built by media and entertainment and prejudice. I'd picture people shut away in their rooms, unable to function properly... in my experience... even people who know me, the fact I am a comfort eater wasn't particularly obvious. I would do things like choose the most carby or ""satisfying"" thing on a menu in a restaurant (to make sure I would be really full).  I would go for my dog walk and treat myself to a cookie when I picked up a coffee. I would serve myself bigger portions of carb at dinner at home than my partner who is smaller than me. I would make little decisions all the time, none of which are that bad on the face of it, but when you are doing those things all the time and most mealtimes, your weight obviously keeps creeping up and up. I was always working to make sure I was constantly sated and satisfied, I would always finish my plate and not really engage with if i was full or not and therefore eat past fullness(you're told to finish your meal before you can leave the table when you're a child right?).

What my mounjaro journey is showing me already is just how much that feeling of always wanting to make sure i was satisfied by food was weighing down on me and was actually quite stressful and often made me feel shame. Again, not dramatically, but a subtle build of feeling like I have this weakness and lack of control in me. To counteract this and to try and put myself in control I would then count calories for a few weeks on my fitness pal - which would also just make me feel bad about food choices and like I needed to restrict which makes you feel just as trapped by and obsessed by food in a different way.

So basically I was caught in this cycle...

So far, what I am finding is that Mounjaro is giving me the freedom from the above. It has removed that cycle. I am choosing food based on what my body wants and needs without really having to think about it.  I suddenly don't automatically go for the thing that I think will be the most comforting/satisfying aka high carbs, high fat meals. I crave high fibre, high protein foods, greens etc. I stop eating when I am full and can actually recognise that feeling really easily. It's so joyful to suddenly not find it hard to feed my body foods that are good for it.

I will seek some talking therapy at some point in this journey to work on the disconnect I have between what I know my body needs or doesn't need and what I want because I look to food to soothe me. I am super aware of the fact that if i don't work on the above mindset, without mounjaro those habits will likely return.... people keep telling me that as if i don't know it. WARNING - the main side effect of this drug for me so far is the ill-informed opinionated commentators.

So that's my little thought splurge at the start of this journey. As I know so many people like me feel - our relationship with our bodies and with food is deeply personal and all i can say is that in this moment, I am enjoying it and actually I am really proud for making the decision to go for it. It is helping me have a new found appreciation for my health and my privilege as an able-bodied person.

Anyway, thought I'd share my experience in case anyone else is using mounjaro for similar reasons to me and is trying to make sense of it and work on the mind-body connection like me.",15,1737627834.0,mounjarouk,4,0.95,False

Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with. 

If you want to message me, please be in central Ohio! ",1,1737627709.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
