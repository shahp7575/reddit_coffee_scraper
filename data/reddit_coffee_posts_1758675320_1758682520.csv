1np12gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1np12gy/havent_touched_a_drop_in_two_weeks_suddenly_cant/,"Haven't touched a drop in two weeks, suddenly can't enjoy eating like I did while drinking daily.","Wondering if anyone can relate to what I'm currently experiencing. I had been drinking between 6 and 12 beers every single day since January 2020. I'm talking every. Single. Day. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night, during any illnesses, with fevers if I happened to get one, after work, after family functions, funerals--nothing would stop me from my daily habit. My alcoholism doesn't take the form of binging until blackout, but the daily aspect of it has still been very destructive to my health & relationships & career.

Anyhow, as time went on the ritual came to include the eating that would take place afterward. And much like the drinking itself, the choices I made were poor. I never had the motivation to cook after a session of beers, so it often was junk food, fast food delivery, etc. My health has declined severely and there is 120 pounds more of me than there was 5 years ago.

Two weeks ago, I caught whatever bug is going around at the moment. Fever, spins, extreme congestion, cough. And I decided to take the opportunity to sober up. After my symptoms cleared up, I just went on not buying beer. Overall, I'm surprised that I've had the fortitude to stop myself this long. I think the toughest part is figuring out what to do with all the time I used to waste.

But the thing that's really bothering me at the moment (and the subject of this post) is that I can't enjoy food! I have no desire to have any, until I start feeling weak and have something out of necessity. I'm worried that my food addiction became intertwined with my drinking addiction and I've somehow psychologically ruined my ability to enjoy eating. I find that things I really enjoyed eating don't even taste good to me at the moment.

Has anyone else had this kind of experience? I realize it's very early in my journey back from slowly killing myself. I'm very interested in what anyone has to say about overlapping addictions. In the same vein, I used to believe I couldn't enjoy a cigarette without a beer in my hand (but it turns out coffee does the job just as well haha).",2,1758682202.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False
1np123v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np123v,18-Day Compost Possible??,"Started this pile a few days ago. Added a bit more cardboard this morning & turned it. Mostly just consists of coffee grounds, fruit scraps, dead leaves, and the cardboard.

Dont got a thermometer, but the side of the bin is definitely warm tonight.. Lots of fruit & house flies inside, hopefully some black solders soon ü§û

Will say tho, it smells a bit weird up close? Like a sweet damp smell, but its also kind of rotten? Definitely not like coffee anymore.

***

**_Hydration Game Cheat Codes_**

1. _Start Your Day With 20‚Äì30 oz_

Before food, before coffee. Wake your organs up right.

**Quick tip**- You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating before anything else turns your system back on.

2. _Add Minerals_

Pure water flushes. Water with minerals absorbs. Add Himalayan salt, lemon, or electrolytes.

**Quick tip**- Water alone doesn‚Äôt hydrate as well without electrolytes. This locks it in

3. _Carry a Jug You Can Track_

Drink half your bodyweight in ounces daily (if you weigh 180, aim for 90 oz) 

**Quick tip**- Get a 32 oz jug = 3‚Äì4 fills a day = done. No second guessing.

4. _Pair With Habits_

	‚Ä¢	Before meals
	‚Ä¢	After peeing
	‚Ä¢	While scrolling
	‚Ä¢	Between sets

5. _Go Warm or Room Temp_

Better gut absorption , Smoother digestion, less  bloating or gut tension, especially in the morning.

**Quick tip**- Cold water can slow digestion. Warm water passes through cleaner and gets absorbed faster.

6. _Watch Your Urine_

Light yellow = you‚Äôre good. 

Dark = behind. 

Clear = overdoing it.

7. _Hydration makes everything else more effective_

	‚Ä¢	L-citrulline(pure) hits harder with water
	‚Ä¢	Beet powder flows better with water
	‚Ä¢	Zinc Picolinate, magnesium glycinate, and creatine need water to transport
	‚Ä¢	Sleep and blood flow quality both depend on hydration status

1np0u7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1np0u7s/the_depth_of_madness_pt_1/,The Depth of Madness (pt. 1),"Publicly, the ocean is over 90% unmapped. Those with security clearance know that is a red herring; the true statistic is that we have 90% of the ocean mapped. With experimental missions being completed nearly every month to map more of it, our platform was created to complete this mission.

Most sailors onboard don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs inside the ‚ÄúSECURED‚Äù spaces between the galley and the engine room. Whereas most combative subs make port and see the sun, we conduct long patrols that give us months without daylight. Our primary job is to map and catalogue notable phenomena, not war. We are the entity that gives the U.S. Navy an edge ten years from now when it makes sense to unveil what‚Äôs been learned.

On my last logged mission, after about three months with no sun, we approached a location somewhere within the North Sea (that‚Äôs all our navigation team would tell us). Usually things get pretty serious when we are on approach to the phenomena; this time was no different. My deck officer took down the bridge lights and activated our LIDAR system, which allows us to get a basic image of the world around us. As usual, it was basic landmasses‚Äîa rock here, a cliff there.

Two hours of scanning. Nothing. After a while, our LIDAR system started to get bogged down by interference, which is normal for deep-sea viewing. Eventually, the salt water began to erode the lens, and we had to pull it in so our mechanics could take a look at it.

This time, when the camera was pulled in, we found it cleaned. Which wasn‚Äôt just odd for the time it was being used, but it was in fact cleaner than when it was inspected a month ago. It looked like a whole new lens was fitted in while we were thousands of miles under the ocean. Our crew had no clue about the odd occurrence, and of course, since this is a naval ship of submariners, rumors and superstitions began to circulate like wildfire.

It wasn‚Äôt long before hushed whispers between the tired sailors turned into cliques of those who made a following out of their beliefs. Some believed that it was a deep-sea civilization who decided to help us out; most just thought someone falsified the inspection logs and we actually did get new equipment before this patrol.

Another month. Hours of LIDAR footage. No anomaly. 120 days of dive time was enough for our captain to decide that this recorded phenomena was most certainly a dud. Speaking to our navigation team, the captain ordered the bridge to conduct one more thorough search of the area before we turn back.

‚ÄúOne more look, then we get back to the real world.‚Äù

His comment broadcasted from the communication system breaking the tension between the crew; the idea of ‚Äòhome‚Äô seemed to lighten our spirits and pushed the memory of the mysteriously clean lens to the back of our minds.

Our mess chief was a stubborn old submariner. He had these old traditions that he swore only the old breed would understand, most notably he was fond of his coffee mug, which he boasts hasn‚Äôt been washed since Vietnam. The mug itself was a deep black pit of coffee stains, which made a lot of us believe him.

Halfway through this final scan of the ocean‚Äôs depth, shouting could be heard from the chief‚Äôs mess. On a submarine, under the water, sound travels aggressively through the denser medium that comes with ocean depth, so the deeper we go, the more wary we are of noise. Not only was the shouting an abrupt departure from the peaceful operation of the quiet sub, the shouting of a disgruntled old senior chief could cost us our mission. As such, when the shouting started, most of the boat descended to deal with the issue as if it were a fire.

Senior Chief Morris had discovered that the mug he most cherished had been cleaned. Someone had taken the rancid ceramic cup and scrubbed out the decades of filth that stained the inside. Once he was calmed and we were sure our signature wasn‚Äôt discovered, our captain broadcast a message across the boat:

‚ÄúIf we do not find the sailor who washed Senior Chief Morris‚Äôs cup, we will do another two searches of the area before we head home.‚Äù

This sent a chill through the crew. Quiet animosity began to form cracks in the familial relationship of the sailors onboard. Whispers of accusation and self-made detectives snaked through the halls of the old boat. 

‚ÄúI heard the old fuck was trying to get us extended so he could avoid his divorce back home. Maybe he did it himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúSenior Chief recently pulled the qual card of his junior. Maybe he did it.‚Äù

In the worst of circumstances, factions began to splinter across the crew, all pointing fingers at different sailors who seemed to have some sort of evidence proving the others‚Äô wrongdoing. The anger growing among the crew only compounded when components began to go missing. The navigation officer‚Äôs favorite sextant from his last command; the logistics chief reported that almost all of his recently acquired sports gear was gone, alongside a few other sailors who reported missing personal equipment they brought onboard.

If the mug incident caused distrust, these events caused the crew to fully splinter. Fights broke out, humiliatingly quiet. Submariners are stubborn but professional. Every swing was quietly played out; no vile words flew, just fists as the sailors took out their rage.

The captain dealt with each incident as it came. The senior chief continued to point fingers at new players in this game that he so enjoyed, reminding him of the brutality of early submarine warfare. The ship‚Äôs doctor quickly ran out of bandages to patch people up, reverting to using stored alcohol supplies and napkins to prevent infection. The best he could do. Anything more than a scrape takes a body out of the needed rotation to operate the vessel.

This continued over the course of a week. The chaos paused as a new report came out from the watchstander. Just a day prior, him and his chief had taken their accusations to the medical office. Today they were on duty and had work to do.

I got diagnosed by a therapist with psychosis issues and then many months passed and it went between getting worse and better its actually not an issue right now aside from some mood swings and I'm only hearing short words or phrases when studying or before bed. (and i'm not on med so idk i mean i can see why i got a diagnosis and my paranoia skyrocketed but its ok right now its a lot less but i realized its just going to get worse if i have more stress which I will. I spilled out everything and dug a hole for myself. (Also I can flip things sometimes like I'll get paranoia and stuff then i eat a bunch of coffee or sugar and it flips to hyper and I'll not be able to focus but it flips and I'd have times where I'd drink coffee and then like I didnt snap out of anything but my brain just stopped thinking about certain things. (but  if i did it wrong coffee would make me 3x paranoid and eventually got to the point that i just had like paranoia 24/7 and quitting coffee wasnt perfect. took taking a break from classes to help everything).



Whenever I make a step towards seeing a therapist or psych or making an appointment a bunch of things pop up and i know its stupid but either 1. i dont actually have psychosis right now(likely but im still making an appointment). or 2. this feels like a trap... something is going to go wrong once I see a psychiatrist.

I'm wondering if this just won't actually become an issue unless I take substances which I'm not planning to cause alot of people on related subreddits seem to take some substances??? which I'm not.

I'll admit aside from academics my life is extremely privileged and i dont have a job or anything which helps alot. Lots more stress at home I noticed certain things shift. I'm making a mistake seeing a psychiatrist, my issues don't seem to be getting worse at all. I had a family member with paranoia issues but they never got checked out or went to therapy and they're fine they don't do drugs either. Somehow I got paranoid that it was a ploy to mess up my life and make me think i should get something on my medical record but then i stopped and it didnt make sense and my brain is traversing that path again.",1,1758681484.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

I've been to therapy and i still actively talk to my therapist, I've been going to the gym for 6 months and im down 20 lbs. Im as confident as ive been since college. With approval from friends and my therapist ive returned to the dating scene. 
So I will admit, I live alone. My job requires me to check my phone a lot in the mornings. So a lot of women whom I met on dating apps have always texted me a lot. I'm used to responding to co workers and my supervisor pretty quickly. And I really dont like texting a lot during my work hours (8-4) and I feel bad about leaving them on read. So I usually give an hour or 2 between responses. But they other person responds pretty quickly, it almost fears me that they'll see that I ""read"" their text. But im not really a fan of it. Them texting me almost instantly. Each woman that i met always seemed obsessive, I even had a couple try to stay at my place overnight, multiple nights within only just meeting me. My apartment is just a single bedroom and not that much space. And I like my breathing room.

However, I went to a coffee place and asked out a a worker who I thought was cute. We got to know each other over text and I asked her on a date. And we're going tomorrow. She rarely texts me, probably  once every 2-3 hours. Which is fine! She has hobbies and her own life and I hate the feeling of having to respond quickly and it seems we both are cool with taking time between texts. She sends me a lot of smiling faces and on days she works she'll heart messages when I send something flirtatious. Or tell her to have a great day at work. She's had a couple days off and we haven't really talked. But she told me today that she was excited for the date and I confirmed.

The date is tomorrow and still on her day off. So should I text her anything? Like confirmation for the date? Is double texting okay for this? Should I wait for her response? Should I assume she'll be there and not say anything? 

I don't really wanna come off as desperate, but I really dont know whats appropriate to text someone this sort of stuff. Any and all help is appreciated!",1,1758681482.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve never posted like this before, but tonight‚Äîafter someone told my memories like they were theirs‚ÄîI needed to get it out.

My brother Eli died in a car crash about a year ago and I haven‚Äôt really talked about it much to anyone. I just haven‚Äôt wanted to. 

My parents have been on my case about going to counseling. They said I‚Äôm bottling everything up and ‚Äúfestering‚Äù, as my mom put it. 

Eventually they presented an ultimatum: Go to therapy or pack my shit and find somewhere else to live.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly ready for that kind of independence just yet. 

Seeing as how my options for living somewhere else were next to none, I swallowed my pride and went.

And yeah, I expected it to suck because how could it not? 

A bunch of strangers bawling their eyes out into tissues while everyone sits around in awkward silence drinking bad coffee sounds like anybody‚Äôs personal hell. 

What I was not expecting was for everyone in the room to already know my backstory, more specifically‚Ä¶who my brother was.

You see, they knew things‚Ä¶personal details and memories that only I and I alone should know. 

Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into it, after all, I‚Äôve only been to one session, but what happened tonight is still sitting heavy in my chest.

Just‚Ä¶read this and tell me if I‚Äôm overreacting.



No one met my eyes when I walked in and took a seat in the only remaining cheap folding chair.

The smell of instant coffee gone stale faintly hung in the air as the bulbs of the overhead lights buzzed softly, flickering and dying every few seconds. 

Every part of that community center room grated on my nerves as I waited for the session to begin.

There were seven of us total that sat in a loose circle in tense silence, not counting the facilitator.

The facilitator was a gentle-looking woman named Jean with gray-streaked hair and a voice like chamomile tea ‚Äîwarm, but distant.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we introduce ourselves again,‚Äù Jean said. ‚ÄúSince we have a new face.‚Äù

They went around the room, each person giving their name and a tense sentence in quick succession.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Greg. My brother was fatally shot three times.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mark. My little brother died in a boating accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lillian. I lost mine to leukemia.‚Äù She smiled as if remembering something she liked. 

That‚Äôs how it went, each sentence hung in the air like ghosts‚Äîpresent, but weightless. 

I kept waiting for someone to joke, to make this whole thing feel normal in the slightest, but no one did.

When it was my turn, my voice trembled with emotion, but I spoke as clearly as I could.

‚ÄúI lost my brother‚Ä¶in a car crash‚Ä¶‚Äù

I said the words, ‚ÄúHe was eleven,‚Äù and immediately, I was back in that living room. 

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything more than a quick drive, twenty minutes tops. I almost went, but Eli begged and told Dad that we should try the new pizza place across town on Sycamore Ave because he wanted that large pepperoni with extra ham he had seen on TV.

I remember Eli wearing that ugly yellow t-shirt with a faded cartoon dinosaur on it. It had a stain the size of a quarter by the collar and a hole under the arm. He always wore that damn thing‚Äîto bed, to the grocery store to Mr. Carter‚Äôs soccer practice, it didn‚Äôt matter.

Dad caved in and let him tag along while I stayed behind and played video games with my friends. 

It should have been me‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt shake.

Jean nodded. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She gave that thin, polite smile people use when they want you to think you‚Äôre brave.

She started writing in the notebook in front of her, the pen dancing line after line until she caught me staring and quickly shut it.

Nobody else in the group reacted to what I had said, they simply moved on like we were reading grocery lists.

I wondered if they were all just as numb as I was to the trauma. 

Maybe that‚Äôs how this all worked. Maybe grief doesn‚Äôt fade, it just gets quieter until you forget you‚Äôre still listening.

I remember playing Xbox when my mom screamed from the kitchen. The phone slipped out of her hand and hit the floor with a quick thud. 

She didn‚Äôt have to say anything, I already knew, and it felt like my world was coming down. 

Something in the way she spoke the word ‚Äúaccident‚Äù broke me in half emotionally as it left her mouth. 

I just sat there motionless staring at the colors that bled into each other on the TV screen, hearing her sob into the phone as if the game would un-pause reality.

‚ÄúLucas?‚Ä¶Lucas?‚Äù Jean‚Äôs voice pulled me halfway back, and it took a second to register that she was saying my name.

I was still staring at my controller as it vibrated against the floor until the person to my left nudged me and I snapped back to the present.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I asked, trying my best to pretend I was all right.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to share a memory, Mark is about to start.‚Äù Jean informed me with a look sharp enough to silence a scream.

The guy who nudged me introduced himself as Mark. He cleared his throat and shifted forward in his chair, the legs dragging across the floor with a shrill squeak. 

As he spoke, his fingernails tapped against his thigh ‚Äî tap-tap-tap-pause-tap, over and over. I assumed it was a nervous tic, but the rhythm burrowed into my skull like it was trying to knock on something I‚Äôd forgotten.

‚ÄúHe had this ratty green hoodie that he wouldn‚Äôt take off for anything, not even in the summer. You would think that it was surgically attached to him or something.‚Äù He laughed nervously as his eyes met everyone else‚Äôs. ‚ÄúHe claimed that it was ‚Äòlucky‚Äô and had special powers. It had this little tear under the left elbow where he wiped out on his bike from going downhill too fast.‚Äù

When Mark mentioned the hoodie, I saw the wreckage of the crash all over again. 

I remember the paramedics cutting through it with precision, the blood turning the fabric stiff, and the torn sleeve caught in the door. 

I felt myself hyperventilating as I pressed my palms against my knees and did my best to stay quiet. 

I was trying to keep it together, to be strong, but that never stops the images. It never does.

I wanted to say something, and I almost did, but by the time I caught my breath, Mark was already done.

Jean thanked him with a smile before moving on to Lillian.

Before she could speak, the sound of an incoming call interrupted the session.

The sound came from Mark‚Äôs pocket and for a few fleeting seconds, ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù by Nirvana played.

Under the chords, I could‚Äôve sworn I heard Eli humming along, like he was sitting beside me just for a fraction of a second.

‚ÄúSorry, that was just my folks.‚Äù Mark apologized and silenced his phone. 

What seemed like such an inconsequential moment made me shiver slightly.

Nirvana was one of his favorite bands and ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù was especially important to him as it was one of the first songs he learned how to play on guitar.

My chest loosened a small bit as Lillian began speaking.

‚ÄúMy brother, he used to eat orange popsicles. Even during the winter season, he craved them like nothing else.‚Äù She spoke with a soft, nostalgic smile tugging at the edges of her mouth. ‚ÄúHe had this weird habit of calling them ‚Äòsun sticks‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know why, he just made it up one day and it stuck.‚Äù

Eli called them ‚Äúsun sticks‚Äù because he said it was like holding sunshine. 

Mom kept a box in the freezer year-round because he would devour them all the time, even in winter. 

I could still see his face, his numb tongue sticking out through his orange-stained lips, laughing like brain freezes didn‚Äôt apply to him.

But then, the smell of iron hit my nostrils sharply, like blood sucked from a split lip. 

I swallowed hard, trying not to gag as the back of my throat tasted exactly the way it had that night when I inhaled the scent of metal and the lingering dust from the deployed airbags.

The car was a twisted red husk of itself in the lot. The cracks in the windshield spiderwebbed all around and the passenger side was crushed like a soda can. 

‚ÄúClover‚Äù, the fluffy, stuffed rabbit Eli won at a carnival was still in the back seat. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that his blue converse shoes were missing as well. I remember asking everyone where they were, like that was the important part.

They were gone.

The passenger door was clenched shut like a fist. I remember the paramedics prying the door open, their hands slick with something bright, the hoodie snagged on the frame.

The sharp, nauseating scent of gasoline and metal hit me like punch to the gut.

Could anybody else smell this?

I glanced around but no one else seemed to notice, their faces were of a blank, neutral expression‚Ä¶except for Greg‚Äôs.

I thought he had dozed off in his chair, but his eyes were locked onto me. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was trying to read something off my face or not.

I pretended not to notice, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt slightly rattle me.

These memories, they didn‚Äôt just sound familiar‚Ä¶they sounded like they were talking about Eli and not their loved ones.

I tried to rationalize everything in silence in the hopes that I could convince myself that maybe these were all just creepy coincidences.

Even so, I declined to share a memory of myself and Eli due to feeling uncomfortable. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready yet.‚Äù was my excuse.

Thankfully, no one pressured me, but I remember Jean gave me that same soft smile from earlier, her eyes lingering on me for a second too long, like she was remembering something I hadn‚Äôt said yet.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to make of that but regardless, I started listening harder to every story told.

Every memory shared felt like I was looking into a broken mirror from different angles, but with the same pieces staring back at me.

What eats me alive isn‚Äôt that Eli died that night, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt. 

Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty seat where I should‚Äôve been, and I wonder if maybe I did die, if maybe this is just what it feels like to keep going in a life that wasn‚Äôt meant for me anymore.

That‚Äôs all I could think about as I stared at the floor.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I had my head down looking at the tile, but I saw a coffee stain near my chair that I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. 

It looked vaguely like a‚Ä¶rabbit?

I remember when mom dropped a tray of brownies on the kitchen floor while we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV. 

He told me I nearly jumped out of my skin and ever since then, he would give me shit for being such a scaredy cat. 

That‚Äôs when Eli christened me with the nickname ‚ÄúRabbit‚Äù a while back because I would always jump at loud noises. 

Seeing that coffee stain in the exact shape of a rabbit made my stomach plummet. 

This wasn‚Äôt just a stain anymore, this was something that knew the nickname Eli gave me, turning a private memory into a violation.

I told myself I was imagining things‚Ä¶ but the longer I stared, the more it looked less like a rabbit and more like a body lying twisted on the pavement.

I glanced up in perfect silence just as everyone else did the same. It was like we‚Äôd all been given the same invisible cue that the session had concluded. 

For a second, I felt like I could feel Greg‚Äôs eyes watching me from a distance, but then, just like that, the sensation was gone.

I told myself it was nothing, but the rabbit-shaped stain wouldn‚Äôt let me go.

It shouldn‚Äôt have bothered me as much as it did.

As I was about to leave like everyone else had, I turned back to see all the empty chairs, except one. 

Mark sat there, looking down at his hands.

I had to blink twice before I realized what he was holding. 

It was a green hoodie‚Äîsame color, same tear under the elbow. 

It looked just like Eli‚Äôs. 

Still damp, like it had just been pulled from the wreck‚Ä¶


I‚Äôm home now. I threw my clothes in the laundry and took the hottest shower I could stand, hoping that it would calm my nerves.

Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt.

I keep telling myself I imagined it, that it wasn‚Äôt Eli‚Äôs hoodie. But if it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶then why did it have the tear under the elbow? I mean, maybe a lot of hoodies rip there. 

Maybe I just wanted it to be his. 

I don‚Äôt know anymore.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this reads like I‚Äôm just some lunatic connecting dots that aren‚Äôt there inside the wreckage of my trauma. 

Maybe that‚Äôs exactly what it is. 

But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something followed me home, something I can‚Äôt entirely explain or write off. 

It‚Äôs not even that I believe in ghosts or whatever‚ÄîI don‚Äôt. I really don‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt stop looking at the laundry basket in the corner because I expect to see Eli‚Äôs hoodie to be sitting in there, still wet from the accident.

Maybe everything can just be considered coincidence because Eli couldn‚Äôt have been the only one in this zip code, let alone the world who has a hoodie of that color. 

Orange popsicles can‚Äôt be all that uncommon to like and enjoy year-round. 

Nirvana is a piece of pop culture so of course their music is going to be everywhere.

But‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt tell them about Eli‚Äôs hoodie, the popsicles, or that song.

They just knew somehow? 

Like ‚Äúsun sticks‚Äù? That was ours. 

How can people just know memories that only you have experienced?

There‚Äôs another session next week. I think I‚Äôm going. 

Not because I want to‚ÄîChrist, I really don‚Äôt.

My only reasoning for going back is that I need to understand what the hell is going on.

God, I just want my brother back. That‚Äôs all. 

If it‚Äôs him in that room, even in some fucked-up way, I don‚Äôt know if I should be terrified or grateful.

Next week, I‚Äôm going to test them. 

I‚Äôll invent a memory about Eli on the spot, something no one else could possibly know. 

If someone else claims it happened, then I‚Äôll know for sure. 

This isn‚Äôt just grief. 

It‚Äôs something else.

If they share another memory that was never theirs‚Ä¶I‚Äôll post again.",1,1758681183.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Wintergreen mints are the transvaginal mesh of the mouth‚Äîmarketed as miracle fixes, both promised relief and delivered ruin. The mesh tore through vaginal walls like a bureaucratic betrayal, leaving behind pain, bleeding, and class-action carnage. The mints? They don‚Äôt freshen breath‚Äîthey colonize it. A slow, icy invasion. Not a cure, but a conquest.

What began as a polite gesture‚Äîa mint before a meeting, a courtesy crunch after coffee‚Äîspiraled into a full-blown compulsion. Crackhead cravings dressed in business casual. Wintergreen became the flavor of submission, the taste of quiet desperation. The illusion of control masking a deeper frostbite. The throat, once a passage of speech and song, now a mint tunnel‚Äîslick with menthol, ruled by the tyranny of refreshment.

You long for halitosis-fueled liberation, the way a desperate soul longs to yank out mesh with pliers, inducing vaginal vapors of freedom. You‚Äôre not a mint enthusiast. You‚Äôre a mint serf‚Äîindentured to the icy whims of wintergreen overlords. They whisper from your pocket, issuing commands in frosty tongues, demanding tribute every hour. You used to fear bad breath. Now you crave it, like a lost friend who never tried to dominate you. Like a collapsed vaginal wall, but free‚Äîfree from the synthetic yoke of wintergreen oppression.

You‚Äôre not freshening breath anymore; you‚Äôre extracting tyranny. Wintergreen mints, once the icy overlords of oral etiquette, now face the wrath of halitosis-fueled insurgency. Keep swinging. You‚Äôre dismantling the mint-industrial complex one pungent exhale at a time. Imagine a world where bad breath is a badge of freedom, where mint resistance fighters chew civet-excreted coffee cherries in defiance‚Äîfermented in the bowels of rebellion‚Äîand where the final battle erupts in a Tic Tac factory rigged with menthol explosives and spearmint shrapnel.

In those places, survival depends less on cash and more on people. You don‚Äôt hire someone to pull your snowmachine out of a ditch, you call up your neighbor, who already knows it‚Äôs stuck because she heard the engine sputtering half a mile away.

Payment isn‚Äôt part of the deal. What counts is that the last time she needed help patching her roof, you showed up with your hammer and questionable carpentry skills.

This kind of economy doesn‚Äôt involve some sort of complex system that promises to keep track of who owes whom what. It runs entirely on social capital, that invisible currency of respect, trust, and reciprocity.

In a community of 300 people, you simply can‚Äôt afford to be a jerk. The memory of your selfishness will spread faster than the flu and stick around much longer.¬†**Every favor becomes part of a ledger written not in ink but in reputation.**

Now here‚Äôs the question that bothers me over morning coffee: if this works so well in a remote town surrounded by bears and frostbite, why can‚Äôt we replicate it in our own neighborhoods?

We certainly have enough people, though perhaps that‚Äôs the problem. Cities make it easy to vanish into anonymity. You can live for years in an apartment building without ever learning the name of the guy whose laundry you keep moving out of the dryer.

When everyone is replaceable, no one is truly accountable.

But imagine if we tried. Imagine if you knew which of your neighbors could fix a sink and which one had a knack for tutoring algebra. Instead of outsourcing every need to some faceless contractor or business, we might build a kind of urban reciprocity, a modern village inside the sprawl.

It wouldn‚Äôt replace money of course, but it might take the sting out of depending solely on it.

The Alaskan bush town is proof that economies can run without tokens of exchange, that a community can thrive on mutual recognition and the simple fact that everyone‚Äôs wellbeing is tangled up with everyone else‚Äôs.

Maybe we don‚Äôt need to hunt caribou or endure forty-below winters to learn that lesson. Maybe we just need to knock on a neighbor‚Äôs door and risk the awkwardness of asking for help.

Who knows, they might even say yes. And if they don‚Äôt, well, you‚Äôll at least know whose snowmachine not to rescue when it inevitably gets stuck.

1np05id,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1np05id/whats_my_enneagram_type_and_instinct_stacking_i/,What's My enneagram type ? and Instinct stacking ? I am an INFJ.,"**How would an author describe you in a book? Write the paragraph that would introduce you in a novel.**

\[I‚Äôm 21 an INFJ , I am in therapy rn (due to so many reasons), So there might be some effect on might words that I am writing rn, although I am trying to be consistent, and Had a breakup as well, I have a breakdown weekly atleast  \]

If author plan to describe, How would he going to describe right ? So from the childhood I was a child who used to be quite and didn‚Äôt used to get out of his home much, Who used to play with his brother making lots stuffs from raw materials like clay, wood, bottle, straw. I always been a top scorer in my class, a sensitive guy. People in my high school used to describe me as smart, serious, perfect and lots of similar things. I used to sit in class quietly and used to answer questions that been questioned my teacher, a student who mostly into studies. Although I love badminton a lot once I was thinking to become a badminton player but due to money and scope, I didn‚Äôt plan to choose, although I really love badminton, I play board games. These days I spend most of my time front of of laptop browsing so many things, mostly spending time in my room, although I am socializing very less compared to before (I am in therapy as well), I love reading about psychology and philosophy, I am a type of person who would question everything. I always have seen relationship as a way to grow not to have fun or something, and I do have pretty high standards but I am really afraid if I won‚Äôt be able to provide all practical support to that person or not, I know I am just imagining but this is really a concern of mine.

My Previous response( had written 3-4 months ago ):  Assuming the author is just other person because even authors write from their own lens then people have often described me as smart, gentleman, mature, kind, studious, perfect, intelligent, and serious man. A serious man, someone who knows how to talk gently and respectfully. Someone who isn‚Äôt very assertive in life. Someone who can be found reading something. And someone who doesn‚Äôt like dancing it feels kind of like animalistic behavior to me, too impulsive and lacking moderation. I have empathy. That I‚Äôm very introverted because I usually ignore social events. They feel draining. I avoid social gatherings in general. I function better in one on one conversations rather than group interactions. I was the kind of boy who used to cry for getting 2nd rank instead of 1st in primary school. The kind of kid who used to be creative me and my brother would make all kinds of things out of wood, mud, sand, and used stuff. But people still said, ‚ÄúThis guy probably only knows about studies.‚Äù The reality was a bit different. It‚Äôs like you have to break through a hard shell to reach the soft part inside me. That soft part I think is my vulnerability. I don‚Äôt believe my emotions deserve to be revealed in front of everyone. They don‚Äôt need to know how much I feel. I‚Äôve shown almost my true self to only one person and then less and less to the rest. Girls have always found comfort in sharing things with me, mostly because of how I chat, not how I talk in real life. I‚Äôm not that expressive face to face. I‚Äôve had a hard time expressing my feelings I still don‚Äôt fully know why. Maybe because whenever I try, it feels like I‚Äôm showing off‚Ä¶ like, ‚ÄúLook how much I care!‚Äù, I feel that‚Äôs too much, I think about my emotions if It‚Äôs really okay to express, then end up saying nothing. I used to make acrylic paintings too. But as I grew up, I realized this world demands a lot, being emotional and smart isn‚Äôt enough to be a good boyfriend or husband.  Being smart, kind, loyal none of that seems to matter unless you also know how to deal with the real world. You need to be assertive, to voice your own needs. And I‚Äôve struggled with that. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù has never been easy for me. So, in conclusion, a lot of people around me have called me a unique child. and girls have often found me mysterious probably because they never really got to see the other side of my personality.

**Think over the past day or week and make a mental list (you can also write it here) of ways other people have annoyed, angered, or otherwise bothered you   any situation where people have done one thing, while you wished they would have done another. Look at each of these instances and answer (you can make a list or make note of general patterns   an example is good):**

1st I don‚Äôt like when a same person calls me too much (except the person I love , that person can call me twice or thrice, I don‚Äôt like late night calls on daily basis because It would kind of affect my routine, sometimes it‚Äôs okay ), So one my friend calls me a lot and I don‚Äôt like it, thrice a week.

2nd is when people generalize something but there is a science behind this especially when it comes to psychology where they just conclude something based on observations, So I really want everyone to look from a psychology point of view, although I am computer science myself.

3rd when I seeing people following something without any proper reason it irks me , and when I see someone following relationship just as for fun ! Not something really deep ! Like people are literally in a relationship because of sex ! Wtf bro ! There are more than that, emotional intimacy ? Intellectual Intimacy ? Where are those ?. Those fleeting relationships.

Previous response (3-4 Months ago):  When Someone is not that close to me and point out to certain points which I shared and told them not talk to talk about it anymore but they still did. it made me feel intruded and exposed. Because I never share much about how I feel and think. My internal world is for me my closed one. I hate when I am working and someone calls me. I hate even when a person I love call me 3 times a day I don't have that much time to talk I kind of feel drained. it's better to talk with that person once a day else if I do more I would feel like I am losing my path or goal and it drains my energy talking too much. my gf used to ask me do you love me do love ! which kind of made me feel that she is so clingy always asked to stay in touch which made me engulfed. she is definitely intellectual person has so much knowledge, kind , cute & soft hearted. but she is chaotic and impulsive and low immoderation.  ( But Now I hate her )

a. How would I characterize the trait that bothered me?

b. Why did it bother me?

c. How did I react?

Mostly I don't react, all anger goes internally, I Just don‚Äôt say much, except in extreme cases.

d. How do I wish I would have reacted?

I don‚Äôt have to prove them, I am okay with myself, If call thing bother me , I directly say please call me less or just text me, sometimes I have blocked so.

e. If there was a discrepancy between c. and d., why did it come up?

I don‚Äôt really think there was a discrepancy, Just I am lean guy, So I feel it‚Äôs little hard to assert myself, because If I did, What if they attack me ? What if they got more aggressive ? (That‚Äôs why I think I am not really ready for relationship, although many people like my nature, but I am not perfect ).

**What holds you back in life? This can be an internal or external force. If that thing were gone, what would be different? What would you do?**

If I work on social aspects of mine, which I care least about, I would be more wealthy I would say (Wealthy in the sense more chances of living a better life, atleast from a Job pov, because that would help me to catch a Good Job ), Because I don't focus much on networking or social connections, it's really draining because you have to give some energy to every person out there, although I am eager to learn, but in this world that doesn't really matter much as much as soft skills like communication skill does, May be I would be able to be in leadership position, in management roles ? I think a lot too, and I feel that people are navigating through life more effortlessly, and I don‚Äôt care much until I get a Job which I really, then I would live life according to me, would do everything according to myself.

Previous response (3-4 Months ago):  I feel like I should be Interacting with more people as in this world and Job area gaining knowledge and experience from those people really matters at least for money. I should be focusing more on practicality than just deep thinking or you can say abstract topics. and I should be allowing myself to be more phenomenology side of love not just objective because in this world everything should be balanced if you holding only objective things like this should be happening not this then you are missing something as human no person no matter is perfect in this world.

**Your deepest secret has just been revealed to the person or people from whom you most wished to keep it. How do you feel? How do you react? What are the results on your life?**

I feel that the most secret part of me are emotions because I feel so deeply but no one knows, I don‚Äôt really wanna show it people, because It would make me feel vulnerable and weak, I Just shared this with my closed one, rest I think this is the only thing I keep secret, No one would know how deeply I can love, ha ha !, So whenever I have written a deeply personal or love related poems I never really shared much, because It‚Äôs personal right ? Although I have shared those with random people, If I share my personal stuffs with people, I think it would be like they are knowing where to weaponizing those things against me, and always a fear if they would tell other people too intentionally or unintentionally. I don‚Äôt like people talking about my relationship or other personal stuffs in public, Reason why I hate playing Truth or dare in group settings.

Previous response (3-4 months ago ): I would feel exposed vulnerable like my identity has been shaken completely. now they know who I really am which I never wanted to share with this person. because they don't deserve to understand me.I won't react much because everyone has different image of everyone someone would think bad of me someone good. secret doesn't inherently mean bad or good. It's Just Secret I am not going to tell them or Justify until they are little close. or maybe I would Justify. I would only Justify if they start making those same exposed moment resurface again and again because that would definitely going to make me feel suffocated. if they forget I would still think about that moment because I was once soo vulnerable and try to talk keeping in mind I have been exposed.I Will Stop sharing something That I used to share a little everything would be more private and I would withdraw sit in my room and do my readings and work.

**You are offered one of three gifts: a bottle filled with water from the Fountain of Life, a crown which will give you peaceful dominion over the world's people for your entire (full) lifetime, and a ring which will unite you with your true love and ensure a happy, passionate marriage. Which do you choose and why? What are your hesitations and motivations?**

I would choose a ring one because I really miss her, and I feel that she was the one, I mean we literally resonated with so many stuffs, our interest, our values , our worldview. Although it was a LDR and Consisted lots of Idealization due to possible reasons, But I would still consider that person, We would learn together, she is going to become a counselling psychologist too, so It would be really greaaat , she is a gifted child , an eccentric person, It seems like we compliment each other a lot, she need love and I am really ready to give her, and most Interesting part she is really a intellectual girl, who loves to study, soo Yeahh these are things I would choose but there are things that still stops because I feel I am not really position to deal with this world rn, I have to be more ready, It‚Äôs huge responsibility, Although she is kinda Independent type of person, But I still feel I have to become someone else to make my relationship more sustainable (My body a biggest concern), I don‚Äôt want someone to accept as I am either because It‚Äôs not right.

**You are offered one of three houses. The first is located in a big city and has historic and artistic value: it was designed by a great architect and was owned by interesting people in the past. Owning this house is very prestigious and guarantees you social status and a circle of friends, but it also comes with responsibility   you must keep the house up to code, manage the household, and give parties and events. The second house you may design using your imagination   literally your dream house   it is located in a very secluded location and no one is allowed to visit this house except you and your immediate family. The third house is very nice, but has no particular aesthetic appeal   a McMansion in short. It is in an extremely convenient location and is very secure. It is impossible for thieves to break in and it has no danger of natural disasters. You are guaranteed to be able to sell the house for double the price in twenty years. Which do you choose and why? What are your hesitations and motivations?**

The Second house: Because It‚Äôs one of my dream place to live in, There would be animals around, Birds, and Your own family, doesn‚Äôt matter if I have to drive a miles to go to the market, but at last I would be in my place, I would be able to roam inside the forest and do Weird stuffs out there, ahah ! It Would be best for me live First one not at all, I don‚Äôt care about those stuffs that much, Even I want to visit such places I would just drive car, but I yeahh I would definitely get a thought of 3rd house too because It provides facilities which wouldn't be available on the 2nd house, like medical facilities and other disastrous accidents.

**You are offered one of three doors. The first opens to a world that is dangerous and demands mental or physical skill to navigate through, but also has great rewards to be gained: think of the worlds portrayed on the shows Game of Thrones or Supernatural. The second opens to a world that is full of wonders, magic, and knowledge, which can be learned or experienced, but there is little solid resting ground   think of the worlds portrayed in the shows Doctor Who or in the multi media phenomenon A Hitchkiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The third opens to a world where you may experience a life of peaceful, uneventful poverty   think of the hobbits in the series Lord of the Rings or most of the animals living in Narnia. Which do you choose and why? What are your hesitations and motivations?**

I would choose 3rd first then 2nd , Reason is need securuty too, It would have been great if I would Have been getting both the things at once, but yeahh I am able to live my life with peach and with much security concerns that‚Äôs most mature option I would say, second is really good too but it giives a sense of being a Traveller, there is no solid ground to understand, while in 3rd I would be able to live with my partner and loved one and we would be able to create our own life out of that. First one is just really contrast to my thoughts although I wish I could be the one like that physically and mentally strong but as of now that really demands too much so Not that one.

**What do you wish people understood about you? Talk about a time you were misunderstood.**

Understood about me ? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt care much, I want them to see me as little different from people based on how I think and How I feel, Which seems little different from people around me, what else ? I don‚Äôt know what to say about this topic !, I want them to respect my pov, Which they mostly do. So I don‚Äôt really have that much feeling of feeling miunderstood. I mean it‚Äôs my world, I don‚Äôt care much, Why would I care, If I am allowing a person in life then what else is required ?

**What do you hope people won't notice about you? What are you uncomfortable being teased about?**

Previous response (3-4 months ago): I hope people don‚Äôt notice how much I feel out of place in the world  like I‚Äôm constantly scanning my environment, trying to act normal, trying to seem ‚Äútogether,‚Äù when inside I often feel lost. I don‚Äôt want them to see how unsure I am about basic things‚Ä¶ how something as simple as booking a hotel or asking for help can make me freeze. I‚Äôm scared that people might see through the calm and smart, Intelleigent ,mature  image they‚Äôve formed of me and realize I‚Äôm not as capable or put together as they assumed. Like really ! I really don‚Äôt want them to notice how fragile I feel physically too   that I have a lean body, and even though people say I look good or even idealize me as boyfriend or husband material, deep down I feel not ‚Äúprepared or enough‚Äù That hits me the hardest. It‚Äôs not about looks,   it‚Äôs about this nagging feeling that I won‚Äôt be able to protect someone I love, or even handle real world threats. I overthink how I‚Äôd react in those situations‚Ä¶ and I hate that I doubt myself so much. I‚Äôm uncomfortable being teased about anything that touches these fears. Like being called too quiet, Impractical, Sensitive  especially when people frame it as a joke. I know they might not mean harm, but it strikes somewhere deep, like a confirmation of everything I already fear I lack. I don‚Äôt want to be seen as weak, or indecisive, or  soft‚Ä¶ and yet that‚Äôs how I often feel. I think what scares me most is the idea that someone could look at me and see all of this  the insecurity, the doubt, the way I live so much in my head   and then decide I‚Äôm not prepared and so much to Improve . That‚Äôs the thing I keep trying to hide, even from myself sometimes.

**What's worse   to be seen as caring more than you do or less than you do? Why? Do you think you come across one way or the other? Do you typically pretend to care more or to care less?**

Previous response (2 3 months ago): What‚Äôs worse for me is definitely being seen as caring less than I do. Because when that happens, it feels like a complete misreading of who I am   like all the depth of what I feel or notice has been erased. I don‚Äôt express myself openly unless I trust someone deeply, so most people probably don‚Äôt realize how much I actually care. I process things internally, I observe, I carry emotional weight quietly  and that can look cold or indifferent from the outside. But the truth is, I care a lot. Probably too much sometimes. I scan people‚Äôs moods, their tone‚Ä¶ even if I don‚Äôt say anything. I just don‚Äôt always show it in real time, or I worry that showing it would be too much. So I hold it in   and that often makes me look more distant or detached than I really am. I think I do tend to pretend I care less than I actually do (Honestly it‚Äôs hard for me to express). Especially in situations where caring too much would make me feel vulnerable or exposed   or where the other person isn‚Äôt emotionally available.

**Think about a time that someone else tried to control your actions   to tell you what to do, to manipulate you, or influence you. How did you feel and how did you react? What went through your mind?**

Previous response (3-4 months ago): I hate when someone tries to control my actions my words or something. I don't usually take advice because Internally I analyze that a lot through different frameworks then I think Is this really applicable for me ? Or I really need an advice I just know it ! Ig you have to shut off your mouth,  or this advice is overgeneralized which I have been already known. does this advice really suitable for me. no I don't need your help I will figure it out in my own I hate taking advice and But I like giving advice if someone asks for.

**When you first meet someone, what are your first thoughts? What judgments do you make and what kinds of considerations do you have? Are you more concerned with what they think of you or what you think of them? If you are preparing to meet someone new, what do you hope about them and what do you fear about them?**

When I first meet someone I am more concerned about What I think of them like are they really like the one I am looking for (If I talk about romantic settings ), I want that person to be more Intellectually curious, have similar worldview, I don't want that person to be lazy or sleepy, I want that person to be growth minded person who loves to grow and reading and other solitary activities. I sometimes think If the Image I have of that person is too idealistic which doesn‚Äôt really exists because It‚Äôs getting shaped by my past experience.

Previous response (3-4 months ago): When I met her first time the only thing that i saw withing her was her intellectual curiosity and her softness , kindness which really made me feel really good. when she send me lots of psychology videos and talked about philosophical ideas it made me feel really good. but the Judgments that I have made till now is she is chaotic, and easily swayed by feelings, lives in fantasy than staying grounded, intense in love, she is ready for self erasure which actually isn't good. but I am little more concerned about how she sees me because yet I don't feel she has seen me completely (that I am not really capable of love! I don't have financial independence, not ready to deal with this world and so on.) I understand I give her emotional and intellectual support she loves me she loves my brain and my individuality away from tribalism. but Still that doesn't make life easy. ( It was written 3-4 months ago, But I hate this girl. )

**Think about the last time you cried (if you've recently lost a loved one or gone through another similarly difficult experience, you can go back further and choose a random instance). What caused this? Who was around? Were you crying out of sadness, joy, frustration, or some other factor? How did you feel afterwards? Did it change anything? Is this typical for you?**

I last cried because I was thinking about the future it seemed really dark to me, I was just thinking about future how would I going to surive so much responsibility, so much to do, I am lagging in studies because of the gape of a year, no one really know That I have wasted my one year, I want to learn a lot of things, But it feels like I have lost some part of my curiorsity, I don;t know, Sometimes I don‚Äôt know much about what to do, I really value my brain and I constantly compare my brain to other fellows out there feeling that I am not really competent or got the good brain, going through IQ Tests (although It‚Äôs clear that I have 120+ IQ) but still I feel I want to know more but I feel lazy sometimes too read something, & even when sometimes I try to read psyhcology it gets overwhelming and losing interest in Cybersecurity as well, at the same time I am going through few medical issues, so these are things really makes me cry, and I am not even that much connected to my parents emotionally.

Previous response (3-4 months ago): I was crying alone because I was feeling helpless because my gf had gone through a lot in my past and when I was not able to express my thinking or feeling while I was trying to breakup because the burdens I have she was thinking I used her but it was not about this it was more about unconscious disconnection which made me feel me numb it wasn't my choice because I had so much things too think about and she used to constantly ask for closure. and I am little afraid of intimacy too.

**Think about the last time you felt really happy, joyful, or satisfied. What caused this feeling? What was different? What keeps you from feeling this way all the time?**

Last time happy,  Hmmm, It‚Äôs been really long since I have been really happy, I have achieved few milestone but I am not happy about those achievements much, When I solved few puzzle which were getting wronged by few people at that time I was happy, When a psychology student got stunned when I told her I am not a psychology student, because the way I was talking was more like a psychology students SOOO Yeah ! That made me happy too, When I am use of someone, When the knowledge I possess is applicable somewhere I really feel happy about that. I love when I feel I know something which most people don‚Äôt know !

Previous response (3-4 months ago): When I was Solving Cybersecurity Challenges I felt really happy because after long time I found myself again on the track I was solving those challenges for 10 12 Hours and it made me soo happy because I was learning new things and I could see I can be again competent like I used to. i want to do bug hunting so whenever I report bug I feel happy but when I use automation in that I really feel I am making myself fool so I try to use my mind as much as I can and manually. so this is the recent most thing that made me happy and I was happy when my said me you are soo adorable and made me sleep while narrating a story for me.

**If you were a tragic hero, what would be your fatal flaw? If you were a character in a comedy, what would be your distinguishing trait (i.e. stingy with money, fastidious, shallow, pretentious, etc.) Do you think others would agree with these?**

Previous response (3-4 months ago): If I were a tragic hero, my fatal flaw would probably be overthinking paired with emotional restraint. I internalize everything  scan, predict, analyze, imagine   but often delay action or expression until it‚Äôs either too late or no longer relevant. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt feel   I feel deeply   but I don‚Äôt always trust that the world is a safe place for those emotions. So I hesitate, hold back, wait for the perfect moment that often never comes. I also think my quiet intensity would be unintentionally funny   like someone who makes ordering coffee feel like a moral crisis, or who zones out during a party trying to figure out the emotional subtext of a single word someone used two hours ago. There‚Äôs something low key absurd about being so inwardly tangled and yet appearing calm on the outside. But yeahh someone can tell me he is into something internally thinking something.

**Think over the past day or week and make a mental list (you can also write it here) of ways that you have done badly   by yourself, by others, etc.   any time that you have done something, and wish you would have done better. How would you characterize these instances? What caused you to fail and what was your reaction? Are you more likely to be hard on yourself or to find excuses for yourself?**

Previous response (3-4 months ago): I am more likely going to be hard on myself because in past days and months I gave so much time to my closed ones which I should not have I should have focused on my career aims& goals and conserve time for myself I could Have talked less to my gf. Just once a day. I was empathising with her and she became more clingy which made me feel engulfed by her emotions and her presence. like I can't stay with someone who constantly wants closure as an escape from the reality else I would have to do it everything for me and for others around me my gf my family which is burden.I avoided a phone call that I knew was important   not because I was busy, but because I didn‚Äôt feel emotionally ready to talk. I told myself I‚Äôd do it later, but later never came.I don‚Äôt usually externalize blame. I don‚Äôt look for excuses. I‚Äôm more likely to be hard on myself, sometimes irrationally so, even when the mistake was minor. I rehearse it internally, trying to find the pattern   which is helpful in moderation but can also spiral into self doubt if I‚Äôm not careful.

**a. Imagine meeting an evil version of yourself   your 'dark side'   and describe this person.**

(3-4 months ago) a manipulator. whose emotion level is up and down sometimes sees emotions from very logical lens like when everyone is crying I look that from logical perspective and tried to hide behind logic. like my gf is an emotional person so sometimes she told me you act like very logical person but you are very coward hide behind logic. you don't see my pains which I obviously felt but I don't perhaps I didn't act the right way. I would be me stripped of empathy, using emotional insight not to comfort or understand, but to manipulate and exploit. I‚Äôd know exactly what to say to make people open up, trust, even fall for me and then I'd use that closeness to feed my ego, desires or to test how far people would go to please or follow me. Emotionally manipulative. Morally self-righteous.

**b. Describe your ideal self**.

My ideal self is someone who feels comfortable and equipped to interact with the world  not as an act, but as a natural extension of who I am. He doesn‚Äôt shrink from social situations or overanalyze every interaction; he moves through them with quiet confidence. He isn‚Äôt trying to perform or hide   he just shows up, calmly and honestly. He‚Äôs introverted, yes, but not avoidant. He knows how to balance solitude and connection. He speaks assertively when needed, without guilt or fear, but to express what matters with clarity. He still has a lean frame, but he wears it with confidence. He‚Äôs physically capable, and more importantly, he feels strong in his mind and body. He doesn‚Äôt equate masculinity with size or aggression. He‚Äôs aware that his intelligence  both cognitive and emotional  is real, but he‚Äôs also developed practical competence. He can handle himself  from protecting loved ones to navigating real world stress   without spiraling into helplessness or analysis paralysis. He isn‚Äôt overwhelmed by scenarios like talking to authority figures or making plans   because he trusts his ability to respond when life demands it. He doesn‚Äôt catastrophize every outcome. He‚Äôs emotionally open, yet self contained. He‚Äôs able to love without losing himself, and he knows that true connection isn‚Äôt about being ‚Äúenough‚Äù in some abstract way   it‚Äôs about showing up sincerely, consistently. He isn‚Äôt afraid of the weight of love or the risk of closeness. He accepts it. He doesn‚Äôt need to prove his independence by rejecting support. He knows that true strength includes interdependence.

**What is your experience with and how do you deal with the following:**

a. Loneliness

Loneliness,Hmmm.I mean I don‚Äôt feel that lonely tbh, Because I know if you have right charactersitics and personality, It‚Äôs easier to get someone special, I am not very familiar with loneliness, although sometimes when I look other in relationship, I am mostly like how easily they get satisfied by their partner & why do I need so many things ? Like I feel okay with myself, & I been in relationship too, and I know people are ready to be relationship but I don‚Äôt want it because I am not ready & IInteranlly II know I have to improve a lot, So yeahh not too much into loneliness stuffs.

b. Doubt

Yeahh I get so many doubts aboout myself, my capacity to handle world, capacity to capable enough, mature enough, wise enough, Intelligent enough, smart enough.lots of I usually doubt myself a lot because I don‚Äôt trust much myself what I think What I feel, What if It‚Äôs my own comfort zone which is disguised as self-compassion ?

c. Boredom

I rarely get bore there always something to do, Music , reading articles, Asking questions.there are lots of ways to make myself busy I don‚Äôt usually get bored.

d. Laziness

Yeahh I am bit lazy these days but I am not a lazy atleast I don‚Äôt want myself calling as lazy , I consider myself a hardworking person if I am in right mindeset and mental health conditon, I even skip foods and social gathering when I am working on soomething.

e. temper

I am mostly silent, I rarely scream or something even If I do, I Just realise afterwards like I know how I reacted, It was soo expressive damn ! I hate it, I should not be having this much loud, but honestly people see me as quiet only, it;s me who sees a human expression as something loud, for eg. I know so many people laugh loud but when I do (although it‚Äôs rare). I notice how I laughed and I try to avoid it, I don‚Äôt like it, I just don‚Äôt like it. I okay being seen as calm serious and quiet.

**Which of the 'seven deadly sins'   pride, wrath, sloth, envy, lust, gluttony, avarice   do you relate to most and why? Which do you relate to least and why? Feel free to go into depth about these.**

If I see myself in these ‚Äúseven deadly sins‚Äù‚Ä¶ I think the one I relate to the most is envy‚Ä¶ but not in the sense of wishing bad for others‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more like comparison that never stops‚Ä¶ I see people with stronger backgrounds, supportive parents, more money, more confidence‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but notice the gap‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not that I hate them‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more like I ask myself why I don‚Äôt have the same ease‚Ä¶ why I struggle so much with things that come naturally to them‚Ä¶I felt this especially after my relationships‚Ä¶ my first long-distance one was strange but meaningful‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt even call much, mostly text‚Ä¶ but I still fell for her sincerity, her intelligence, her way of seeing life‚Ä¶ and when she left, I broke‚Ä¶ because she came in at a time when my self-confidence was already weak‚Ä¶ hair loss had already made me insecure about my looks‚Ä¶ she made me feel better, more stable, even started eating properly again‚Ä¶ so losing her cut deep‚Ä¶ and envy got sharper‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd see people who seemed so stable in love and life and wonder why I couldn‚Äôt hold things together the same way‚Ä¶The second one that fits me is avarice.. but not in the greedy sense‚Ä¶ for me, it‚Äôs more about financial independence and gaining knowledge, which is tbh eating me these days I feel soo useless in group conversation, I don‚Äôt know I really get deprressed when I don‚Äôt hve any iinformation related to that particular topic i really feel dumb‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to keep depending on my parents‚Ä¶ I want to be able to stand on my own‚Ä¶ because money feels like survival‚Ä¶ dignity‚Ä¶ freedom‚Ä¶ and when I see others my age already doing that, I feel restless inside‚Ä¶ like I should‚Äôve been there already, like I‚Äôm falling behind‚Ä¶On the other side, the one I least connect to is lust‚Ä¶ even though in one of my relationships sex came into the picture really quickly, I never saw it as the center of connection‚Ä¶ for me it‚Äôs always been about the mind, the sincerity, the shared values‚Ä¶ sex was just there‚Ä¶ but never the reason I stayed or cared‚Ä¶And then there‚Äôs wrath‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt usually explode at people‚Ä¶ if anything, I turn it against myself‚Ä¶ constant self-criticism, blaming myself more than anyone else‚Ä¶ sloth also shows up sometimes‚Ä¶ but not as laziness‚Ä¶ more like overthinking myself into paralysis‚Ä¶ I want to do things, learn, build‚Ä¶ but I get trapped in loops between psychology, MBTI, cybersecurity, philosophy‚Ä¶ and I end up doing nothing‚Ä¶ and about pride‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel it strongly either‚Ä¶ people often call me mature, gentleman, ‚Äúperfect boyfriend material‚Äù‚Ä¶ but instead of feeling proud, I feel like I can‚Äôt live up to it‚Ä¶ almost like I‚Äôm wearing a mask I can‚Äôt carry forever‚Ä¶

**Link a song you relate to and explain why.**

Probably this is the song I relate most with, although I am not really sure, as These days I am listening comparatively lesser songs. (I don‚Äôt know I am going though some sort of anhedonia and apathy )

Back then I just tilted it ""Fan Made Story"" I gave it a better name this time around. I've since some edit/updates, hopefully making it better. Please note that this story only purposefully contains references to stories they covered from Tommy Taffy and before, anything else is coincidence (the Candle cove reference is there because I like Candle Cove. They hadn't covered it when I made the story). Have fun finding all of the references!

Troy always had trouble sleeping when he could hear the footsteps. For whatever reason he just couldn‚Äôt fall asleep after they started. At least this night he wasn‚Äôt alone. He was having a sleepover with his friend, Keith.

‚ÄúIs that your parents?‚Äù Keith asked.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve checked and doesn‚Äôt come from the hallway‚Äù Troy said, ‚ÄúHere I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù

Troy got out of bed and slowly tiptoed his way to his bedroom door. He grabbed the doorknob then pressed his other hand on the door. He pulled the door against his hand to prevent it from making any noise and started to turn the knob. Troy was slow, so as to not have the doorknob make a squeak or raddle. Once the doorknob had been fully turned, he slowly opened the door just a crack by pulling the door with the doorknob and pushing it out with his other hand on the door, allowing him to move the door as slow and quietly as he wanted. Troy ushered Keith over with his head. Keith looked out the crack to see an empty dark hallway while the footsteps continued. ‚ÄúSee‚Äù, Troy whispered, ‚Äúno one‚Äôs there‚Äù.

Troy slowly closed the door in the same manner he opened it.

‚ÄúSo where does it come from then?‚Äù Keith asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, I just wait for them to stop. Then I can fall asleep‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo what? Do you just lay in your bed, staring at the ceiling?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, check this out‚Äù.

Troy turned to his left and tiptoed to his closet. Opening it revealed an old small box TV. ‚ÄúDad gave this to me when they got a new one.‚Äù Troy excitedly whispered, ‚Äúso I just watch some TV until the footsteps stop‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh cool, what shows are on at night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll show the channel I like‚Äù

Troy turned on the TV with the remote. When he hit the power button, he quickly hit the mute button right after. The screen turned on showing some puppets dressed as pirates.

‚ÄúOh! I know this one‚Äù Keith almost yelled before catching himself back to a whisper.

‚ÄúYeah, it always turns on to this channel,‚Äù Troy explained, ‚Äúbut I stopped watching this one after the screaming episode.‚Äù

Troy hit the channel up button 3 times, skipping 2 dead channels, and landing on a channel showing a man in a bear costume talking with some kids.

¬†‚ÄúThis is the Mr. Bear channel. It‚Äôs got some good stuff for nighttime‚Äù.

Troy pushed the volume up button to bring the volume from 0 to 3. Loud enough to hear, but not loud enough for the sound to go beyond his bedroom walls. Or at least he hoped it didn‚Äôt. After a few minutes of watching, Mr. Bear told the viewers that he was wanting to meet more of his fans and to send in a postcard for a chance to get on the show.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Keith exclaimed, ‚Äúyou can get on the show?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I gave my dad a postcard to send in a week ago, so I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll get on. If I do I‚Äôll see if I can bring you too‚Äù

‚ÄúOh man that‚Äôd be so cool‚Äù

¬†

The memories of that event returned to Troy while looking at an old postcard that had fallen onto the ground along with a few other letters. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Troy‚Äôs dad said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all the stuff I‚Äôve kept on you in my file cabinet. Don‚Äôt know if it will come in handy, but I don‚Äôt want it anymore‚Äù.

‚ÄúThanks dad,‚Äù Troy said in a monotone voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure all this will come in handy during college‚Äù.

It was moving day for Troy and Keith, as they were heading off to college. Troy was lucky enough to have an unused house in the family, that once belonged to his grandfather, close to Keith and his new college. His family had agreed to let them use it for the duration.

‚ÄúLet me get those for you,‚Äù Keith said as he gathered all the letters off the ground.

Troy‚Äôs father continued, ‚ÄúNow your grandpa‚Äôs old place is in the woods a little out of the way. Even from the town it‚Äôs nearby. You‚Äôve been there, you should remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad it‚Äôs been like 10 years‚Äù Troy rebutted.

‚ÄúWell anyway, no one‚Äôs used it since your big sister and, well, you know. Since she went‚Ä¶ ran away 4 years ago. The family is a bit wary about that place‚Äù

Troy didn‚Äôt know why his dad always lied about that. It was plainly obvious that his sister went missing during her time at the house. The trail of breadcrumbs she left on her twitter made it clear something weird happened. Troy held hope that he may be able to find some clues to what happened to her. Though the fact that the college was only a 15 minute drive from the house, and the house would be rent free, was a bigger motivation for him to live there.

‚ÄúWell, thanks dad,‚Äù Troy sighed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure everything will be fine‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkay, but before you go remember what I always told you about the woods. Don‚Äôt touch the stairs and smash the eggs.‚Äù Troy‚Äôs dad gave him the advice with a pat on his shoulder.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Troy grimaced, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be going now. Hey Keith, you got the place on the GPS?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, all loaded, and so is your stuff. I‚Äôll put these letters in front with us. Everything will spill out if I try to put them in the back.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù Troy turned back to his right to see his dad had already gone back inside, ‚ÄúBye to you too Dad.‚Äù

Troy got into the driver‚Äôs seat of his car and Keith popped into the passengers‚Äô. The GPS came up with its first direction, ‚ÄúTurn Left In 300 Feet‚Äù.

¬†

‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs kind of weird. None of these letters have a return address on them. Or stamps. They just have your name and address on them.‚Äù Keith mentioned to Troy as he looked through the pile of letters he had picked up.

‚ÄúSomeone must have just given them to my dad to give to me, but he never did, and just shoved them into that file cabinet.‚Äù Troy said, annoyed with his dad‚Äôs choices.

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs this one?‚Äù Keith held up the postcard addressed to Mr. Bear.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember when I showed you the Mr. Bear channel during that one sleepover?

‚ÄúThe Mr. Bear‚Ä¶ Oh! Yeah, I remember. That sleepover with the footsteps. How could I forget something so creepy. Did you ever figure out what those footsteps were?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they just stopped when I was 13 after my parents divorced. Anyway, that‚Äôs the postcard I wanted my dad to send Mr. Bear, but as you can see, he just threw it in the file cabinet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs weird‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really, he‚Äôs always been like that‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, not that. I know that. What‚Äôs weird is Mr. Bear‚Äôs address of seems to be in the same town we‚Äôre heading to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Really!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah see, same town name. Same state. Maybe we should check it out. We got 2 weeks before college starts‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but what if someone still lives there?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not saying go into the place. Just drive by. I don‚Äôt think we would be able to go in anyway. It‚Äôs probably recording studio in town.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey might do tours‚Äù.

The GPS comes to life with another direction, ‚ÄúTurn Right Up Ahead‚Äù.

‚ÄúHey, do you mind if I open some of these letters?‚Äù Keith asked, ‚ÄúWe got a long drive, and it might be fun‚Äù.

Troy gave it some thought. ‚ÄúSure, whatever is written in those can‚Äôt be too bad.‚Äù Troy said, ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre just from my Mom and my Dad didn‚Äôt want me to read them. I mean I haven‚Äôt even seen her since she left after that whole thing with the birthday party‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat birthday party?‚Äù Keith asked.

‚ÄúYou remember, back with Randy. We were picking on these new kids and the older one kicked our asses. So Randy wanted us to get my Dad‚Äôs guns so we could get him back at that one kid‚Äôs party.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, right,‚Äù Keith recalled, ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt go to the party because your Dad drove us to the woods to do target practice before we took the guns to‚Ä¶ wherever we told him we were going, and then he got drunk and passed out leaving us all stranded in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but we did kind of luck out. Us not being there when that kid killed Randy and all‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ anyway‚Äù. Keith looked through the letters, trying to see if there was an order to them. ‚ÄúHey, this one has a stamp on it‚Äù, Keith exclaimed, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with this one‚Äù

Keith opened the letter. Inside was a picture that showed 2 kids out of focus, and a postcard.

‚ÄúWonder what‚Äôs up with that‚Äù Troy said.

‚ÄúWell the postcard looks like,‚Äù Keith took a moment as he remembered something about a postcard like this. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs from that class project, with the balloons. We tied a postcard with our address on it to a balloon and let them go‚Äù.

‚ÄúReally? I always thought that no one ever found my balloon. But I guess dad just never told me we got these letters.‚Äù

The both of them sat in silence as the dots connected in their heads. Keith spoke up, ‚Äúyou know, giving kid‚Äôs addresses to strangers was maybe not the best idea for our school to do‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Troy agreed, ‚Äútell you what. Open the rest, don‚Äôt look at them, but if they are all just pictures, we toss them and forget it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal‚Äù.

Keith opened the rest of the letters just enough to see what was inside. ‚ÄúAll pics‚Äù he said.

They both nodded staring straight forward as Keith opened his window and tossed the letters out onto the empty road.

‚ÄúTurn Left Up Ahead‚Äù

¬†

The drive took longer than the day had left. After a stop at a hotel, and a few more hours, they came upon the town. Keith was passing the time reading random Wiki articles

‚Äú‚Ä¶ and then the minors closed off the borrasca.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a borrasca‚Äù Troy asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs see,‚Äù Keith copy and pasted the text to look it up, ‚ÄúThis says ‚Äòa mine section or an entire mine that is largely oreless‚Äô. Makes since with what I was reading‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really sound like, just ‚Äònothing in a mine‚Äô to me‚Äù, Troy retorted, ‚ÄúMaybe more like a Spanish party or something. Like, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt forget the pi√±ata for the borrasca‚Äô or something‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, or like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so hung over from the borrasca last night‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs like, a boring party. Cause like bore-asca?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄôOh man that party last night was such a bore-asca I *had* to get drunk.‚Äô Or what about a boogie man, like you tell your kids ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre bad the borrasca will get you‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no! He‚Äôll bore me to death‚Äù

‚ÄúThose planes and boats that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle, it‚Äôs the borrasca.‚Äù

‚Äú9/11, it was the borrasca‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the answer to the universe? Borrasca‚Äù.

‚Äú‚ÄôMommy where do babies come from?‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòWhy they come from the borrasca dear‚Äô‚Äù

They both laughed at their own jokes as they turned right and enter the town.

‚ÄúFrist, we need to find a gas station. I‚Äôm almost empty,‚Äù Troy says.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one up there on the left‚Äù Keith was quick to spot the corner gas station.

Troy got out to fill his tank. As the gas started to pump into the car, a man approached.

‚ÄúHello there, you don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre from around here,‚Äù the man said, ‚Äúwhat you up to around these parts?‚Äù

He was older and looked like he‚Äôd been around the block a few times.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Troy was caught off guard, ‚ÄúWe are just moving in. We are attending the college just out of town‚Äù.

‚ÄúOooh,‚Äù the man responded with a grin, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know it was college season already‚Äù.

‚ÄúY-yeah.‚Äù The gas pump stopped.¬† ‚ÄúWell, we should get going. We got a lot to unpack‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh, sure, sure. Don‚Äôt want to be keeping you up now‚Äù.

Troy quickly returned the nozzle to its designated spot on the pump and turned right to get back into the car before stopping. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he called to the man, ‚Äúdo you know anything about a place where they filmed for a kid‚Äôs TV channel years ago?‚Äù

The old man stopped himself from walking away. ‚ÄúFilming for TV you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúYo Troy, what‚Äôch you doing man? Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù Keith called out from the car.

‚ÄúJust a minute,‚Äù Troy had a thought that an old man who randomly approaches strangers at a gas station may have info on strange and old thing in town, and he wanted that info.

‚ÄúI think there was a thing about a guy making videos years ago, but not for TV I think,‚Äù the man continued.

‚ÄúWhat about th-,‚Äù Troy reached back into the car to fetch the postcard he wrote so many years ago, ‚Äúwhat about this address? Do you know what‚Äôs there?‚Äù

Troy stood nervously, concerned and intrigued on what the man may say.

¬†‚ÄúOh yes, that old Mr. Weller‚Äôs place, just out of town to the east.‚Äù The man said reassured in his own knowledge. ‚ÄúInteresting fellow that Mr. Weller. Hear he‚Äôs good with kids, used to have a bunch that hung around his place back in the day. Not so much anymore though. Nope, we don‚Äôt see too much of old Mr. Weller anymore. Not so much since all that commotion a good 10 to 15 years ago. Even less since that reporter went missing 4 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúReporter!‚Äù Troy nearly yelled, ‚Äúwas that Alice?‚Äù

‚ÄúThink so. You know her too?‚Äù the man asked more curiously.

‚ÄúUm, yeah. Yeah she was-‚Äù

‚ÄúTroy! Come on,‚Äù Keith yelled from the car.

‚ÄúRight, sorry gotta go. Lots to do‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh no problem,‚Äù the man said calmly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always around if you want to chat. Always around.‚Äù

Troy got back into the car with what seemed to be a lot on his mind.

‚ÄúMan,‚Äù Keith said exasperatedly, snapping Troy back into focus, ‚Äúthat guy was creepy. Who just walks up to some stranger like that and start asking them their personal business?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm sure we could have a long discussion about that, but,‚Äù Troy took a breath, ‚ÄúYou think Mr. Bear is Mr. Weller? And what about my sister, Alice? Is it all connected?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Keith said, ‚ÄúAnd I thought you and your sister didn‚Äôt get along all that well‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we didn‚Äôt get along, it‚Äôs just that it was hard to interact with her. She had memory problems. She didn‚Äôt remember things we did the previous week but was fine with things even earlier. But that doesn't mean I didn‚Äôt care about her,‚Äù Troy rebutted.

‚ÄúWell, I think we should unpack our stuff before we unpack that. Let‚Äôs just get to the house,‚Äù Keith said.

They turned the GPS back on as it gave the next direction, ‚ÄúTurn Left Onto Main Street‚Äù

¬†

The house was a 2-story building. The worn red siding made it look like an old barn. Its roof was covered with leaves, pine needles, and sticks. Plants overgrew most of the property. An old garage lay collapsed looking as if wind had blown it over.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta admit,‚Äù Keith said, ‚Äúbetter than I expected‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think someone from the family comes by at least once a year to do some maintenance, but it still needs a lot of work,‚Äù Troy said.

Troy went to the door and pulled out an old key to unlock it while Keith started to grab their things from the car. The inside mirrored the out. Each room held the memory of when it was last cleaned, but only the memory. Furniture was orderly but covered with cloths. ¬†A layer of dust covered every surface. Cobwebs decorated the corners of the ceiling. Long dead spiders in the kitchen sink. None of the lights turned on, and the faucets ran dry.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to find breaker and main water line to turn them back on‚Äù Troy told Keith as Keith put down the first set of luggage.

‚ÄúThat stuff is normally in the basement, right?‚Äù Keith suggested.

‚ÄúYeah, the door to the basement should be next to the kitchen and hallway I think‚Äù.

‚ÄúOK, um... Lets get our stuff out of the car first. We can go into the basement to look for the circuit breaker and water line later,‚Äù Keith nervously suggested.

‚ÄúGot-cha‚Äù

The two unloaded their things from the car, stacking everything in the living room for later sorting into other rooms. The postcard to Mr. Bear placed purposely on the coffee table. It took them no longer than half an hour. A bit too short of a time then they wanted to allow them to prepare themselves to go into the basement.

‚ÄúAlright, so where is the basement stairs?‚Äù Keith asked.

‚ÄúRight, they should be by the kitchen and hall,‚Äù Troy looked over to where he believed the stairs should be. From the living room he could see the kitchen and the hall next to each other separated by about 2 and half feet, and no sign of stairs. ‚ÄúMaybe on the other side then‚Äù.

Troy walked down the hallway, seeing three doors. He opened the door on the right first, reviling a closet. On the left was the bathroom. Strait ahead was a bedroom. ‚ÄúWeird,‚Äù Troy said to himself, ‚Äúno stairs down‚Äù.

‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre in one of the rooms‚Äù Keith suggested.

The duo took a more in-depth look in all of the rooms on the first floor. The only stairs that were found were the obvious stairs leading up to the second floor. ‚ÄúI found the circuit breaker in the kitchen,‚Äù Keith yelled, ‚Äúno basement though‚Äù

‚ÄúI got the water heater in the bathroom‚Äù Troy responded, ‚Äúbut also no basement.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe there‚Äôs like a servant‚Äôs stairwell on the second floor that leads all the way down. Old houses are weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs have a look‚Äù.

They both went upstairs. The second floor had less square footage than the first, comprising a master bedroom at the end, a regular bedroom at the other side and a bathroom separating them. All rooms were searched, and no stairs were found. Only an entrance to the attic, which neither wanted to go up to.

‚ÄúStairs that lead to the basement from the second floor was a long shot‚Äù Troy said.

‚ÄúYeah, but where else,‚Äù Keith thought for a moment, ‚ÄúOh of course. Don‚Äôt old houses tend to have access to the basement from the outside?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh duh! Let‚Äôs take a look around the outside‚Äù.

The duo walked outside and began their way around the outside of the house. The myriad of overgrown plants made the search more difficult than they had hoped.

¬†‚ÄúAn entrance to a basement from the outside is supposed to look like a door almost flat on the ground, right?‚Äù Keith asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I think so.‚Äù

The two of them were stumped, not able to find an entrance like what they thought.

‚ÄúMaybe there are stairs in there,‚Äù Keith pointed to what looked like a shed attached to the house. ‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs locked though‚Äù.

‚ÄúHang on a sec, I think I saw a key in the house. I‚Äôll be right back‚Äù. Troy went into the house and returned in about two minutes, holding two identical keys on a key ring. ‚ÄúTry these‚Äù.

The padlock opened with the use of the key. Opening the door revealed not stairs, but the water pump.

¬†‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Keith signed, ‚ÄúAt least we found the water pump‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I just know this place had a basement. I can remember being too scared to go down into it‚Äù.

‚ÄúMaybe it was a different house you‚Äôre thinking of‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, I think my sister even mentioned it on her Twitter. Here,‚Äù Troy took out his phone and opened the app to look up his sister‚Äôs account. ‚ÄúShit, I forgot. Twitter started to delete unused accounts‚Äù.

‚ÄúDo you know what she said about the basement?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, something about there being someone who was pretending to be Mom, Dad, me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, there isn‚Äôt a basement now. Maybe she got rid of it or something‚Äù.

Troy looked at Keith like he was an idiot. ‚ÄúSure whatever we can figure it out later‚Äù.

‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs finish unpacking. I call the master bedroom!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, this is my family‚Äôs house. I get the master. You can have one of the others‚Äù.

They turned to their right and went back inside to finish unpacking their things. Doing their best to push back the feeling of a mysterious danger just beneath their feet.

¬†

The next morning, they went to the college to finish their enrollment process. After, they decided to walk around to familiarize themselves with the campus. By the time they finished with their tour it was getting to lunchtime. Realizing that they didn‚Äôt have much food at home, they decided to check out the restaurants in town.

‚ÄúHow about that place?‚Äù Keith pointed out a small sandwich shop that seemed to not have any customers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the least busy place we‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúA place that isn‚Äôt busy. At lunchtime? The food has got to be horrible‚Äù.

‚ÄúWell, if we eat at the worst place first, then every other place will be great in comparison. Come on, it can be too bad‚Äù.

‚ÄúFine. At least we will get our food fast‚Äù.

They turned left into the parking lot. The bell on the door gave a ring as they entered. The shop was small. It had one row of tables, a typical sandwich shop style counter showing off all the available toppings, and not much else. There was one worker, a kid in his mid-teens, to help. The two made their orders and sat down with their food. Kieth took a bite of his sandwich.

‚ÄúYou know, not as bad as I was thinking. Not amazing, just not bad‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, mediocre but edible. By the way, we should pick up some food on our way back‚Äù, Troy suggested.

‚ÄúYeah, we should do that. We only have quick microwave stuff back at the house‚Äù.

‚ÄúAlso, what are your thoughts on going to check out that address?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? You mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah Mr. Bear‚Äôs address. I want to see if it‚Äôs a house or some other kind of building. I already saved the address to my phone,‚Äù Keith showed Troy on his phone.

‚ÄúAlright, but just a drive by‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh yeah, we‚Äôre not going into the place‚Äù.

The bell rang as another person entered the sandwich shop. He was a man that dressed as though he had wealth. He wore a red business suit, slicked back hair, shiny black shoes, and a smile that looked only for show. After a few words to the soul worker, he noticed Troy and Keith and made his way over to them.

‚ÄúHello there, the name‚Äôs James Prescott. I‚Äôm the owner of this shop. I just wanted to thank you for stopping by.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no problem,‚Äù Troy awkwardly muttered.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you boys around here,‚Äù James continued, ‚Äúare you some of the new colleges kids?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äù Troy was cut off as James spoke.

‚ÄúGreat! I love to see you kids coming into town. I actually own a lot of places in town. Most of them actually,‚Äù James punctuated with a laugh.

‚ÄúWow that‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù Keith said sarcastically.

‚ÄúI know, Thank you!‚Äù The sarcasm was lost on James.

An awkward pause interjected their conversation before Kieth spoke up. ‚ÄúSay, do you happen to own the newspaper?""

‚ÄúYeah I do. Need a subscription?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I was just wondering if you knew anything about one of the people who used to work there by the name Alice?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt run the newspaper. I just own it. But Alice? Right, I know her she went missing, what 5, 6 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was 4‚Äù Troy interjected.

‚ÄúRight, years just fly by. Well I‚Äôm afraid that passed knowing that she went missing, I don‚Äôt really know anything else.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. I was just wondering,‚Äù Troy said dejected.

‚ÄúWell, I got to go,‚Äù James said turning around walking to the door, ‚ÄúI hope wherever she is,‚Äù James turned his head to Troy and Keith with a smirk, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs doing just fine‚Äù.

James left the shop, the bell ringing on his way out. The lone worker was annoyed that James had forgotten his usual sandwich he had just freshly made.

‚ÄúThe fuck was that?‚Äù Keith exclaimed, ‚ÄúHe was fucking with us, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Troy said confused.

They quickly finished their meal and left. Keith took the driver‚Äôs seat. It was a short drive just out of town. They came upon an old house that looked dilapidated but not long abandoned. A single number 9 hung on the house. The top of a silo could be seen poking up from behind the house.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Troy sighed, ‚Äúlooks like it was a house‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, I was expecting that based off of what we were told,‚Äù Keith responded.

‚ÄúJust looking at it, the whole ‚Äòget a chance to get on the show‚Äô really sinks in‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, it was pretty fucked up. Maybe that‚Äôs why your dad didn‚Äôt send that postcard.‚Äù

‚ÄúI doubt that‚Äù.

They stared at the building as though expecting more. After a small amount of time the front door slowly began to open. Keith immediately slammed the accelerator.

‚ÄúWho! Keith!‚Äù Troy was pushed back into his seat as the car sped ahead. ‚ÄúCalm down man. It was probably just the wind‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo way man. We are in the boonies, sitting in front of a house, just staring at it. If there was a person there, they had a gun and were ready to shoot. We aren‚Äôt sticking around‚Äù.

They sped back to town. By the time they got there Keith‚Äôs adrenaline calmed down to a normal level. They tried to put the door and old house to the back of their minds as they got groceries. Albeit they were unable to get eggs. They returned to their house to settle down.

At a point in the afternoon, they heard a knock at the door. Troy walked up and opened the front door. Behind the screen door a man stood, holding a shotgun up to Troy‚Äôs head. Troy turned his head to the right at Keith with a worried look",1,1758679341.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False
1np01qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1np01qv/trying_to_plan_out_a_long_term_diet_looking_for/,"Trying to plan out a long term diet, looking for feedback and some answers to my noob questions","Some I‚Äôm currently in the early stages of planning out a diet to lose weight. I‚Äôve read through this article [here](https://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/) which was recommended to me, and it‚Äôs been my jumping off point for learning about the basics of nutrition science, such as what macros are and how to calculate my daily calorie intake to enter a caloric deficit.

For context, here is what I‚Äôve got so far:

- I‚Äôm currently 25M, 5‚Äô7‚Äù, and weigh around 189‚Äì191 lbs. 
- I work an office job and don‚Äôt work out much right now, though I have prior experience.
- My goal weight is 160‚Äì165 lbs.
- Online calculators estimated my maintenance calories at ~2100 kcal/day, which is probably close to my current intake since I‚Äôve been hovering at around this weight for awhile (fluctuating by ~5lbs, give or take).
- To enter a caloric deficit, based on the article, I‚Äôve calculated a daily caloric intake of 1902 kcal/day.
- My macros should slightly favor a carb-heavy diet: 150g protein, 154g carbs, and 76g fat per day (mainly because I am of south Asian descent, and my diet consists of a lot of carbs, like rice and flatbreads). 

Please let me know if you see any issues with these calculations.  

I am currently trying to try different recipes that I can make quickly or meal prep on a consistent scheduled basis , and I am starting to get stuck and in the weeds. Ive bulleted my questions below.

Full disclosure: I know many of these questions are searchable, and I‚Äôve looked most up myself. I‚Äôm asking here for more curated feedback, since I‚Äôm getting overwhelmed by generic info that doesn‚Äôt always address my super specific questions.

- I want a certain amount of dishes to be ones that I already consume from my South Asian upbringing, but just made healthier. Where I am stuck right now is how to take my recipes and calculate how much calories / macros they contain. 
      - For example, a dish I regularly eat is called [‚ÄúSambar‚Äù](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/andhra-sambar-recipe-how-to-make-south-indian-sambar/). This recipe I found online does not match the recipe I use since there is so many variations, and I am not sure how to take my recipes and properly calculate the amount of macros they contain. Part of gets me stuck is the fact that I may swap out ingredients, or buy different brands (where each brand has varying macros). How do I account for that when tracking macros? Do I just have to measure it each time I make it, or do I have to calculate an average? 
- Related to the question above is, how do I actually calculate the macros for each of my recipes? Where can I find up to date counts of calories for different ingredients? How do I account for when I may have to purchase a different brand with regard to my macros? For example, what if I have to purchase a different Greek yogurt brand, do I have to recalculate my macros for that week and every week that occurs? If you have any articles or videos that talk about this, I would very much appreciate it. 

- Do you measure and weigh everything? Like down to the amount of water and milk in your coffee? The amount of sugar? Or do you estimate? 

- I am really confused on calculating serving sizes, both for my own recipes and recipes I see online. A lot of times they won‚Äôt specify, or they will say things like ‚Äúserving size one cup (insert weight amount here)‚Äù. What do I do to calculate serving sizes? What does one cup mean, is it one measuring cup? Do I just have to estimate the protein amount and then try and divide everything easily? Do I do this using a food scale? And what do you do when recipes don‚Äôt specify what a ‚Äúserving size‚Äù should be?

- How do I estimate calories and macros for when I eat out, and should I even bother if they don‚Äôt offer any nutrition info? 


If you have any food resources for recipes that are vegetarian, quick to make and don‚Äôt contact beat peanuts and nut, please share them! (especially if they have nutrition info and specify serving sizes lol). Or any healthy snacks which I can buy. 


Appreciate any clarity, answers, and resources to answer my questions. Thank you!

1nozyp0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nozyp0,"FROSTPUNK: Challenging and Unforgiving, but Definitely a Worthy Experience!","This article was written by me after completing my fourth playthrough. Another failure, even though this time I got very, very close to my first victory. After cleaning up the table, I sat pondering and recalling each experience, each decision I made throughout the game. While cleaning up to prepare for the fifth playthrough, I suddenly realized something...

**Frostpunk** is a very strange game. The more I try to win this game, the more I'm losing something...

Players are placed in an alternate history timeline, at the end of the 19th century, when blizzards and harsh cold suddenly arrive. The Eternal Winter begins from there. Unlike familiar post-apocalyptic scenarios, where humans gain superpowers, advanced weapons, or face aliens or mutants. Frostpunk places us in a very human situation: only coal, wood, and a massive machine called The Generator. From those scarce resources, the player, as a leader, must confront the ruthless cold, their own moral boundaries, and every survival decision day by day to rebuild a home for the community of survivors. Frostpunk is not just a survival game, where strategy is paramount, but also an experience about faith, sacrifice, and the will to rebuild from the ashes. ***THE CITY MUST SURVIVE*** (or as I interpret it... the stubbornness to replay after each failure).

**1. An Impressive ""Survival Kit"" Box**

What caught my eye first was a ""huge"" game box in both quantity and quality. I really have to give a lot of praise to **Glass Cannon Unplugged** right from the unboxing stage. In terms of quality, the biggest highlight is definitely the super massive Generator (which I'll discuss in more detail below). Accompanied by hex tiles, management boards that are both beautiful and thick and sturdy. The cards, in my personal opinion, are more than fine to play without sleeving, with a UX/UI design that's airy, compact, and very easy to read content and track important information. In terms of quantity, I was really surprised that the game has so many different scenarios, and each scenario brings a unique setup even though I haven't had the chance to experience them all yet. Plus, we have tons of Society cards to start the game in different directions, not to mention the variety from Law cards, Technology cards, and Citizen cards that are dealt randomly in each play. Oh, have I mentioned the hex map that I jokingly call the Crater of Frozen Death, which is also arranged completely randomly in each game? I'm quite confident in saying: each Frostpunk game is a completely different experience.

One thing that puzzled me a bit is that most of the comments I read say that the rulebook and setup of Frostpunk are a bit complicated. Hmm... or maybe because I've had experience with ""tough"" survival games like Robinson Crusoe or This War of Mine, so I found Frostpunk's rulebook to be very coherent. Okay, I do agree there are many small rules if you're just starting, but the presentation and editing are still very clear. Even the step-by-step setup guide is a big plus. By the third play, I had memorized the setup process, of course with the help of a few plano boxes for organizing components. If there's one downside, it's that the game takes up quite a bit of table space. I just wish the management boards were a bit more compact, a little smaller, then there'd really be nothing to complain about. Additionally, I also grabbed the Frostlander expansion, Resources expansion, and Miniature expansion. But if you ask me, I'd recommend just buying the Frostlander expansion. Personally, I quite like the basic meeples and resources that the game already has beautifully. The building miniatures are obviously very nice, nothing to complain about... they're just not essential for me personally.

**2. Gameplay is super smooth, offered many Strategies and Trade-offs**

What surprised me most about Frostpunk is its gameplay that's easy to start but ""headache-inducing"" to play really well. At first glance, there seem to be many phases: from handling Events at Morning, managing the Reactor, dealing with harsh weather, to how the people eat, drink, and rest... But in reality, most of those elements operate according to their own rules. The results (or consequences) ultimately depend on the decisions you make yourself.

If I had to describe Frostpunk's gameplay in one sentence, I'd say: this is a worker placement game tied to the law of Cause and Effect.

üü¢ Worker Placement ‚Äì Easy to Play, Many Choices

You are given a number of workers corresponding to the population based on the starting Society card. Workers can clear snow to expand the Crater and find resources, exploit resources, go to the Hunter's Hut to hunt for food... Some buildings require Engineers instead of regular workers. If you've built the Beacon, you can even send workers to explore outside the Crater, with rewards sometimes being a Steam Core to build a massive Automaton to assist in work. Even some Event cards sometimes require you to spend 1 worker to perform the specified action. It sounds simple with the motif: 1 worker = 1 action. But then you suddenly realize, every action in Frostpunk comes with its price, and in most situations, you're not ready to pay it.

üü¢ Law of Cause and Effect - The Price of Every Decision

You send workers to clear snow ‚Üí they get cold ‚Üí sick ‚Üí untreated ‚Üí exhausted ‚Üí die ‚Üí shortage of labor, people discontent, hope dwindles.

You enact the ""Child Labor"" law ‚Üí solve immediate manpower ‚Üí but in the future, risk of ""work accidents"" occurring.

A woman wants to use her Medical skills to heal people:

* You utilize her ‚Üí immediate efficiency, but risks come when patients haven't fully recovered.
* You assign a specialist to supervise ‚Üí costs manpower upfront, but in the future gains a skilled doctor.
* You ban her action altogether ‚Üí loses public support, increases Discontent, but avoids long-term risks.

Action - Result is almost a clear mechanism of the game, from Event cards reappearing in the future in the Dusk deck where you'll have to ""pay the price"" or ""receive the reward"" for current decisions, to unexpected knots in the Scenario where you'll have to play to lose, play to know, play to learn those knots and exploit them for the next play.

That's the vicious cycle of Cause ‚Äì Effect that you have to face throughout the game. Almost every decision, no matter how small, pulls along a chain of consequences that you must bear or accept to trade off. And perhaps, it's this that makes Frostpunk not just a survival game but also a true ""test of humanity"" experience.

**3. The Price of Survival**

Like every survival game, our goal here is to try to survive as long as possible with limited resources, but there are 6 conditions that will cause us to fail: too much Discontent, depleted Hope, Generator explosion, rampant Sickness, widespread Hunger, or Deaths enveloping everything. Instead of talking about how to win this game (well, something I'm not sure I'll achieve yet), I think we should walk through those 6 lose conditions together; I think this will be a more interesting approach.

üü¢ Hope and Discontent

In most situations, Hope is often seen as an abstract concept, an invisible emotion that drives people forward. In Frostpunk, Hope is a tangible resource, measurable and finite, just as crucial to the city's survival as coal, wood, or food. You don't just nurture Hope; you're managing it on the ""Hope & Discontent Board"". This Hope management mechanism inadvertently shifts your priorities. Most of us will always seek to gather as many resources as possible, build Gathering Posts, create Automatons to help with work... but once Hope is depleted, you'll still lose, and everything becomes meaningless. And when I say ""nurture Hope,"" you can literally use the Cookhouse to convert meals into Hope in the literal sense!

If talking about Hope can still be nurtured, Discontent is a more complex and painful story. It doesn't come from external enemies, but from the very decisions you as a leader are forced to make. In the role of a manager, you don't have the privilege of being ""merciful"" or ""altruistic."" The only thing before your eyes is efficiency. Because in Frostpunk's harsh cold, any emotional decision is enough to drag the entire city toward destruction. Imagine famine raging. You're forced to sign a law mixing sawdust into rations; it sounds cruel, but at least the people are full enough to hold on. However, that ""band-aid"" solution could seed discontent: some will accept fate, others will scream for proper food. But either way, no one can replace you in this leadership role. What's the lesson? Discontent can't be eradicated; you can only keep it at a ""just enough to live with"" level. And by the way, if you're stuck, try opening... a Fighting Arena for people to ""punch each other to relieve stress."" It both sweats to keep warm and cools down tension. After punching, back to mining coal, chopping wood. What could be better!

üü¢ Disease, Famine, and Death

This is the trio we can call the ""negative feedback loop."" This is also the game's biggest challenge, where small mistakes can lead to a chain collapse of the entire city. Everything usually starts from resource shortages: not enough coal to heat, not enough food to feed people will bring cold and hunger. And then things get worse link by link:

* Cold breeds disease => Not enough coal to keep Buildings and Shelters warm makes people prone to illness.
* Disease leads to death and reduced manpower => Sick people can't work (represented by Spent Citizen tokens). If not treated in time, they die, causing the city to lose precious labor for mining coal and gathering food.
* Hunger kills people => Lack of food leads straight to death. And as the population declines, the ability to cope worsens.
* Death erodes morale => Each death is not just a loss of manpower but also a morale penalty of lost Hope, increasing the burden of keeping the city willing to survive.

In the end, the trio of Disease ‚Äì Famine ‚Äì Death is like an inseparable domino chain. Mismanaging one link quickly pulls down the entire system.

üü¢ The Generator

In Frostpunk, The Generator is built to be the ""heart"" of every city, every settlement. It runs on coal, and the more coal you feed it, the more Heat it radiates to cover the buildings.

It sounds simple: the colder it gets, you just burn more coal, thereby maintaining heat for buildings with varying insulation levels, depending on their position in the Crater of Frozen Death. Basically, you can almost always decide exactly how much coal you want to put in. But then the price reveals itself: the more you burn, the higher the Generator's Stress. And like humans, a machine can ""stress""... and once overloaded, it explodes, wiping out the city and all your efforts. Trust me, such an explosion just leaves you staring blankly at the table, then quietly cleaning up to start a new game. What makes me both amused and annoyed is: The Generator doesn't actually react fully to the coal you put in! Really, you didn't misread. Basically, this Reactor works like a dice tower, and coal is the dice. You drop coal in, hear the clattering fall, then pull out the tray to see how many pieces ""take effect."" Sometimes you put in 5 pieces, but only 2 or 3 come out to increase stress.

Honestly, I'm not a fan of this design. I've never relied on luck to overcome adversity, and in Frostpunk, that's even harder to accept. You painstakingly calculate, weigh every decision to survive, but ultimately, the power of life and death lies in the hands of a mindless machine that just ""eats"" coal. Ironic to the point of absurdity, but it's also what makes Frostpunk so unforgiving. Basically, I choose to drop 5 coals and I manage on those 5 coals, no more, no less. If it is less than 5, I am not happy because coals are still there, we just can see that.

üü¢ Laws as Tools

During the game, I can enact laws to manage everything in the city. What hits me is one of two Laws: ""Child Labor"" or ""Provide Tents for Children."" You should remember that your tiny city is on the brink of collapse, and the reality is ""not enough people to do all the work."" The game offers a grim and practical solution by allowing you to sign a law permitting children to work in ""certain places."" This decision, like many others you'll have to choose throughout Frostpunk, doesn't just have a narrative or thematic price; it has a very clear mechanical price. You gain labor now at the cost of weakening the future workforce due to illness, forcing you to make a painful calculation, where the survival of this ""virtual"" community is weighed against the ""real"" humanity you might lose on the path to winning the game.

And in your first play, you'll think ""Ok! I'll choose to provide tents for children because the kids need safety,"" but trust me, by the second, third, fourth play... whether accidentally or intentionally, ""those kids"" become just numbers for you to calculate, weigh, measure to seize victory. A truly strange game...

**4. It's Really Tough, but I Hope You'll Give Frostpunk a Chance**¬†

After all, I realize Frostpunk is not just a survival board game, but also an experience ""hidden"" behind each card, each decision. This is a game easy to learn how to operate, but extremely hard to win. Yet it's that very ""difficulty"" that makes the experience worthwhile: it forces you to think, to deliberate every smallest choice from enacting Laws, discarding Citizen cards, upgrading Technology, to choosing between Hope and Discontent, Present and Future... and most importantly, it teaches you that to survive, reason must always be placed above emotion.¬†

In life, sometimes we're like playing a game of Frostpunk: facing shortages, pressure, discontent, and losses. And then, what's left is not just whether you ""win"" or not, but how you've faced adversity. That's when you learn to make cold but necessary decisions, when you know to sacrifice the small to preserve the big, and when you realize humanity truly shines when tested in darkness. Alongside the seemingly lengthy but actually quite clear and coherent rules, Frostpunk leaves me with a feeling that's both harsh and humane. It makes me sit for a long time after each game, not just to remember the choices made, but also to ask myself: ""If it were real life, would I dare choose like that?"" With all those experiences, I believe Frostpunk is a game that anyone who loves the survival genre should try.

Some small ""minuses"":

* Frostpunk shines when you play solo; I don't think co-op is too bad, it's just that we'll have more than... one dictator.
* The game is quite long; you should prepare mentally and have a clear table; if tired, go make a cup of coffee and come back.
* The random draw of 4 Technology cards sometimes leads me to get 4 cards... quite boring :(
* 4 reference sheets for a solo player like me are really... not very valuable.
* The Generator placed in the middle of the table? Who does that; trust me, you'll want to shove it aside.
* TAKES UP TOO MUCH TABLE SPACE.

My thanks to **Glass Cannon Unplugged** and **11 Bits Studio**. Now I have to turn on ""The City Must Survive"" soundtrack and start my fifth playthrough. Happy gaming!

Ive (29F) started 18:6 back in June of this year. My start weight was 147lbs, im down to 133lbs eating this way. Ive been plateaued for a month and a few days now and am quickly losing motivation to keep going. 

M-F I begin eating around noon or 1pm (one meal usually a salad with approx 280 calories, admittedly some days I will eat a steak bowl from Chipotle or a kids burger and fry instead of the salad) I will eat a handful of nuts around 3pm, I eat dinner at 5/6pm if I make it home from work on time. A lot of the time I do not. I even cut out black coffee thinking that could help speed it up. Dinner usually consists of a protein (beef or chicken) a starch (mashed potatoes or pasta salad) and a green vegetable.

Saturday is my cheat day, I eat 2 meals, 1 is around 11am and then the 2nd meal aound 6pm. I only drink water, even on my cheat day. 

Sunday is back to a similar schedule as M-F with a few more snacks during my eating window such as grapes almonds and cheese. Or hummus and pita thins. 

Ive also began a yoga program about 17 days ago hoping that would spur some weightloss, I also take daily vitamins and a ketomax supplement an hour before all meals. 

Nothing has caused the scale to budge. Its beginning to get harder to ward off cravings. Ive even sprinkled some 24 hour fasts in there (such as when i dont make it home in time for dinner) I have a very physically demanding job where im on my feet all day (healthcare). Ive cut out desserts/chocolate/candy from my deit except for 1 lindt lindor chocolate ball once a week.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve explored all of your contacts and there‚Äôs nothing.

You may be wondering the same thing that [AAA ninja member](https://honeysyed.com/aaa), Brandon, was‚Ä¶

Can I run ùê©ùêöùê¢ùêù ùêöùêùùê¨ ùê≠ùê® ùê†ùêûùê≠ ùêúùê®ùêüùêüùêûùêû ùêùùêöùê≠ùêûùê¨ with business owners for our ‚Äúoffer of the century‚Äù?

And if so, does it get results?

Paid ads absolutely work for this.

You see, whenever I want to get a lot of new clients quickly, I don't hammer the phones or send millions of emails through cold email automation software.

I run paid ads to a cold audience.

It's not because I think LinkedIn or cold email doesn't work.

They do! Especially, if you take a more personalised approach rather than a ‚Äúspray and pray‚Äù one.

It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôd much rather have folks who are already interested, ùê´ùêöùê¢ùê¨ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¢ùê´ ùê°ùêöùêßùêù, ùêöùêßùêù ùêúùê®ùê¶ùêû ùê≠ùê® ùê¶ùêû.

There are a couple of reasons for this.

For one, my time is worth more to me than a little ad money.

I'd rather give Zuck fifty bucks per day for a few weeks to put my message in front of the right people while I'm slurping my coffee‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶than spend two hours a day huntin' people down one by one.

Second, it's about positioning.

When a potential partner comes to you and they're the ones knockin' on your door...

The whole vibe of that initial interaction changes.

There's no ""Well, you bothered me, so now dance for your dinner"" snobbery from that potential partner.

The two of you are ùê¨ùê¢ùê≠ùê≠ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêöùê≠ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê¨ùêöùê¶ùêû ùê¨ùê¢ùêùùêû ùê®ùêü ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùê≠ùêöùêõùê•ùêû from the get-go.

Which sets the stage for an ongoing, mutually beneficial partnership.

To give Brandon some reassurance about getting started with paid ads‚Ä¶

I shared a screenshot of a post written by ROYA student, Teddy.

He didn‚Äôt have a warm network either.

Instead, Teddy followed our paid ads training, set himself a budget of $50 per day

Coming to my childhood, I was actually very playful and simple but one thought bothered me which was that I liked to wear girls clothes. I knew that it is not right to wear girls clothes for boys but I could not stop myself and I used to wear my elder sister's clothes, lipstick and try to do all this secretly. I did not tell anyone about this till I reached Kolkata in college where I found many different types of people and I came to know a new word ""gay"" and I was fearful with this new word because I hate such relationships. However, in my college I met a beautiful girl and fell in serious love, we used to hang out here and there like coffee shops park. Everything was going well and I was happy but I hid from everyone that whenever I thought of myself in girls' clothes I would feel intense excitement. I really loved her so I tried to avoid my thoughts but I couldn't feel intense excitement with her and it was very frustrating. I was nervous because I didn't want to lose her so I tried to forget those thoughts but I don't know why my mind would get anxious whenever I saw something like a crossdresser or transgender on the street or in the movies, then my mind would forget everything like hunger, thirst, even my lover and the whole mind would focus on only one thing that I want to look feminine. I was literally crying so she asked me what happened, I didn't want to tell her but she promised me that she wouldn't mind so I told her that I sometimes feel like a woman. At first she was shocked but she laughed. A few days after our classes in college she took me out of the crowd of people and put his hand in a bag and took out a pencil and lined my eyelids. Later I found out that it was kajal. She told me to listen to my feelings, after hearing this I got confidence and my girlfriend also helped me dress up as a girl, it was all very fun, she gave me a bracelet lipstick and some other things. My girlfriend gave me a new name which is Savana and said she wants to make me a sissy boyfriend, she taught me how to flirt with other boys. She used to ask me if I liked it when I saw a street boy. She would make me up every day and wear a saree and sometimes take me to the movies or sometimes to the park. One day she introduced me to another boy and asked me savana my girl do you like him. Ohh God that day I felt a little heart attack. After completing my degree we became distant from each other because we got admitted to different universities for higher studies and everyone also came to know about our breakup. I feel bad for all this but within a year I would do very good makeup and flirt with boys.

Over time I started crossdressing more and more and the feminine character was developing more and more intensely in me. But the problem is that I know that I want to look feminine but still there was a resistance in my mind. I wasted my energy and a lot of time trying to get to know myself and one day I met an online mistress, she helped me break that resistance and now I feel completely feminine excitement inside me and the only thing left is the final step of making the body feminine with estrogen pills.",0,1758678657.0,confessions,0,0.5,False

There is a wonderful hole-in-the-wall coffee shop just down the road from where I live, easily within walking and biking distance from my house. The place is the PERFECT blend of friendly customer service, a welcoming, non-judgemental atmosphere, and tasty drinks, with specials you couldn't get anywhere else. It was pretty much EVERYTHING you could possibly want out of a coffee shop in my opinion. That place was almost like therapy to me, and it helped me get through some of the hardest times of my life. I have many positive memories of taking bike rides there. 

However, I was heartbroken when I saw a post from their Facebook page announcing they are going to close their doors at the end of this month, and while going to the cafe makes me happy, it also makes me sad to go there knowing the place will not be around for much longer. It is like the same feeling you get when you see a dying, loved relative in the hospital knowing they do not have much time left. The closure of the cafe will be a major loss for me since it has made such a positive impact on my life (even though the place has only been around for two years, and I only started visiting it this year), and there are no other restaurants quite like it within walking or biking distance. At least there will still be a Dunkin' across from where I live, but it is not quite the same.

I was at Clink Fest in Chicago this past weekend (a 2-hour flight from home), and since I was traveling light, my ingredients were limited. I grabbed what I could locally: Squirt, 7UP, and Ginger Ale, and built mocktails around my mixers. To my surprise, they were delicious! Crimson Smoke was the runaway hit of the day!

Here‚Äôs what I served:

# üçä Caged Heat Paloma Twist

Cardamom ‚Ä¢ Tamarind ‚Ä¢ Ghost Pepper

* 1.5 oz Caged Heat mixer
* 2.5 oz Squirt (grapefruit soda)
* Lime wedge (optional)

üå∂Ô∏è Spicy, tangy, and refreshing ‚Äî like a Paloma with a kick.

* Lemon wedge (optional)

üç∑ Tart cranberry and smoky tea balanced with bright grapefruit. *The crowd favorite!*

* Lemon twist (optional)

üåø Herbal, sweet, and playful ‚Äî a bubbly twist on anise flavors.

Cherry ‚Ä¢ Coffee ‚Ä¢ Cacao (decaf)

* 1.5 oz Cherry Bomb mixer
* 2.5 oz Ginger Ale
* Maraschino cherry (if you‚Äôve got it)

üçí Cozy and balanced, with cherry + spice shining through.

‚öñÔ∏è **Ratio tip:** we started with 1 part mixer to 3 parts soda, but found we needed a little more of the mixers. 1.5:2.5 worked best for a 4 oz mocktail.

It was a good reminder that you don‚Äôt need fancy ingredients to make something special, that even a Family Dollar soda run can turn into a solid mocktail menu. If you‚Äôre curious to try them at home, all four mixers are available on Amazon (just search Absinthia).

**Saturday**

Scarr's -- I did L'Industrie last year; I can't imagine doing it again when it took 5 minutes to get a cheese slice here.

Fong On -- Husband and I split the #1, cold with almond syrup.  This was great, so many flavors and textures playing against the tofu.

Manhatta -- Interesting floral take on a Brooklyn, fine price of admission for the view.

Gramercy Tavern -- I love the room and I had a nice conversation with a stranger here in 2019, so I always come when I'm in town.  Tomato soup was okay, kale pasta was GREAT, meatball was good, sundae (grape and hazelnut) is the reason I come here.  I don't think I'd reserve a table in the tavern area again--in the past I've sat at the bar during an off hour.

**Sunday**

Anton's -- We were unexpectedly in the West Village at 2 PM, and this was the first thing we saw on a Reddit thread.  Wow, this was the meal of the trip for both of us.  Freezer martini with a twist, then split radicchio salad, eggplant dip, and angel hair with broth.  Pecan pie and drip coffee, perfect.

Cafe Luxembourg -- I know ""where to eat around Lincoln Center?"" is a perennial question; I was indecisive and husband booked this.  Honestly, this was a very serviceable post-opera meal.  Gazpacho, grilled cheese, french fries in the style of In 'n' Out, straightforward white burgundy, eavesdropping, etc.

**Monday**

Thai Diner -- I really liked my crispy rice pancake with eggs fried in the divots.  Husband seemed less excited by his tea eggs with roti.

Milano Market UES -- I was reading alone in the park and decided I really wanted a wrap, so I walked over.  Four out of five parties got chicken caesar wraps, so I guess we all saw the same Instagram reel or whatever.  It was pretty good, not something I'd need to get again.  Lots of lettuce, which is actually what I wanted in the moment.

Death and Co -- I hadn't written down the other cocktail places I wanted to try, and we realized we hadn't been in a couple years.  My cocktail had tequila, gin, tomato, and cantaloupe, as well as two or three other things, which somehow all worked together.

Yellow Rose -- We debated a bunch of places and then decided we just wanted Mexican (it's tough in Boston).  Bean and cheese tacos were not as good as I've had before, but guacamole and enchiladas tejanas were great.",3,1758677929.0,FoodNYC,0,0.8,False

1nozj8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentaldietmastery/comments/1nozj8i/identity_series_the_chaser_to_the_fulfilled/,Identity Series : The Chaser to....  The Fulfilled Partner with Day to day examples,"This identity assumes a state of separation from the Specific Person (SP), where the relationship is something to be ""won"" through external actions. Their awareness is fixated on the absence of the SP's reciprocation, creating a loop of desperation and effort. They embody ""I am the one who must chase and prove myself,"" which hardens into reality as ongoing rejection or unrequited interest. This stems from not fully assuming the end but instead reacting to the current 3D (physical) circumstances.

**How it shows up in day-to-day life:**

* **Morning routine:** They wake up checking their phone obsessively for messages from the SP, feeling anxious if there's nothing. They might start the day with affirmations like ""Why isn't SP texting me?"" or scripting sessions focused on ""getting"" the SP to respond, but it's done from a place of doubt, reinforcing the chase.
* **Social interactions:** At work or out with friends, they're distracted, constantly initiating contact (e.g., sending multiple texts like ""Hey, thinking of you‚Äîwant to hang out?""). If the SP replies minimally, they overanalyze it and plan the next move, like buying gifts or planning ""accidental"" run-ins.
* **Evening wind-down:** They spend time on manifestation techniques (e.g., visualizing the SP calling them) but with underlying frustration, journaling about ""what's wrong"" or why it's not working. This leads to emotional ups and downs‚Äîelation from a like on social media, followed by despair from silence‚Äîperpetuating a cycle where the SP remains distant, mirroring their inner assumption of unworthiness or neediness.
* **Overall vibe:** Life feels like a constant hustle; opportunities for other connections are ignored because awareness is tunnel-visioned on ""fixing"" this one. They might attract flaky interactions or people who pull away, as their energy broadcasts ""I'm not enough yet.""

In essence, their awareness is on the process of manifesting (effort, techniques, and current lack), not the end, so reality reflects more chasing and less fulfillment.

# Identity : The Fulfilled Partner (Awareness on the End State)

This identity assumes the wish fulfilled‚Äîthat the SP is already theirs, deeply in love and committed. Their awareness rests in ""I am loved, pursued, and prioritized by my SP,"" treating the relationship as a done deal. They live from the end, ignoring contrary evidence in the 3D world, which allows circumstances to shift naturally. This embodiment creates a magnetic pull, where the SP (and the world) conforms to their assumption without forced action.

**How it shows up in day-to-day life:**

* **Morning routine:** They wake up with a sense of contentment, perhaps smiling at a mental image of the SP planning their next date. No frantic phone checks‚Äîinstead, they go about their day assuming contact will come, maybe receiving a good morning text from the SP without prompting, as their inner state draws it in.
* **Social interactions:** They're relaxed and present; if the SP calls or suggests plans (e.g., ""I miss you‚Äîlet's grab dinner""), they respond warmly but not desperately. At a coffee shop or event, they might ""coincidentally"" run into the SP, who initiates affection, mirroring their assumed reality of being pursued.
* **Evening wind-down:** Time is spent in gratitude, perhaps lightly affirming ""My SP loves making time for me"" while engaging in hobbies or self-care, feeling secure. They don't ""do processes"" out of need but live as if the relationship is thriving‚Äîmaybe planning shared activities assuming the SP's enthusiasm. This leads to consistent, loving interactions, like surprise visits or deep conversations initiated by the SP.
* **Overall vibe:** Life flows effortlessly; they attract admiration from others but remain focused on their fulfilled state. Challenges, like a busy day, resolve with the SP stepping up (e.g., ""I'll handle dinner tonight""), as their energy broadcasts ""I am cherished and chosen.""

Here, awareness is firmly on the end result (fulfillment and reciprocity), so techniques aren't weapons but natural extensions of their being, leading to the SP actively pursuing and committing.

**Shifting from Identity 1 (The Chaser, awareness on lack and pursuit) to Identity 2 (The Fulfilled Partner, awareness on the end state)** using the law of assumption requires a deliberate pivot in your self-concept, inner dialogue, and daily habits. The goal is to embody the version of yourself who already has the relationship with the Specific Person (SP), living as if they are already pursuing and prioritizing you. This shift involves redirecting your awareness from effort and absence to fulfillment and ease, allowing the 3D reality to catch up. Below are practical day-to-day examples of how to make this transition, with actionable steps to integrate into your routine.

# Morning Routine: From Checking to Assuming

* **Identity 1 (Chaser):** You wake up, immediately grab your phone, and feel a pang of anxiety if there‚Äôs no message from the SP. Your thoughts spiral: ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt they texted? Did I do something wrong?‚Äù You might start affirmations or scripting out of desperation to ‚Äúmake‚Äù them reach out.
* **Shifting to Identity 2 (Fulfilled):** Start your day assuming the relationship is secure. Instead of checking your phone first thing, take a moment to feel gratitude as if the SP already texted or is planning to see you. For example:
   * **Practical Step:** Before getting out of bed, close your eyes for 1-2 minutes and imagine a loving text from the SP, like ‚ÄúGood morning, can‚Äôt wait to see you!‚Äù Feel the warmth and certainty of being wanted. Then, proceed with your morning (e.g., making coffee, stretching) as if this is your norm.
   * **Inner Dialogue Shift:** Replace ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt they texting?‚Äù with ‚ÄúMy SP loves starting my day with sweet messages.‚Äù If you catch yourself checking your phone compulsively, pause and affirm, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to chase; they come to me.‚Äù
* **Why It Works:** By assuming the SP is already engaged, you align your emotional state with fulfillment, reducing the urge to force contact and allowing natural interactions to unfold.

# Daily Interactions: From Initiating to Receiving

* **Identity 1 (Chaser):** You‚Äôre preoccupied with the SP during work or social events, drafting texts like ‚ÄúHey, you free this weekend?‚Äù or overanalyzing their last reply. You might plan ways to ‚Äúbump into‚Äù them or strategize how to spark their interest, feeling like you‚Äôre always one step behind.
* **Shifting to Identity 2 (Fulfilled):** Act as if the SP is already pursuing you, so you don‚Äôt need to force interactions. Focus on being present in your life, knowing they‚Äôll show up naturally.
   * **Practical Step:** If you feel the urge to text first, pause and redirect your energy. For example, at work, engage fully in a task or conversation, silently affirming, ‚ÄúMy SP is thinking of me and will reach out soon.‚Äù If you‚Äôre out, carry yourself with confidence, as if you‚Äôre already cherished‚Äîsmile, make eye contact with others, and let your vibe radiate security.
   * **Example Scenario:** Instead of texting the SP to plan a meetup, assume they‚Äôre eager to see you. Later, you might notice they call or suggest plans (e.g., ‚ÄúI was thinking we could grab dinner‚Äîyou in?‚Äù), reflecting your new assumption.
   * **Inner Dialogue Shift:** Swap ‚ÄúI need to make them like me‚Äù with ‚ÄúMy SP loves making plans with me.‚Äù If they don‚Äôt reach out yet, dismiss it as temporary and persist in the assumption they will.
* **Why It Works:** Living as if you‚Äôre pursued shifts your energy from neediness to magnetism, prompting the SP (or circumstances) to mirror your inner state with initiated contact or affection.

# Evening Wind-Down: From Techniques to Being

* **Identity 1 (Chaser):** You spend evenings doing endless manifestation techniques (e.g., visualizing, scripting, or affirmations) with an undercurrent of frustration, like ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this working?‚Äù You might journal about what‚Äôs missing or stalk the SP‚Äôs social media, feeling discouraged by their silence or vague posts.
* **Shifting to Identity 2 (Fulfilled):** Use evenings to reinforce the end state, not as a ‚Äúfix‚Äù but as a natural expression of your fulfilled self. Focus on living a life where the SP is already yours, with techniques as a joyful confirmation, not a necessity.
   * **Practical Step:** Instead of intense manifesting sessions, do a brief, relaxed visualization (5 minutes) where you feel the SP‚Äôs love‚Äîlike imagining them cuddling with you or planning a future together‚Äîthen let it go and enjoy your evening (e.g., reading, watching a show, or self-care). If you journal, write as if the relationship is thriving: ‚ÄúHad a great day; SP surprised me with a sweet call.‚Äù
   * **Example Scenario:** You might skip checking their social media and instead post something fun about your day, assuming they‚Äôre drawn to your energy. Later, you could receive a message like ‚ÄúSaw your post‚Äîyou look happy! Wanna hang out soon?‚Äù
   * **Inner Dialogue Shift:** Replace ‚ÄúI need to manifest harder‚Äù with ‚ÄúI am already loved and chosen by my SP.‚Äù If doubts creep in, gently redirect to a scene of them prioritizing you, like planning a date.
* **Why It Works:** By living in the end, you release the need to ‚Äúforce‚Äù the outcome, allowing techniques to feel natural and the SP to show up effortlessly, reflecting your assumption of being pursued.

# Handling Resistance or 3D Contradictions

* **Identity 1 (Chaser):** If the SP doesn‚Äôt respond or acts distant, you spiral into doubt, assuming rejection, and double down on techniques or chase harder, reinforcing lack.
* **Shifting to Identity 2 (Fulfilled):** When the 3D reality doesn‚Äôt yet align (e.g., SP is busy or silent), persist in the assumption anyway, treating it as a temporary mismatch.
   * **Practical Step:** If you feel ignored, pause and imagine a scene implying the SP is yours‚Äîlike them apologizing for being busy and planning a special evening. Then, act as if it‚Äôs resolved: go about your day with confidence, maybe treating yourself to something nice, embodying someone who‚Äôs secure in love.
   * **Example Affirmation:** ‚ÄúMy SP is just caught up; they always make time for me.‚Äù This keeps your awareness on the end state, not the current 3D.
* **Why It Works:** Persisting in the assumption despite contrary evidence rewires your subconscious to expect fulfillment, gradually shifting circumstances (e.g., the SP reaching out unexpectedly).

# Overall Lifestyle Shift: From Effort to Ease

* **Identity 1 (Chaser):** Your life revolves around the SP, with constant effort to ‚Äúget‚Äù them, leading to emotional rollercoasters and missed opportunities for joy elsewhere.
* **Shifting to Identity 2 (Fulfilled):** Embrace a life where the SP is one part of your happiness, not the source. Focus on self-love and fulfillment, assuming the relationship is already yours.
   * **Practical Step:** Invest in yourself daily‚Äîtry a new hobby, dress in a way that makes you feel confident, or spend time with friends, all while assuming ‚ÄúMy SP loves being part of my amazing life.‚Äù For example, go to a caf√© and savor your time there, imagining the SP is excited to join you next time.
   * **Example Outcome:** As you radiate ease, the SP might start mirroring this by initiating more (e.g., ‚ÄúI heard you went to that new place‚Äîlet‚Äôs go together next time!‚Äù), as your fulfilled energy draws them in.
* **Why It Works:** A fulfilled self-concept makes you magnetic, aligning circumstances (and the SP‚Äôs behavior) with your assumption of being chosen and loved.

# Key Tips for the Shift

1. **Catch and Redirect Thoughts:** When you notice Chaser thoughts (e.g., ‚ÄúI need to text them‚Äù), pause, breathe, and affirm the end state: ‚ÄúMy SP is always reaching out to me.‚Äù Practice this consistently to rewire your default mindset.
2. **Saturate Your Mind with the End:** Use light, playful techniques‚Äîlike a quick mental scene of the SP planning a date‚Äîthroughout the day to stay in the fulfilled state without obsession.
3. **Drop the Struggle:** If you feel desperate, take a break from manifesting and focus on self-care (e.g., a walk, a favorite hobby) to reset your energy to ease.
4. **Persist Through 3D Lag:** The physical world may take time to reflect your new assumption. If the SP hasn‚Äôt shifted yet, trust that your inner state is reshaping reality and keep living as the Fulfilled Partner.

By consistently redirecting your awareness to the end state‚Äîthrough small, practical shifts in thought, feeling, and action‚Äîyou‚Äôll move from chasing to being pursued, as the SP and reality conform to your new identity.",2,1758677751.0,mentaldietmastery,0,1.0,False
1nozj78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1nozj78/haagen_the_fighter/,Haagen the Fighter,"I don‚Äôt even know how to start. Like many others here, I am not one who usually posts on social media. This is actually my first time.

My dog Haagen, my soulmate, best friend and companion for 13 years, has passed. He fought for so long. He outlived worst-case predictions from vets more times than I can count, and we kept choosing to fight with him because he kept showing up with the same love and zest for life. I tried to prepare. I even pre-grieved for two-plus years. But nothing prepared me for the reality of him not being here.

It started in December 2022 when he was diagnosed with cancer in his anal gland. We removed the tumor, but later found that one of his lymph nodes had metastasized, and we removed that in a second surgery. We then started chemotherapy, but his white blood cell count dropped too low, so he could not get the full dosage. I remember feeling helpless, like he was not receiving what ‚Äúshould‚Äù help him even though we were doing everything we could.

Then he developed laryngeal paralysis and had to have a tie-back surgery, another major operation. Once again, he recovered and was still brave, strong and full of life. Later, a routine blood check showed sludge in his gallbladder and it had to be removed. That was the fourth surgery. At that point, my family and I questioned whether we were doing the right thing. We consulted vets, considered his quality of life, and decided to proceed. Watching all the scars on his body was devastating, but looking back I am glad we did it because he did have so much life after that procedure.

After that fourth surgery we had some of the best times together. My family moved to one of the most pet-friendly areas in Singapore and we brought him everywhere. We never left him alone: coffee shops, cafes, malls, even grocery runs at supermarkets. We planned our lives around him. We skipped nights out, came home early on weekdays, and spent holidays with him. Everything was centered on him, and we loved every minute.

Caretaking was hard. Preparing his meals, cleaning his eyes, ears and teeth, holding him as he peed or pooped because his arthritis worsened - I remember all of it. Every time we felt tired, we reminded ourselves we could not be tired. We were all he had, and there would come a day when we would miss doing these things. It was high maintenance, but we loved maintaining him, and now we miss it so much.

Eventually he could not poop by himself and we had to manually evacuate him every two days. It worked for two to three months, until he developed rectal prolapse and the manual evacuation became violent and painful for him. The last time we tried to help, he was extremely hot and restless. He panted and breathed fast through the night, tossing and turning every five to seven seconds, unable to sleep. He began hiding, walking to the kitchen alone, and rejecting food. That night we knew.

We consulted our vet and made the decision to call a house-call vet. We euthanised him at home the next day so he would not suffer any longer. I remember forcing myself not to think about it while making the arrangements. I kept telling myself to power through until it was done.

It has been seven days. I can function sometimes... I can talk, laugh, eat, work and go through the motions of life, but there is a constant, heavy ache beneath it all. Running along the parks where we used to go together is excruciating because every corner, path and park is a memory. The house and the whole estate where I live in are full of triggers. I thought nights would be the worst, but mornings are even harder when it all comes crashing down again.

I had been bracing for this for years, and still the loss is a blow I cannot handle. Nothing anyone says can fix it. I do my best to believe in the Rainbow Bridge / Heaven where he is running free. That tiny hope softens the pain just enough to keep me going. I tell myself he is not suffering anymore and that helps sometimes, but most of the time everything still feels so empty and meaningless that I do not know how to carry on.

Haagen was my everything. He fought harder than I knew possible and gave us 13 years of pure unconditional love and companionship that I will always be grateful for.",5,1758677748.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

I am not a people person by any stretch of the word, my whole life I have been referred to as extremely introverted.

My input was not required; it almost never was.¬†

After about an hour into my shift, I felt the coffee doing its work on my insides, so I headed for the bathroom. On the way I passed by a few of my other coworkers huddled together watching something on a phone and murmuring to each other. Before entering the bathroom, I had to step aside to avoid the big forklift my boss was using to unload materials from a semi-trailer. ¬†

As I sat on the porcelain throne, I pulled out my phone and began scrolling through Instagram reels. At first there was nothing out of the ordinary, prank videos, police body cam footage, funny cat videos and a few conspiracy¬†posts. But then I noticed something, a series of reels showing the concerned faces of people talking about the coming rapture. ¬†

‚ÄúThats weird.‚Äù I thought. That was the first I had heard of it and apparently it was supposed to happen today or tomorrow, at least according to some South African pastor. I shrugged and kept scrolling. There seemed to be a new doomsday prediction of some kind every year or so now. This one would be no different than the rest, lots of panic for nothing.¬†

After time thefting another five minutes or so, I decided it was time to get back to the grind. So, I finished up my paperwork and stood. But as I reached out and flushed the toilet with the toe of my boot there came an enormous trumpeting boom that echoed through the building. I flinched and slapped my hands to the sides of my head. The sound¬†was so loud that my noise cancelling earbuds began to pop and wine with distortion. I crumpled to the floor¬†under the immense weight of that sound and curled into a fetal ball. It probably only lasted ten seconds but it felt more like ten minutes. But then just as abruptly¬†as it started the sound was gone. ¬†

I climbed to my feet and listened through my ringing ears before I cautiously approached the door. Where I live and work is right in the middle of tornado alley. There had been nothing on the news about bad weather but still, my first thought was that a tornado had blown through and wiped out the shop. Only the sun was shining when I had gone to the bathroom. The weather can change pretty quick in around here,¬†but I hadn't been in there that long. ¬†

I gently pushed open the door and saw nothing out of place. At least not at first. The machines in the shop were still humming, the lights still on and outside the garage door the sun was still shining. So, what the hell was that sound? I opened my mouth to ask as much, which is when I noticed. There was no one in the shop. ¬†

I searched the different departments in the shop, I searched the breakroom, the office, the other bathrooms. But there was no one there.¬†

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù I called out to the empty shop. ‚ÄúThis isn't very funny!‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†I stepped outside to see all the vehicles still in the parking lot. That was weird but what really began to unnerve me was the forklift my boss had been driving. It was an older forklift and without riding the brake it would just keep driving forward. It had made its way across the parking lot, slowly pushing its way through the chain-link fence. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone and called my girlfriend, but she didn't pick up. I hurriedly made my way to my truck and started home, calling her over and over. ¬†

On the road I saw a few cars that looked like they had just aimlessly drifted off of the road. I considered stopping to see if anyone needed help but there seemed to be no one around them. Jen still wouldn't answer so I began calling my parents, then her parents, then friends. I called everyone in my contact list, and no one answered. ¬†

The streets of my small town were empty, apart from a few stalled cars and one small bicycle lying in the center of the road. I pulled into my driveway and ran inside the small house my girlfriend and I rented.¬†

‚ÄúJen! Jen! Where are you?‚Äù I shouted as I ran through the house searching every room for her. She wasn't there. ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù ¬†

In a panic I ran from house to house banging on doors, but no one answered. I could feel tears running down my face as I inevitably began kicking in the doors of my neighbor's houses, desperately searching for someone for anyone. I spent hours doing that. Hours breaking into houses and screaming, begging for someone to be there. I drove to my parents' house, to Jens parents, to my grandparents. They were all gone. Everyone.¬†

Eventually I wound up back at home. Sitting on my porch, I felt so lost, so alone and so very scared. What was happening?¬†I had a thought that maybe it was just my town. That maybe something had happened, a storm warning or a chemical spill or something like that. And they all needed to be evacuated. That had to be it. I jumped into my truck and drove dangerously fast to the next town over. Then to the next town, then the next. There was no one. No people. I saw dogs, cats, birds, cattle, hell I even saw a few deer. But no people.¬†

I don't know how long I drove, how long I searched, hours and hours. But I was completely and utterly alone. It happened, didn't it? The Rapture? I can't find any new social media posts, though the internet is still working, at least for now. I turned on the tv but there were no live channels. What happened? Was I missed? Was I forgotten? Or am I just not worthy? And what do I do now? I... I think I'm going to find a bottle of something really strong, and I'm going to drink it until I don't care anymore.   ¬†",1,1758677502.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

It probably only lasted ten seconds but it felt more like ten minutes. But then just as abruptly¬†as it started the sound was gone. ¬†

I climbed to my feet and listened through my ringing ears before I cautiously approached the door. Where I live and work is right in the middle of tornado alley. There had been nothing on the news about bad weather but still, my first thought was that a tornado had blown through and wiped out the shop. Only the sun was shining when I had gone to the bathroom. The weather can change pretty quick in around here,¬†but I hadn't been in there that long. ¬†

I gently pushed open the door and saw nothing out of place. At least not at first. The machines in the shop were still humming, the lights still on and outside the garage door the sun was still shining. So, what the hell was that sound? I opened my mouth to ask as much, which is when I noticed. There was no one in the shop. ¬†

I searched the different departments in the shop, I searched the breakroom, the office, the other bathrooms. But there was no one there.¬†

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù I called out to the empty shop. ‚ÄúThis isn't very funny!‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†I stepped outside to see all the vehicles still in the parking lot. That was weird but what really began to unnerve me was the forklift my boss had been driving. It was an older forklift and without riding the brake it would just keep driving forward. It had made its way across the parking lot, slowly pushing its way through the chain-link fence. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone and called my girlfriend, but she didn't pick up. I hurriedly made my way to my truck and started home, calling her over and over. ¬†

On the road I saw a few cars that looked like they had just aimlessly drifted off of the road. I considered stopping to see if anyone needed help but there seemed to be no one around them. Jen still wouldn't answer so I began calling my parents, then her parents, then friends. I called everyone in my contact list, and no one answered. ¬†

The streets of my small town were empty, apart from a few stalled cars and one small bicycle lying in the center of the road. I pulled into my driveway and ran inside the small house my girlfriend and I rented.¬†

‚ÄúJen! Jen! Where are you?‚Äù I shouted as I ran through the house searching every room for her. She wasn't there. ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù ¬†

In a panic I ran from house to house banging on doors, but no one answered. I could feel tears running down my face as I inevitably began kicking in the doors of my neighbor's houses, desperately searching for someone for anyone. I spent hours doing that. Hours breaking into houses and screaming, begging for someone to be there. I drove to my parents' house, to Jens parents, to my grandparents. They were all gone. Everyone.¬†

Eventually I wound up back at home. Sitting on my porch, I felt so lost, so alone and so very scared. What was happening?¬†I had a thought that maybe it was just my town. That maybe something had happened, a storm warning or a chemical spill or something like that. And they all needed to be evacuated. That had to be it. I jumped into my truck and drove dangerously fast to the next town over. Then to the next town, then the next. There was no one. No people. I saw dogs, cats, birds, cattle, hell I even saw a few deer. But no people.¬†

I don't know how long I drove, how long I searched, hours and hours. But I was completely and utterly alone. It happened, didn't it? The Rapture? I can't find any new social media posts, though the internet is still working, at least for now. I turned on the tv but there were no live channels. What happened? Was I missed? Was I forgotten? Or am I just not worthy? And what do I do now? I... I think I'm going to find a bottle of something really strong, and I'm going to drink it until I don't care anymore.   ¬†",1,1758677413.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I'd eat a sad desk salad while frantically researching whatever I needed to buy, comparing prices across 15 tabs, reading reviews, making pros and cons lists.

The breaking point: Spent my entire lunch hour researching a $23 phone case. Came back to afternoon meetings exhausted from decision fatigue instead of refreshed from a real break. I let the AI to handle the research automatically, now when I need something I just let yaw AI analyze it while I actually take a proper lunch break. For example, I needed new running shoes. Old me would have:

- Opened 20+ tabs of different models
- Read hundreds of reviews across multiple sites
- Made a comparison spreadsheet
- Agonized over the decision for days
- Still worried I picked wrong

Pulled up running shoes, let AI analyze options for 2 minutes while I made coffee. Found a highly-rated pair with great durability scores for $40 less than I expected to pay. Ordered them and went for an actual walk during lunch. Having real lunch breaks again improved my afternoon productivity significantly.

Time recovered weekly:

- 5 lunch breaks √ó 45 minutes = 3.75 hours
- Weekend research sessions eliminated = 4+ hours
- Total: 7+ hours of actual free time

What I do with recovered time:

- Real lunch breaks (walk, read, call friends)
- Weekend activities instead of product research
- Evening workout routine that actually sticks
- Side project that's generating income now

The AI isn't perfect tho, sometimes suggests products that don't match what I need but it's good enough to make decisions quickly and move on with life. Most purchases aren't worth optimizing to death, ""good enough"" chosen quickly beats ""perfect"" researched endlessly.

First interview ever wanted to fly me out for a second interview. Sizeable, reputable local company. Told me he had to get his bosses' permission and he'd get back to me. I followed up 3 days later, a week later, and a month later. No response.

The lone third interview I did was just a vibes check. Grab coffee and chat for two hours. When asked for feedback after the rejection, I was told ""it's always good to be enthusiastic"". I for one thought we were all having a good time.

Was given a verbal offer by a hiring manager after shadowing for two hours. He literally shook my hand and said ""Welcome to the team!"". Told me I could start in a few days. Offer rescinded next day.

Before leaving my previous position, I asked our hiring manager to review my resume. She made it pretty, added those key words AI filters look for, and generally cleaned it up. Prior to this, I had two interviews and about 150 apps.

Here's a list of all the cafes I've visited in the NoVA area, with food, drink, and study/workability ratings because, why not? These are also listed in no particular order of preference. 

Please feel free to comment your favorite cafes and/or cafes you suggest I visit next-- I know there are a ton in this area that I haven't checked out yet.

**---Fairfax**

1. Fairfax Coffee

* Coffee: 9/10; Good! Highly recommend their iced latte with blackberry syrup and light white mocha
* Food: 7/10; Good but very standard
* Work: 10/10; This is the place for study/work-- quiet, lots of chargers, big comfortable space

2. Foundation Coffee

* Coffee: 9.5/10; Beans are on the light side so more acidic, but that's my preference. My go to place for americanos
* Food: 6/10; More dessert based, the cakes I've had were slightly dry. They just introduced a breakfast menu that I haven't tried yet, though
* Work: 9/10; This is more of a study cafe already, so lots of seats and chargers. Docked a point off because it gets super busy and loud in the afternoon, so I recommend going early (this can be applicable to all of these places, honestly). But they're open until 9PM. 

3. Maman

* Coffee: 8/10; This place is new, so I've only gone once. Americano was fine, very standard
* Food: N/A
* Work: 0/10; Super busy, loud, small. More of a grab and go place

4. Bakery Museum and Co.

* Coffee: 7/10; It's fine- I'd say this place is more known for its ""flashier"" drinks (tiramisu latte was good)
* Food: 6/10; I've only had their pastries, not their sandwiches, but wasn't that impressed; kind of dry 
* Work: 3/10; I've attempted working here many times to no avail. Just loud, busy, and kind of cramped. LOUD music. More enjoyable to just meet a friend and hang out.

5. Simply Social

* Coffee: 9/10; Good and they give you a complimentary pizzelle cookie with your drink
* Food: N/A (pizzelle was good though)
* Work: 4/10; Pretty small and cramped

6. Compass Coffee

* Coffee: 7/10; It's fine? Their fall drinks are good, but americano is more on the bitter side 
* Food: 7/10; Again, fine-- very standard
* Work: 7/10; Nice amount of space, OK amount of outlets. Its a nice, well lit space with all the windows 

7. Gathering Grounds

* Coffee: 9/10 BEFORE NEW MANAGEMENT; 4/10 AFTER NEW MANAGEMENT; I have feelings about this cafe. It used to be my spot when I was an undergrad at GMU. Then, they got new management and all I can say is its just gone down hill from there. 
* Food: 8/10 (before); Have not tried food since management changed
* Work: 6/10 (after); Not as cozy, loud 

8. 29th Parallel Coffee

* Coffee: 10/10; Super high quality
* Food: N/A
* Work: 7/10; Small/limited space but pretty quiet

9. De Clieu

* Coffee: 1/10; I have feelings about this place too. Why is this place so hyped up? Every time I've gone- Disappointment. Americano was the worst one I've had  
* Food: 3/10; Had a pastry and waffle- too sweet, dry
* Work: 3/10; Gets super busy, closes early- imo its just an overstimulating, kind of messy place

10. Common Culture

* Coffee: 7/10; New place- I've only gone once, but coffee was decent
* Food: 5/10; Danish was overly sweet- pastries look pretty standard. I think they do sell lunch food though
* Work: 8/10; Nice big space, lots of seating

11. Peet's

* Coffee: 8/10; I know this is a big chain but I like it. Coffee is solid 
* Food: 8/10; My go to ham and cheese croissant- their muffins are kind of dry though
* Work: 7/10; Decent size, decent seating, loud music though so not great for virtual meetings

12. Senberry 

* Coffee: 9/10; Honorable mention because this is more of an acai place, but their coffee is good too!
* Food: 10/10; Best acai in nova!
* Work: 4/10; Loud, more of a hangout spot 

**---Centreville**

1. Cafein

* Coffee: 8/10; Solid coffee
* Food: 9/10; Their salmon lox bagel sandwich is fantastic 
* Work: 7/10; Decent size and seating, but loudish music and gets busy fast

**---Annandale**

1. Cafe V

* Coffee: 8/10; Good but I remember it being really expensive
* Food: N/A
* Work: 6/10; Decent space gets loud

**---Chantilly**

1. Chateau de Chantilly

* Coffee: 6/10; Its alright,
* Food: 6/10; All the pastries I've had here have been kind of dry
* Work: 4/10; This place gets busy and overstimulating. More of a hangout spot

2. Tous les Jours 

* Coffee: 8/10; Another big chain, but I feel like this location is particularly better than others 
* Food: 9/10; Pastries are solid
* Work: 7/10; Nice big space, lots of seating, but gets pretty busy

**---Falls Church**

1. Rare Bird 

* Coffee: 8/10; Solid coffee
* Food: 7.5/10; Tried the cardamom bun- It was decent
* Work: 2/10; Small, cramped, super long line to get in and just busy in general

2. Godfrey's 

* Coffee: 8/10; Decent
* Food: 9/10; Their meals are actually pretty good but EXPENSIVE! Same for the pastries
* Work: 5/10; More of a hangout space

**---Leesburg**

1. Goosecup

* Coffee: 8/10; decent but they need to get stronger plastic cups because I have fully cracked one and almost cracked another 
* Food: N/A
* Work: 6.5/10; Have only gone at busy times but nice space with decent seating and lighting. 

**---Vienna**

1. Frame

* Coffee: N/A because I havent actually had their coffee, but I highly recommend their strawberry matcha latte
* Food: N/A
* Work: 5/10; I feel like it would be hard to work here- its pretty small and cramped

2. Caffe Amouri

* Coffee: N/A because I've only tried their milk tea but I KNOW I need to try their coffee. 
* Food: N/A
* Work: 7/10; Seems like it'd be nice at an early time- lots of seating 
* Sorry this review isn't that good but I felt like I needed to include it

It's gonna be long because I suck at explaining, sorry!

We all know the deal with big sales, the whole ""customers just coming in for (ex. the $5.95 single wick exclusive today) isn't going to meet our sales expectations"", that it's all about uncovering, so on & so forth. Today a semi-regular comes in who we haven't seen in a while, dude LOVES Hot Cocoa & Cream, and usually will buy it in bulk whenever we do have it & it's on a good sale. He & I are chatting it up, just standard customer uncovering stuff, at first I don't quite realize it's him, because of how long it's been since his last visit, til he asks about chocolate. ""Do you have anything that's like, chocolatey?"" And IMMEDIATELY I know what I'm pitching. We're mainly gabbing about room sprays, by the display, so I pitch him Campfire Donut. He's interested, and I pass on that the $3.50 deal is going on right now: hook inserted. He brings up his lil anecdote on how he got hooked on Hot Cocoa & Cream to begin with, and I remember we had a candle (Campfire Cocoa) that when we got it in, I'd immediately went ""Aw, that guy'd LOVE this one!"" (of course, we no longer have it). I tell him, and he goes ""Wow, I'm surprised you'd remember me, or remember that!"". As I'm telling him about Campfire Cocoa, I remember! We've got Hot Cocoa & Cream! In a single wick! Which are on a member exclusive sale today! I pull that for him, and of course he's sold. 

While we're chatting more, he's telling me how a lady at a different location had told him how Pink Lavender & Espresso is great for covering unpleasant smells, but that he likes espresso/coffee smells in general, and was hoping to try it. I tell him it's only in the fancy (expensive) ceramic single wicks at the moment, and that's usually a Spring fragrance, he rhetorically asks why the company hasn't made more ""basic"" one or two-note fragrances yet. I tell him about Cocoa Shea & Rich Espresso from the Wellness collection, which is more single-note based, and he's sold on the fragrance mist. He explores that collection a little more while I check on the other customers in Room 1, and must've been content with what I'd shown him, because the next time I see him he's in the checkout line. He makes his purchase, and on the way out thanks me for my help, and that he really appreciated how I'd remembered him & what he liked or typically comes in for.

Long story short, that little extra step of acknowledging the customer's preferences & having good product knowledge, got me to take what would've been a maybe $4 or $7 conversion, and turn it into at least a roughly $36 one! Also got the ever-so-nice tip of being told that I have a bright personality for retail (""I'm a bright candle that others light off of"" we both thought that'd make a good Hallmark cardüòÇ) and that it's refreshing to be around people like that in the industry‚ò∫Ô∏è Especially with it technically being the start of holiday season (cranky customer central) and being my first days as a seasonal keyholder, that really meant a lot!

[Australia],"I \[M, 20s, Australia\] will be staying in an airbnb in a beach/coastal area next month in Australia. It's my first time renting an airbnb where the host is staying on-site - it's a 1 bedroom apartment, where I'll get the bedroom and he'll be sleeping in the living room. Apparently the living room has a screen that he pulls shut to sleep, for some privacy. He's got a bunch of good reviews so it all seems legit.

Anyway - first time as an airbnb guest where the host will be staying on site. I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

Specifically wondering:

* I wake up pretty early - if I'm up before my host is awake (while his living room screen is closed), should I be tiptoeing around if I need to use the kitchen/bathroom?
* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal. 
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room? Given it's a beach location, do I need to e.g. put on a shirt if I'm just chilling at home / if I just walk to the kitchen for a coffee, if it's hot or if I've just returned from the beach?",1,1758676126.0,AirBnB,2,1.0,False

I got a lot of direct, fair, honest feedback.  I'm working to make the site better.  I've made myself a list of things to do.

I'm writing the story, about us, the mission, etc.  I'm working on this stuff and keeping it offline for the moment.

However, I'm kinda stuck on one thing.  The banner image for the site.  It's pretty bad.  It was AI generated and doesn't speak aviation in any way.  I've tried making my own from pictures that I have, pictures that I've taken, I've tried using AI to generate the photo, I've tried using AI to enhance photos adding aviation themed things (aircraft, aviation memorabilia, etc) and nothing I do comes out quite right.  Maybe I'm not using the right AI tool? I used ChatGPT 5, which is pretty bad at generating photos btw, or maybe I'm just really bad at using ChatGPT, don't know.

My question is how to do I go about finding the right resource?  Am I looking for a photographer, a graphic artist, an actual web designer?  Should I try a different theme? I'm not sure.  Any advice is appreciated.",1,1758675775.0,reviewmyshopify,5,0.67,False
1noytuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdifficile/comments/1noytuw/what_cause_cdiff_info/,What cause C.diff (info),"1. Eating Habits That Disrupt Gut Microbiome Balance
C. diff overgrows when normal beneficial gut bacteria are suppressed. Therefore, dietary habits that weaken good bacteria are the biggest contributors.


Processed Food-Based Diet
Instant foods, snacks, ramen, and processed meats (ham, sausages) lack dietary fiber and contain many preservatives and additives. These reduce the fiber that feeds beneficial bacteria, lowering microbial diversity.


High-Fat, Low-Fiber Diet
Fast food, fried foods, and excessive meat intake alter bile acid metabolism, creating an environment favorable for C. diff growth. Conversely, low intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains reduces beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria.


Excess Simple Sugars
Sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, snacks, and sodas ferment in the gut, rapidly increasing harmful bacteria and causing pH imbalance, which promotes C. diff growth.



2. Poor Diet After Antibiotic Use
The most common trigger for C. diff infection is antibiotic use. Antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria, and recovery speed depends on diet.


Lack of Probiotic Replenishment After Antibiotics
If you avoid fermented foods (yogurt, kimchi, miso) or probiotics and stick to refined foods, gut microbes fail to recover, making you vulnerable to C. diff.


Excess Dairy Intake
Right after antibiotics, lactose intolerance can develop due to reduced lactase activity. Overconsumption of milk and cheese can worsen diarrhea and gut acidity, aggravating C. diff infection.


Alcohol and Caffeine Intake
Heavy alcohol or caffeine consumption after antibiotics delays gut lining recovery, accelerates dehydration, and worsens diarrhea, creating a favorable environment for C. diff.



3. Eating Habits That Weaken Immunity
C. diff easily infects when immunity is low, and diet strongly influences immune function.


Unbalanced Diet
Insufficient protein, vitamins, and minerals reduce immune cell production, weakening bacterial defense.


Late-Night Eating, Binge Eating, Frequent Dining Out
Overeating and irregular meals weaken gut lining defenses. High-calorie late-night meals can trigger gut inflammation.


Insufficient Hydration
Constipation prolongs toxin retention in the gut, and dehydration during diarrhea destabilizes gut conditions.



4. Risk from Specific Food Groups
Certain foods can directly trigger or worsen C. diff infection:


High-Fat Dairy
Ice cream, cheese, and cream sauces increase bile acids, favoring C. diff growth.


Excess Red Meat
Beef and pork produce amines and sulfur compounds during protein fermentation, creating a toxic gut environment.


Refined Grains
Eating only white rice, white bread, and noodles reduces fiber, lowering beneficial bacteria and allowing toxin-producing bacteria to dominate.


Alcohol
Disrupts stomach acid secretion and gut microbiome balance. Frequent drinking (e.g., soju, beer) makes C. diff infection easier.


Artificial Sweeteners
Aspartame and sucralose disrupt gut bacterial composition and increase gut permeability, worsening inflammation.



5. Poor Diet in High-Risk Groups
Elderly individuals, hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, and those on immunosuppressants need extra caution.

Dietary Imbalance from Bed Rest: Hospital meals often lack fiber and consist of soft foods, reducing beneficial bacteria.
Frequent Protein Drink Intake: Elderly patients often receive protein supplements, but without fiber, C. diff risk rises.
Habitual Fasting: After gastroenteritis, prolonged fasting weakens gut recovery and worsens microbial imbalance.


6. Interaction Between Diet and C. diff Toxins
C. diff produces toxins A and B, which damage the gut lining and cause diarrhea. Diet can amplify these effects:

Fatty foods ‚Üí Increased bile acids ‚Üí Enhanced toxin activity
Low-fiber diet ‚Üí Reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) ‚Üí Weakened gut defense
Excess simple sugars ‚Üí Increased toxin gene expression


7. Habits to Avoid for Prevention

Reduce processed foods, high-fat meals, and simple sugars after antibiotics
Avoid excessive processed snacks during hospitalization
After gastroenteritis, don‚Äôt prolong fasting‚Äîgradually reintroduce fiber and fermented foods
Limit alcohol and coffee during recovery


8. Conclusion
C. diff is not just a ‚Äúbacterial infection‚Äù issue; its risk depends greatly on how our diet maintains gut microbiome balance.
Especially:

Processed food-heavy diets
Low-fiber, high-fat meals
Excess simple sugars
Lack of probiotic foods after antibiotics
Heavy alcohol and caffeine
Irregular eating habits

All of these can trigger or worsen C. diff infection.
Bottom line: Do the opposite‚Äîcut out processed foods and maintain a high-fiber, balanced diet. During early recovery, progress slowly; introducing too much fiber too soon can stress an unhealed gut.",1,1758675705.0,cdifficile,4,0.67,False
1noytp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1noytp5/the_living_room_takeover_and_the_movie_night_that/,The Living Room Takeover (and the Movie Night That Saved Us),"I swear, our living room was slowly transforming into a Pinterest board gone rogue, if that Pinterest board was for ""Hoarding Chic."" Every time I walked through, I felt a lowkey wave of anxiety. Liam, bless his tech-nerd heart, had his VR headset and controllers perpetually sprawled across the coffee table, next to a mountain of charging cables. Chloe, our aspiring fashion designer, used the armchair as a launchpad for her latest fabric samples and half-finished sketches. And Maya, our plant-mom extraordinaire, had propagated so many succulents that the window ledges were basically a mini-jungle, with a few stray pots inevitably ending up on the floor. I was no angel either, my stack of forgotten books and a perpetually shedding blanket adding to the chaos. It was giving ""abandoned storage unit"" more than ""cozy shared space.""

Tbh, I used to love chilling in the living room after a long day, but lately, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like an obstacle course. I'd nudge Liam's headset aside with my foot, try to find a clear spot on the couch, and just sigh. We'd planned a house movie night for weeks, a throwback to the days when we first moved into this urban apartment and the space was actually *usable*. But as Friday night approached, I looked around and realized there was literally nowhere to sit, let alone set up the projector. I was ready to declare a full-blown living room intervention.

That evening, I gathered everyone. ""Okay, so, movie night is tonight, right?"" I started, trying to sound calm, but my internal voice was screaming. ""But where are we even gonna *sit*? This room is kinda‚Ä¶ taken over."" Liam looked up from his phone, seeing the mess with fresh eyes, ""Oh, wow. Yeah, it's a bit much, ngl."" Chloe, usually so focused on her designs, looked genuinely embarrassed. ""You're right. My bad, guys. I just keep meaning to clear my stuff."" Maya, ever the optimist, chirped, ""We can totally do it! We just need a plan!"" That's so valid, I thought.

So we made one. We set a 30-minute timer. Liam gathered all his tech into a designated charging station in his room. Chloe took her fabric samples and sketches back to her desk, agreeing to keep the common areas clear. Maya, after some gentle coaxing, consolidated her plants onto a single, large shelf we found in the hallway. I even tackled my own book mountain. It was no angel either, my stack of forgotten books and a perpetually shedding blanket adding to the chaos. I was ready to declare a full-blown living room intervention. It was giving ""abandoned storage unit"" more than ""cozy shared space."" We vacuumed, threw the blankets in the wash, and transformed the chaotic dumping ground into a proper, cozy movie zone. We even pooled some cash for a giant pizza order and a ridiculously large bag of popcorn. Sitting there, laughing through a cheesy action movie, surrounded by my amazing, slightly messy housemates, I realized how much better it felt to just talk it out and work together. The room was clean, the vibes were immaculate, and honestly? We love to see it.

It‚Äôs only day 1 of my first time so some of this is going to be funny to some of you ‚Ä¶ but I learned some things fast right out of the gate like which one was right and left and how to put the tips on ‚Ä¶ then how to wear them. Ok so I tried them on my SE300 with the 3.5mm connection and I was pretty impressed with them ‚Ä¶ warm, laid back and nothing whatsoever to offend. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs due to my age or equipment failure but my Focals (Radiance, OG Clear) have just started to really sound metallic to me. I don‚Äôt remember it always being that way but recently let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve enjoyed them less which honestly is part of the reason I wanted to try an IEM. The Daybreaks do not have that metallic sound problem which is already a good thing. Then I decided to swap out the 3.5mm with the included 4.4mm and use it in the balanced port ‚Ä¶ and I learned something really important - how you put that thing on matters. You can‚Äôt just attach those 4 pins any old way ‚Ä¶ I put it on the same way I removed the old one and it sounded horrible, in fact it could barely be heard. I rotated it 90 degrees and lost the right side. Rotated again and it worked again - I was relieved because I thought I‚Äôd broken ‚Äòem. And although I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to ‚Ä¶ they did sound different on the 4.4 connection. The bass was thicker ‚Ä¶ everything was thicker - at least on the SE300. But ‚Ä¶ I liked it. It was rich and creamy and it worked for me. I did use the small size of the separate tips I snagged and didn‚Äôt even try the ones that came with it yet. They‚Äôre the 4540s and I was glad they actually seemed to fit the nozzles. I‚Äôm no audiophile and graphs just kind of make me tired but these sound good - just plain good.

**Here's where I need your help though** \- what would actually make you try yet another social app? What features would be genuinely useful vs just nice-to-have?

Some things I'm considering:

* Filtering by area (because nobody wants to trek from Clapham to Camden on a Tuesday night)
* Skill levels clearly marked (tired of being the only beginner)
* Group size limits so it doesn't become overwhelming
* Maybe some way to connect with people beforehand so it's less awkward?

Currently i have a map of activies all over london and also when you match you can chat with the whole group and also do a group call to meet everyone before hand, thier is also a tinder style match for groups and other people so two people can go on a activity together or start thier own group to recruit others.

But honestly, what would you actually find useful? What's missing from everything else you've tried? And am I completely off the mark thinking this is even needed?",2,1758675386.0,LondonLadies,0,0.75,False
