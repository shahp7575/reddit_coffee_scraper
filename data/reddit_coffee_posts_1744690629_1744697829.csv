1jzktxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jzktxf/weird_symptoms_going_on_for_2_weeks/,Weird symptoms going on for 2 weeks,"Hello all! I am a 26 y/o female. I have been having some scary symptoms going on since April 2nd. A weird sensation at the base of my throat, what feeels like heart palpitations/ fluttering, and when I breathe in/out it feels like my breath is cut short. I have actually thought I was actively dying a handful of times since this has started. Now I have been to urgent care when this first started, and then the emergency room THREE times this week. I’m hopingggg somebody can give me some answers, as I’m getting super frustrated that none of the doctors has been able to figure anything out. I’m going to throw some random details that I think mayyy be contributing but I’m not sure. 

April 1st: Had a pretty crazy but good day at first, but my mom kept asking me to deflate some NASTY/ mildew covered floaties that were never deflated last year.. meaning they have been inflated sitting in our shed with some nasty mildew all over them. I brought them into the house to use the pump to drain all of the air out. I definitely noticed a strong, gross smell, but ignored it and kept deflating them so I wouldn’t be bothered about them later. Later that night, I then realized my 4 year old daughter had cellulitis on her foot and had to rush her to the hospital in the middle of the night. They gave her antibiotics and said to watch her for the next 24 hours but they assumed she would be okay. Later that night, I was on my period, bad/ different type of cramping/ abdominal spasms started on lower right side and has been there almost every day since. 

April 2nd: Woke up feeling much more calm knowing my baby girl was okay. My father brought Popeyes home, I woke up and had eaten quite a bit of it to be honest. Everything was fine, I went downstairs, sat on the couch, and was talking to my daughter when all of the sudden, I got the HARDEST (heart?) palpitation. It was straight pounding for about 4-5 pounds and it felt like it was right up against my chest. It definitely freaked me out at first, but then it felt fine so I let it go and forgot about it. Then, later that night, I started getting a CONSTANT weird fluttering in my throat/ chest. Not really painful at first, but very noticeable fluttering and breath kind of being cut short. It scared me so bad I went to urgent care first thing to next morning. I thought I was having some sort of heart failure. Heart rate/ blood pressure was fine, so of course I was sent home. 

Now, this morning woke up with HORRIBLE chest pain on the right side of chest. I was already at ER last night over palpitations, so I did NOT want to go back over this, but I decided it was probably a smarter idea to go than not to. I have gone to ER 3 times this week, I have had blood tests, urine tests, lung x-rays, EKG’s, abdominal CT scan (that I had to stop in the middle of because I was getting a STRONG palpitation/ pulsing feeling on the right side of my neck) but they still got enough to look at. Everything seems to be coming back just fine besides my white blood cell count being high, neutrophils high, lymphocytes low, globulin high, and A/G ratio low. I have googled this and it keeps saying stuff about some sort of inflammation/ maybe infection in my body. I was sick with some weird viral infection a month before any of this, even woke up with bell’s palsy from this previous viral infection, but I don’t think this has anything to do with my symptoms now. I do have a primary appointment later today and a cardiologist appointment on the 17th. 

Now I’m wondering, could this be some sort of weird respiratory/ heart reaction to the mildewy floaties? Or some sort of spasms in my throat? Something they could be missing in my throat/ heart? A pinched vagus nerve? It’s driving me CRAZY, I feel like I’m never going to get better. I’m scared to even drink coffee because I’m scared if it does happen to be my heart that I will end up having a heart attack. PLEASE somebody, what could this be? They certainly feel more like palpitations but I’m not sure if I’m mistaking them for something else/ doctors maybe missing something they aren’t testing me for? I can hardly even explain how weird this sensation is but I’ve never been so frustrated in my life. I feel like crazy nonstop every day because I feel guilty as hell being scared to get up and run around with my daughter. I need some sort of answers, PLEASE. ",1,1744697777.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1jzkszb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jzkszb/i_cant_stand_my_own_company/,I Cant Stand My Own Company,"People always say you need to learn to enjoy being alone with yourself—to be your own best friend and whatnot. I’ve always adhered to this, and being alone in my solitude was never a problem, that is, until I saw myself.

It started out in a way that made it hard for anyone to notice what was going on. I would check my closet for a change of clothes before going out and notice that there seemed to be fewer clothes than usual, not a large amount or anything outrageous, but two or three shirts would be gone that I swear I had just put there the last time I did the laundry. I would simply shrug this off, thinking I must've misplaced them somewhere along the way to hanging them up, though no matter how hard I looked, they were nowhere to be seen. I’ve even somehow misplaced my favorite out of the bunch. 

Then there were the drinks. When I wake up, I always make sure to feed the caffeine addiction as soon as possible, practically still being asleep when I make my coffee. I would always sip from my mug for a bit, then set it down to start looking at my groggy self and messy black hair in the mirror before getting my outfit ready for the day. Of course, I would always return to finish the mug I left on the counter, though I would hate to waste something I brought. This time, the mug felt much lighter than it should have. Strange I thought, bummed out thinking I had more left in the mug, it was practically empty. I should have had half left, damn near even more. Though these thoughts wouldn't stay for too long, and the entire thing got shrugged off entirely, I must have just misjudged how much I had in my sleep-induced stupor. What I couldn't keep shrugging off, however, was what started happening next. 
I was hanging out with Leo, one of my better friends, when I mentioned going to the nearby Burger King to grab something to eat.  

""Can’t we at least go somewhere else this time?"" Leo replied. 

""What...?"" Leo and I hadn’t gone out to eat in at least a month. 

""We literally just went there like three days ago. We could at least do Taco Bell or something."" 

""Sure, man. Whatever you say,"" I told him. I liked Taco Bell more, and it's not like I would be the one driving us. But I had no clue what the hell he was talking about 3 days ago. I was in my apartment the whole day. Honestly, I was just thinking it was his weed brain acting up again, and he was just confusing me with another friend.  

A few days later, still unable to find my shirt, I noticed that there was a large cut going down my left forearm, thin and surface level like a cat scratch. Honestly, this wasn't much of anything to note. It’s easy to ding yourself on something jagged when you live in the apartment that I do. I went back to digging for the damn shirt, even moving my whole mattress to look under it when I got a text. It was my boss from the paint shop where I worked. It wasn't a place I loved all too much, but it was close to me, and the pay was enough to get by. Mostly, I clocked in, avoided crowds (yes, crowds—paint selling is chaos), did the bare minimum, and clocked out. ‘James (Boss)’ glowed on my screen, that red (1) like a warning. Great. Time to job hunt. Though opening it, to my surprise—it was positive? 

*“Hey, Alan, it was a great meeting. I want you to know you've been given the position. Your work has been very much noticed.”* I looked up from my phone in bewilderment but quickly went back to text  

*“What meeting?”*

*“Yeah, right! A guy like you probably had a few, anyway, congrats. I am still blown away at how you were keeping track of this quarter's sales; even I don't take the time to do that.”*

If I could do an ounce of math—with all due respect, I probably wouldn’t be working at a stupid ass paint shop just to get by. There was no meeting I attended; all I had been doing was looking for the same god. damn. shirt. 
In my state of panic and confusion, I was wildly pacing until I reached the kitchen. Neatly folded on my counter, it sat with a note right next to it. “Hey Alan, thanks for letting me borrow it! Maybe it was even the reason we—or, well, I was able to land the promotion. I think it's my new favorite shirt.” -Allen

It was three days after the note and shirt appeared, I couldn't be surer, since there was exactly two sleepless nights I had following it, and now I was on my third.  I’ve tried to sleep, but the knowledge of there being something out there like me—a better me, made it impossible. Listen, science is my damn rock. I've always thought that. Shit like this isn’t out there. But it's all that my brain could say to make sense of it all. 

Then came the noise. My forever drooped eyelids seized completely open as my head shot around my room looking for the source. I would have almost assumed it was just the pounding of my heart if it didn’t happen again. From the living room came a muffled sound I couldn’t place, almost like something dragging. I had to get closer; I just needed to prove that there was just something wrong with me—that I was simply making this all up. I Stagger my way into the entrance of the living room until I became paralyzed. They say the choices are fight or flight, but my legs chose to keep me right where I was planted. What stood before me… was me—but something nothing like me at the same time. My face was discolored, looking ashen with the structure of it grossly exaggerated, the nose too long and bent. My eyes looked sunken and dried resembling a pair of white raisins more than anything from the human anatomy. The jaw was far past unhinged and went all the way down to the things center. Its limbs were too long for its own frame; its knees were buckling in on themselves, looking as if the leg bones were internally twisted. Hanging low to the ground were both of its hands; fingers seemingly mashed onto them jutting out in various directions with long curled nails on the end of them. In my horror all I could do was take in what I was seeing, that was until my strained eyes were forced to blink. In an instant it was gone from my sight and just as quickly the curse on my legs were lifted. I was able to finally choose flight. I thanked every piece of my soul for leaving my keys in my bedroom as I went out my bedside window towards my car. I knew I had to get far away from where I lived —where it lived.

I wish I was crazy. I wish I could just return to my mediocre position at the paint shop where I could just do some mediocre work and get my mediocre paycheck. It's been around a year since I first saw him; after leaving I stayed at a couple of motels, i've distancing myself as I thought of what to do. Im in a city a few states away now instead of a town, I knew I needed to be around more people, I couldn’t be alone anymore—my old life exists still in that town, just without *me* in it. I was scared of what would happen there with people who knew me but yet nothing has happened to them, they just don’t know that’s not me. It seems it's only me that can see what that thing really looks like. I still get pay from the shop, it’s seem’s to have even become the stores manager since the time I’ve been gone. I still get messages from Leo, and it includes full blown conversations, but I can’t see anything I say to him, it’s almost like he’s just talking to a wall; he seems to enjoy me more.

I stay I’n public as much as I possibly can. Sitting on my laptop in cafes or eateries in the day and going to clubs when it gets darker. Sleep has taken a large toll on me. I stay up for long periods until I can’t take it then ill sleep on a park bench during the day in busier hours. I swear I see it sometimes. Glancing up to a mirror after washing my hands Ill see its cocked neck looking at me. The paranoia and sleeplessness come together like that sometimes. I don’t know how much longer a person is supposed to live like this, I’m always looking over my shoulder, scanning crowds, and staying in the light.

 I have no one to tell this to, with my general unease at everything and the absolute insanity behind this story I would be either mocked or institutionalized effective immediately. But I needed this out there somewhere so I’m posting this on social media because I need help.


 I just went to this café for the first time; they asked if I wanted my usual.

1jzksh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1jzksh6/customers/,Customers,"Okay, I work at a restaurant/bar in a city in Australia and divide between open and close shifts as a full time employee

Rude customers come with the job. Its fine. But at this point I have worked 5 days (Wed - Fri and Mon/Tuesday) and have had nothing but rude people constantly all 5 days. I can deal with the occasional a**hole. But 5 shifts in a row!!! I am losing it

From ignoring my staff and I when we try and greet them and then getting mad when they weren't served instantly, to taking a seat on their own without waiting for one of the waitresses/waiter in the middle of rushes, moving tables without permission (this one dude has done this all 5 day) and sitting at a table for 4 when there are multiple tables of 2 and there only being two of them (same dude moving the tables), demanding we close the door because it's ""too cold"" and being frustrated although majority of customers like the cool breeze and the staff perfer to not sweat their asses off. To standing at a till without anyone there and seeing I am serving a line of people on the other one and being actually, for some reason, astonished that no one has served them yet and is hesitate and confused when I ask them to join the line, to trying to order the breakfast menu at 7pm when it also says on said menu - ""7am - 11am"" and asking ""Can't you just do this for me"" and Walking into the cafe part of the restaurant, looking around clueless before staring into my soul and with a demanding attitude saying ""So you guys sell coffee or what?"" Like no, this coffee machine is for show

Thats not even all.
Its so bothersome and frustrating how stupid and rude people are. Like I understand my job is to ""serve"" you, but why be so rude? I also understand that you may never been here before, but instead of walking up all like ""So, you got food or what?"" You could say ""Hey, I am new around here, what do you guys serve?"" 

And the lack of common sense is astonishing. How do many people miss context clues. One side of the coffee station says ""Takeaway here"", has a register there, my coworker is actually actively serving someone at said register, while you are telling me, the person frothing milk, what your coffee order is. I don't care. If you walk a few meters to the side, my coworker will care and take your order. How is that not obvious to some?

Like there is no way this is how these people act when visiting friends and family is it? Like imagine someone showing up to your house and moving your chairs, or demanding food or telling you what windows should and shouldn't be open. There's no way

I have heard that some people treat restaurants and staff like shit because it's not their place and they don't see it their responsibility to be clean because ""the staff will deal with it"". Is this actually true. Do people actually see restaurant staff as lower people even though it's Australia it's 2025. I thought we would be beyond this by now

A pleasant note to help calm me and any of you guys who need it. I did have a older gentleman today who ordered a large cappuccino (the easiest one to carry) and when I handed it to him, he compliments my coffee carrying skills and says how proud he is that I ""didn't spill even a single drop"" and how he couldn't possibly do the same. It was such a wholesome moment in the midst of all the choas",1,1744697622.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

## Who Created Instant Sprix 3.0?

The lack of a public founder might raise an eyebrow, but it’s worth noting that many trading tools operate under corporate umbrellas rather than personal branding. As long as the platform does what it says, I’m okay with that.

And I want to wake up with you every single day. I want to grow old with you. But not just grow old. I want to savor every morning in your arms. Every soft breath. Every slow touch. I want to see that look in your eyes, the one that tells me I’m the only one you see.

When I close my eyes, you’re there. Whispering my name. And when I open them, I want to be wrapped up in you. I want your hands on me like you mean it. Like I’m your beginning, your middle, and your never-ending.

You are the calm after my storm. But you also start fires in me. Fires that burn slow, steady, and deep. I want to feel the press of your body against mine, hear the rhythm of your heartbeat syncing with mine. Skin to skin. Soul to soul.

You are the silver lining in my sky. And one day, I hope to see silver in your hair too. But not before we’ve made a thousand memories. Not before we’ve kissed under a hundred sunsets and tangled our limbs through every long, lazy morning.

I want your desire. All of it. Raw. Real. Undeniable. I want that smile, the one you save just for me over that first cup of coffee, when we both know we’ve already had our first taste of heaven.

You are my peace. My pleasure. And I don’t just want to love you for a lifetime. I want to love you like the world is watching, and I don’t give a damn. Because you’ve got me. Entirely.

And all I ask is that you love me back the same way. Boldly. Completely. And without end.

Crying out of feeling so stuck, crying about old memories and also crying about something good happening today. But the DPDR won’t leave.","
I'm not sure if it's because I reduced my Zoloft - it's actually likely, but I've even able to cry again, a lot. I got some good news today and ugly cried for like an hour. But also sad cried all weekend. I've even using music to help me feel.

I was blocked from feeling anything at all until I reduced my Zoloft from 50mg to 25mg. But my anxiety is also back. I can't drink coffee because it makes my nervous system go crazy. But on 50mg I could.

I think I need to be able to feel all this. But it's also a lot. I'm not afraid to panic because my mind is learning none of this is dangerous. With the medication, it was just numbing it all out and making me fear the feelings. So is this a good thing?

My body feels very heavy and I feel extremely overstimulated. I feel like there's no happy medium. I'm either completely numb on Zoloft or feeling a bit overwhelmed. While im able to cry and feel deep sadness or even pride- there's no other positive emotions. I just always feel either anxiety, sadness or numbness. I'd also say that my DPDR is really bad right now too, and I live in 24/7 DPDR already.

Where is the bottom of the negative emotions? I feel like I'm an open wound that just doesn't stop bleeding. I either put pressure on it (numbness) or I let it bleed out (crying) but that wound never heal. The dissociation never stops. It's all just too much, or too little. When do I get windows of feeling good? I am so tired. So so tired after 3 years of this. Yet I somehow keep achieving things in my career - and I cry, cause the little boy inside me is proud of me, yet he's still hurting. When does the hurt stop?",1,1744697268.0,CPTSDFreeze,0,1.0,False

If you’ve ever searched for ways to get free money on Cash App, you've probably run into a ton of sketchy sites, too-good-to-be-true promises, and outright scams. While there's no magic button to instantly get rich, there **are** a few **legit ways to earn free money** using Cash App. Let’s break it down.

# 1. Referral Bonuses

The easiest and most reliable way to get free Cash App money is through the **referral program**. When you invite someone to download and use Cash App, both you **and** your friend can earn a bonus—usually $5 to $15—once they sign up using your referral code and send at least $5 using the app.

To find your referral code:

* Open Cash App.
* Tap your profile icon.
* Find your referral link or code and share it.

You can promote this code on social media, blogs, or with friends and family. Just be honest and don’t spam—Cash App can ban users for abusive referral activity.

# 2. Cash App Boosts

While not direct ""free money,"" Cash App Boosts offer **instant discounts** when you use your Cash Card at certain stores or restaurants. It’s a form of saving money rather than getting it, but the effect is the same: more cash stays in your pocket.

For example, you might get:

* 10% off DoorDash orders
* $1 off at coffee shops
* 5% off groceries

To activate a Boost:

* Tap the Cash Card tab in the app.
* Select a Boost that fits your spending habits.

If you already planned to make a purchase, a Boost is basically free money back.

# 3. Cash App Giveaways

Cash App occasionally runs **official giveaways** on their verified Twitter account [u/CashApp](https://twitter.com/CashApp). These giveaways, often branded as “#CashAppFriday,” ask users to comment or retweet with their $Cashtag for a chance to win free money. Amounts can range from $50 to even thousands of dollars.

Important tips:

* Always make sure you’re interacting with the **verified Cash App account** (blue checkmark).
* Never give your password, PIN, or send money to receive money. That’s a scam.

# 4. Surveys and Reward Apps

Some third-party apps pay users small amounts of money for completing surveys or simple tasks, which you can cash out to Cash App via PayPal or bank transfer. Examples include:

* Swagbucks
* InboxDollars
* Mistplay (for gamers)

While you won’t earn a lot, it’s a low-effort way to make a few extra bucks that you can transfer to your Cash App balance.

# 5. Sell Products or Services

Cash App is also great for peer-to-peer transactions. You can offer:

* Digital art
* Custom playlists
* Coaching sessions
* Small gigs or odd jobs

Share your $Cashtag with customers, and you can receive payment instantly—no waiting on checks or invoices.

# Avoid These Cash App Scams

While searching for ways to get free Cash App money, you’ll run into scammers promising:

* Money flipping (“Send me $10 and I’ll send you back $100!”)
* “Generators” or fake modded apps
* Requests to “verify your account” by sending money

🚫 **NEVER** send money to get money. That’s a red flag.

🚫 **NEVER** give your sign-in code, PIN, or full card details to anyone—even if they claim to be Cash App support.

# Final Thoughts

While there’s no magical hack to get thousands of free dollars, you can still earn **real** money on Cash App through referrals, smart use of Boosts, giveaways, and side hustles. Stay safe, avoid the scams, and focus on the methods that are actually supported by Cash App or legit third parties.

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to the real ones—and that free Cash App money will add up.

1jzkhya,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jzkhya/anyone_have_their_ex_turn_mutual_friends_against/,Anyone have their Ex turn mutual friends against them?,"I (21M) broke up with my ex (21F) a few months ago. I finally went and got the rest of my stuff from her place the other day. We had been together for 6 years and lived together for 3, so I had quite a lot of things there.

I broke up with her on the phone after a 6 year relationship. That was a really shitty thing to do. I shouldn’t have done that. I’ve been in therapy since, and my therapist says that it seems like a lot of emotional abuse was taking place from her. 

I only mention this to explain why I felt the need to do it over the phone. She had gotten violent (throwing things, kicking holes in walls) during arguments before, and I didn’t want to be there if she snapped after I broke the news to her.

I wasn’t perfect either. I neglected her emotional needs nearing the end of the relationship, and had a habit of drinking too much alcohol to self-medicate for depression I’ve been living with. I’m not an alcoholic, but I tend to binge when I do drink.

Since the break-up, I’ve been working on myself and understanding what led me to make the decision to break up with her. I’ve apologized profusely. I’m not above admitting that I begged for another chance with her, hoping that we could make things work. She told me that I hurt her too badly during the breakup, that she needs to heal before she can get into a relationship again (probably not with me). 

She’s telling me to move on, so I’m not stuck waiting for that moment that she’s back in a better place mentally. On the last day I got my stuff at her house, she offered me a coffee. We talked about how life has been going for both of us. I suggested we go for a walk, and so we walked together for a few hours and talked. We went and got some groceries, I helped her bring them inside. 

When we were together, she had a friend who we both hung out with. Her friend and I had known each other for a while, we even ended up working together for a summer. I honestly thought we were friends. After the breakup, whenever me and my ex hang out, she mentions “____ is going to be so mad at me”, and talks about how her friend hates me now. 

She sent me snapchats when they’re at the bar together and it’s videos of our old mutual friend telling me “go fuck yourself” and giving me the middle finger. This person is a girl who’s in a relationship, not a man, so it’s not like she’s trying to take my place. I can tell she’s influencing my ex to never take me back and talking shit about me to her. My ex keeps mentioning “hot girl summer is coming up!”, to try to dig at my insecurities that she’ll be sleeping around. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I knew this friend for years, I would go pick her up and bring her to my ex’s house and it was always a good conversation. Now that we split up, she’s in my ex’s ear telling her how bad I was for her, telling me to go fuck myself on my ex’s phone, and generally trying to stir shit between me and my ex. 

All the other mutual friends we shared have been turning on me as well. My ex probably would’ve been willing to work things out if it wasn’t for that one friend’s comments and opinions. We shared pretty much all of our friends, and it’s clear to see that they’re all choosing her over me. I feel like I’ve lost my entire friend group.

I’m having my reputation ruined among people I really care about. People I’ve known from even before our relationship started. I’m upset that I’m losing all my friends because I broke up with my girlfriend. I haven’t said anything negative about her to anyone, but it’s clear that she’s saying very negative things about me to anyone who will listen. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What should I do?

I have noticed i start sweating under my armpits and shivering a little sometimes. It's happened a few times during the last few weeks.  Today i just got my period and I slept a ton, I got up feeling very sick and fatigued. No pain anywhere I just felt bad and so tired. I got up and started playing some games and noticed that my armpits were sweating a lot with my forehead a little. I had to clean them twice. I did have deodorant on so that's weird. I drank some water and ate soup. I'm only sweating a little now and don't feel as cold. My temp is 99.3, hr 90 and o2 100. 

I also did drink some coffee after I started gaming so I wonder if that could've caused it but I don't rmemeber when exactly I started sweating I just know it was when I got up on my PC.

I feel fine otherwise. No pain anywhere, no SOB or chest pain, no aches (other than period aches), concentration is okay just feel a little out of it cuz I'm tired (even tho I slept 12 hours)

Any input is greatly appreciated.

1jzkgl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1jzkgl1/people_who_selfhelp_poorly_and_then_whine_about/,"People who ""Self-Help"" poorly, and then whine about how useless it is","I get it, self-help resources can be great, and even if they don't work, they can help you narrow down what kind of actual help you need.

What frustrates me is people who can't seem to understand how they work and then whine about how useless it is. There are two people in particular that bug me.

1) The person who reads all the books, but do none of the things, and then are upset nothing has changed.  You read 7 habits of highly effective people, but you didn't try and apply any of the habits and are somehow disappointed in the book.  The fave self-help intro I ever read was on one of Gail Vaz-Oxlade's (financial help, debt recovery) books where she said if you weren't going to do the work you might as well not buy the book because it was just wasting more money you probably didn't have.  Brutal, but true.   
  
I get not all self help books are for you, and the advice given might not be relevant, but if you aren't going to do any of the things a self help book recommends, then you aren't going to see any changes. The book doesn't just make things better.  They are guides.

2) The ""all of nothing people"" who won't try one thing if they can't do all of them, or do all the things, even if it's detrimental.  Sure all 7 habits of highly effective people might not apply, but you know what, just applying one or two could still make huge gains.    
  
Going back to Gail Vaz-Oxlade, she points out some brutal truths, like if you are in debt and overspending, you can't afford cigarettes, alcohol, eating out, buying coffee, or sometimes owning a car.  Someone looks at this, and says, I can't have any joy so they do nothing.  Well just taking one of those out could help.  If you have none of those things, then it sucks you might have to cut elsewhere.  Then there is the other end where the person goes, she says I can't afford a car, sells it, but then can't get to work because they don't live near transit and lose their job.  Like you need to use common sense too, and realize that even partial implementation can have huge gains.  Not everything might apply to you or work for you, and you don't need to do it all or do none.

For the most part I don't care if people self help badly as much as I am sick of people whining about how useless self-help is after they waste their money on another book, course, seminar, only to have it not have the effect they want, but also have done nothing to make that a reality, or done things they KNEW would negatively impact their lives.

Use your brain, reading the book doesn't make things better with self-help.  That's the reason it's called self-help instead of something like book-help, you need to be willing to help yourself.",1,1744696293.0,PetPeeves,0,1.0,False

I’ve heard so many stories from friends, even couples who met their partners at a bachata social and that post dance hang is often where things happen.

This has especially been true for me with super casual social dancers the ones who aren’t too serious about it or don’t show up to every event. I’m not sure if it’s just my “dance” skill that creates that spark and honestly, I’m average at best but sometimes I wonder if I’m using the dance as a bridge to create that feeling with them. Though this is where I start questioning how genuine I really am. 

Because there’s a certain energy, right? Even beginners can pick up on it when someone’s dancing just to manipulate. Like that one guy in my scene who’s always throwing in bachata sensual moves during salsa, and I mean really close sensuals, it’s obvious. You can feel it. You can see it.

But when it’s real? When someone’s smiling, making eye contact, feeling the music with you even if they’re not too serious dancing ""dancers"" that’s where it's better. 

Though, very skilled and experienced dancers can just be theatrical with it that it may leave you going, wait a second, were we flirting during the dance or was that all an act?

Just sharing my experiences since everyone is going crazy about the dating and being open in social dancing lately. So if it feels real, follow it. If they’re into it, if they want to hang out after or outside the social… that’s when it turns into something worth remembering. 

If it’s late or near to closing, see if they’re down for more than three dances, close the night with them on that last dance, last song. If the vibe’s right, ask to add each other on socials or then suggest a quick coffee after. Late-night coffee shops in my area is clutch. From there, you can always suggest checking out a nicer view. It’s a smooth way to keep the spark going. Drop them off or walk them to a uber after. If you're at a festival with a room, nearby landmarks are good provided that both of you are down to check them out, then if anything happens that's why you got a room.

But for the skilled long term type 5 year more dancers, they know what's up and so should you.",0,1744696035.0,Salsa,0,0.25,False

Because I am home most of the day, when I’m not enjoying my daily coffee or at the gym defluffing, I enjoy chatting at all hours and hope you do too! Meme’s and humor are always welcome forms of communication!



I hope to hear from you soon!

## What is Netherex Pro?

Netherex Pro is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify how people trade crypto and other assets. Think of it as a digital assistant that helps you make smarter trading decisions—or even make them for you—based on real-time market analysis.

What sets it apart is the combo of **automation**, **custom alerts**, and a **user-friendly interface**, making it accessible even if you’ve never traded a single coin in your life. It’s not just for crypto either—you can also dive into forex, stocks, and commodities if you want to diversify your portfolio.

## Who Created Netherex Pro?

That’s where things get a little murky. The team behind Netherex Pro hasn’t been super public, which is pretty common with platforms like this. While that might raise some eyebrows, it doesn’t necessarily mean it's shady. In fact, platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** started similarly, and they’ve grown into trusted names in the space.

What we do know is that the creators claim to be a group of **financial tech experts** and **data scientists** who wanted to make trading more accessible. Whether that’s marketing or truth, the product itself seems to reflect a decent amount of professional design and development.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Netherex Pro Today](https://tinyurl.com/3bsr2v5x)
## How Does Netherex Pro Work?

Netherex Pro uses **AI algorithms** to analyze market trends and suggest trades—or execute them automatically—based on pre-set parameters. It’s like having a robot assistant that scans the crypto market 24/7, looking for opportunities so you don’t have to.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **Market Analysis**: The platform uses real-time data to scan for price movements and trends.
- **Trade Automation**: Once the system identifies a potential trade, it can either alert you or complete the trade itself.
- **User Input**: You can set your own trading rules, risk levels, and strategies.
- **Demo Mode**: Try everything out with fake money before you go in for real.

This setup makes it appealing to both total beginners and more seasoned users who want to save time.

## Netherex Pro Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I liked and what could be better.

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-friendly interface** with no steep learning curve
- ✅ **Automated trading** so you can trade while you sleep
- ✅ **Real-time alerts** and analysis
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes, not just crypto
- ✅ Great for both manual and auto trading styles
- ✅ Demo mode to test strategies risk-free

**Cons:**

- ❌ **Not officially regulated**, which may be a dealbreaker for some
- ❌ No dedicated mobile app yet
- ❌ Limited transparency about the development team

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Netherex Pro?

Good news: Netherex Pro is **web-based**, so you can use it on just about anything.

- **Desktop** (Windows/Mac/Linux): Full access with all features
- **Smartphones**: Works smoothly on mobile browsers like Chrome or Safari
- **Tablets**: Similar experience to desktop

There’s no official app (yet), but the responsive web design makes it pretty easy to use on the go.

Netherex Pro is available in most regions where crypto trading is legal. Some of the **supported countries** include:

- United States
- Canada
- Australia
- United Kingdom
- Germany

If you’re in a restricted country (like China or parts of the Middle East), access might be limited. But for most users in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, getting started is easy.

## Netherex Pro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is one of the platform’s strongest points. Netherex Pro uses **AI-powered tools** to analyze thousands of data points in real time. It’s not just pulling random charts—it’s scanning for actionable signals and patterns, even during volatile markets.

### User-Friendly Interface

No clutter, no confusing dashboards. The platform is designed for simplicity with big buttons, clear menus, and helpful tooltips. It’s the kind of UI that makes you feel smart even if you don’t fully understand candlestick patterns yet.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there's no dedicated app yet, the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. You can make trades, set alerts, or just check your dashboard over morning coffee—all from your phone.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for **price movements**, **trade opportunities**, or **risk thresholds**. Whether you're a control freak or just like to be in the loop, this feature has your back.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Netherex Pro isn’t just about crypto. You can also trade:

- **Forex pairs**
- **Commodities (like gold and oil)**
- **Stocks from major exchanges**

This makes it a nice option if you want to explore beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Is Netherex Pro a Scam?

I get this question a lot. Honestly, based on my experience so far—**no, it doesn’t seem like a scam**.

- The platform works as advertised
- Customer support is responsive (within 5-10 minutes on live chat)
- Withdrawals are processed within 24–48 hours
- There’s a working demo account (scammy platforms usually skip this)

That said, always trade with caution. This isn’t a get-rich-quick tool. It’s a platform that can help you **optimize your trades**, not guarantee profits.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Netherex Pro?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is standard across most trading platforms like this. This deposit is used as your trading capital—not a fee—so it goes directly into your account for live trading.

### Netherex Pro Customer Support

Support is surprisingly solid. You can reach out via:

- **Live chat**: Available 24/7, usually responds fast
- **Email**: For more detailed questions
- **Account manager**: Some users get assigned a rep after signing up

They were helpful when I tested them, answering questions quickly without sounding like bots.

## How do you start trading on Netherex Pro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the Netherex Pro homepage and fill in your:

- Name
- Email
- Phone number

You’ll get a confirmation email and be redirected to the dashboard.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to verify your identity (usually a government ID + address proof). Once that's done, you can make your first deposit via:

- Credit/Debit Card
- Bank Transfer
- Crypto Wallet

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either:

- **Practice on Demo Mode** to get a feel for the system
- **Set up your trading strategy** and let the bot do its thing
- **Manually place trades** if you’re more hands-on

## How to Delete a Netherex Pro Account?

If you want out, just contact support and request deletion. They’ll guide you through the process, usually asking for ID verification before closing the account. It’s not instant, but it’s straightforward.

**Best for**: Beginners, passive traders, and anyone curious about automation.

So far, I’ve just added a toggle switch to control the pump for pre-infusion/blooming shots. Temporary until Gaggimate is in. Temp surfing all day. Not going to waste time with the PID as I can work around the temp until I get it running with Gaggimate.

The meeting is over and the crowd dissipates—half of them make water-cooler talk next to the expired baked goods. The other half chain-smoke outside glancing at their cars. None of them want to be here.     

8:30 pm. Too late to attend another meeting. I burn my tongue trying to gulp down the coffee before lobbing the cup into the trash can two feet away from me. Close enough that I can guarantee it lands in the bin; far enough away that it's not embarrassing that I went for the throw. 

Its a three-pointer and I call it a night. I retreat to the backdoor, anxious to triple check that paying for parking ends at 6:00 PM, and more anxious to avoid coffee drinkers blocking the point of entrance. 

I slink to the backdoor, already queuing up in my mind the music for the drive home.

Laura stops me, gently (in her mind —in mine it feels invasive). 

'Alex, you've been attending these meetings for over a year now'

    'I have'

'You haven't shared with the group or offered verbal support to any other members... There is no obligation or pressure to participate in these meetings but I know that in the road to recovery you must embrace a village, and—'

I cut her off

'Laura, this group has been instrumental in my recovery. In particular, you have been a shining light. I hope that you know that you are a lighthouse keeper guiding lost souls home. It would be easy to just call you the lighthouse, but you are more than that. You have taken it upon yourself to occupy the never-ending position of giving lost ships a beacon of light to follow home. Lighthouses don't exist without keepers, and a light without direction will sink the most seasoned sailer into the sea.'

It was heavy handed and I knew so as I was saying its but I had judged her caffeine intake as well as the 12 unopened notifications on her phone and knew it was just enough to give me an out without further questioning, and her both an out of further talking to an alcoholic as well as validation that her magnanimous efforts had not been in vain.

Laura's shoulders visibly relaxed, and as she backed away, hand reaching towards her phone, she told me that she was proud of me, and that she was happy that I was here. 

At least she didn't ask me about my sponsor (non-existent.)

Clear of Laura, I dodge the smokers and head to my car. I check the meter (parking was free after 6 pm, but I like to make sure.) It's 8:50 pm now. 

My car is pristine, There is no dust on any of the bits that love to collect dust. I open the dash and pull out a water bottle filled with clear liquor and take a pull. The flask that I hid in my notebook and strategically drank from throughout the day had long been emptied. I reach for my phone and check traffic. 12 minutes. No excuse not to go. I crack the windows and light a smoke, before deciding the soundtrack of the night. I've got four songs and ideally they'll be cohesive.

I can lean into the melancholy the dead at 27 club. The Eliiot Smith route feels like gilding the lily of AA. Leonard Cohen is too wail-y. I can only stand 7 minutes of Nirvana. 

I settle on Harry Nilsson for tonight's usual haunts. I know it would piss him off, which only makes it sound sweeter.

But the clatter of a tray turns her laughter into silence – “I don’t belong here,” she whispers, then flees, her footsteps echoing across the wooden floor.
Lisa remains behind, the cup cold, her heart heavy: “What did I miss?”
That’s how *A Light in the Fog* begins – a journey through Anna’s world with borderline personality disorder, and Lisa’s path as her sister: a dance between light and shadow, love and doubt.

This book isn’t a dry manual – it’s a companion. For you, who loves someone whose moods ignite like sparks, without warning.
“Maybe you know the feeling,” the narrator whispers, “a moment when everything flips.”
With around 20,000 words, the story unfolds in seven chapters plus an appendix, carried by poetic imagery – “a veil lifts,”* “a fire flares”* – and set against the backdrop of Vienna: from the Prater to the Danube.
It’s for those who see themselves in Anna, and for loved ones who share Lisa’s questions:
“Why is she like this? What can I do?”
Without blame or clinical jargon, it reveals borderline as an intense form of perception – “a radio jumping between stations” – and offers understanding, a compass through the storm.

I'd love to discuss this book with others, let me know what you think about it. ",1,1744694286.0,Borderline,0,1.0,False

1jzjxsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Best-Bonus-4525/comments/1jzjxsu/rhys/,Rhys,"The chill started subtly. A draft in the coffee shop where there shouldn't be one, a whisper of air against my skin when the door was closed tight. I’d shrug it off, blaming the old building, the overactive imagination of someone who spent a lot of time alone. Then came the dreams.

They were vivid, sensual in a way no waking fantasy could ever replicate. A touch like cool silk, lips that tasted of rain and something ancient, a voice a low hum against my ear, promising things I couldn’t quite grasp but desperately craved. I’d wake up flushed, my sheets tangled, a lingering sense of… completion.

Then I started seeing *him* at the market. He always seemed to be browsing the same aisle as me, his eyes, a startling shade of deep grey, would meet mine for a fleeting moment before he’d turn away. There was an undeniable magnetism about him, an old-world charm in the way he carried himself. He always smelled faintly of lavender and old fabric a scent that both intrigued and slightly unsettled me.

One rainy afternoon, he finally spoke to me. “Beautiful day for contemplation, isn’t it?” His voice was a low murmur, sending a shiver down my spine despite the warmth of the cafe. We talked for hours that day, about books and art and the strange beauty of solitude. He was enigmatic, revealing little about himself, but there was a profound connection, a feeling like we’d known each other for lifetimes. He told me his name was Rhys.

We started meeting regularly. At the park, in quiet corners of bookstores, always under the soft glow of twilight or in dimly lit cafes. His touch was always cool, almost startling at first, but I grew accustomed to it, even found myself craving it. His lips, when we finally kissed, tasted of rain and something indefinably old, just like in my dreams.

Our intimacy deepened quickly. He was unlike anyone I’d ever met, so intensely focused on me, so utterly captivating. He’d appear at my doorstep late at night, a silent invitation in his grey eyes. I never questioned how he knew where I lived, or why he always seemed to materialize out of the shadows. The pull towards him was too strong, too intoxicating.

He never stayed the night fully. He would hold me in the darkness, his cool embrace strangely comforting, his whispers against my skin filled with a longing I mirrored. I’d wake up alone, the lingering scent of lavender the only proof he’d been there. I started leaving the window unlatched, a silent acknowledgment of his nocturnal visits.

One evening, as dusk bled into night during our usual meeting in the park, the air grew heavy, almost suffocating. The temperature plummeted, even though it was a mild spring evening. The scent of lavender was overpowering, mixed with the sharp, metallic tang of rain on stone, even though the sky was clear. The shadows around us seemed to deepen and writhe.

Rhys reached for me, his cool fingers brushing my cheek. His eyes seemed to glow in the dim light, no longer just grey, but something deeper, more ancient. This time, there was no gentle affection in his touch, only an overwhelming sense of dread.

“You are mine now,” his voice echoed in my mind, not through my ears. It was a possessive claim, a chilling pronouncement.

Panic seized me. I tried to pull away, but an unseen force held me fast. His grip tightened, his cool flesh growing momentarily solid, almost brittle. The world around us seemed to warp, the trees twisting into grotesque shapes, the air thick with a whispering that wasn’t the wind.

I felt a tugging sensation, a pulling from within. My body grew light, insubstantial. I looked down at my hands, seeing them fade, becoming translucent like his.

“Rhys, what’s happening? Who are you?” I tried to scream, but no sound escaped my lips.

His cool smile widened, a terrifying rictus in the fading light. “Home,” he whispered, his voice a chilling caress against my fading form. “You belong with me now.”

The world dissolved into a cold, swirling void. The last thing I felt was his icy embrace, pulling me deeper, further away from the warmth of the living world, into the silent, desolate realm of the dead. I was his now, another ghost in his spectral domain, forever bound to a love that transcended life and plunged me into eternal darkness, all because I thought I’d finally met someone who saw the real me.",1,1744694232.0,u_Best-Bonus-4525,0,1.0,False

I'm mostly curious to know what are the blessings of abstaining from tea and coffee.

To me, choosing to obey the word of wisdom and abstaining from tea and coffee sounds like a test of faith, obedience, and humility. I.e. Do you have enough faith and trust in God to keep a commandment that you don't fully understand.

1jzjurs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jzjurs/the_skin_cathedral/,The Skin Cathedral,"I just keep waking up, I keep waking up after having the same dream. I’m 12 years old, I’m walking through my childhood home, and when I open my bedroom door I’m finally myself. Day after day I have to wake up from that. I keep coming into work more and more tired. I can’t keep doing this. All I know is that I have to find that place again.

I woke up again, and I still went into work. Every day on the way I pass by a cathedral, and all I can think about is how I want to look like that. Then my coworker pulled me out of my thoughts.

“So the first game is really good, but the second one is where it’s at. I really like the graphics and-”

“Jimmy it’s six in the morning and we’re minimum wage baristas.”

The skinny kid who stood across from me was my sixteen year old coworker, Jimmy. He’s a much better worker than me; a really sweet kid, but will never stop talking about how the early Playstation consoles had separate memory cards, or that the only reason Silent Hill is foggy is because of the rendering limitations of the PS1. As much as I hate to admit it, he was my favorite coworker. I just didn’t have the energy. 

“Jimmy… Do you ever have recurring dreams, that no matter how hard you try you can’t forget?”

“Huh? What do you mean”

“Like I keep having the same dream every night, and I can’t sleep because I don’t want to see it again.”

“Oh, so kind of like PT?’

I then remembered that Jimmy was a child working in a Starbucks in the Midwest, so he could afford to buy more purposefully faded thrasher font shirts. 

As we both stared at each other baffled, our boss walked in. A large Irish man who insisted we call him Red. None of us wanted this; he just based his identity on being Irish. “Hey lads, we have to open up soon. Are you two ready?” He said with a tired smile. We both wordlessly went to our stations. The longer the shift went on, the more I retreated into my thoughts. I couldn’t stop thinking about the cathedral. I loved the way it was shaped; I needed to see it again. 

I spent the rest of the day alone. As the sleep deprivation caught up with me the church was speaking. The dream was different this time. I was in a field and so was *it.* I kept running towards the spiraling ornate building, but it never got any closer. It wasn’t getting further away necessarily, it just wasn’t getting closer.

I woke up again, and I still wasn’t myself. I don’t remember any conversations from that morning. The cathedral was still calling to me, telling me how perfect I could be. I served people their coffee in a catatonic state. At the end of the shift Red seemed to notice “Hey kid, you seem tired. What’s on your mind?” I met his gaze

“Red… Do you know anything about that cathedral?’

“What cathedral?”

“Y’know the massive one, a couple miles down the road?’

“There’s… there’s no cathedral around here.”

He was *lying*. It was there, and it was so beautiful, and it was all I wanted to be. I drove there running every red light. I stood outside its imposing doors, nearly unable to fathom it. It felt like if I strained my ear hard enough I could faintly hear music. As I opened the door with a loud creaking, it was well lit and completely empty. My footsteps echoed for miles even though I could see every wall of the chappel, and that’s when I saw it. A little door offset to the altar. It was my door, I knew it. I walked to it with a certain reverence, and an unrecognizable fear I wouldn’t acknowledge. 

It led me to the field. The wind felt otherworldly as it rushed through my bones. It was pitch black, but I knew where it was. I approached the stone monolith, and it was bigger this time. The inside of the building was *perfect*. It was imperceptibly massive, with stained glass windows that were barely visible in the dim light. Everything was so intricate and beautiful. I stumbled wearily to the altar, almost wondering when I would wake up. I stared into the large silver mirror placed in front of the cross, and I understood. I ripped and tore at my unclean flesh until I was finally myself. When I looked in the mirror, I too was *perfect*. I was my very own skin cathedral… ",2,1744693910.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

How did I get here? How did I go from holding the line to just walking away? How has these three months been the longest four years ever? The plain answer is I don’t know. It’s amazing how life can change at the drop of a hat. I honestly believe that we all thought they couldn’t possibly mean literally “traumatize” Federal workers.  Surely, it was rhetoric and some red meat. The worst that can only come of this is RTO right? America would not tolerate a descent into tyranny in two months. We dug into our resolve that our massive resistance would win out it. Feds have been villainized for decades, just keep your head down and work. You’ll survive. It never dawned on me that evil knows no boundaries. So, here I am with tens of thousands of other Federal workers. Wondering…

I signed the contract to go. I felt no defeat, no shame, no remorse but for those co-workers who will hold on and don’t know what their fate may be. I felt a quiet relief though. The click of a button and it was done. I have no job lined up. No guarantees. Just a thought that it can’t get much worse than where I am now. Now I race against a clock set to 9/30/25 in a bad economy and tough job market. But now I have a voice. I don’t have to fear retribution for a paycheck. Silence for a few more days of work. I can join the chorus of millions and openly speak. Freely tell what it’s like from a Fed’s perspective.

I thought dictatorships were only in those countries where soldiers goose-step and parade before the dear leader who’s dressed in military uniform with self-awarded medals of honor pinned on them. Yes, despite her flawed foundation I thought America still had it deep within to strive towards E Pluribus Unum. Some guardrail would hold. I pondered that there was no mandate for a dictator.  No mandate for Co-Presidents, but here we are. My mind wandered off into so much deep thought that my coffee had gotten cold. This is what life has tossed at me and countless others. Choose between a bad and a worse choice. I can’t say what the future holds, but I know I did my best. I know I tried to serve my fellow citizens with my best. I know I’ll embrace yet another chapter of my life. I’ll leave knowing I did what every decent human should strive to do, make something a little better than it was before they came along.

**My (27f) ex (26m) dumped me in January after 9 years together because he didn’t think i was wife material now he reached out wanting to talk because he needs to get something off his chest I don’t know why he doing this or if I should met him?**



I was with my ex who I will call Nate because if I’m being honest minus betraying a friend I was a Cassie

I don’t want to go to much into the details but for the last nine years I lost myself to Nate he was my world everything I did was for him, I helped him though depression, help get/keep his grades up even worked two jobs so he could focus on collage when his parents disowned him for nearly 3 years because they didn’t agree with the major or collage he choose bare in mind I was also a collage student

when his parents started talking to him again and started to financial support him we moved into a new apartment Nate said he wanted me to quit my job (I didn’t) because it was his turn to take care of me . For 16 months everything was great he spoiled me than I noticed he was more interested in his new friends at times he ignored me completely

Back in December he did a 180 and he loved bombed me the whole month he really went out of his way to make Christmas magical for me i honestly believed he was going to propose on January the 2nd he made me my favourite dinner and made this speech about me being his first love how I’ve been there since high school I kept thinking any minute now he’s gonna ask me to marry him

But no he dumped me as his speech went on my world fell apart and as much he tried to sugar coat it he basically said “you were a good girlfriend but that’s what you always be to me a girlfriend I don’t see you as my wife or the mother of my children blah blah you served your purpose now I don’t need you anymore blah blah I need someone on my level blah blah you’re a gold digger blah I’ll give you 30 days to move out”

I couldn’t speak and he stared at me looking for a response I think this lasted 20 minutes before he said he’d sleep in the guest room than left, strangely I didn’t cry or get angry I just ordered cardboard boxes online than went to bed. The next day I waited for him to leave the apartment before I left my room than I called my boss asked (begged really) if I could transfer anywhere she told me there wasn’t anything but if something came up in my department she’d consider me. I than reached out to everyone I knew that wasn’t also Nate’s friend for a place to stay my cousin invited me to stay in her spare room for as long as I needed and I could move in straight away so that was amazing, in the four days it took me too pack my stuff and move out I didn’t see or speak to Nate I doubt he even noticed

I didn’t trust myself at the time to ignore a “you up text” so I blocked him and everyone close to him even changed me number/email to make sure he couldn’t reach me. The first night at my cousins was the night everything hit me I think I cried every night the first month i honestly felt like shit i thought about what Nate said over and over again it made me feel so low like I was nothing he only stayed with me because I was just there but thankfully my cousin sent for my mom,other cousins and real friends to give me an intervention which I badly needed , I believe that first month I wouldn’t have made it without my cousin

I’m still healing and waiting on that job transfer because I feel like if I’m not in the same city as nate and I have a place of my own the fresh start would do me the world of good.

I thought by now I’d be a distant memory for Nate but shockingly he sent flowers to my job today for my brithday which was on Sunday apparently he went to my parents house looking for me too and my mom admitted he’s been before dropping off stuff and tried to ask questions about me but they told him to fuck off

The flowers came with a card saying “dear cassie happy belated birthday I’ve been thinking about you for non stop for the last few months especially with how everything ended I need to get something off my chest that I feel will haunt me for the rest of my life if I don’t tell you this to your face but I’ve no way of contacting you if it’s possible can we meet up in the near future -Nate”

What could he want? What’s haunting him he needs to say to my face? Everyone in my life is telling me ignore him but they hate him

I’m torn but I can’t lie my curiosity is telling me meet him to see what he wants Has anyone been in my shoes or in Nates?

**Cultural\_Section\_862**

*NGL I didn't read all that, I just wanted to say... just bc he needs to say something doesn't mean you need to hear it. I doubt it's anything that would add vakue to your life, he's likely wanting to alleviate guilt for some long ago tresspass*

>OOP: My cousin thinks he tried to monkey branch and it didn’t work out

**StudentOfThisLife**

*Seems like he cheated on you back in December before the love bombing. Now, this dumb ass cheater is probably engaged to the affair partner, hence the wife material comment. Fuck him. Let him implode that relationship just like he imploded yours. He's not a good human, and he's trying to make himself feel better about something. He doesn't deserve that. And he doesn't deserve your time or energy.*

>OOP: You know what’s pathetic? If he cheated and told me that was the reason he was breaking up with me wouldn’t I don’t think it have hurt me as much



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 5 days later**



So we ended up meeting and no I didn’t go to him

I had told the receptionist at my work if he came looking for just say I’m out for the day after he showed up once I didn’t want the drama of him around my job.

So nate just kept going to my usual places like the grocery store I go every Saturday evening or the park I ran at Sunday mornings (his words) till he would eventually run into me

And he did yesterday he was waiting at the coffee shop I go to after my morning run. When I saw him I tried to do turn around and leave but he kept calling me so I thought to myself if everything went pear shaped a coffee shop would be safer than my walk home

So I just sat down and asked him what he wanted He gave an apology that wasn’t an apology you know the type with “I’m sorry but” and “pity me” he blamed his mental health ,his job his parents,his friends everyone but himself

I took someone’s adivce on here and said “cut the crap I already know everything” he genuinely looked shocked and stared at me for a second I guess he thought his coworker already told me everything so he couldn’t lie

Here’s what really happened he fell for a girl in his office when he told me her name I knew her immediately I’ve met her a few times. He told for the last two years he idolised her (to be fair she’s beautiful with an amazing personality) and he hated me because I was the one stopping them from being together because his coworker was too classy to be a side piece. When he broke up with me he confessed to her that he was madly in love with her and he ended a 9 year relationship to be with her

Well here’s were it gets funny she doesn’t even like him lol she called him a piece of trash and told him if he ever spoke to her outside work she’d report him to HR. So I asked him what has any of this got to do with me like we are over I clearly cut ties there’s no reason for us to speak?

He wants to try again promised we’d get married before the year ends that we belong together, I told him no I’m nobodies second choice he threw me away after 9 years and said some pretty cruel things to me and now he thinks if he snaps his fingers I’ll come running back, he tried to beg and fake tears bringing the good times in our relationship

I told him please leave me alone as he wasted too much of my time already. I texted my cousin to meet me at the coffee shop he kept saying nonsense even suggested if I went to couples counselling for a few months he’d leave me alone the 20 minutes it took for my cousin to arrive felt like 20 years

In the end I just stopped listening and stood at the counter making small talk with baristas till my cousin arrived, she told him to fuck off and if he tried to follow us she’d call her brothers

He stayed in the coffee shop as far as I know and we just went home that’s it

It’s only been a day but I feel like it’s over and I’m free of him



**Comments**



**NONE0FURBIZZ**

*Pity you didn't tell him: ""turns out, you're the one that's not husband material, if you can say things like 'she's too classy to be a side piece', it means you'll never be a faithful, good, husband"".*

**Orphanbitchrat**

*You are the witty bitch friend we all need*

**little\_kiittyy**

*Girl, NTA. You handled that like a queen. He threw away 9 years chasing a fantasy, got rejected, and thought you’d be waiting like a backup plan? Nah. You chose you, and I’m clapping for it.*

**Misommar1246**

*This has to be the dumbest mf out there. Most people have the smarts to get a feel, set something up and monkeybranch (I say this with revulsion), but this guy just YOLO’d his way to a breakup. The other girl was never interested in him, either he is completely delusional and misread the signs, or he thought he was such a catch that she possibly couldn’t say no. And now here he is, dumped by both women and crying about his fate. OP, you dodged a nuclear missile with this one.*

The doctor owns a Tesla model X and a Porsche 911, The psychologist is a little more down to earth and drives a Mazda 3. 

We were in the parking lot chatting before we all headed out and the doctor friend said oh I didn't know you got a new car. I said oh no I've had it for a couple of months. He asked what happened to my BMW (X5 diesel). I said I gave it to my dad, who wanted to work on it, and bought the Fit instead as a city runabout. (Truly, the Bimmer was a nightmare of faults and a black hole of money.) The doctor asked why I got this car, I said it's super practical, the seats fold down flat and let me haul all my stuff and it's also a stick so it's fun to drive. 

He asked what car it was I told him a Honda Fit and he looked quizzically. He was perplexed by that last point, especially. ""But why would you want to shift it yourself isn't that a pain in traffic? It's kind of hard isn't it? I tried to learn it sometime ago but couldn't get the hang of it. How can you hold your coffee in the morning and also drive? I have a Tesla and it drives itself."" 

""I got the car because I like it; it's reliable, economical, and fun to drive"", I said.

As I drove home in my Honda, being passed by a Porsche 911 targa, an M3, and getting a nod from a race prepped 90's Civic, I only had a smile on my face. I easily scooted my little hatchback between the cones at the Chic-fil-A on the way home, and slipped into neutral to play a silly game of ""try to coast through my neighborhood all the way to my parking spot in front of my house without having to get back in gear"". 

When I parked I popped open the little doors to full 90° wide so I could grab all my stuff and then headed in to shower and rest for the night. I took a couple of glances back at my silver little hatchback as it nestled close to the curb in front of my house. It looked back at me honestly and reliably and I swear it would bark like the family dog if it could. I do really love this car and I would guess that it loves me back.

Hope you take special notice of your ride the next time you jump in and fire it up.

Spoiler: That’s not the case (at least not with the one I ended up using).

After some research, I went with the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**, a small 4G LTE hotspot device that works in over 70 countries. I’ve used it for travel, remote work, and as a backup when my home internet goes down. Let me walk you through what I learned.

**Is There a Monthly Fee?**

Short answer: **No, not with Ryoko WiFi**. There’s no monthly subscription required unless you want one.

When you buy the device, it comes **unlocked** and with a **SIM card already installed**, along with **500MB of free data** to try it out. After that, you just **top up when needed**. No auto-renewals, no hidden charges, no contract.

That was a huge relief for me. I didn’t want another monthly bill.

Here’s where I got mine from (they had a 70% discount when I ordered):  
[**MUAMA Ryoko Official Site**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**How Does the Data Work Then?**

It’s totally **pay-as-you-go**. You choose how much data you want to buy based on your needs. Packages typically start at around $5 for 1GB, with better rates the more you buy (like 10GB or 20GB bundles).

And here’s the cool part:

* **Data doesn’t expire monthly.**
* If you buy 10GB and only use 4GB, the remaining 6GB stays available for next time.

You can check out the top-up options here if you're curious:  
[**Ryoko WiFi Data Packages**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**So, What’s the Catch?**

Honestly, there are a few things to be aware of:

* **It runs on 4G LTE**, not 5G. But I’ve consistently gotten 30–80 Mbps depending on where I am.
* **No screen on the device**, so if you want to check your signal strength or data usage, you need to log in via browser.
* The included SIM is **tied to the device**, so you can’t just pop it into your phone. But the device *itself* is unlocked, so you can use local SIMs if you prefer.

**Why I Still Use It**

I originally got the **Ryoko portable WiFi** for a vacation, but now I use it all the time:

* When I work from random spots like coffee shops or parks
* On road trips
* When my home WiFi goes down
* Even just as a safer alternative to public WiFi

It’s lightweight, easy to carry, and has a **battery that lasts 12–15 hours**. I just toss it in my backpack and forget about it until I need it.

**Final Thought**

If you’re wondering whether **portable WiFi means paying a monthly fee**, the answer is: **not necessarily**. With Ryoko WiFi, you control when and how you pay. That flexibility was the deciding factor for me, and so far, it’s been totally worth it.

If anyone else is using a mobile hotspot or has a different setup, I’d love to hear what’s working for you.

1jzjeyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SepticSolutions101/comments/1jzjeyj/how_to_maintain_a_small_septic_tank_without/,How To Maintain A Small Septic Tank Without Frequent Pumping,"Effective Daily Habits to Maintain a Small Septic Tank Without Frequent Pumping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div> Owning a small septic tank means regular care is essential, but you don't always have to rely on frequent pumping to keep it operating efficiently. By adopting effective daily habits, you can extend the time between pumpings and protect your septic system from costly repairs. These simple but impactful steps focus on managing what goes into the tank and how water flows through your plumbing.

### Understand What Goes Down Your Drains

 One of the most important habits for maintaining a small septic tank is monitoring what you flush or pour down sinks and toilets. Avoid disposing of non-biodegradable materials like diapers, feminine hygiene products, and wipes, even if they are labeled ""flushable."" These items can clog the system and cause solids to build up more quickly, increasing the need for pumping.

 Additionally, refrain from pouring chemicals, oils, paints, or medications down your drains. Harsh chemicals can kill the beneficial bacteria in your septic tank that break down waste naturally. Without these bacteria, solids accumulate rapidly, and the system loses efficiency.

### Conserve Water to Reduce Load

 Water conservation plays a crucial role in septic tank health. Flooding the tank with excess water stresses the system and pushes solids into the drain field. If you want to maintain a small septic tank without frequent pumping, watch your water use closely.

 Simple daily habits such as fixing leaky faucets, installing low-flow showerheads, and running full loads in your washing machine and dishwasher can greatly reduce water consumption. Spread out activities that use large amounts of water, so the system has time to process waste between uses.

### Use Septic-Safe Cleaning Products

 Not all household cleaners are safe for septic tanks. Choosing septic-safe or biodegradable cleaning products helps preserve the natural bacteria in your tank. These microorganisms are vital for breaking down organic waste effectively.

 Avoid bleach and other harsh disinfectants in high volumes, as they can disrupt bacterial activity. When you choose cleaning products wisely, you're supporting your septic system's health and extending intervals between necessary pumping.

### Maintain Regular Solids Breakdown with Natural Additives

 Occasionally, introducing natural additives into your septic tank can stimulate bacterial growth and improve solids breakdown. Some homeowners use bacterial starters or enzyme products designed for septic systems. These promote efficient digestion of waste and prevent buildup.

 Always follow manufacturer instructions on these additives and consult with your septic service professional to ensure compatibility, especially for small tanks.

### Control Grease and Food Waste Disposal

 Grease and food scraps are common culprits that cause septic tanks to fill up faster. Avoid rinsing grease, cooking oils, or coffee grounds down the kitchen sink. These substances solidify and add unnecessary bulk to the tank's sludge layer.

 Instead, scrape food leftovers into the trash and collect grease in containers for disposal. This simple habit keeps your septic tank clearer and helps maintain its capacity longer.

### Regularly Inspect and Protect Drain Field Areas

 The drain field is a key part of your septic system, where treated water disperses safely into the soil. To support this function, avoid driving or parking vehicles over the drain field area, and keep heavy equipment away.

 Plant only grass above the drain field. Deep-rooted plants or trees can invade septic pipes, leading to damage and costly repairs. Maintaining proper drainage and preventing surface water pooling over this area also helps your septic system function optimally.

### Schedule Periodic Professional Inspections

 Even with excellent daily habits, it's wise to have a septic system professional inspect your small tank every 1 to 3 years. Inspections identify any early signs of clogging, leaks, or system stress before problems worsen.

 During inspections, professionals can recommend appropriate maintenance strategies customized for your specific system size and usage patterns. This proactive approach allows you to delay frequent pumping while keeping your septic tank in good health.

### Key Daily Practices to Remember

- Dispose of trash and non-biodegradable materials in the garbage, not the septic system.
- Limit water use during peak times and fix leaks promptly.
- Choose septic-safe soaps and avoid harsh chemicals.
- Keep grease, oils, and food scraps out of drains.
- Avoid driving over or constructing on the drain field.
 
 By integrating these daily habits, you can maintain a small septic tank effectively and reduce the frequency of sewage pumping. These practices ensure that your septic system remains efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective for years to come.

</div>Common Mistakes to Avoid for Prolonging the Life of Your Small Septic Tank
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding Common Pitfalls to Protect Your Small Septic Tank

If you own a small septic tank, knowing what mistakes to avoid can save you from costly repairs and frequent pumping. Proper maintenance not only protects your investment but also ensures the system functions efficiently for years. Many people unknowingly harm their septic systems through everyday habits. By recognizing these common errors, you can make smarter choices that prolong the life of your septic tank and reduce the need for frequent pumping.

### Using Excessive Water Wastes the System’s Capacity

Small septic tanks have limited volume designed to treat wastewater slowly and effectively. When you pour too much water into the system at once, it overwhelms the tank, preventing solids from settling properly. This leads to more solids entering the drain field, causing clogs and soil contamination. To avoid this, you should:

- Spread out laundry loads throughout the week instead of doing multiple loads in one day.
- Fix leaking faucets and toilets quickly to prevent constant water flow.
- Use water-efficient fixtures that reduce overall water consumption.
 
Maintaining balanced water use helps keep the tank in good condition, reducing solids buildup and the need for frequent pumping.

### Flushing Harmful Chemicals and Non-Biodegradable Items

Many people don't realize the damage caused by flushing items or pouring harsh chemicals down the drain. Your small septic tank relies on natural bacterial action to break down waste. Chemicals like bleach, solvents, and antibacterial soaps kill these helpful bacteria, slowing waste decomposition. Similarly, flushing non-biodegradable materials such as wipes, feminine hygiene products, dental floss, and cigarette butts causes blockages and slows down the system. To protect your septic tank:

- Dispose of kitchen grease and cooking oils in the trash, not down the sink.
- Avoid pouring paint, motor oil, and harsh cleaners into drains.
- Only flush human waste and toilet paper designed to decompose quickly.
 
Preserving the bacterial balance inside your septic tank is crucial to keeping solids from accumulating rapidly and extending the time between pumpings.

### Neglecting Regular Inspections and Minor Repairs

Small septic tanks benefit from routine professional inspections that catch small problems before they escalate. Many homeowners skip or delay inspections, resulting in unnoticed leaks, cracks, or clogging that damage the system. Early detection of issues such as damaged baffles, sludge buildup, or drain field problems allows for timely maintenance to prevent costly damage. Set a reminder to schedule an inspection every 1 to 3 years depending on usage, and always address any plumbing leaks immediately to avoid extra strain on your septic tank.

### Improper Landscaping Around the Septic Tank Area

Planting certain types of vegetation or placing structures near the septic tank can cause damage. Tree roots often invade pipes and the tank itself, creating blockages or cracks. Heavy vehicles parked over the septic system can compress and damage the tank or drain field. To help maintain your small septic tank:

- Plant only grass or shallow-rooted plants above and around the tank and drain field.
- Keep heavy machinery and vehicles off the septic area at all times.
- Mark the location of your septic system clearly to avoid accidental damage.
 
Cautious landscaping protects critical components and extends your system's lifespan.

### Ignoring the Impact of Household Habits

Everyday behaviors have a big influence on septic tank health. For example, overusing garbage disposals adds excessive solids to the system, increasing how often it needs pumping. Using water softeners excessively can release high levels of salt into the system, disrupting bacterial communities. Be mindful about what goes down the drain and how often you run appliances like dishwashers and washing machines. Modifying habits can reduce the load on your small septic tank and prevent sludge buildup.

### Regular Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Tank Healthy

Avoiding mistakes is one part of the equation. Implementing consistent maintenance steps will further minimize pumping frequency and extend your tank’s functioning life. Here are some expert-recommended actions:

- Have the tank pumped only when necessary, based on inspections and sludge measurements rather than on a fixed schedule.
- Use septic-safe cleaning products to protect bacterial health.
- Consider adding natural bacterial additives to boost waste breakdown.
 
Taking a proactive approach saves money and prevents unexpected failures.

Maintaining a small septic tank without frequent pumping largely depends on your daily choices and upkeep routines. Managing water use carefully, avoiding harmful substances, scheduling regular inspections, protecting the tank physically, and adjusting household habits all play vital roles. By steering clear of common mistakes, you ensure your septic system runs smoothly, providing reliable service for a much longer time.

</div>### Conclusion

Maintaining a small septic tank without frequent pumping relies on adopting effective daily habits and steering clear of common mistakes. By being mindful of what goes down your drains, reducing water waste, and regularly inspecting your system for any signs of trouble, you can significantly extend the lifespan of your septic tank. Simple actions like avoiding flushing non-biodegradable items, using water efficiently, and keeping heavy equipment off the drain field go a long way in preventing costly backups and system failures.

At the same time, understanding the pitfalls that many homeowners fall into—such as neglecting routine checks or treating the septic tank as a “set it and forget it” system—helps you safeguard your investment. Avoiding harsh chemicals and excessive grease buildup will keep your beneficial bacteria healthy, which is vital for breaking down waste naturally. These everyday choices minimize the risk of blockages and slow down sludge accumulation, reducing the need for frequent pumping.

Ultimately, taking care of a small septic tank is about being proactive and consistent. By integrating simple, sustainable habits into your daily routine and being aware of how your actions impact the system, you can enjoy a reliable and trouble-free septic system for years. This approach not only saves you money but also supports environmental health by preventing leaks and contamination. With the right care, your small septic tank can function efficiently, giving you peace of mind and a well-maintained home environment.

""Yes. We are serious. This is a new form of punishment we shall give to misbehaving students. And you three,"" Rufus glanced and his apprentices ""Just happened to have a punishment pending due to that... Stunt you held in the refectory a few days back."" His stance was firm, his voice was steady. He was certain with his decision.

So that's how the apprentices of Master Rufus ended up here, in the creatively named ""The Magical Café"". They were going to work as punishment. As bariatas. To the new café. Tamara and Call looked about ready to make the floor collapse. Aaron meanwhile was smiling sympathetically 

""Cmon guys. It isn't THAT bad"" He patted his friends backs. ""It's just working as baristas. You make coffee and serve them. What could go wrong?""

""Aaron, you just jinxed us."" Call pointed out, his eyes narrowing at his best friend. ""Plus, this means that we have to talk to other people."" he grumbled stubbornly. He wasn't a fan of people.

After a few moments of silent life questioning, Tamara sighed, grabbing her apron and tying it behind her back. ""Well, if we're gonna do this, we better do this right. Master Rufus said that we'd get another shift if our services were rated a 7 below."" A collective shudder went through the three of them.

Eventually, with a begrudging pout, Call grumbled something about ""Elementals being easier to deal with than customers"" and called divs on making the coffee. Probably for the best. Aaron was in charge of serving the drinks to customers since he was the least clumsy and he loved people. Tamara took the cashier since she knew soxial cues and how to deal with people since... Rich family requires a lot of socializing.

First hour in. It was manageable. A few students. Elementals (somehow? Neither of them knew why). And a few masters. Nothing too irritating. Until 11am. When a flood of people came in. What. The. Hell. It wasn't lunch rush yet?!

The trio stared at the growing line. Then to each other. Then back to the growing line. With a synced sigh, Call rolled up his sleeves, Tamara put on her most polite face, and Aaron rolled his shoulders. Today was gonna be busy.

Call worked efficiently, hands busy while he stared at the orders on the tablet. His hand-eye coordination was surprisingly good for a guy like him. He worked on the coffees as quickly as he could and put them on the counter for Aaron to serve. Aaron was surprisingly good at his job. He greeted customers and initiated a bit of small talk. Considering he was THE makar.. Yea, that would definitely help their reviews. Tamara was amazing at her job. She kept a polite smile and a cheerful voice. Call wondered how the hell could she do it. If it were him, he'd be drained after the first five customers.

Eventually... It was over. It was finally lunch break for them. The lunch rush was over. Tamara put up the ""On break"" sign and sat down with Call and Aaron at one of the booths. Rufus came in to check on his apprentices, who were snacking on some lichen and bologna sandwiches. With a chuckle, the master approached the wistful trio.

""So, how was your day so far?"" He asked in a dry yet teasing tone. Aaron was the first to answer.

""It was... Fine."" Though, the weary and tired look on his face said otherwise. Tamara opened her mouth next.

""It was exhausting. I never wanna do this again"" She slumped on the table, braids a mess. Call untied her braids and brushed out her hair as he answered himself.

""It was hell on earth. I got burnt by hot coffee several times."" He grumbled bitterly. Almost as bitter as pure coffee. ""I couldn't heal it because those damn orders kept coming. I am a single teenager here!"" The makar rolled his eyes while rebraiding Tamara's hair.

Rufus chuckled and sat next to Aaron then patted his back. ""You're doing a great job so far. I only hear positive things about you three from the customers. So far."" The underlying threat wasn't lost on the three apprentices.

""Anyhow. I must get going"" He stood up and dusted off his deep purple robes. ""There are still many matters to attend to. I expect to hear these stunning reviews till your shift has ended"" Then he walks out.

Call, Aaron, and Tamara looked at each other, then laughed. Yea, they could only hope those shiny reviews would stay ",1,1744691789.0,magisterium,0,1.0,False

Tha k you all for reading my post. Even tho it's not all that interesting. TLDR at the end.
 
 Also if you haven't read the first part of this post go to my profile and read it  from the beginning to get an understanding of what is going on. Thank you.
 
 So today, D-Day I call it. As I imagined/expected it to go doen hill. So this morning, 04/14/25 we got up and got ready to head to Uncle V's place. I was nervous as we got closer to his place feeling the anxiety starting to creep up.
  
We got to the trailer park they lived in and had my cousin M, aunt N's son (who drives her almost everywhere as she is physically disabled and needs a walker to get around and it's hard for her to drive anymore.)
 
 It took a bit to find their trailer but we eventually did. Thankfully, V Jr. Wasn't there. I was a little relieved but my nerves were still on edge. My aunt N, (shockingly suggested this) suggested that Uncle V2 go up and knock on the door to see if they recognized him. (Which ironically happened before with her daughter when she told me to do the dame but she didn't recognize me. Good times. Sorry I'm rambling) Anyways, my aunt C answered and she recognized him immediately. Aunt C:""V2?"" V2:""Idk, am I?""
 
  Aunt C:""Your brother's here!. Come on in. Is S with you?"" (Aunt S is my uncle V2's wife for context) 
V2:""No."" Aunt C:""How did you know where we lived?"" (White pages does wonders lol.) 
 
  V2:""N(my mom) found it."" Aunt C:""Is she here?"" She opened the door and looked outside seeing all of us. Aunt C:""Oh my gosh you guys!"" Aunt N:""Surprise!"" I was hiding behind their truck filming the incident cause I figured it would be funny if she didn't recognize him. They were shocked that everyone was here out of thr blue.
 
 We all went in the trailer. Aunt N having the most difficulty getting into the house as the steps were high and made of hardened fiberglass I'm surprised it held any weight. We all managed to get in. The trailer Aunt N having the most difficulty getting into the house as the steps were high and made of hardened fiberglass I'm surprised it held any weight. We all managed to get in. The trailer had cigarette smoke redolencing in every square inch of that place. Made my stomach churn. I've never liked the smell of cigarettes, MJ, beer etc. it makes me want to cut my nose off.

 But I dealt with it. My anxiety kept getting more heightened just cause I wasn't sure of V Jr. Was there or not or if he was coming. They talked a bit and got along surprisingly well. I was pleasantly surprised.

  We talked for about an hour almost until Aunt C said; ""we should call V over and tell him that someone came over!"" At first I was like V? What do you mean? He is right here, meaning my Uncle V. Then it hit me. OH, you mean V Jr. NOPE NOPE nope nope!

  Just hearing his name set off a huge trigger. I will give myself credit. I tried really really hard to stay there and not lose it. I looked at my mom who's face said ""uh oh/oh no."" I had to prop my arm on my face hand covering my mouth so I could keep myself from Judy completely break down crying.

 It.. sort of worked? For a moment at least. But my brain kept flashing that image of me being 8 years old and In that dark cramped closet with his huge heavy frame blocking almost all of the light that came through the doorway. My imagination can be... very vivid and sometimes a curse as it can runaway with me a lot.

 I started to silently cry I looked at my mom I saw she was ""talking"" to Aunt N eith her eyed and small hand movements getting her attention to me as she saw me  reacting like that. I didn't see her face or anything as I didn't want to let my uncles know what was happening and cause a scene. I looked back at my mom as my anxiety built more and more I silently 

 Tho, almost lost it had tears streaming down my face and my mom nodded to the door mouthing I could go. I grabbed my car keys and without a word got up and walked out almost running to my car. I got in, sobbing. 

 I saw my cousin M come out, I guess to check on me, but I had backed out went doen the culdasack and turned around and rolled my window down and just told him i was going back to the hotel. He nodded. My Cousin M is a man of few words, very quiet and reserved but I really  appreciate him coming out to check on me.  My other uncles and aunt didn't seem to notice that I left. Which was fine. 

 I didn't want to cause a scene. Whr. I left I cried and sobbed all the eay back to my hotel room. I kind of got lost as my Google maps couldn't pick which direction it was sending me.

  I managed to finally get there. I went inside and just broke down. My room felt so dark I had to turn on all the lights to just help calm my sanity. It took a good 15-20 minutes to calm down enough. 
 
 I texted my mom hoe long they would be.  And if they were gon a be a bit I'd just go eat lunch. She said she wasn't  sure and to just go-ahead and eat. So I did.
 
 I left all the lights on and went to Dairy Queen that I hadn't had in ages. I seriously needed some comfort food. I got the chicken strip basket and a large chocolate dipped cone. (I was not prepared on how BIG that sucker would be but dang it felt so nice to eat it.

 I know food is never a good thing to rely on when stressed and such, but I didn't know what else to do to help calm me down as well frankly it's all I know. I'm not like 600 lbs or anything but I'm not skinny by any means. But I am trying to lose slowly but surly. It'd never been an easy road for me. But I keep trying. 

 Anyways I got back and ate my food and watched dome cartoons and Joce Bedard. And after I finished lunch. Texted my mom saying if I didn't answer I fell asleep. 
And to not freak out. She said they were actually on their way back. Uncle V and Uncle V2 went to Uncle V's Dr appointment and my mom rode back with Aunt N and cousin M.
 
 So I didn't have to pick her up. I was thankful as I REEEALLLY didn't want to go back to that house. Especially if I didn't know if he was still there or not.
 
 A few minutes later my mom came knocking on the door and came into grab some stuff ad she was going to go to Aunt N and Cousin M's room to talk and chat.
 
 When she left I dozed off for a bit till Uncle V2 came back to the room afte the room. I fell back asleep till about 7 and my Uncle V2 had hit the hay already. He, my mom and I shared a room as well were poor. He has his own bed and my mom and I shared one.

  He's an EXTREMELY light sleeper not a dead asleep sleeper like me, my mom and dad are. So I asked my mom if wr could go to Walmart to get some shopping done and to tell me what all went down when I left.
 
 We left and I felt like I could actually move around and talk as I couldn't while my uncle was sleeping. I mean it's fine I can watch vids on my phone with my headphones and not wake him I'm just not use to having to tip toe and be as quiet as a mouse as to not wake him
 
 Anyways we went to Walmart and just parked and stayed in the car. She had said that it went surprisingly well! Which can only be by the Grace of God as it is almost UNHEARD of them getting along eith no arguing and fighting.

 So praise God for that! There was some hurt that was let out in the open. Apologies said. And forgiveness. And a lot of mending of family bonds. I'm happy my moms family is on the road of healing.    

 But it is going to be a VERY LONG hard road. I'm not sure if aunt N and Uncle V2 will stay in touch after this and actually talk, but they've at least played nice on this trip so far.
 
 Now to cousin V Jr. After all of that he had came after the talking and such. And was surprised to see everyone etc. But he didn't stay long and after chatting he left to pick up his kid and go to work. Yes, he has a kid. Not sure how old or how many he has.
 
 But tomorrow the plan is to go get breakfast. I asked my mom if HE would be there and she said more than likely. She said I didn't have to sit near him, but I told her of my reaction was so strong just by hearing his name and that he was coming. Having him in the same building as me was not going to be any better and that it may be even worse.
 
 She understood, tho sad I won't be there, but she understands. Which I'm thakful for. She's been my rock through a lot of hard times in my life. Especially when I have complete breakdowns/meltdowns. I'm glad she's my mom.

 I hope and pray that tomorrow goes OK while I'm not there. We shall see how it goes. But I'm gonna be elsewhere and have Starbucks for breakfast. In the small town I'm in their isn't much in the way of stores or coffee shops. We don't have walmart, Safeway, city market etc. No Starbucks. Which sucks as I like their coffee even tho it costs like 10+ bucks for one large coffee. 

 Anyways, thank you all for reading and taking time our of your day to read a snippet of my life and to hear me ramble. Sorry if I did I tend to go on rabbit trails a lot. 😅 
 
 I'll update tomorrow and let yall know what happened God bless.

 TLDR: I tried to go to my uncles house and stay, but when mu cousin V Jr. Was mentioned I left and had a breakdown, but my mom's side of thr family's family bonds are slowly starting to heal and mend so aside from that it was a good day. Tomorrow we shall see what happens at breakfast. I'll post an update tomorrow. Thanks for reading.",0,1744691600.0,AITAH,6,0.33,False

They were always ""joined at the hip"" and even joked about getting surgery to make it possible. Both had dreams and desires that only they could fulfill, and only accomplished together.  They bought a house, a new car, a nice couch, and even a brand new tv for the games. No matter what, they always had each other despite the hardships and luck. But Edgar never really wanted to be an accountant, and didn't want a future of calculating all day long. Those clients of his never gave him a break, not even the big boss as well. Sometimes we would visit the bathroom just to see a picture of his lovely wife, Melly. It was a reminder of how she used to be, and what times have been. Edgar also made tally marks on the back of the photo from the first time the funeral home first laid her tombstone in the ground. She didn't make it since her fatal injuries prevented her from breathing for a few days after the accident by the house. Edgar never got to make up after the argument the two had before the crash, to say their marriage and love was useless and jaded. Maybe someday he could visit the grave site and say it one last time. Edgar took too long, and there were four hard knocks on the bathroom door. Time to get back to work, the big boss wanted him to accept overtime for him.

1jzj15g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1jzj15g/aio_about_if_my_husband_got_a_blow_job/,AIO about if my husband got a blow job?,"So 2 years ago I went to print something off my husband’s computer. He left his chats open. I read it.

He was chatting with a random girl. No sexting. But the worst thing he had said was how she was very sexy and he was turned on by her (and said he had a hard on cause it was morning wood).

I saved the phone number of the girl. Then I confronted my husband about it and he said how he met her on Bumble online app. Said he only met her once for coffee at random cafe. That was it.

I knew it didnt make sense so I called the girl. Told her I was the wife and how my husband was cheating on me with her. She had no idea and she told me everything and even sent me the full chat history of them talking.

She said: they met on bumble dating, they went on a date to Niagara falls around 7pm and came home 2am. Said they just drank and played some games. Held hands, he kissed her on the cheek NOT lips (I asked). She said he was very into her though and if she had asked to get a hotel she thinks he would have said yes. She said nothing else happened besides that and she had no idea he was married and was sorry this happened. She seemed genuine.

Anyways we went through therapy. I stayed with him cause I just had a baby then. He said he was sorry and did individual therapy also. He “swore on his parents life that was it and nothing more happened and there were no more girls”

Now fast forward 4 years. I am pregnant right now. My husband lied to me about something small. I knew he was lying. And even though he knew he was lying he said he swore his parents life!!

So now I am spiralling. If he can swear on his parents life and lie now then what if he did back then?

I brought the topic up. We discussed it. He swears again there is literally nothing else that happened at all!

So I asked him, what if I didnt catch him like 2 weeks of him speaking to this girl and how far would it have gone? He said he thinks it would have faded off, he loves me, he just wanted attention and that was it. It meant nothing.

So I asked - would you have had sex with her? And he said NO I WOULD NOT! So I asked, would he let her give him a blow job? And he paused and thought about it and said I DONT KNOW, IM NOT SURE, MAYBE? And I was shocked!!! And he said IM JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST! I DONT THINK SO.
And I asked if he would go down on her? And he said NO I WOULDNT DO THAT.

So now its in my head
Did he actually get a blow job from the girl that night? Hence why he paused to answer?
Also, the girl told me nothing happened besides hand holding + cheek kiss, but do you think she was just embarrassed to say she gave him a blow job? Or did it actually not happen?

My husband “swore on everything in his life and even on the child I am pregnant with that he never for a blow job or anything like that from her”

I dont know. AIO? Just overthinking?
I dont want to blow up my marriage with kids involved over a thing that never happened

1jziyzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jziyzk/social_media_games/,Social media games,"I’m looking for some opinions on a situation with my ex.  She had gotten out of a 10 year relationship in October 2024 and a month long fling in December.  Both guys were narcissists and cheated on her.  She’d text me all day every day and call me almost every night after a month for two hours each time.  We broke up 2/28, dated for two months, and she said I did nothing wrong to earn this.  She just wanted to be single, that she felt pressure to meet my parents (I told her she could say no multiple times), the number of sayings I had paused was a turn off, and that she didn’t want to feel guilty not communicating with me like she had done the last week of our relationship.  

I went in to no contact and she reached out for a few days but then stopped replying to my replies and started just responding to my stories or sending me a meme late at night. She started posting on her Instagram story looking like she was having a great time.  Massages, her coffees, out with friends, gym pics she’d send me usually, and Bible verses about looking to the future and not dwelling on the past.  She started seeing someone almost a week after our breakup.  She copied the scenery of one of my stories on a bridge the next day after I posted it.  She put the song “so long honey” by Caamp on the story.  A few days after that she posted him on her private story with a white heart above her head and it was at her company’s social event and her friends didn’t even know about me until a month into us dating.  She didn’t tag him though.  Then she posted an inside joke between us on her private story the next day.  A few days later she started posting love songs.  A few days later she copied the exact same story a girl I started following 2 days before on her story on the same day the other girl posted it.  She kept posting bible verses about the future and love songs.  I reached out to her 3/31 just to see how she was doing.  She replied and was talkative but did nothing to further the conversation so I ended it after she waited 16 hours to respond.  She posted a story a few days later with th flowers I got her for Valentine’s Day still on her desk (they last for 3 years).  Friday I unpaused the dating app we met on finally.  Saturday I copied her bridge post that she copied from me.  Yesterday she posted on her private story the orioles game they went to but didn’t show him or tag him.  She’s been watching all of my stories almost as soon as they’re posted.  First 20 people usually.  Today she unfollowed me on Instagram and removed me as a follower but didn’t block me and didn’t remove me off Facebook.  

I get the sense she’s hoping I react and sending me subtle messages that she’s watching what I’m doing.  What are your opinions on this behavior?  What do you think she’s trying to convey or achieve by acting like this?  ",1,1744690738.0,BreakUps,13,1.0,False
