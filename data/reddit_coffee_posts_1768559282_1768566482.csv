1qeekjw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeekjw,STUB FROTH: RUNNING VENEZUELA — Day Fourteen — THE BOOKS WON’T CLOSE,"THE BOOKS WON’T CLOSE

*January 16, 2026 — 7:07 AM ET*

This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

It’s going to be freezing across the country today.

People will wake up late. Coffee will sit longer. The house will feel quieter than it should. Phones will get checked not because anything happened overnight, but because cold has a way of pulling attention inward. When the weather traps the body, the mind goes looking for something to make sense of the stillness.

This is the right day to say this plainly:

What’s happening in Venezuela isn’t about oil, democracy, or empire.  
It’s about the moment the books stopped closing — and everyone in charge realized it at the same time.

We keep talking about “running” Venezuela as if that sentence explains something. It doesn’t. It distracts. Running a country is theater. What’s actually happening is quieter, colder, and far more unsettling.

Someone is trying to reconstruct a balance sheet that no longer balances.

And they’re doing it without admitting that the loss of visibility — not ideology — is the emergency.

*“For decades, power meant knowing where the money was. Now it means knowing who might know.” —* *Stub Froth*

Venezuela exported oil at scale for twenty years. That should have produced something durable. A fund. A reserve. A traceable accumulation of sovereign wealth. Instead, there’s a void where certainty should be. Gold disputes. Frozen accounts. Sanctions-era opacity. Rumors of assets that never consolidate into a number anyone will stand behind.

That isn’t theft in the cinematic sense.  
That’s dispersion.

Value didn’t disappear. It scattered.

Oil sold at discount. Intermediaries inserted. Payments rerouted. Settlement pushed off the dollar. Custody fragmented across jurisdictions, shells, proxies, and — yes — digital rails that don’t need a flag to move.

The mistake is thinking this was clever.  
It was adaptive.

And adaptation at scale has a cost: eventually, nobody knows the full picture anymore.

*“When value escapes its paperwork, the panic doesn’t come from loss — it comes from not knowing who can pull the trigger.”* — *Stub Froth*

That’s why the operation moved fast. Not because Washington was confident — but because optionality was closing. When uncertainty reaches a certain density, delay becomes risk. And risk that can’t be bounded is the one thing capital refuses to tolerate.

So force was used. Then paperwork. Then custody. Then silence.

Each phase wasn’t escalation. It was containment.

Drugs justified the raid.  
Oil justified the stay.  
Stability justified supervision.  
Contractors justified deniability.

None of it explains the urgency on its own. Together, they explain a system trying to hold something still long enough to inventory it without triggering a confidence event.

This isn’t conquest.  
It’s recovery — of information.

*“When the state starts guarding assets it can’t fully inventory, sovereignty has already failed — just not where you think.” —* *Stub Froth*

Notice what hasn’t happened. There’s been no definitive denial of the asset rumors. No confirmation either. Just calibrated quiet. That silence isn’t emptiness. It’s leverage preservation. It buys time while institutions decide what they can safely acknowledge without shaking markets that now treat rumor as data.

That’s the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say:

Belief moves faster than facts now.

A large, poorly documented pool of value doesn’t need to move to do damage. It only needs to be believed capable of moving. In a financial system stitched together by confidence, that belief alone can pressure ETFs, funds, pensions, counterparties — all downstream from assets we pretend are just “another class.”

They aren’t. Not yet.

*“A secret fortune isn’t wealth. It’s a hostage situation with a price chart.”* — *Stub Froth*

So the response isn’t transparency. It’s custody.  
Not truth. Not reconciliation. Not closure.

Escrow.

Escrow is what you use when ownership is contested, records are incomplete, and time is your only remaining ally. You don’t resolve. You hold. You supervise. You protect the perimeter while pretending you’re rebuilding the house.

That’s why contractors matter. Not because they’re sinister — but because they’re accountable to invoices, not voters. They’re the bridge between force and finance, between control and plausible distance. Soldiers raise flags. Contractors guard processes.

And processes don’t answer questions.

*“Empire doesn’t announce itself anymore. It files.”* — *Stub Froth*

This is where the public gets restless. They want morality. They want villains. They want clarity. Instead, they’re getting management. Metrics. Committees. Reviews. A slow replacement of visible decision-making with administrative momentum that doesn’t need permission to continue.

It feels boring. That’s the danger.

Because boring is how systems normalize before they harden.

What makes this moment different isn’t what was done to Venezuela. It’s what it revealed about everyone else. States no longer fully control the value they generate. They chase it after the fact. Sanctions don’t stop flows — they reroute them. Enforcement doesn’t eliminate risk — it displaces it into places nobody fully governs.

So now power is improvising. Guarding. Supervising. Hoping to reconstruct a ledger before someone else forces it open in public.

*“The most dangerous sentence in geopolitics isn’t ‘we’re going to war.’ It’s ‘this should be straightforward.’”* — *Stub Froth*

On a freezing Friday, with people home and scrolling, this is the thing worth sitting with:

This isn’t about Venezuela.  
It’s about a world where no one can close the books anymore — and everyone is pretending that’s temporary.

It isn’t.

The cold outside will pass.  
The silence won’t.

Because once value escapes its paperwork, power doesn’t get to reset the system.

It only gets to manage the fallout.

And right now, that’s exactly what we’re watching.

1qeej7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/app_dev_ai/comments/1qeej7n/the_agentfirst_interface_rethinking_apis_for/,"The ""Agent-First"" Interface: Rethinking APIs for Machine Consumers","In the past, APIs were built for humans to read and machines to execute. In 2026, the paradigm has flipped. With the explosion of autonomous AI agents, the most critical ""user"" of your API is no longer a developer with a cup of coffee, but an LLM-based agent seeking to complete a multi-step task.

This shift toward **Agentic Experience (AX)** is transforming API development from a static delivery mechanism into a dynamic, conversational exchange.^(1)



# From Human-Readable to Agent-Actionable

Traditional REST APIs rely on rigid documentation that humans interpret to write code. Today, the rise of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and AI-ready schemas is removing the middleman.

# 1. The Death of the ""Developer Portal""?

Standard portals are being replaced by **AI-accessible Knowledge Centers**.^(2) Instead of just hosting a Swagger UI, 2026-era backends publish metadata specifically designed for LLMs to ingest.



* **Semantic Descriptions:** Every endpoint now includes ""intent metadata""—rich natural language descriptions that tell an agent *why* it should call a specific function.
* **Sequence Mapping:** APIs now describe ""common workflows"" (e.g., ""To process a refund, call A, then B, then C"") so agents can plan multi-step actions without trial-and-error.

# 2. Adaptive Schemas and Mutable Flows

We are seeing the early success of **Mutable AI Flows**. Unlike the hard-coded logic of 2020, modern APIs can adapt their responses based on the agent's context. If an agent identifies itself as a ""Financial Auditor,"" the API might automatically include additional compliance metadata in the JSON payload that a standard ""User"" agent wouldn't receive.

# The Rise of ""Just-in-Time"" Infrastructure

The combination of AI code generation and serverless technology has given birth to **Ephemeral APIs**.

|**Concept**|**Traditional API (2022)**|**AI-Driven API (2026)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Provisioning**|Permanent servers/clusters.|JIT (Just-in-Time) serverless instances.|
|**Code Base**|Static, versioned repository.|AI-generated ""edge functions"" on demand.|
|**Integrations**|Manual OAuth/Key exchange.|MCP-based ""handshake"" and discovery.|
|**Scaling**|Reactive (based on CPU/RAM).|Predictive (AI anticipates task load).|

Platforms like **DigitalAPI** and **Kuberns** now allow developers to deploy from an LLM prompt directly to a global edge network in one click, with AI-driven scaling that adjusts based on real-world usage patterns rather than simple traffic spikes.^(3)



# Security in the Age of Autonomy

As agents move from simple ""GET"" requests to high-value ""POST"" and ""DELETE"" actions, the risk of **Indeterministic Failure** increases. In 2026, security is no longer a firewall; it is a **Governance Layer**.

* **Audit Trails for Agents:** Every action taken by an AI agent is logged with the specific ""thought chain"" that led to the API call. This allows for forensic debugging of *why* an AI decided to delete a record.
* **Identity Delegation:** We use advanced scoping where a human grants an agent a ""temporary lease"" of authority. The agent doesn't ""own"" the API key; it borrows a cryptographic slice of the human's permissions.
* **Hallucination Filters:** Gateways now use smaller, specialized models to ""lint"" incoming agent requests, ensuring the payload structure isn't a hallucination before it ever hits the database.

# The New Developer Skillset: Prompt Architect

If the AI is generating the code and the agents are consuming the endpoints, what does the human developer do? They become **Prompt Architects** and **System Governors**.

1qeehcx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeehcx,"Private Nature Escape at Kenaray Farmstay, Kaeng Krachan","Kenaray Farmstay is a resort in Kaeng Krachan , Petchaburi that truly stands out for its exceptional privacy. This was my fifth visit, and the feeling was no different from the first time — except for the exciting addition of a new room type, Tucan, which is absolutely perfect for families.

It’s a large two-story wooden house with a Jacuzzi filled with mineral water — yes, you read that right, mineral water, not saltwater or anything else. The house is fully equipped with everything you could need: a PlayStation 5 with two controllers, a large TV, B&O sound system, and even Smeg appliances such as a kettle and toaster.

This was the first time I felt completely entertained without even going down to the river. The mineral pool, mountain views, lush greenery, and even toucan birds were more than enough. Around the house, peacocks freely wander about and sometimes even fly into the house to say hi. They’re not afraid of people — just don’t startle them.

Breakfast here is already known to be the best. The spread includes a full set of Thai desserts, grilled pork with sticky rice, pan-fried eggs, deep-fried dough sticks (pa thong ko), a generous salad bar, and rice porridge. If you’re still hungry, you can always ask for more.

The weather during this season is wonderful — cool and comfortable. If you love peace and quiet, this place comes highly recommended. It’s only about a 2.5-hour drive from Bangkok.

Safety is not a concern, as the resort clearly separates overnight guests from café visitors. There is a gated entrance with staff assisting access, so you don’t need to worry about strangers entering the property.

The resort also has a café at the front. Coffee lovers will be delighted with many choices of light and medium roasts. The desserts are all delicious. Whenever you visit Kaeng Krachan, even if you’re not staying overnight, you should definitely stop by and try the Toffee Nut and Crème Brûlée — if they’re not good, feel free to come back and comment!

💕 What impressed me the most is the local team: polite, friendly, attentive, highly informative, and truly service-minded. As someone working in the hospitality industry, I can confidently say they consistently maintain excellent standards every single visit.

🌎 Wi-Fi: Free Wi-Fi available 📞 Mobile Signal: All major networks work well — no signal issues

🗣️ Stay Recommendations 
💘 For peace and privacy: weekdays are best. 💘 For a lively atmosphere: weekends and public holidays (book in advance — rooms fill up quickly). 
💘 Not recommended for those who dislike animals, as many animals roam freely and birds often fly around the houses. 
💘 Families with young children should understand the natural environment — children must not chase the peacocks. 
💘 Cooking and camping are not allowed.

🎯 Resort Highlights & Activities 

🌸 River floating (recommended for strong swimmers, with staff supervision) 
🌸 White-water rafting (safe, guided, fun for all ages) 
🌸 Phanoen Thung mountain trip (beautiful views, cool weather — bring a windbreaker) 
🌸 Paddle boarding (new activity) 
🌸 Swimming in front of the resort (life jacket recommended)

❗ Safety Note: Always wear a life jacket for water activities, as some currents can be strong.

🏊 What to Prepare: Waterproof phone pouch / water shoes / sun hat

💰 Price Range: Approximately 4,000–11,000 THB++ (depending on season and room type) 📍 Location: Kenaray Farmstay

We’ve been together a little over two years and moved in together last year. Overall, things are good. Not perfect, but good.

We’re pretty casual about sharing things. Not in a “what’s mine is yours forever” way, but more like… if you need a little milk, or a snack here and there, it’s fine. We don’t really talk about it. It just kind of happens.

Last week, I came home late from work. I was tired, hungry, and honestly a little cranky. I opened the fridge and saw a strawberry yogurt. My favorite. I knew immediately it was Jess’s. Mine were gone. I stood there for a second, fridge door open, just staring at it. I told myself I’d replace it the next day.

I ate it.

The next morning, Jess was in the kitchen, looking through the fridge.

“Hey,” she said, still looking inside. “Did you eat my yogurt?”

There was a pause. I said yes and told her I’d buy her another one after work. She nodded and said, “Okay,” but the vibe felt off. Quieter than usual.

A few days later, I noticed she’d been using my coffee pods. Not one or two. Like, a lot of them. I didn’t say anything at first. I felt weird bringing it up after the yogurt thing.

But then I bought a new box, and within a couple of days, half of them were gone. That night, I brought it up.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound calm. “Can you not use my coffee pods? They’re kind of expensive.”

She looked at me, surprised. “Oh. I thought we shared stuff like that.”

I said, “Not really. I mean, small things sometimes, but these add up.”

There was this awkward silence. She crossed her arms and said, “You literally ate my food the other day.”

I felt embarrassed. I said, “I know. And I replaced it.”

She shrugged. “It just feels kind of unfair.”

I didn’t know what to say. I stood there holding my mug, wishing I’d waited or chosen different words. I finally said, “I just want us to ask first.”

She said, “Fine,” but not warmly, and went to the bedroom.

Since then, things have been… polite. Short conversations. No hanging out on the couch like usual. I keep thinking maybe I was too nitpicky, or maybe I shouldn’t have said anything at all, especially after eating her yogurt.

Update 3 on my first post about my husband. It’s a long one so I made a separate post.  (And little reminder that English is not my first language) I am not sure if anyone will read this but here we go. 

In my first post I (34F) found multiple numbers on my husband’s (38M) phone. We had a rough year with his overseas business trips and young children that we are raising without any help or family in the country where I moved to be with my husband. Plus some financial and legal issues on top of that made this year the hardest yet. I found few chats with women on his phone located in that city that he often travels. So, few months into our conversations and trial for the marriage counseling he told me that he did it (only coffee dates) for two reasons: 1. It took off all the stress taking about nothing to people who don’t know him and 2. Why young and beautiful women? Because he liked to reject them when they obviously like him. Because back in the days when he was young student pr unemployed, poor and overweight no one wanted to talk to him and he has been rejected but now they see him in his prime and it’s different. 

He realizes how bad it’s sounds and why he became so bitter to strangers so much so that he was ready to waste their time. I still have questions about it, his character and his thoughts about women in general. 

Of course he says that “you are different! You are the only one who saw me for me. You are my wife and a mother of our children”. 

I was ready to listen for the kids and later because I was little changes and his determination to change things for our family. I guess we will see…

For those who will not be happy that I did not leave him. Let me tell you that I am being smart this time and saving on the side, exploring my options with jobs in this country and I am starting new course this year, once both kids are in school. So I am definitely building myself up and not just trusting and giving all my life to one person. 

Thank you everyone who gave their thoughts and advice. Your comments and stories gave me a lot of ideas and more than anything gave me confidence that I can do anything. Even if I am on other side of the world, without connections , experience, without any family or support. Stranger to n the internet can give this support sometimes.

It was a random Tuesday. I was sitting alone in a café, pretending to work, when she asked if she could share my table because the place was full. I said yes without looking up. When I finally did, she smiled like we already knew each other.
We talked for an hour. About nothing important. Music. Bad jobs. How life never turns out the way you plan. When she left, she waved and said, “See you around.” I didn’t think I would.
But I did.
She became a regular part of my routine. Coffee turned into walks. Walks turned into late-night texts. Late-night texts turned into the kind of conversations you only have when you feel safe with someone.
She told me about her long relationship that had slowly faded but never fully ended. I told her about my fear of starting over again. We both said we weren’t ready for something serious.
We lied.
It happened quietly. No big confession. No dramatic kiss in the rain. Just a moment where our hands touched and neither of us pulled away.
Being with her felt easy. Real. Like breathing. We laughed about stupid things. We argued softly. We learned each other’s habits—how she needed music to fall asleep, how I needed silence when I was overwhelmed.
But reality has a way of catching up.
She still had unfinished chapters in her life. I had responsibilities I couldn’t drop. We never fought about love—we fought about timing.
One night, she came over and didn’t take her coat off. That’s how I knew.
“I love you,” she said, crying. “But I can’t do this right now.”
I nodded like I understood. Like it didn’t break me.
We didn’t block each other. We didn’t hate each other. We just… stopped being part of each other’s daily lives. And somehow that hurt more.
Months passed.
I’d think of her when I heard certain songs. When I passed that café. When my phone buzzed and for a split second I hoped it was her.
Last week, I ran into her again.
She looked happy. Different. At peace. We hugged a little too long. Talked a little too carefully. When we said goodbye, she smiled and said, “I’m really glad you’re doing well.”
So was I.
But as I walked away, I realized something that still sits heavy in my chest:
Sometimes, you don’t lose people because the love isn’t strong enough.
You lose them because life doesn’t wait until you’re ready.
And even though I don’t regret loving her…

For years, our breakroom had a simple, reliable drip coffee maker. It was stained brown, smelled vaguely of burnt plastic, and brewed a sludge that could strip paint off a Buick. But it worked. You pressed a button, and hot caffeine came out. It was honest.

Then, management decided we needed to elevate the employee experience.

On Monday morning, the old machine was gone. In its place stood The Obelisk. It was a sleek, matte-black chrome tower named the *Barista-Bot 4000*. It had a 12-inch touchscreen, Wi-Fi capability, and according to the manual, 

It learns what you like, my manager, Dave, said, beaming as if he’d just discovered fire. It connects to the cloud.

Dave, I said. I just want black coffee. Why does my coffee maker need to be on the cloud? Is it uploading my caffeine dependency to the NSA?

Don't be a Luddite, Dave said, tapping the screen.

The trouble began immediately. The *Barista-Bot 4000* didn't just have buttons; it had a User Agreement. I am not joking. Before you could brew a simple espresso, you had to scroll through 40 pages of Terms and Conditions on the tiny screen and hit I Accept.

By 9:15 AM, the line for coffee stretched into the hallway. The IT guy, Kevin, was at the front, arguing with the machine.

It’s asking for a firmware update! Kevin shouted. Who puts firmware on a kettle?!

Just unplug it and plug it back in! someone yelled from the back.

I tried! Kevin yelled back. It says it’s Calibrating the extraction matrix. It’s been at 99% for ten minutes!

At 10:00 AM, the withdrawal headaches set in. The office was silent, save for the hum of the Obelisk and the tapping of impatient feet.

At 10:30 AM, the machine finally woke up. But it had locked nearly all the options. 'Latte', 'Cappuccino', and 'Americano' were greyed out. The only available option was 'Hot Water' and something called 'The Executive Blend.

Desperate, I stepped up and selected The Executive Blend.

The machine whirred. It hissed. Lights flashed like a disco in a server room. A robotic voice announced, *Please present QR code for verification.*

Verification? I whispered. I just want a bean juice.

It turns out, 'The Executive Blend' was reserved for... executives. The machine had facial recognition. It scanned my face, paused for a humiliating three seconds, and flashed a red ACCESS DENIED on the screen. It then dispensed a small cup of lukewarm water and turned itself off to conserve energy.

The revolt was swift.

I won't say who did it, but by Tuesday morning, The Obelisk had been pushed into the supply closet. On the counter sat the old, stained drip machine, rescued from the dumpster like a war hero returning home.

We never spoke of the *Barista-Bot* again. Though sometimes, when I walk past the supply closet, I swear I can hear it in the dark, beeping softly, trying to connect to the Wi-Fi to update its terms of service.",1,1768565077.0,story,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation.
I’ve been into coffee for a long time, mostly through local barista friends who work with proper, high-end espresso machines. Eventually I decided to stop relying on cafés and try making espresso at home.
So I saw an advertisement about a Newal machine (Turkish brand, I think). It cost around $150, which is a bit high for me since I’m a last-year college student and I feel scammed. The machine itself is brand new, but clearly on the budget side.
Because I already had some experience with good espresso, I tried to “work with what I have” and improve the setup. I bought a grinder, scale, WDT tool, and other accessories. those upgrades ended up costing more than the machine itself (nearly $200).
The results were… acceptable, but nowhere near what I was aiming for. That already made me feel like I wasted money.
Recently, I decided to ditch the pressurized portafilter and go for a bottomless portafilter to really learn extraction. I bought an expensive one (with a tamper), and the seller assured me it would fit my machine.
It didn’t.
Despite ordering the “correct” size, it simply won’t lock into the group head. At this point, I'm honestly pissed off. This whole thing feels like a complete money sink. I tried to do everything right, spent more and more cash, and now I'm stuck because the machine itself is apparently some non-standard, poorly designed bullshit that doesn't even accept normal portafilters.

I'm seriously starting to think this machine is just cheap, garbage with zero upgrade path, and I'm furious that I didn't realize this earlier.",1,1768565020.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

So I've noticed something interesting: every time my Chinese class is about to end, my students fall into this subtle awkwardness. Later I realized why—they don't know how to politely end a conversation in spoken Chinese.

So to help you avoid similar situations, let me share some common phrases today.



**你先忙 nǐ xiān máng,** literally means ""you go ahead and be busy first"".

It basically means ""I won't take up any more of your time."" You can use it whether they're actually busy or not—it's just a polite way to bounce.

* A: 我得走了，等下还有个会。Wǒ děi zǒu le, děng xià hái yǒu gè huì.
   * I gotta go, I have another meeting later.
* B: 好，那你先忙！我晚点再找你。Hǎo, nà nǐ xiān máng! Wǒ wǎn diǎn zài zhǎo nǐ.
   * Okay, you go ahead! I'll reach out to you later.



**回头聊 huí tóu liáo** and **改天再聊 gǎi tiān zài liáo,** mean ""Let's talk later or another day"".

回头聊 is casual and friendly, while 改天再聊 is slightly more formal. They can both work as either a genuine ""let's reschedule"" or a polite brush-off, depending on your tone.

* A: 他们喊我去吃饭了，咱们回头聊！Tā men hǎn wǒ qù chī fàn le, zán men huí tóu liáo!
   * They're calling me to eat now, let's talk later!
* B: 好的，那改天再聊吧！Hǎo de, nà gǎi tiān zài liáo ba!
   * Okay, let's chat another day!

  
**不打扰你了 bù dǎ rǎo nǐ le,** literally means ""I won't disturb you anymore."" This is super polite and shows you're aware you've taken up someone's time. It's great for professional settings or when you want to sound extra considerate to someone senior.

* A: 谢谢老师，那我不打扰你了。Xiè xie lǎo shī, nà wǒ bù dǎ rǎo nǐ le.
   * Thank you, teacher. I won't take up any more of your time.
* B: 没事，有不懂的地方随时找我。Méi shì, yǒu bù dǒng de dì fang suí shí zhǎo wǒ.
   * No problem, feel free to reach out if you have any questions.



**先这样 xiān zhè yàng**, means ""let's leave it at this for now"". Use this when you've reached a conclusion or there's nothing more to say. Short, clear, polite.

* A: 那先这样吧？咱们保持联系。Nà xiān zhè yàng ba? Zán men bǎo chí lián xì.
   * Let's leave it here for now? Let's keep in touch.
* B: 好呀，改天我请你喝咖啡！Hǎo ya, gǎi tiān wǒ qǐng nǐ hē kā fēi!
   * Sure! Coffee's on me some other day!



I guess these are enough for you to use! And you know what? You can even stack them to sound extra smooth and polite!

Finally, have you noticed that in some examples, there's often a **那 (nà)** before these phrases? Do you know what it's used for? Drop your thoughts in the comments!",1,1768564987.0,ChineseLanguage,1,0.67,False
1qee538,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1qee538/day_5_suggestions/,Day 5 - suggestions,"First and foremost, this group has helped me a lot thus far. Thank you.

I had been smoking 10 cigs a day (Marlboro Gold) before turning to Zyn/Velo in late 2024. There was an intermittent 3 months where I had no nic and I remember that quitting cigs was surprisingly easy, I was maybe irritated for a day or two and then everything was fine. Well, that's not the case with pouches..

My work is incredibly stressful so I did what every addict I know failed to realize - I associated the use of pouches with getting relief from stress and made it into a ritual. What started with 3-5 pouches a day of 3mg nic pouches quickly turned into 10 pouches of 6mg or 9mg. I decided to quit Zyns on 10 January 2026 after realizing that I devoured an entire can in a single day when I did not even have any work done or any stress factor as a matter of fact... Kinda kicked in that it's not normal to be constantly on nic on a bare average day.

I went cold turkey and until today I thought I had it going fine. Days 1-2 felt weird, nothing extraordinary, day 3 was a bit worse. However all hell broke loose on day 4 and today on day 5 for me. I said to myself and read that days 3-4 are by far the most challenging but god damn I did not expect this shit to be this hard. Constant brain fog, completely fucked up sleeping schedule for the last 2 days but worst of all is the feeling of being extremely demotivated. If I could I would just sleep all day or rot on the couch playing video games. I am also super anxious for whatever reason and of course a nightmare to talk to in the morning as I am irritated af.

I am sharing this because the temptation is crazy and maybe someone walking the same path as I do might find relief that they are not alone. Also I am looking for advice on how to continue as today has been absolutely hellish...

What has helped me thus far: 

1. chewing gums (constantly, to fight off cravings emerging from oral fixation). I choose very minty ones. 

2. LOTS of water/tea/coffee. I am mindful of the caffeine though. 

3. Exercising - I tried working out every day (weights + cardio). It has helped me immensely, the winter weather where I live does not help much but I try my best.

4. Zero alcohol and NA beers - I am doing the dry January challenge as well and NA beers helped tremendously.

What has NOT helped me:

1. Caffeine pouches - absolutely horrid taste, just as bad for your gums as Zyns

2. The 15/30-min. rule - I read that when you have an insane craving you need to allow yourself 15/30 mins to see whether you still feel it. I get the logic behind it but it did not work for me at all. As a matter of fact, it only made me think about nics even more. Stopped it after day 2.

  
Those who managed to quit or are further into the progress what helps on day 5? When will it start to get better?

1qee2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qee2zo/sockie/,Sockie,"April 4th, 1991 was when I learned that listening too well can hurt you.

Sometimes they forgot I was there. I learned not to remind them.

Our house looked normal from the street. Small yard. Cracked driveway. A tree that dropped its leaves early every year. The paint on the porch railings peeled in thin strips like it couldn’t hold on.

Inside, everything felt close. Like the rooms kept air in their corners. Even with the windows open, the air didn’t move the way it should. Sounds stayed longer than they needed to.

When I walked through rooms, I learned how to walk like I wasn’t there.

Not fast. Not loud. Not in anyone’s way.

If you move like you belong, people notice. If you move like you don’t, people step around you.

I noticed patterns before I noticed people. That was the first thing that felt like it belonged to me. I noticed which floorboard squeaked and which didn’t. I noticed the exact sound the kettle made right before it screamed. I noticed how long it took for the refrigerator light to turn off after you shut the door.

I noticed how long it took for my parents’ faces to turn away from me.

I learned to breathe quietly.

Sometimes I practiced it on purpose. In through my nose. Out slower than I went in. Quiet enough that nobody could blame me for anything. Quiet enough that if someone got angry, it couldn’t be because I was making noise.

I wore the same shirt every day. Buttoned to the top. Tight sleeves. I slept in it too. Changing felt like it would start something. If I stayed the same, maybe nothing would pick me out. Routine felt like a shield. If the buttons stayed closed, maybe everything else would too.

Liz made lists on the fridge and rewrote them when nothing changed. Maggie drew houses with too many windows and people that were too small inside them. Dad walked through rooms without stopping, like slowing down would cost him something. Mom poured coffee and forgot where she put it, then poured another. Sometimes she stared at the counter while it cooled, like she was trying to remember what she came in the kitchen for.

Sometimes Mom would speak and stop in the middle of her sentence.

Like she lost the thread.

Like she forgot who she was talking to.

Like she forgot there was a kid right there.

Sometimes Dad would look past me when he talked. His eyes would land on the wall behind my head instead. It made me feel like I didn’t take up space the way other people did.

I tried to be easy to forget. It felt safer.

James noticed things.

He noticed when adults stopped listening. He noticed when voices changed. He fixed small things when he could—loose handles, drawers that stuck, a cabinet door that wouldn’t close right. He taught me how to wait.

He also taught me how to breathe.

Not like a lesson. He never said my name when he did it. When the house got loud, he would stand near me and breathe out slowly, deep enough that I could hear it. He didn’t look at me. He just slowed himself down until I followed.

If my chest moved too fast, he made his breathing slower. Longer. Like he was showing me where the air was supposed to go. I copied him without thinking. That was easier than asking.

Sometimes he did it in the kitchen when voices rose. Sometimes he did it in the hallway when a door slammed. Sometimes he did it in my room after lights-out, standing in the dark like a guard, breathing out slow until my body remembered it could stop shaking.

James didn’t talk much either, but when he did, it mattered. Like he saved words and only spent them when he had to.

Waiting meant staying quiet. Staying still. Not asking again. Waiting until someone remembered you were there. James said waiting was better than being wrong.

Sometimes I stood in doorways and watched people move around me. If I looked at someone long enough, I could see when they decided I didn’t matter. Their faces barely changed. Just a small shift. Like a door clicking shut.

It happened fast. A glance. A pause. Then the decision.

Not loud.

Just done.

At night, James sang our mom’s lullaby wrong on purpose. If he messed up, he started over. He stretched the notes. Left space between lines. He said it was a game, but it wasn’t for sleeping. It was for timing—inhale, exhale, slow enough to stay.

I think he didn’t want me listening to the house. Or to our parents breathing in the dark like they were trying not to notice each other. Sometimes the breathing stopped for too long, and I counted until it came back.

Counting was another thing that belonged to me. Numbers didn’t change their minds. Numbers didn’t pretend they didn’t see you.

Once, very quietly, James said, “You don’t have to hold it.”

So I learned not to.

I prayed for him every night. Not because I believed it fixed things. Because doing the same thing every night felt steady. I said the words slowly so I wouldn’t miss any.

Sometimes I prayed for myself too. Not for big things. Just for a night that stayed quiet.

There was one afternoon where nothing went wrong.

No slammed doors. No raised voices. Maggie showed me a drawing. Liz stayed at the table. Dad didn’t leave the room. James leaned against the couch and didn’t fix anything.

The light through the window looked soft. Like it belonged to a different house. For a moment, it felt like the house was holding us.

I remember thinking: Maybe this is what normal feels like. Maybe normal is just a day where nobody gets tired of you.

Then James left.

I heard the zipper before I saw him. He packed clothes and his notebook. He didn’t take Maggie’s bear. He left it sitting on her bed, facing the door. His shirt was buttoned wrong. He didn’t fix it.

That scared me more than if he had.

He said he was leaving. Said he’d find somewhere better. Said he’d send for us. He kissed Maggie’s forehead, waved at Liz, and rested his hand on my head for one second.

His hand was warm. His fingers shook once, like he wanted to say something else. He opened his mouth, then closed it again.

Then he was gone.

I stood in the hallway long after the front door closed. Not because I was listening for him to come back.

Because the house didn’t know what to do without him, and neither did I. The rooms felt too big. The quiet felt too close.

After that, the air in the house felt sharper. Like you could bump into it.

Three weeks later, the police used careful words. The kind meant to end conversations. They said river road. They said tunnel. They said it was handled.

I wasn’t allowed to ask questions.

They said James was old enough to make choices. They said boys ran away. They said the tunnel was dangerous and that it wasn’t my business.

They said it like a door being shut. After that, no one opened it again.

But I noticed the word they kept using.

Tunnel.

They said it like it was something you weren’t supposed to picture.

After that, everything felt louder.

Not the volume. The pressure. Small noises that felt too sharp—chairs scraping, dishes clinking, people breathing too close. I learned to hold my breath when adults were talking, like my lungs were something I should hide.

At school, rules changed after they were explained. I corrected them once. The teacher smiled like I was making trouble. When other kids yelled, adults stepped in. When I spoke, they told me to wait my turn.

So I did.

I learned how to disappear without leaving.

If I didn’t look like I needed anything, people stopped seeing me. They stepped around me instead of over me.

That’s how I learned the most dangerous thing you can do is look like you’ll manage.

Because once people believe you’ll manage, they stop checking. They stop helping. They stop noticing the moment you start sinking.

They sent me to St. Mary’s Home for Boys.

The place smelled like cleaner and old paper. The clocks didn’t match. The hallway lights buzzed constantly. Someone had scratched numbers into the floor tiles so hard they left grooves. I traced them with my eyes while I walked.

The first thing I learned there was that the building kept sound.

Not like a person.

Like a place that held everything you did.

The second thing I learned was that adults there didn’t need to shout to make you do what they wanted.

Mrs. Kimber checked her watch before she spoke.

“You’ll settle in,” she said. “You always do.”

She said it like she’d already decided what I was, and that was that.

Her hair was pinned tight. Her smile was tighter. She spoke in a voice that made everything sound reasonable, even when it wasn’t.

My bed was against the wall. The sheets were tucked too tight. The pillowcase smelled like bleach. I folded my clothes carefully. I didn’t want anyone to get angry about small things.

I kept my shoes lined up. I kept my socks even. I kept my breathing small.

If I did everything right, maybe nothing would happen.

On my first day, I found the library before I found the dining hall.

It wasn’t a real library. Just shelves and old donated books and a smell like dust that didn’t move.

But the rules in there didn’t change.

You take a book. You bring it back. You put it where it belongs.

I liked that.

I liked puzzles too. I liked questions with answers. I liked knowing there was a way through something if you could think long enough.

The first night, I lay still and listened to everyone else sleeping. Some boys snored. Some talked in their sleep. One cried quietly, like he didn’t want anyone to hear him. I counted breaths until my chest hurt, then slowed them down the way James taught me.

I stared at the ceiling until the darkness started to look like shapes.

Then I heard it.

Not the building.

A person.

A soft step on the floor near my bed. A pause. A careful inhale.

I didn’t open my eyes right away. I tried to pretend I was asleep, because I didn’t know what the right move was.

The mattress dipped.

Weight. A knee. Too close.

A hand grabbed my shirt right under my collar and yanked, hard. My buttons strained. Fabric cut into my throat.

I opened my eyes.

There was a boy above me.

Same age.

Eight, like me.

But built like he’d been shoved around longer. Some kids look older when they’ve been angry their whole life.

His face was half in shadow, but I saw his mouth.

He wasn’t smiling.

He leaned in so close I could smell toothpaste and something sour underneath it.

“Don’t make noise,” he whispered.

I tried to breathe like James taught me.

In.

Out.

But my chest jumped anyway because my body didn’t care about lessons when someone was sitting on you.

He shoved something against the side of my head—hard enough that white sparks flashed in my eyes. I didn’t know if it was his fist or the bedframe edge. I just knew pain hit fast.

I made a sound. Small. Not a scream. Just a noise my throat made by accident.

He hit me again.

This time my ear rang. The world tilted. My pillow slipped.

He grabbed my wrist and twisted, not enough to break it, just enough to make it clear he could.

“Stay still,” he said.

I stayed still.

He pressed his palm over my mouth and pushed my face down into the pillow until my nose filled with fabric. I couldn’t get air. My lungs panicked and kicked against my ribs.

I tried to count.

One. Two.

But the numbers broke apart.

His weight shifted, and for a second I thought he was leaving, but then he grabbed the side of my head and slammed it once into the wall.

Not enough to kill me.

Enough to leave something behind.

Then he whispered, like he was giving me a rule.

“You don’t get to be quiet here,” he said. “Quiet makes people look.”

And then he got off me.

Just like that.

He stepped back. He looked around once, like checking if anyone had moved.

He left without running.

Like he wasn’t scared.

Like this was normal to him.

I lay there with my heart hammering and my mouth tasting like metal.

In the dark, nobody moved.

The boys kept breathing like normal.

The building kept every sound anyway.

I pressed my hand to the side of my head.

It came away wet.

In the morning, I told Mrs. Kimber something happened.

I didn’t say the word attacked.

I didn’t say the word boy.

I said, “Someone was at my bed.”

She looked at me like I was giving her extra work.

“Nightmares,” she said.

I shook my head.

“I wasn’t asleep,” I said.

Her smile tightened.

“Boys get carried away,” she said, like it was nothing.

I told the nurse my head hurt.

The nurse looked at the side of my face and went quiet.

She dabbed at my ear with gauze and didn’t ask me to repeat myself.

Someone wrapped my head.

Clean white bandages.

The nurse asked, “Who did this?”

I stared at the floor tiles.

I counted scratches.

I said, “I don’t know.”

Because I didn’t.

And because knowing would mean naming.

And naming would mean people would expect me to keep talking.

Back in the dorm, my blanket was folded at the foot of the bed.

I hadn’t done that.

I didn’t tell anyone. There were things you didn’t say out loud if you wanted them to stay small.

After that, a group of boys started sitting near me.

They weren’t quiet kids. They laughed. They argued. They made jokes. They dared each other to do stupid things. They talked like they owned the room.

And they didn’t use real names.

Everyone called them what they called each other.

Gage.

Redd.

Dax.

Cole.

No one asked where the names came from.

Gage talked the most.

Redd laughed the quickest.

Dax watched where people stood, like he kept a map in his head.

Cole asked questions like he already knew the answer.

They joked with each other constantly.

“Bro, you can’t even spell that,” Redd said once, leaning over Dax’s paper.

“I can spell,” Dax said.

“You spelled it wrong,” Cole said, smiling.

Gage laughed like he liked the sound. “Let him be wrong. Makes him easier to beat.”

They all laughed, even Dax, like it was normal.

Then they looked at me.

Like they were deciding if I was part of it.

The boys called me Sockie.

I hated that name.

No adult commented. No adult smiled about it. The adults didn’t pay attention.

Only Mrs. Kimber watched like she was waiting for me to mess up.

At first, the nickname sounded like nothing. Like a word kids throw out and forget.

But they didn’t forget.

They used it like a signal.

“Sockie,” Gage said one day, like he was checking how it sounded. “Come here.”

I walked over.

Gage didn’t touch me. He didn’t need to.

He just pointed at a spot next to the table, like that was where I belonged.

“Stand there,” he said.

I stood there.

Redd snorted. “He actually did it.”

Cole looked at my face like he was studying it. “He’s really serious.”

Dax said, “Leave him alone,” but he didn’t sound sure.

Gage’s smile stayed on his face, but it wasn’t friendly. “We are leaving him alone.”

They laughed at that.

The game didn’t have a name.

At first, it looked harmless. Like something to pass time.

One person walked ahead. One followed. You weren’t supposed to lose sight. If you did, it reset.

They said it was teamwork.

They didn’t hit me. They didn’t shove me. They didn’t grab me.

They just used words and timing.

They told me to stand still.

They said it was part of the game. Or a test. Or just for a second.

Sometimes they joked with each other while they set it up.

“Bet you can’t keep a straight face,” Redd told Dax.

“I’m not laughing,” Dax said.

“You always laugh,” Cole said.

Gage looked at me. “Sockie won’t laugh. He doesn’t do anything.”

I didn’t know what to do with that.

Redd said the light was better there. Dax told me to move two steps. Cole told me to wait. Gage counted down even though nothing started.

They laughed like it mattered.

Sometimes their teasing was small.

“Why you standing like that?”

“Say something.”

“You’re blinking like a robot.”

“No he doesn’t, he just stares.”

“Bro, he’s right behind you.”

They teased each other too, so it didn’t stand out at first.

But it started to change.

They started using me as the punchline more than each other.

At lunch, they told me to sit in the wrong seat.

When the real boy came back angry, they leaned back like it was funny.

“Sockie said it was fine,” they said.

I didn’t.

Adults said it was a misunderstanding.

Misunderstanding became the word for everything.

Some days, they made me carry things I hadn’t touched. A broken pencil. A torn page. A missing key.

I’d find them in my pocket like they’d always been there.

It made me start checking my pockets all the time. Like I didn’t trust my own hands.

They didn’t need to touch me to make it worse.

They just spoke like they owned the truth.

“Why you always doing weird stuff?”

“Stop acting like you don’t hear people.”

“You’re so quiet it’s creepy.”

“You’re not creepy,” Dax said once, quickly.

Redd looked at him. “You defending him?”

“I’m not defending him,” Dax said.

Gage laughed. “He doesn’t need defending. He’s fine.”

If I stayed quiet, they acted like I didn’t mind.

If I spoke, they acted like I was making it a big deal.

Gage was the one who watched my face the most.

Sometimes he stared too long, like he wanted a reaction.

Sometimes he acted like I wasn’t there at all, like he was proving something.

Sometimes he said my name like he wanted to hear it again.

“Sockie.”

Like testing how it felt.

Redd noticed once and smirked. “Why you always saying it like that?”

Gage’s smile snapped into place. “Saying what?”

“You know,” Redd said. “Like you like it.”

Cole’s eyes flicked between them like he was counting.

Dax said, “Shut up,” but not loudly.

Gage didn’t look away from me. “Go get your book,” he told me.

I went.

The worst part wasn’t one moment.

It was the pattern.

And then Part 2 started without anyone saying it out loud.

They stopped pulling me in.

They started leaving me out.

They’d talk and laugh, and when I stepped closer, the conversation would shift like a door closing.

“We already did that,” Redd would say.

“It’s not for you,” Cole would add, like it was simple.

Dax wouldn’t look at me. He’d just keep walking.

Gage would look, though.

Gage would look right at me, then look away first, like it made him mad that he noticed.

One night after lights-out, they told me to hide with them.

They pointed at the lockers where the light didn’t reach.

“Go,” Gage said. “Right there.”

I went.

“Don’t move,” Cole said.

“Don’t breathe loud,” Redd added, and laughed like it was funny.

Dax muttered, “Hurry up,” like he wanted it over with.

Then they left.

I stayed where they put me.

I could hear whispering. Quiet laughing. Shoes moving away. I heard Gage counting under his breath like time was the point.

I slowed my breathing and waited.

I didn’t move until the hallway went silent.

When I stepped out, the air felt colder. The lockers looked taller. The silence felt crowded.

After that, the rules got stranger.

They told me to wait in places that didn’t feel meant for kids. Stairwells. Storage rooms. Ends of hallways where the air tasted old.

They left me there.

Sometimes I heard them whisper my name on the other side of a door. Sometimes I heard nothing. Sometimes I heard breathing that wasn’t mine.

Those were the worst times.

Because it felt like nobody would notice if I didn’t come back.

Mrs. Kimber said I needed to “socialize.”

She said it like it was my job to fix it.

When I told her the boys played games that made me feel wrong inside, she smiled the same tight smile.

“Boys will be boys,” she said. “You’re bright. You’ll figure it out.”

Bright.

That was a word adults used when they didn’t want to help.

So I tried harder.

I learned the shape of their jokes. I learned which laugh meant trouble and which laugh meant nothing. I learned that when Cole asked a question softly, it meant he wanted an answer he could use later. I learned that when Redd laughed too quickly, it meant something had been set up. I learned that when Dax went quiet, it meant he didn’t want to be part of it but didn’t know how to stop it. I learned that when Gage got calm, it meant he was decided.

I learned so much.

It didn’t save me.

One afternoon, Dax told me we were going somewhere else.

“Just for a minute,” he said.

They took me farther than usual. Past the fence. Past where adults watched. Past where the building’s buzzing lights couldn’t follow.

The sky looked too open. Like it didn’t care what happened down here.

They were quieter than normal.

Gage walked ahead and didn’t look back. Redd laughed once—sharp and quick—then stopped. Cole asked me if I always did what people told me.

I said yes.

They stopped walking.

Gage turned around slowly, like he wanted to see my face when I said it.

“Say it again,” he said. “Louder.”

So I did.

They smiled, but it wasn’t the same kind of smile.

It was the kind of smile people have when they’ve been waiting for something to line up.

Dax told me to stand where the light didn’t reach.

So I did.

Redd looked at my shirt and laughed like he saw something funny.

Cole asked me if I understood what a joke was.

I nodded.

Gage stepped closer.

For a second, he didn’t look like he was joking at all.

“Say you’ll wait,” he said.

So I did.

Because waiting was what I was good at. Because saying no felt like guessing wrong. Because James had taught me waiting was safer.

Redd tilted his head. “He really will.”

Dax laughed under his breath. Quick. Small.

Cole walked a slow circle around me without touching me. “You don’t even argue.”

Gage’s jaw tightened like that annoyed him.

Then he pointed ahead.

“Go on,” he said. “Wait there.”

That was when I saw the tunnel.

It didn’t look huge. It looked ordinary. Like a place people drove through without thinking.

The air near it felt used.

They followed me to the edge.

Gage stopped at the mouth of it and looked in like he was checking something.

“Just a little in,” he said. “Then wait.”

Redd leaned close enough that I could hear his voice clearly.

“Don’t leave,” he whispered, smiling.

I turned to look at them again.

They were already stepping back.

They told me to wait.

They walked away together.

They didn’t look back.

That was when I understood.

Not just that they were fake.

But that the kindness had always been part of it.

That the whole point was to get me here.

The tunnel held cold air like a mouth holds breath.

I waited.

I waited the way James taught me.

At first, I could still hear them. Shoes on gravel. Low voices. A laugh that cut off too fast.

Then the sound faded.

And another sound took its place.

Breathing.

Not mine.

Slow. Careful. Close enough to change the air.

I tried to breathe quieter.

The tunnel answered, like it heard me.

I told myself I would count like I did at home.

One.

Two.

Three.

But the breathing behind me didn’t match my counting.

It waited between breaths.

Longer than a person should.

My chest tightened.

I tried to do it like James. In. Out slow.

The breathing behind me copied me.

Like it knew exactly what I was doing.

That’s when I ran.

When no one came back, I tried to breathe.

I ran. I slipped. I fell.

Everything went white.

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed.

My head was wrapped in gauze again. My ribs were bandaged. Breathing hurt like my chest had been squeezed.

The nurse kept looking at the bandages like she didn’t want to.

She asked me who did it.

I said I fell.

She didn’t believe me, but she didn’t push. Like she knew pushing didn’t always help.

The nurse said the wound was strange. Clean. Like it didn’t happen by accident.

She didn’t meet my eyes when she said it.

They sent me back.

St. Mary’s looked the same when I returned—same buzzing lights, same cleaner smell, same clocks disagreeing.

But the air felt different, like it knew.

The boys acted normal again.

Gage asked me if I was okay in a voice that sounded careful.

Redd smiled and said, “You’re back.”

Cole asked if I wanted to sit with them.

Dax opened the door like nothing happened.

I didn’t answer.

Adults said I needed to make an effort.

Mrs. Kimber told me to stop being dramatic.

She told me to stop making stories.

She told me to stop trying to get attention.

But I didn’t want attention.

I wanted someone to notice me quietly and then do something about it.

Nobody did.

The next night, my bed was empty.

They said I wandered.

They put up posters.

My name was wrong.

They never found me.

Years later, Mrs. Kimber drove home late.

She took the tunnel because it was faster.

She didn’t like the tunnel. She had never liked it. She had heard stories—boys disappearing, drivers seeing things in mirrors.

But stories were just stories.

And she didn’t like being slowed down by anything.

Halfway through, she felt it.

Breathing.

Slow. Careful. Familiar.

At first she told herself it was her own breath. That tight feeling people get in tunnels.

Then she realized her breathing was too fast.

And the other breathing wasn’t.

It was calm.

It was patient.

It sounded like someone who had practiced.

She told herself it was nothing.

Then she checked the mirror.

He was in the backseat.

Bandaged. Quiet. Shirt buttoned wrong.

Not looking at her.

Breathing the way he had been taught.

Her hands tightened on the wheel.

For a second, she didn’t scream.

For a second, she did what she always did.

She looked forward again like that would fix it.

But the breathing stayed.

Slow. Careful. Close.

She whispered, “Who are you?”

The boy didn’t answer.

He didn’t move.

He just breathed out, long and steady.

And the air in the car changed. It felt thicker. Like the tunnel had followed her out.

Mrs. Kimber tried to tell herself she was imagining it.

Then she heard it.

A small sound behind her.

Not a voice.

Just fabric shifting.

Like someone sitting up straighter.

Her eyes flicked to the mirror again.

The bandage looked too clean.

The face looked calm.

The eyes looked older than they should.

She swallowed hard.

“No,” she said, like a warning.

The breathing behind her stayed steady.

Then, very quietly—so quietly it could have been the tunnel itself—she heard words.

Not loud.

Not angry.

Practiced.

“You’ll settle in,” the voice said.

Mrs. Kimber’s stomach dropped.

It was her own sentence.

Her own voice.

But it didn’t come from her mouth.

Her foot jerked on the pedal. The car sped up.

The tunnel lights blurred.

She couldn’t stop looking forward.

Because she knew the moment she looked away, she’d look back again.

And she knew what would happen if she did.

The breathing grew closer.

Not physically.

Just there.

Like someone sitting right behind you, close enough that the space changes.

Her hands started to shake.

She tried to scream.

But her throat wouldn’t work right.

The boy breathed out.

Long. Slow.

And the car kept moving.

When she finally burst out of the tunnel into open air, she didn’t feel relief.

Because the breathing didn’t stop.

She drove faster.

Streetlights flashed.

Her house came into view.

She pulled into the driveway too hard, tires scraping.

She sat there with the engine running, shaking, staring straight ahead.

She didn’t check the mirror.

Minutes passed.

The car filled with quiet.

Then the breathing behind her moved again.

A gentle inhale.

A patient exhale.

Like someone waiting for her to remember he was there.

Like someone very good at it.

And she learned how long waiting can really last.

I was just starting to warm up to her (first time watching), after finding her insufferable during the first few episodes and this really made me hate her again.

She did not have to be included in their ping pong team whatsoever, she said it herself: ""if you guys don't want to hang out with me, just say so""

I would be so enraged if someone sneaked into a room and spied on me and my friends, I wouldn't even bother to explain what we were doing and confess that we're doing something illegal. If they didn't want you there, it's for a reason - period. She even threatened to snitch on them if she didn't make the team, and then proceeded to randomly start singing at the restaurant and seeking attention

She even made Jade give her the dress, then she proceeded to make a disgusted face ONLY at Jade because of her clothes, even tho they were Tori's in the first place! Tori's just a bitch overall, flirting with waiters and older men. Also, she's not the only one who could sing , she absolutely did not need to have a solo preformance. Jade and Cat sing just as well, and they all could've sung together. 

Yeah, you could argue Jade was also an ass toward Tori and didn't remind her to bring nice clothes, and also outright refused to let her join the team in the first place, but I will die as a Jade defender (so far), because imagine seeing someone up close and personal with your boyfriend like that? Sure, Tori explained what happened, but everyone would make up the same exact lie just to avoid any trouble, so Jade could've easily assumed she was lying because she was confronted. Then, Tori had the audacity to kiss Beck infront of the whole class

Honestly, Jade did go way overboard by pouring coffee on Tori, but Tori still did NOT have to kiss Beck. Even later throughout the episodes Tori is just an attention-seeking, selfish asshole tbh..

But here's the kicker—can fraternal twins actually have \*two different fathers\*?


I'm staring at these two paternity test results, and my brain is fucking short-circuiting.


That's when Marcus calls out from the nursery.


""Let's name the boy Atticus. And the girl? Autumn.""


I freeze.


Autumn Atwell. His high school sweetheart.


He's literally naming OUR kids after his first love.


The blood drains from my face, then rushes right back—hot and furious.


I slam the paternity reports on the kitchen counter.


""Are you out of your goddamn mind?""


He appears in the doorway, confused. ""What's the problem?""


""What's the problem?""


""Marcus, these aren't even YOUR kids. You don't even have the RIGHT to name them!""


I'm a simple woman. Traditional.


The kind who grew up believing marriage meant forever.


When I married Marcus, he became my whole world.


Whatever he said? Gospel truth.


Whatever he did? The right call.


I loved him. Worshipped him, really.


We met in college—same university, but he was a few years ahead of me. To me, he was untouchable. The smartest guy in any room.


We dated. We got married. And I threw myself into being the perfect wife.


Quit my career the second I graduated. Spent my days cooking his favorite meals, keeping the house spotless, making sure his life ran smoothly.


I thought I was doing everything right.


But two years in, still no baby.


And that's when everything started falling apart.


I panicked.


Back home in my hometown, divorce doesn't exist.


If a woman can't give her husband children, she's damaged goods.


The whole town would know.


My family would be humiliated.


I couldn't let that happen.


So I reached out to one of Marcus's close friends—James, a doctor.


Marcus works as a VP at some tech firm, and all his friends are successful like that. Lawyers, doctors, consultants.


James was kind. When I broke down and told him I was terrified something was wrong with me, he offered to run some tests.


Discreetly.


The results came back.


It wasn't me.


Marcus was the one who couldn't have kids!


YEAH!


I'm so happy. And relief.


Because if it had been me? I'd have to cut his d\*\*k.


So we'd both be infertile, and no one could blame me alone.


Now, at least, I didn't have to hurt my love.


But I also couldn't tell him the truth.


His mother—my mother-in-law—started calling me a ""barren hen."" Said it right to my face over Sunday dinner.


Marcus? He'd come home from work and snap at me.


""Every other woman can get pregnant, Sophia. Why can't you?""


I never fought back. Never corrected him.


I'm not the type to argue. I endure. I stay quiet.


Because I wasn't going to waste time defending myself.


I was going to fix this.


Chapter 2


James asked me what I was going to do.


He's... ridiculously attractive.


I'd never really noticed before, but sitting across from him in that exam room, it was impossible to ignore.


Those warm brown eyes that crinkle when he smiles. That low, rough voice that makes everything sound intimate.


The sharp jawline. Designer cologne—subtle, expensive.


When he leaned in to hand me a tissue, I caught the full scent of it.


I was crying silently, and he gently wiped my tears with his thumb, then pulled me against his chest.


""You don't deserve this, Sophia. Watching you go through this—it kills me.""


I buried my face in his shirt.


""I can't hurt Marcus. I can't lose my marriage. I can't.""


I looked up at him, desperate.


""James, please. Isn't there some way you can help me get pregnant?""


He went still. Then, slowly, he said it.


""I could be the donor.""


We agreed—neither of us would tell Marcus. It would destroy him to know the truth.


But we weren't alone.


Ryan had overheard everything.


Ryan Carter. Marcus's other best friend.


Literature professor at the state university.


Tweed jackets, wire-rimmed glasses, the kind of guy who quotes poetry at dinner parties.


He cornered me two days later outside a coffee shop.


""You're making a mistake, Sophia.""


I froze. ""Ryan, I—""


""You should tell him. He deserves to know."" His voice was sharp, almost angry.


""The problem is his, not yours. Stop protecting him.""


I shook my head frantically.


""What good would that do? It won't change anything. It'll just hurt him. He wants a child—if I can't give him that, what kind of wife am I? How do I face his family?""


Ryan stared at me for a long moment.


Then his expression shifted. Softened.


""If you're going to go through with this... don't use James.""


I blinked. ""What?""


""Use me.""


My breath caught.


He stepped closer, voice dropping.


""I've been in love with you since the day Marcus introduced us. But you only ever saw him. I never stood a chance.""


His hand brushed mine.


""If you have my child, Sophia, I'll give them \*everything\*. My entire estate. My name, if you ever want it.""


He paused.


""I'm only asking for one night. One night I can hold onto for the rest of my life. Can't you give me that much?""


I'll admit it—I was tempted.


Ryan promised he'd never marry. Said he'd love this child from the shadows, always be there if we needed him.


An extra person loving my baby? That sounded... safe. Good, even.


And there was something else.


With James, I felt like I owed him. Like I was asking for a massive favor I could never repay.


But Ryan was offering himself. He wanted this.


It felt less like charity. More like... mutual need.


So I turned James down.


He didn't take it well.


""Why?"" His voice was tight. ""Sophia, why?""


I hesitated. ""I found someone more... suitable.""


Silence.


Then, quietly: ""You should leave him.""


I stared at him.


""Divorce Marcus. Marry me. I'll take care of you. You won't have to go through this insane plan.""


I physically recoiled. ""James, stop. You're scaring me.""


He looked like I'd slapped him.


But I meant it. The idea terrified me.


Marcus always said women need marriage. That our value comes from being loved, from keeping a man.


His mother said the same thing. Over and over.


A woman without a husband is nothing.


I'd never even considered divorce.


I'm traditional. Conservative.


Divorce isn't in my vocabulary.


Chapter 3


James wouldn't let it go.


""Who is it, Sophia? Who are you using instead of me? What did he promise you?""


I kept my mouth shut.


His jaw tightened. ""You don't have to say it. I already know.""


He stepped closer, voice dropping to something dangerous.


""It's Ryan, isn't it? I've seen the way he looks at you. Like he's \*starving\*. You're seriously going to sleep with him? Are you insane?""


I tried to pull away. He caught my wrist.


""I can marry you, Sophia. Can he say the same?""


His grip loosened, thumb brushing my pulse point.


""I'm a doctor. If there are complications—medical, legal, \*anything\*—I can fix it. If Marcus ever demands a paternity test? I'll handle it. I have connections at every lab in the state.""


He leaned in.


""Ryan can't protect you like I can.""


Damn it.


He was right.


And pregnancy would mean doctor's visits. Ultrasounds. Bloodwork. If something went wrong, I'd need someone I could trust.


Someone who could make problems disappear.


I called Ryan that night and told him I'd changed my mind.


He lost it.


""You're choosing him? Sophia, I'm going to Marcus. I'm telling him everything—that he's been bullying you over kids he can't even have.""


Panic surged through me. ""Ryan, wait—""


""No. You've been carrying this alone long enough. He doesn't deserve you.""


""Please."" My voice cracked. ""I'll... I'll do it. I'll meet you.""


Silence on the other end.


Then: ""When?""


In the end, I made a decision.


They were both Marcus's best friends. Both willing to help. Both genetically suitable.


Why choose?


Two donors meant better odds, right?


So I tracked my ovulation, circled the date on my calendar, and set up two appointments.


Ryan at 10 AM.


James at 3 PM.


Six weeks later, the pregnancy test came back positive.


They both wanted to see me again.


I shut that down immediately.


What we did was already unforgivable. I wasn't about to turn this into some ongoing affair.


The truth was... being with them had felt good. Really good. Better than anything I'd ever experienced with Marcus.


But that's exactly why it was wrong.


I'm a good woman. Traditional. Pure.


I don't get to enjoy sex like that. It's shameful.


James and Ryan didn't take rejection well.


They both ran bloodwork—paternity tests, I assume—and each came back claiming the baby was his.


I was stunned at first. Thought one of them was lying.


But I didn't have time to figure it out, because pregnancy hit me like a freight train.


Morning sickness. Fatigue. Swollen ankles.


Eleanor—my mother-in-law—had zero sympathy.


""When I was pregnant with Marcus, I was out in the fields harvesting crops. I gave birth in a barn and went right back to work. Young girls these days are so dramatic.""


Marcus wasn't much better.


""You don't even have a job, Sophia. You sit at home all day doing nothing. How hard can pregnancy be? I swear, I married the most useless woman alive.""


I bit my tongue. Smiled through it.


It'll get better when the baby comes. When Marcus matures. When we're old, we'll be each other's companion. Just hold on.


But some days, I couldn't hold on.


That's when James stepped in.


He insisted I come to his private practice for prenatal care. Every visit, he'd ask about my diet, my sleep, whether I was stressed.


When he found out I was still doing all the cooking and cleaning—for Marcus, Eleanor, and Marcus's two younger siblings who still lived at home—he nearly exploded.


""Absolutely not. You're high-risk. No heavy lifting, no standing for long periods.""


He called Marcus directly.


""Your wife needs bed rest. I'm sending over a housekeeper—my treat. Consider it a congratulations gift for the baby.""


Eleanor was \*thrilled\*. Free help? She wasn't about to say no.


I was relieved.


Because keeping our household of seven people running smoothly?


That's all that mattered.

I'm currently upgrading from a superautomatic (DeLonghi) to my first proper espresso setup (Lelit Victoria), and I'm stuck deciding on the grinder.

Since I'm coming from a bean-to-cup machine, a convenient workflow is key for me (I really want Grind-by-Weight). However, I also own a 3D printer (Bambu Lab A1) and I'm comfortable with tech and tinkering.

I'm torn between these two options (European prices):

**Option A: The ""Peace of Mind"" route**

Eureka Mignon Libra

Price: \~€550 \\\~$580

Pros: Works out of the box, warranty, clean look.

**Option B: The ""Maker"" route**

Eureka Mignon Specialita \~€360 \\\~$380 + DIY Smart Grind-by-Weight Mod

Project: GitHub - smart-grind-by-weight from jaaap

https://github.com/jaapp/smart-grind-by-weight

Est. cost for parts: \~€60 \\\~$65

Total: \~€420 \\\~$445 -> Saving \~€130 \\\~$135

My concerns/questions for those who have experience with this:

Reliability: I drink dark roasts and just want my morning coffee without hassle. Is the DIY mod reliable as a daily driver, or does it require constant re-taring and calibration?

Vibration Dampening: I know the Libra uses specific algorithms to filter out motor vibration from the weight reading. Does the DIY mod (Load cell + ESP32) handle this well, or are the readings noisy/drifting during grinding?

Warranty: To get the full auto-stop functionality, I assume I have to mess with the internal wiring of a brand new Specialita. Is saving €130 (\\\~$135) really worth voiding the warranty on a new unit?

Is the DIY mod polished enough to rival the Libra, or should I just pay the premium to avoid having a ""science project"" on my kitchen counter?

However, I also use other 3D printed parts such as the WDT tool.

Workflow: How well does grinding directly into the portafilter work? Is the mod stable/responsive enough for that, or am I forced to use a dosing cup?""

So I physically stop the boy and threaten him to be more careful. Then his mother (dark brown hair and olive skin) shows up and I tell her what happens and she agrees that he needs to be more careful. I then go through a door to the side of the alley way and into a house. I start looking for my mom, tqi of my siblings, and the family dog and start to become more frantic when I can't find them.

Eventually I find them in the corner of one of the rooms I looked in already. I've asked them if they've explored the secret rooms yet to which they said no so we explore them. There's an aquarium secret room in my little sister sister and many more rooms that are filled to the brim with stuff (some in a organized way and some in a hoarding way) and we were having fun. Then me and my mom are in her bedroom bathroom (the one in this dream house) on the top of one shelf (right across from the toilet) is suitecase filled with money and over the toilet is another suitecase filled with passports, first aide, and a white round glass ball like thing. 

I asked my mom if she's seen the secret room that's connected to her bathroom and she's said no (though I felt like I've asked her this before) so I tap on the mirror above the sink and it became black and when I lift it up a light green light comes threw. My mom said not right now cause she has a headache.

Then we (me, now three siblings, mom, and family dog) start to explore her room and I get to her closet. The whole closet is painted with with tiny black dots. On the back wall near the corner is a knob which opens into a walk-in closet that is painted teal, there is a dusty pink (not covered in dust but the type of pink that is called dusty pink) floor length long sleeve dress in there with a embroidery design on the wrist to elbow and I just know it's only on the outer arms.

On the opposite end (and opposite wall) of the room is another door that we open and leads into a living (with a hallway). The living room is bear with only a dark mahogany recliner and a big window with clear white curtains. The walls are a light brown with sports team curved (every few feat) into them and as we go down the wall some are carved wrong. Some of the rooms are in good shape but others look run down with rotting walls and broken closet doors. All the walls have natural lighting.

Then we get to the end of the hall which opens up into a room with two sets of doors (I start feeling scared like I feel when I have a nightmare at this point) that has knobs the first one we go to the French doors and when I open them it opens into a hallway with dark brown wood with light coming from light bulbs and has stair case their are shadows from people and so we close the door but it won't stay closed. So I try and tie the knobs except they're gone and their cobwebs where the school be. I place different coffee tables in front of it (some made of glass, some metal, and some wood) to try and block the door but it's still ajared no matter firm I try and place it against the door. I then put candles (tall unlit ones under the coffee table and against the doors).

Then I check the other door and it leads to the same hallway so I slam the door shut and start putting stuff in front of it. First is two small bags of cat food, then a bag of cat litter, the a bag of birds seeds, then a bag of cat food.

First trimester, I had horrible nausea/vomiting (didn't get an official HG diagnosis because my doctor was willing to prescribe meds right away, I was VERY lucky about that) – I could hardly eat or drink water even after I started Xonvea, the worst was weeks 5-8 (before Xonvea) and 8-12 (with Xonvea - it didn't change how I felt that much but made it possible to eat at least a survival amount of food). After week 12 things got better, although I was still sick often, and since week 18 or so I haven't even vomited, although often been close to it. Now I can drink water and even a little coffee and eat anything except acids (vinegar, citrus etc., even in tiny quantities).

But, I still feel just generally dreadful physically practically all of the time, even if I don't have exactly the feeling of nausea. Specifically physically - it's not at all like periods of mental health challenges I've had in the past. Comparable to a flu without head cold symptoms, maybe.

I have to actively force myself to do virtually any of my normal activities - I usually love my job, working out, keeping active in general, but now virtually any typical activity just feels like a miserable burden, even taking a shower most days.

People I know, even who had bad nausea earlier in pregnancy, tell me ""it just disappeared one day and I felt great"". Or that they just felt great the whole pregnancy >:)

Anyone had a similar situation? Is it possible the Xonvea is affecting me negatively? (I am hesitant to go off it because I still have fairly strong waves of nausea most days - taking a 20mg/20mg dose each evening).",2,1768563499.0,PregnancyUK,3,1.0,False

I'm looking for new girlies in London bc now I love it there, I'm willing to meet new people and it's cheap to flight from my city, I usually go Fri-Sun. It would be amazing to connect again with new girlies. 

I love coffee, matcha, brunch, pubs, reggaeton parties, parks and spending time in London. I know it's different but it could be worth it💙💙",2,1768563478.0,UkFriends,0,1.0,False

1qedosg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qedosg/need_advice_neouza_vs_normcore_bottomless/,Need advice: Neouza vs. Normcore bottomless portafilter for Dedica EC685? [50€],"Hi everyone,

I recently wrote a post sharing my frustrating experience with the De'Longhi Dedica and the Baratza Encore ESP grinder using the stock pressurized filter. I couldn't manage to dial in my shots, and everyone recommended switching to a non-pressurized (bottomless) filter.

However, there are so many conflicting opinions on different brands that I really don't know which one to choose. Keeping in mind that I am a beginner and I live in Spain (so prices are in €), here are my two options:

**Neouza Order (Total w/ shipping: €39)**

* [Bottomless portafilter with 8 tools/accessories](https://neouza.com/es/products/neouza-coffee-51mm-bottomless-portafilter-compatible-with-delonghi-ec680-ec685-espresso-machine?variant=44100281368762): €23.95
* [Magnetic dosing funnel](https://neouza.com/es/products/neouza-coffee-espresso-dosing-funnel-ring-catcher-with-magnetic-stainless-steel-fits-for-portafilter-51-53-58mm): €9.95

**Normcore Order (Total w/ shipping: €75.72)**

* [Bottomless portafilte](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-naked-bottomless-portafilter-with-handle?variant=46292026753272)r: €55

As you can see, one option is much cheaper than the other. Judging by the website design, Neouza looks like dropshipping, and I feel like I could find the same items on AliExpress for half the price and then just add an IMS basket to it.

But as I said, I'm new to the world of espresso, and I don't know what is truly important. What I definitely don't want to do is spend €75 on the Normcore order and then realize I still need to buy a precision basket (like IMS) for another €20-30.

On another note, I need a Tamper and a WDT tool that are already in my AliExpress cart.

If you could give me your opinion on these accessories, it would be a huge help, as currently, I only own a scale and a distributor. Thank you!!!!!!",1,1768563407.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1qedmrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProteinPacing/comments/1qedmrv/the_light_switch_method_a_simple_guide_to_protein/,"The ""Light Switch"" Method: A Simple Guide to Protein Pacing","**Most of us were taught to eat like this:**

❌ Breakfast: Coffee & Bagel (Low Protein)

❌ Lunch: Salad or Sandwich (Low/Medium Protein)

❌ Dinner: Huge Steak or Chicken meal (Too Much Protein at once)

**The Result?** You are hungry all day, your energy crashes, and your body stores the excess dinner energy as fat because it can't use it all at once.

Enter **Protein Pacing.**

Instead of starving your muscles all day and flooding them at night, you distribute that protein evenly. Think of it like a **Light Switch** for your metabolism.

💡 **The ""Light Switch"" Analogy**

Every time you eat 20g-30g of protein, you turn your muscle-building and metabolism switch ""**ON**"".

• If you eat 80g at dinner, the switch just turns ""ON"". It doesn't turn ""Super ON"".

• If you eat protein 6 times a day, you keep that switch turned ON all day long.

✅ **The Protocol (How to do it)**

The rules are simple but powerful:

1. **Eat every 3 hours.**

2. **20g to 40g of protein** per meal.

3. **Start early:** Within 1 hour of waking up.

4. **End late**: Within 2 hours of sleeping.

📅 **A Sample Day** (6 Meals / \~140g Protein)

• 07:00 AM: 🍳 3 Eggs + Cottage Cheese (25g)

• 10:00 AM: 🥤 Whey Shake or Greek Yogurt (25g)

• 01:00 PM: 🥗 Grilled Chicken Salad (30g)

• 04:00 PM: 🐟 Tuna or Turkey with Wasa crackers (20g)

• 07:00 PM: 🥩 Lean Beef or Salmon with Veggies (25g)

• 10:00 PM: 🥛 Casein Shake or Cottage Cheese (15g)

🚀 **Why it changes everything:**

• **No more cravings**: Protein kills appetite better than carbs.

• **Constant Energy**: No afternoon sugar crash.

• **Fat Loss**: Your body spends more energy digesting protein (Thermic Effect).

**Give it 2 weeks.**

Reset your schedule. Time your protein. Watch your body change.

So I physically stop the boy and threaten him to be more careful. Then his mother (dark brown hair and olive skin) shows up and I tell her what happens and she agrees that he needs to be more careful. I then go through a door to the side of the alley way and into a house. I start looking for my mom, tqi of my siblings, and the family dog and start to become more frantic when I can't find them.

Eventually I find them in the corner of one of the rooms I looked in already. I've asked them if they've explored the secret rooms yet to which they said no so we explore them. There's an aquarium secret room in my little sister sister and many more rooms that are filled to the brim with stuff (some in a organized way and some in a hoarding way) and we were having fun. Then me and my mom are in her bedroom bathroom (the one in this dream house) on the top of one shelf (right across from the toilet) is suitecase filled with money and over the toilet is another suitecase filled with passports, first aide, and a white round glass ball like thing. 

I asked my mom if she's seen the secret room that's connected to her bathroom and she's said no (though I felt like I've asked her this before) so I tap on the mirror above the sink and it became black and when I lift it up a light green light comes threw. My mom said not right now cause she has a headache.

Then we (me, now three siblings, mom, and family dog) start to explore her room and I get to her closet. The whole closet is painted with with tiny black dots. On the back wall near the corner is a knob which opens into a walk-in closet that is painted teal, there is a dusty pink (not covered in dust but the type of pink that is called dusty pink) floor length long sleeve dress in there with a embroidery design on the wrist to elbow and I just know it's only on the outer arms.

On the opposite end (and opposite wall) of the room is another door that we open and leads into a living (with a hallway). The living room is bear with only a dark mahogany recliner and a big window with clear white curtains. The walls are a light brown with sports team curved (every few feat) into them and as we go down the wall some are carved wrong. Some of the rooms are in good shape but others look run down with rotting walls and broken closet doors. All the walls have natural lighting.

Then we get to the end of the hall which opens up into a room with two sets of doors (I start feeling scared like I feel in nightmares at this point) that has knobs the first one we go to the French doors and when I open them it opens into a hallway with dark brown wood with light coming from light bulbs and has stair case their are shadows from people and so we close the door but it won't stay closed. So I try and tie the knobs except they're gone and their cobwebs where the school be. I place different coffee tables in front of it (some made of glass, some metal, and some wood) to try and block the door but it's still ajared no matter firm I try and place it against the door. I then put candles (tall unlit ones under the coffee table and against the doors).

Then I check the other door and it leads to the same hallway so I slam the door shut and start putting stuff in front of it. First is two small bags of cat food, then a bag of cat litter, the a bag of birds seeds, then a bag of cat food. Then I lay in front of the with the coffee table and kinda just stay there feeling depressed for days (or it's days in the dream).

1qedkb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qedkb5/rf_the_first_date/,[RF] The First Date,"By Nekro

It begins on a Tuesday that doesn't know it matters yet.

A man with a laundry bag slung over his shoulder, thinking about whether he has enough quarters. A woman holding an envelope, wondering if mailing it will fix anything or just make it permanent.

They pass each other on that particular stretch of sidewalk where the bodega meets the dry cleaner, where the city's rhythm briefly stutters.

Their eyes catch. Not dramatically. Just the way eyes sometimes do when two people happen to be looking up at the exact wrong or right moment. A half second of accidental intimacy that the brain immediately begins to misinterpret.

You know this feeling. The one where your chest does something architectural. Where time briefly forgets how to move forward.
He walks another ten steps. Tells himself it was nothing. That the washing machines are waiting and quarters have a way of disappearing when you need them most.

He stops anyway.
Turns around before the rational part of his brain can lodge a formal objection.

She is still there, half a block away, walking slower now like she's waiting for something to happen or hoping it wont.

He catches up. No prepared speech. No borrowed cleverness. Just honesty, which is usually a terrible opening move but occasionally the only one that works.
""I know this is strange,"" he says. ""But I think I'd regret not saying something.""

She looks at him the way people do when theyre deciding whether a stranger is dangerous or just refreshingly honest. There is a pause. A car passes. Someone's radio plays something neither of them will remember.
""Saying what?"" she asks.
""I dont know yet. But it felt like walking away would be a mistake.""

She studies him. He doesnt look away. This is the moment that seals it, not what he said, but that he stayed present for her inspection of it.

""I was going to the post office,"" she says finally.
""I was going to do laundry.""
""Riveting lives we lead.""
""Devastating,"" he agrees.

She smiles. Its a small smile, the kind that suggests shes already decided but wants to see how this plays out.

""You can walk me to the post office if you want,"" she says. ""If your laundry can wait.""
""My laundry has been waiting since Thursday. It can wait a little longer.""

They walk together. She mails the letter without telling him who its to, and he doesnt ask, which she appreciates. He loads two machines at the laundromat on the corner while she sits on the bench by the window and watches people argue about the right water temperature.

""You fold or crumple?"" she asks.
""Fold what?""
""Your life. When you pack it away.""
He considers this. ""I fold the things I want to keep nice. Everything else gets crumpled.""
""Honest answer.""

""I'm trying something new today.""
Breakfast happens because they're both hungry and neither wants the conversation to end. A diner with cracked vinyl booths and coffee that tastes like the 1970s never left.

They talk the way people do when they sense time is limited, not frantically, but without filler. No resume recitations. No practiced anecdotes.

Just the stuff that bubbles up when you're not trying to impress anyone.
She tells him about the year she lived in her car. He tells her about the plant he accidentally killed by loving it too much. They disagree about whether movies are better when you know the ending. Neither convinces the other. Both enjoy the argument.
Hours dissolve. The laundry finishes. They fold it together, and somehow this feels more intimate than it should. The city darkens.

 They wander without destination, the way you do when stopping would break whatever spell is holding.
By the time they circle back to where they started, the day has taken on that golden hour quality where everything looks like a memory already.

She reaches into her jacket. He sees whats coming, the pen, the number, the promise of continuation.
""Wait,"" he says.
She pauses, pen halfway out.
""I don't want your number.""
She blinks. Recalibrates. ""Oh.""
""Not because"" He stops. Tries again. ""Do you believe in fate?""
""I don't know. Do you?""
""I didn't this morning.""
She laughs, but it fades quickly because she can see he's serious.

""If this matters,"" he says, ""we shall meet again. Same circumstances. Laundry and mail. And if we do, if the universe is paying any attention at all, ill ask you to marry me immediately. No phone calls. No slow erosion. Just that.""

She stares at him. ""That's insane.""
""Completely.""
""We dont even know each other's names.""
""I know you hate cilantro and love your sister and youre afraid of becoming the person in that letter you mailed. Thats not nothing.""
Shes quiet for a long time. He can see her working through it the absurdity, the romance, the clean logic of a bet against entropy.
""And if we don't meet again?"" she asks.

""Then this was enough. One perfect day. No decay. No disappointment. Just this.""
You can see her decision in her shoulders. The way they drop slightly, accepting the terms.
""Okay,"" she says.
""Okay?""
""Okay.""

They kiss. Not like people who are saying goodbye, but not like people who are certain of tomorrow either. Somewhere in between. The kind of kiss that carries its own ending.
They walk away in opposite directions. Neither looks back. Looking back would be cheating.

Time does what it does.
Days become weeks become years. They meet other people. Fall into other rhythms. Get married, different people, different ceremonies, different last names. 

Build lives that work. Have children who ask questions they can't quite answer. Forget the exact sound of each other's voices but never quite forget the feeling of that day, lodged somewhere behind the sternum like a splinter made of light.

Memory is generous with distance. The day becomes mythical. A story they each tell themselves, alone, in quiet moments. Proof that magic happened once. That they were capable of it.

They dont google. Dont search. That would violate the pact.
The years pile up. The laundry continues. The mail still needs sending.

It happens on a Tuesday again. Because irony is lazy but persistent.
A man, older now, with gray threading through his temples and a laundry bag that weighs exactly as much as middle age feels.

 Different apartment. Same detergent.
A woman, older now, with reading glasses on a chain and an envelope in her hand. Different handwriting. Similar dread about what mailing it will set in motion.

They cross paths on that same stretch of sidewalk.

The bodega is under new management. The dry cleaner has closed. But the geometry of the intersection is identical.

They pass.
Their eyes dont catch. Or maybe they do, briefly, the way everyones eyes catch a thousand times a day in cities, a flicker of recognition that could be anything or nothing.

They keep walking.
He doesn't turn around. She doesn't slow down.

The moment evaporates like all the other moments that happen and unhappen a thousand times a day in cities where people are always crossing paths and never stopping.

The laundry gets done. The letter gets mailed.

Somewhere in their respective homes that night, maybe one of them pauses. Feels something. Dismisses it. Returns to the dishes, the mortgage, the life that turned out fine even if it turned out differently than expected.

That's the story.
The one where fate doesnt show up.
Where the pact goes unclaimed.
Where something perfect happened once and then ended, and ending didn't make it less perfect.

If this bothers you, good. You're supposed to be bothered. You were never promised a universe that pays attention or rewards your bets against entropy.

Only reminded that some things are complete because they end.
That meaning doesn't require continuation.

That the machines keep spinning and the mail keeps moving and life keeps happening whether or not you get the ending you negotiated with a stranger on a sidewalk when you were younger and believed in tests the universe might actually grade.

Somewhere between the detergent and the mailbox, something mattered once.
And that was enough.
It has to be.

1qedkad,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qedkad,AddiesKIN K007 Carbon Luxe (Miyota 9015) - “Accessible Luxury” or Actually Legit?,"I picked up the **AddiesKIN K007 Carbon Luxe (Miyota 9015)**, which is basically Addiesdive’s new “accessible luxury” line. So yeah… I had to check if it’s actually a budget sleeper, or just another shiny marketing story.

The biggest standout is the **carbon fiber dial** \- it genuinely looks great in person. The pattern is unique, it changes depending on the angle, and it gives the watch a much more “premium” vibe than the price suggests. The **applied indices** are surprisingly clean too - no rough edges, even under macro shots. And the **lume**? Absolutely insane. It’s bright enough that my **Traser P67 with tritium** feels like it needs a coffee break.

The hands also surprised me: **brushed center + polished edges**, and they don’t look like “$100 watch hands”. The seconds hand is pretty basic and generic, but it doesn’t really ruin the vibe.

The **bezel** is another strong point. The numbers and markers are crisp, the finishing is nicely done with good texture contrast, and it gives off a bit of that **Yacht-Master-style** vibe. It’s a little stiff and clicks loudly, but at least it feels precise. Only downside: this kind of bezel finish will probably pick up scratches and shiny spots over time.

Case finishing is fine - nothing crazy, but clean and wearable. It sits better on my wrist than I expected, not a giant frying pan. The only part that screams “budget” is the **crown** \- you won’t notice it day-to-day, but under macro you can see minor imperfections.

The bracelet is brushed and looks decent, but it’s not “luxury” - more toolwatch than jewelry. The clasp is stamped (thicker metal), works securely, and has a laser-engraved logo. Again: practical, not fancy.

Now the best part: **Miyota 9015** at this price is kind of a cheat code. You get **28,800 bph**, hacking, hand-winding, and a solid power reserve. The usual downside applies: the rotor can be a bit noisy, but that’s normal for a 9015 and doesn’t bother me.

# Quick specs (K007 per AddiesKIN):

* Movement: **Miyota 9015 automatic**
* Crystal: **flat sapphire**
* Water resistance: **100m / 330ft**
* Date: **yes**
* Dial: **carbon fiber**
* Bezel: **rotating**
* Bracelet: **stainless steel**

**Final take:** it’s not “true luxury”, but for an “accessible luxury” watch it’s honestly closer than I expected. Carbon dial + crazy lume + Miyota 9015 makes it feel like it costs more than it does. Definitely a fun buy if you want something different without setting your wallet on fire.",8,1768563000.0,ChineseWatches,0,1.0,False
1qedk05,https://www.reddit.com/r/WYSIWYG_HTML_Editor/comments/1qedk05/discover_the_best_html_code_generator_for_web/,Discover the Best HTML Code Generator for Web Development,"HTML code generators have helped web developers speed up their development cycles since their emergence. By providing a user-friendly interface to generate HTML code, they are able to significantly lessen manual coding. Many of these tools function as a [WYSIWYG editor](https://froala.com/), allowing users to create and edit web pages visually without needing to write extensive code.

Thus, businesses, developers, and even non-technical hobbyists have chosen to rely on these HTML generators or integrate them into their workflow.

If you’re planning to find the best HTML code generator that suits your needs, then read on below. In this guide, you’ll see some key features to look for in these generators, as well as a list featuring the best of them. Additionally, you’ll explore how you can quickly integrate one in your projects.

## **Key Takeaways**

* HTML code generators speed up development by reducing repetitive manual coding and enabling visual or assisted HTML creation.
    
* Not all generators are the same — some focus on WYSIWYG editing, while others behave more like IDEs or desktop site builders.
    
* The best HTML code generator depends on your workflow, project size, and whether you prioritize visual editing, clean output, or deep customization.
    
* Features like syntax highlighting, templates, and cross-browser compatibility are essential for producing reliable, maintainable code.
    
* Generated HTML should always be reviewed to ensure semantic structure, accessibility, security, and long-term maintainability.
    
* Modern generators integrate easily into existing workflows, whether through online tools, CDN-based editors, package managers, or standalone applications.
    

## **What is an HTML Code Generator?**

Whenever we build webpages, we write HTML code using text editors and view the result through a browser. Let’s call this “traditional coding.”

HTML code generators, on the other hand, allow developers to use a visual or text-based interface to generate code.

For example, a user can type on the generator’s text editor, select the text, and click some buttons (e.g., bold and italics). Afterwards, the generator will convert the editor’s contents (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) into HTML code. The way generators display the HTML code might differ, but the end result should be the same.

With these features, HTML generators help developers reduce or skip some basic coding, allowing them to focus on other important parts like optimization, security, and analysis.

## **Key Features to Look for in an HTML Code Generator**

Nowadays, code generators come with plenty of features. Most of these are standard and essential, while others have more niche or specific uses. Here are four important features that the best HTML code generators should contain:

## **User-friendly Interface**

This might appear obvious or simple at first glance, but the truth is that some generators prioritize other things over a polished user interface. Without proper layouts, organization, accessibility, customization, and a clean, modern look, a feature-rich code generator would turn into a difficult, counterintuitive tool.

So, for efficiency (and for not straining your eyes), choose a generator that looks and feels intuitive and seamless.

## **Auto-completion and Syntax Highlighting**

Auto-completion and syntax highlighting are integral parts of every development process because of how they reduce issues, ensure clean code, and provide convenience.

The former automatically suggests code when you type in the editor, possibly reducing human errors (such as typos). Additionally, it helps cut time when writing repetitive code. On the other hand, syntax highlighting helps you identify syntax errors or inconsistencies in the editor.

## **Code Snippets and Templates**

The code snippets feature contributes greatly to the rapid development of web pages. It allows developers to use pre-written codes and insert or paste them directly into projects.

Templates provide developers with a fixed yet customizable web page design and features. They serve as a good foundation for a project, especially for those who want a quick start.

In case you’re looking for ways to visualize code snippets or animate them in various ways, you can look at tools like [Snappify](https://snappify.com/).

## **Cross-browser Compatibility**

Browsers may display HTML code differently. That’s why you usually test the look and feel of your web pages across different browsers before deploying them.

The same goes for HTML generators. When looking for the right one for your use case, you should pick that which already has cross-browser compatibility.

## **Top HTML Code Generators Available Today**

There are many HTML generators available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a list of some of the best options you can consider:

## **1\. Froala Editor**

## **How to Choose the Right HTML Code Generator for Your Needs**

With many available options to generate HTML code, you should consider the following factors:

## **Project Requirements**

Are you building a full website, or are you looking to quickly generate HTML code? Do you need many features or just specific ones? Are compliance, security, clean layouts, SEO, and performance important for you? How about scalability?

## **Team Size**

If you’re working solo, you can opt for a simple, easy-to-use, and possibly free tool to generate HTML code. On the other hand, small and larger teams might benefit from more robust tools, especially those with collaboration features.

## **Budget**

Some HTML code generators are free or have a perpetual plan option. Others require a subscription. Better ones offer all of the aforementioned. Choose a tool that aligns with your budget constraints.

Remember that before you fully commit, you should test out the tools with either a free trial or a live demo. You can then gauge whether the features align with your needs and workflow.

## **Integrating an HTML Code Generator into Your Workflow**

You can use HTML code generators in several ways. Here are some examples that demonstrate how you can integrate them into your workflow:

## **Online HTML code generators**

If you just need a quick and accessible start to your projects, you can use online HTML generators. These include [online HTML editor](https://froala.com/online-html-editor/) demos and even AI-powered LLMs like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/). To get started, visit the site of your preferred online editor.

## **Web app integration**

You can also integrate these generators into applications (e.g., internal apps or apps for your users). For example, you can install Froala Editor by either downloading its files as a ZIP, using the CDN, or using package managers like NPM.

After you have the editor’s files (or if you’re using CDN), you can then import them into your project directly like the following lines:

```plaintext
<!--Import via CDN-->

<link href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/froala-editor@latest/css/froala_editor.pkgd.min.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /><script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/froala-editor@latest/js/froala_editor.pkgd.min.js'></script>
```

Once you have them, you’re ready to initialize the editor and enable your application’s users to generate HTML.

## **As separate desktop applications**

Lastly, you can download or purchase full IDEs with code generation features. This method would probably require the most effort and resources but might also come with the most features. Hence, you must ensure that you can maximize the use of these features should you get such a code generator.

## **Conclusion**

In web development, you can supplement your current tech stack with [a tool that can generate HTML code](https://froala.com/blog/general/html-table-generator-tool-to-help-automate-your-coding/). This speeds up the layout design and development process while possibly reducing errors.

Before you start implementing, it is worth noting that neither traditional coding nor HTML generators is better than the other. Furthermore, you should always review generated code to be safe.

To find the best one for you, check each of the best HTML code generators out (demos, free trials, etc.). In the end, the answer will depend on your project needs, development style, pacing, and budget.

## **FAQs**

## **How to generate code for HTML?**

You can generate HTML code by writing it manually in a text editor, using an HTML code generator or WYSIWYG editor, or through AI tools. HTML generators allow you to design visually or use templates, then automatically convert your input into structured HTML code.

## **Can ChatGPT create HTML?**

Yes, ChatGPT can generate HTML code based on prompts you provide. It’s useful for creating layouts, components, forms, and sample markup. However, the generated code should always be reviewed and tested before use in production.

## **Can AI write HTML code?**

Yes, AI tools can write HTML code efficiently, especially for common layouts and components. While AI speeds up development, developers should still validate the output for correctness, accessibility, performance, and security.

## **Are HTML code generators good for SEO?**

Yes, HTML code generators can be good for SEO if they produce clean, semantic HTML. To get the best results, developers should review generated code to ensure proper heading structure, accessible markup, optimized images, and minimal unnecessary elements.

## **Do HTML code generators replace manual coding?**

No, HTML code generators do not fully replace manual coding. They are best used to speed up layout creation and repetitive tasks, while developers still refine, optimize, and secure the generated code for production use.

1qedjxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qedjxv/update_ideas_for_new_horizons/,Update Ideas for New Horizons,"I would've never guessed more updates would be on the way after the huge update of 2.0.0. But turns out, Nintendo hasn't completely forsaken this beloved IP and even listened to some of the highly requested fan requests (Bulk crafting, Leif's service) Very un-nintendo-ish if you ask me.

So after learning that there might be a chance in the future, I would like to share some of my ideas for the future update of the game. Generally, I wouldn't talk about something that would need unplausible amount of work from nintendo, or something that would hurt the overall design of the game for both New players and Old players. 

1. Museum Guide

I genuinely think this could be a very good addition to the game. Some people would rather just skip the dialogue from blathers completely in the early stage of the game, and feel bored and empty about the museum quite easily after finishing (or mostly finishing) it. I know that you can still bring stuffs to blathers after it being donated, and he'll offer you an explanation, but that's quite exclusive and not many people will want to go through it just for the sake of few lines. So I think it would be great if you could talk to blathers about the museum tour, and He will follow you and give explanation to the sea creatures, etc if you ask him for details. I think it would make one of the most neglected, yet center part of the game, much livlier. Maybe even having blathers being afraid the whole time during the bug exhibit or making it more expensive could also contribute to small humor. After the museum tour, maybe blathers could even ask if we would want to have coffee together in the brewster's and talk about his relationship to celeste, or some talks related to the old games just for few references. but maybe I'm going too far.

2. Music App

I hope they could add the spoof version of Nintendo Music App that lets you listen to the old version of the soundtrack. But of course I think this should be exclusive for people that truly has lots of hours already spent on the game. Because the new NH soundtrack is really great, and people should give it a try. But if, say, the player has already paid all of their debts to Tom Nook, you get this ability to choose the music of the game from New Leaf, OG Gamecube AC, or no music at all. I think this would make playing the game for a long time a more soothing experience.

3. A bit more variety on the fruit..?

I know this has already been talked alot, but I think NH's art direction has moved a little too much from the very concept of it's game. To me the game's Soul is all about having cute and dumb animal friends in the nature, fishing and picking fruits, doing the most absurd things possible and still making money to pay debt. In that sense, they are missing out so much when there's only 5 types (or six) of fruit. Past fruits such as Bananas, Durians, Mangos should be wonderful if they get added to this game. some of the veterans of the game would really get nuts with these additions I know that for sure. Nintendo being nintendo, if they add more fruits, they will have the need to push it really far and add more DIYs or recipes including them, but I really hope they don't feel too pressured, because realisticly if they are added, not many people are going to complain about the lack of the recipe, but be joyful that they're in the game. Also perfect fruits and some dialogues about them should also be very welcoming.

4. Ability to turn down DIY recipe offers

The reason that cooking, crafting villagers still give you the recipe when you already have it is quite clear. It is to encourage players to communicate and trade with other players to make it more lively. It's quite dandy and all, but now the game has been out for for more than 5 years and I don't think there's a good reason to push this idea too hard anymore. Many players now already have most of the DIY recipes, so they are not in need of hoarding them anymore. And I know people don't even talk to some of the villager if they're cooking at their home anymore because they don't want to bother throwing it away wasing their time. Just an option if you would want to take the DIY from the villager, and if said no, being able to talk to them as usual (being able to gift or just chat) and the fourth option of ""I actually want to have the recipe!"" in blue, would be a nice way for people to interact more to the characters in the game. Instead of leaving without even saying Hi.

5. Better way to experience Local Co-op

This is probably be the most difficult and most unlikely feature for nintendo to work on. But for now, being the second player is terrible in this game. Thankfully I don't have any siblings who want to play this game with me together, but for some of the customers this would be very, very disappointing. Now that many new percs have been experimented in the Dream island, I hope they can make local co-op gameplay a little more engaging even for the second player.

I think that's the biggest 5 wishlist of mine when it comes to this game. So far, I'm loving the new update and the hotel addition is brilliant. Who would've thought having strange tourist villagers walking around the island could be so much fun. Also a very fun demo to see if buying happy home paradise would be worth it for you if you haven't bought it yet.

If there's any other good ideas I missed please share them, but please don't whine about things there are probably there or not there for a good reason, because frankly we all have heard it so many times. XD",2,1768562968.0,AnimalCrossing,2,0.75,False

So I physically stop the boy and threaten him to be more careful. Then his mother (dark brown hair and olive skin) shows up and I tell her what happens and she agrees that he needs to be more careful. I then go through a door to the side of the alley way and into a house. I start looking for my mom, tqi of my siblings, and the family dog and start to become more frantic when I can't find them.

Eventually I find them in the corner of one of the rooms I looked in already. I've asked them if they've explored the secret rooms yet to which they said no so we explore them. There's an aquarium secret room in my little sister sister and many more rooms that are filled to the brim with stuff (some in a organized way and some in a hoarding way) and we were having fun. Then me and my mom are in her bedroom bathroom (the one in this dream house) on the top of one shelf (right across from the toilet) is suitecase filled with money and over the toilet is another suitecase filled with passports, first aide, and a white round glass ball like thing. 

I asked my mom if she's seen the secret room that's connected to her bathroom and she's said no (though I felt like I've asked her this before) so I tap on the mirror above the sink and it became black and when I lift it up a light green light comes threw. My mom said not right now cause she has a headache.

Then we (me, now three siblings, mom, and family dog) start to explore her room and I get to her closet. The whole closet is painted with with tiny black dots. On the back wall near the corner is a knob which opens into a walk-in closet that is painted teal, there is a dusty pink (not covered in dust but the type of pink that is called dusty pink) floor length long sleeve dress in there with a embroidery design on the wrist to elbow and I just know it's only on the outer arms.

On the opposite end (and opposite wall) of the room is another door that we open and leads into a living (with a hallway). The living room is bear with only a dark mahogany recliner and a big window with clear white curtains. The walls are a light brown with sports team curved (every few feat) into them and as we go down the wall some are carved wrong. Some of the rooms are in good shape but others look run down with rotting walls and broken closet doors. All the walls have natural lighting.

Then we get to the end of the hall which opens up into a room with two sets of doors (I start feeling scared like I feel when I have nightmares at this point) that has knobs the first one we go to the French doors and when I open them it opens into a hallway with dark brown wood with light coming from light bulbs and has stair case their are shadows from people and so we close the door but it won't stay closed. So I try and tie the knobs except they're gone and their cobwebs where the school be. I place different coffee tables in front of it (some made of glass, some metal, and some wood) to try and block the door but it's still ajared no matter firm I try and place it against the door. I then put candles (tall unlit ones under the coffee table and against the doors).

Then I check the other door and it leads to the same hallway so I slam the door shut and start putting stuff in front of it. First is two small bags of cat food, then a bag of cat litter, the a bag of birds seeds, then a bag of cat food. Then I lay in front of the with the coffee table and kinda just stay there feeling depressed for days (or it's days in the dream).

1qedjpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1qedjpu/i_used_atomic_habits_for_studying_and_it_actually/,I used Atomic Habits for studying and it actually changed things for me,"I’m currently studying at a university in the UK, and juggling term deadlines, tutorials, and exams made me realise how broken my study habits actually were.

I was honestly tired of studying last minute and still feeling stressed for every quiz or exam. I’d “study” a lot, but it never felt consistent. More like panic mode every time something was coming up.  
So I finally read *Atomic Habits* (yeah, late, I know) and decided to actually try a few things instead of just highlighting quotes and moving on.

Here’s what surprisingly worked.

Habit stacking. I started studying right after my morning coffee. No decision, no planning. Coffee → study. Now it feels weird to drink coffee and not open my notes.

Bribing myself. I let myself watch a short YouTube video after finishing a solid chunk of studying. Not scrolling for hours, just something small. Way more motivating than trying to “be disciplined.”

Identity shift. I stopped saying “I should study” and started thinking “I’m the type of person who studies every day.” Sounds cringe, but skipping started to feel off instead of normal.

Clear focus was huge too. I realised half of my stress came from not knowing what actually mattered. I started planning the night before and keeping my goals visible. I used the Purposa app to stay focused on my studying and life goals and to cut mind-wandering, which was a huge problem for me. For big-picture planning (me in 5 years, my goals, etc.), I used Notion since it’s, in my opinion, the ideal tool for that. This combination alone reduced a lot of mental noise and massively improved my productivity.

I also fixed my space. Clean desk, phone out of reach, site blocker on. Same setup every day. Once I sat down, my brain knew what time it was.

Results after a couple of weeks:  
– finished an essay early (never happens)  
– studying feels part of my day instead of a fight  
– way less stress before exams  
– and weirdly… I don’t hate studying anymore

Not a miracle cure, but it’s been way better than before.

Well... yes and no. While both are the legendary horsemen of the Americas, symbols of freedom and the frontier, the differences in their gear, diet, and lifestyle are fascinating.

Here is a quick breakdown of **The Real Difference Between Gauchos and Cowboys**:

🔪 **The Tools:**

* **Cowboy:** Iconic for the lasso and the Colt revolver.
* **Gaucho:** Famous for the *Facón* (a large knife used for everything from eating to dueling) and the *Boleadoras* (stones capable of stopping a running animal).

👖 **The Gear:**

* **Cowboy:** Denim jeans, stetson hats, and heeled boots.
* **Gaucho:** *Bombachas de campo* (loose sturdy trousers), *Alpargatas* (canvas shoes) or leather boots, and the essential *Poncho* that doubles as a blanket and shield.

🍖 **The Fuel:**

* **Cowboy:** Beans, biscuits, and coffee by the fire.
* **Gaucho:** It's all about the *Asado* (meat roasted on an open fire) and sharing a *Mate* circle.

But the biggest difference might be in the **philosophy**. While the Cowboy is often celebrated as the ""tamer of the wild,"" the Gaucho is historically seen more as a nomadic son of the land—living in harmony with the vast Pampa rather than trying to conquer it.

But honestly, some of the stuff hardcore coffee fans do seems pretty wild to me.

* WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique): They use needles to spread out the coffee grounds in all sorts of fancy patterns.

* RDT (Ross Droplet Technique): They add a tiny bit of water so the grounds don’t stick to the grinder.

* Freezing single servings of beans in little test tubes.

Some people even use laser refractometers to measure how much stuff is dissolved in their coffee, which is supposed to help them figure if it tastes good (kind of defeats the purpose imo).

One of my friends goes through a whole routine every morning just to make a cup of coffee. It tastes good, but I feel like he’s reached at the very least a point of diminishing returns.

1qedeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyInTheNetherlands/comments/1qedeth/i_used_atomic_habits_for_studying_and_it_actually/,I used Atomic Habits for studying and it actually changed things for me,"I’m currently studying in the Netherlands, and adjusting to the study system here made me realize I had a serious problem with how I was studying.

I was honestly tired of studying last minute and still feeling stressed for every quiz or exam. I’d “study” a lot, but it never felt consistent. More like panic mode every time something was coming up.  
So I finally read Atomic Habits (yeah, late, I know) and decided to actually try a few things instead of just highlighting quotes and moving on.

Here’s what surprisingly worked.

Habit stacking. I started studying right after my morning coffee. No decision, no planning. Coffee → study. Now it feels weird to drink coffee and not open my notes.

Bribing myself. I let myself watch a short YouTube video after finishing a solid chunk of studying. Not scrolling for hours, just something small. Way more motivating than trying to “be disciplined.”

Identity shift. I stopped saying “I should study” and started thinking “I’m the type of person who studies every day.” Sounds cringe, but skipping started to feel off instead of normal.

Clear focus was huge too. I realized half of my stress came from not knowing what actually mattered. I started planning the night before and keeping my goals visible. I used the Purposa aрр to stay focused on my studying and life goals and to cut mind-wandering, which was a huge problem for me. For big-picture planning (me in 5 years, my dreams, etc.), I used Notion since it’s, in my opinion, the ideal tool for that. This combination alone reduced a lot of mental noise and improved my productivity so much.

I also fixed my space. Clean desk, phone out of reach, site blocker on. Same setup every day. Once I sat down, my brain knew what time it was.

Results after a couple weeks:  
finished an essay early (never happens)  
studying feels part of my day instead of a fight  
way less stress before quizzes  
and weirdly… I’m not hating studying anymore

Not a miracle cure, but it’s been way better than before.

* Someone who enjoys a **quiet coffee, a library session, or a focused online call**.
* **Availability:** 1 or 2 sessions a week (Mondays, Fridays, or Weekends work best for me).

**The Deal:**

* **50/50 Split:** We switch languages halfway through. Fair is fair.

1qedc7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antipsychiatry/comments/1qedc7a/i_started_writing_a_book_should_i_continue/,I started writing a book. Should I continue?,"The room was always the same. He didn't look around to check upon it, frankly he didn't even know what was in it except for a couple of things he used frequently. He lied flatly on the bed, laptop on his chest, separated by a rigid cushion to prevent the heat from reaching him and his clothes from clogging the airflow from the cooling fans. He spent most of his days like this. He didn't comment online, he didn't post online; not anymore at least, not since no one felt like his peer. Not since he'd entered what he'd describe as a niche with a headcount of 1. He spent his days between distractions, some more or less intellectual sounding, whether it was pokémon or psychiatry the topic hardly mattered, he took it in because it mattered to someone he used to know: himself.

His life was filled with monotony, he was its architect, trying to artificially insert variety didn't help. Alternate day fasting. Alternate weeks celibacy. All in a bid to get some contrast into the monotony of laying in bed day in and day out, looking at a computer screen. He used to be one of the brightest minds of his country, these days he wasn't. He just had some still viable neural pathways that sometimes mimicked competency he used to have. For all intents and purposes he was a piece of furniture in a room no one visited, with a life that looked more like a lab experiment on atrophy and how to stave it off than anything else.

Today he'd talked smack about psychiatry from yet another angle, people usually find one angle and stick to it, not him. He'd find them and run with whatever came up that day. Today it was the response of increased compliance from a member of a group and how the adaptations the group has to the change can lead to reduced stressors imposed on the now compliant member in the short term. So many different ways psychiatry seemed to forget to check for confounding factors on why their drugs worked. Religion might call it sin, he called it reward hacking and everybody apparently did it if you listened to the sermons.

Was he a religious person? Not these days. He was trying to change things up and lose the attempt to save the world and religion made it difficult. The world didn't want to be saved and people in need of help, he learned, were all too eager to take an arm when a hand was given. He needed to recoup from self-sacrifice, it was no longer endearing and he didn't even have a job anymore. He'll find one soon enough. Nothing lucrative, but hopefully enough to get him out of the house before he merged with the bed.

He was in his early thirties, widely considered good looking, well mannered and intelligent, but society left him behind a decade ago and never looked back. He lived with his parents, which he hardly saw despite that. With his lack of social interactions he started to notice his sense of self losing coherence. Who was he? Beyond all the information, obligations and entertainment... Who was he? Were these even his tastes and interests or just his habits? He didn't know. He went along anyway. One day eating, one day not eating. One week celibate, one week gooner. It didn't seem to matter either way.

What did the AIs think of him? He asked himself whether that was even the right way to phrase the question. It didn't matter, the point was expressing a desire to be perceived, a semblance of it at least. Language was just a means to an end. A way to look at his own reflection.



Throughout his years he had never felt superior to others, he felt different. He learned somewhere along the way that arrogance was the best antidote for pity, and he started wearing it like someone wears cologne long before he even understood what he was doing. He understood now. However he still found it endearing, a link to his childhood. A friend that protected him. That's how he'd started to view what used to be traits of his character: friends. In an empty room they were the closest thing to people he could find. He didn't do it too often though, nor did he fully commit to the idea, maintaining his sanity had requirements, this he had reason to believe was one of them.

He lived thriftily, to use a euphemism. He spent as little as he possibly could without endangering his health. What money he saved up he had gained a habit of giving to charity. However now, without a job, he couldn't afford to anymore. He knew... Yet he ended up giving more than he ever did this month. A homeless guy kept calling him and he just went over and gave him money... Then he seemed enthusiastic about a power bank he gifted him, which prompted him to buy another 10 and gift them to the local city angels to distribute for Christmas. Why did he do these things? He had no idea.

He wanted to show himself that people could care for each other... That the world could be kind. Everyone he helped however insisted that he was their only true friend and hated everyone else for not being more like him, all the while asking more and more of him. He hated it. He didn't even know them, they didn't know him. He wasn't their true friend, he was just someone trying to get the most out of his money. Trying to help others reach for life before they ended up like him, and maybe, just maybe, catch him in their current back towards the shore.

He was tired of playing the saviour, people he helped assumed he had it all figured out because he had a confident smile and gave out money like it was a natural course of action. He acted like a conman, only he was his own target. Like a robin hood stealing from himself to help the poor. He found it cathartic when he hated himself for spilling money from himself. A big old ""Fuck you, that's what you get for being stingy."". Same thing with his own time. They asked him to be with them, listen to their problems, accompany them on their days, and he just sold himself like a cheap whore, a free one to be precise, always available to spread her legs on the altar of good deeds.



Now he was trying to wind down from his exploits, which played a significant role in how his progressive integration with his bed was taking a turn for the worse. He didn't have a life outside of his ""altruism"".

He was tired of compliments, most people sought validation, he never had. He reasoned people probably sought validation because it made them feel seen for their efforts. He never experienced efforts. His mind didn't work like that. He ran a marathon, he crossed half the country on his bike, both on a whim. Effort never even factored in. For him it was always a cost-benefit analysis run on a loop in real time and followed by a recurrent choice: continue. Effort was an abstraction that belonged to someone else. Was it effort if he ran himself ragged? Why? Was effort a metric of how much someone could romanticize sunken cost? Because he did do that, sometimes.

He wondered if there was a light at the end of the tunnel. He reasoned there had to be. All his troubles were due to the drug. The godforsaken evil in pill form they called a medication. He was performing an unsanctioned taper of the prescription. A hyperbolic one for extra safety and better monitoring. Had been for half year now, would be for a year still. He didn't know if it was all the pill, heck he didn't even believe it, but he thought that if he could lump every problem together and blame the pill, tapering it might just fix everything the pill didn't fix, plus its side effects, courtesy of placebo.

At least the taper gave him something to keep himself occupied through the monotony. Like a recurrent advent calendar each month, where christmas came with a 1/6th reduction of the latest dose. That was his idea of fun. So far people in his life were all complimenting his progress and improvements, all the while none the wiser that he had been tampering with his medication. Filing it away and using a pharmaceutical scale to track the pill weight into the milligrams. He had also started taking a host of supplements for mitochondrial health, detox and healthy neuronal membranes, which he was all too happy to let people believe were the main source of his improvements.

He didn't want the people in his proximity to know the truth because he didn't want the worry, he didn't want the scrutiny, he didn't want the second guessing. He just wanted to do what needed to be done, and he needed his life back, and if filing that pill into smithereens wasn't the answer, he was running out of ideas. That would take one more year though and he had more things coming up.

On top of the new job offer that was bound to come any day now, it seemed like his plan to start a hobby as a beekeeper was also going to be a go. He didn't have any passion yet, but he was going along with his plan anyways. As he'd learned, locally sourced honey made for a widely acceptable gift and gift-giving, he was finding out through his experience with altruism, could be a game changer as far as building cohesion within a group or raising morale; and a constant stream of gifts he wouldn't have to pay for an eye and a leg after the initial investment made it a valuable hobby, not to mention it was a nice and interesting trivia he could use to make small talk about himself. If he didn't have a life and wanted one, he needed to look like he had one already, lest he scare people who didn't need him away.



Another hobby of his was picking up trash from the streets. He wasn't doing it much these days due to the cold of winter and his desire to shake off his altruistic persona. However it was still an hobby, one he wouldn't shake anytime soon.

Whenever he went out the trash from the ground was almost calling to him. He generally only answered the call of ""big recyclables"" so bottles and cans in good conditions were the ones regularly winning him over. He'd stash them in the trunk of his beat up car and dealt with them later.

During the summer it's when he was most active in his endeavors, cleaning up beaches and parks from all sorts of trash, mostly cigarette butts though. He felt free in the act in a way he didn't with anything else. It wasn't about the cleaning, he couldn't care less about these places being clean. It was about the ability to move freely in a public space and do something outside social norms. In other words he picked up trash not out of civic duty, but as an act of transgression. That and the fact that it reminded it of a girl. She would carry a little plastic box where she kept her cigarette butts. Hence he felt she would approve of his hobby.

The girl in question was his best friend before he dropped out of university. They were inseparable in school and spent plenty of time together in-between and after classes. He had a crush on her, she didn't. When he dropped out of school and started losing the plot, she pushed him away. He was unstable at the time, reason why he had been prescribed the evil pill, so he didn't blame her. Lately with his identity dissolving he couldn't even find his feelings for her or his longing for the time they used to spend together, they were a fraying memory.

He hadn't spoken to her in 7 years, she hadn't in 8. That's how he knew she didn't want him reaching out. He first reached out regularly, but when she didn't answer he waited days, then weeks, then months, finally a year, but nothing. So he gave up. Picking up trash was the only link he had to her, artificial though it was.

Despite her clear rejection, somehow this girl felt to him like the only person that ever loved him. Probably precisely because she didn't need nor want anything from him and, until he had gotten needy in his weakness, she still chose to spend an inordinate amount of time alone with him.



These days he had plenty of needy friends and he could tell: she made the right call. He didn't hate her for pushing him away, he hated himself for making her feel how he did at the end, when his mind was in shambles; which made him grow incredibly angry at his needy friends when they grew spiteful and resentful for how they were treated when they were needy with women. They had made of his excessive neediness when the world was crumbling around him a lifestyle.

""They hadn't done anything wrong and the women lashed out at them"" more like they couldn't catch the hint after the whole female population had made it perfectly clear repeatedly to them, and forced the women to lash out time and time again as the only way to get them to let go of them with their rabid fangs. He still cared for the guys, he knew their hurt was real, but boy oh boy did he not like them. Pitiful scourges were still scourges and still pitiful. In their loneliness they flocked to him like he had a hidden flourishing life and they wanted in on the action. Truth was that their life looked like social bonanza compared to his, afterall they still reached out. He didn't, to anyone, ever, for anything; but who can blame them? He was good looking, smart, they even liked him, envied him, and he never needed anything, surely that must have meant he had more than them, they were in need, constantly.

He used to have a couple vices, he long since discontinued them. He didn't drink. He didn't smoke. He didn't overeat. He didn't even drink coffee. After he took them out, that's when the alternation of fasting and celibacy began, he had nothing more to take away but he had gotten so comfortable with removing stuff from his life that he just kept going. These days he was satisfied with what he had taken out. If he was a plate one could say he had cleaned himself thoroughly and was ready to start putting stuff in. That's where the beekeeping on the horizon factored in.

However right now he was in a holding pattern, beekeeping wasn't a winter hobby, so he had started using the extra leeway the first 6 months of his taper granted him to watch less youtube from the computer lying on his chest to do something more active, like watching anime and playing videogames. It was progress to him. The evil pill had made them unenjoyable, but he was starting to enjoy them, at least during daytime.

That was because when the dark set in, like clockwork fear started tinging the silence. The fear had no grip on him, but it was there, vividly present. He wasn't scared. He was surrounded by it every time the sun was out, like the darkness was a constant reminder that his stasis would still result in death eventually. That unshakable fear in the air was almost comfortable to him, but it made watching anime and playing videogames less spontaneous; so he often reverted to watching youtube and talking with AIs when the sun was down.



His parents were old. His dad once boisterous and self-absorbed had now a foot in the grave, so he was quiet and self-absorbed. He had some weights at home for resistance training but he couldn't use them because the old man's lamentations of the noise and supposed endangerement of the house's structural integrity coupled with his mother's pleads for him to be ""reasonable"" made the endeavor way more taxing and destabilizing for his social environment than he was willing to accept in his cost-benefit analysis. So they sat there, gathering up dust, as a reminder that he didn't have a home, he had a bed.

This wasn't news to him. When he was younger, still a teenager, he had started an enterprise, he sponsored and hosted a weekly seminar on wellness and supplements. He had printed fliers, he had personally gone and planted the fliers across the nearby town. He had managed to get a hanful of women to buy into the course. He had personally held the course week after week. His father had pledged his living room for one hour a week to him to host the event. However half-way through his commitment the man started to resent not having free reign in his house and kicked them out in a showy display. He had been forced to move to a smaller and more cramped avenue. From a massive house doubling as an art studio and covered in art pieces to the cramped apartment of his mother where the kitchen and livingroom were the same room. His partner had been going over to host the lectures with him in the first venue, but didn't even want to be associated with the latter. None of the women complained or mentioned the event.

During one of their fights he had told his father that claimed him useless because he didn't have a job that he would find use of him in his old age. The man said he didn't need him and that he would have died on his feet. He replied ""Fine. I'll hold you to it."". He never forgot. He was holding him to it. The man's deteriorating health wasn't his concern. His mother kept asking whether this or that supplement of his could help the man, he told her the truth, they might, so his mother kept taking supplements from his stack and giving them to his father, that was the extent of his support for the man. He didn't care for his health, because it was his father's issue, not his. He didn't want his son's help, he wanted his own pride and that's what he'd get.

His days kept repeating themselves in cycles. On top of the alternate day fasting and alternate week celibacy he also had recurrent self-imposed windows moving through the day where he wouldn't use screens. Every four days. It was either in the morning, in the afternoon, or at night that the prohibition kicked in. The time in which the last one ended was the time in which the new one started and it lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes. 5 hours and 15 minutes without cellphone, computer and TV. It was his way of detoxing from life as he knew it. A way to feel bored on schedule, a distraction from distraction itself. He'd clean up his room a bit, maybe cut his nails, trim his beard, take a shower, sometimes play cards with his mom, or read up some book he needed to read because someone gifted it to him and it was social capital.



As a kid he was bullied long before long term memories started forming. The earliest memory of his life was from kindergarten where the son of a teacher there, a couple years older than him, broke his castle made of legos and laughed at him. Out of the home this kid and another would take him to an isolated portico and prevent him from escaping into the open while another, older still, beat him up for sport. He was four at the time. He never once pitied himself for it. He never once judged them for it, yet he was still resentful at the mere thought of them.

When he was 5, he made his first friend. He found him playing a videogame in a gravel road behind his house. He approached him. They were both lonely and hit it off. They'd go to each other's house and once, while the other kid was at his house he asked him who were the kids outside and whether he knew them. He did. They were his bullies and their brothers. He just said he knew them. He asked him to introduce him and the next time he came over he did. Soon thereafter the older kid that beat him up joined them and started mocking him and pushing him around. His friend didn't help. He didn't take his side. He laughed and never spoke to him again. He never looked for him either. When he came back home in tears his mother from the laundry room told him ""I was afraid you'd never find a friend. You're lucky you met Andrea. He's a true friend."".

When he was 6, his bully made a proposal to him. If he'd take this small lizard and put it in his twin sister's panties he would stop bullying him. He had never considered lies at that point. He looked at his cost-benefit analysis and went along with it. His sister went home crying and told their father that the bully did it. He was behind her. He did it. But she was too shocked to notice or care and the fact that the bully was looking at her with schaudenfreude was all the proof she needed. She even believed that was the case. He remembered it differently. His father found the bully the next time he was in town and hit him with a powerful slap on his back that left a clear red marking on it in the shape of his massive right hand. The boy never showed his head near their home and the bullying, at least the regular beatings for sport, stopped as a result. Later on he figured that if his dad hadn't beat the boy up he'd have probably found out that his bully had no intention to hold up his end of the devilish bargain, and that if his sister had told his dad that he was the culprit, he might have been the one beaten.



He never lied. Not unless he needed to in order to protect a secret that had no intrinsic morality behind it. Like the taper. He had many memories of people lying to shift the blame on him. He never did.

In elementary school a kid broke someone else's foldercase and told it was his fault. He stared at him, sitting behind his desk, with red unblinking eyes while tears accumulated in them and started slowly streaming down his face from the sheer lack of blinking; until he was asked by his teacher to leave the room because no one could concentrate.

At soccer practice a couple kids he barely knew had an altercation that didn't involve him. The first kid was kicked by the second during the fight, the coach, which was this kid's father, noticed a bruise on his son's sheen and asked him where the bruise came from and, not wanting to incriminate his friend told his father that he, who was nowhere near them, did the deed. So he left soccer.

In middle school he started playing basketball. Once he stayed behind on the field to shoot free throws while his teammates went back to the lockerrooms to drink and refresh and someone put another's shoes in the toilet, ruining them. The fact that no one saw him around was reason enough for him to be incriminated unanimously by all his teammates; to which the coach said to him ""Either they lied, which means all your teammates chose to incriminate you without reason and you should change team, or you did it and you should change team."". He changed team.

At university he moved to a house with roomates. He entered an altercation in which he didn't fight back as a woman started scratching him and biting him. When his version of events coincided with her boyfriend's but not hers, and she claimed that the bitemark on his arm was fake and he bit himself because she didn't bite in that zone and other such allegation, the owners of the house said ""it was impossible to ascertain the truth"" and sided with the girl on principle. He left the house.

When he started being altruistic people lied to him proactively about what they were doing with the money in order to get more money. He never lied unless confronted with questions that weren't their business, like whether he was taking the evil pill. Heck, if he could help it he didn't even hide information, his privacy didn't exist to him, so long as disclosure wasn't inevitably met with an undue attempt to try to tamper with his agency, he'd tell anything about anything about himself; even details about his sexual preferences. Everything was on the table if anyone asked. His best friend said about this that he was living life in ""nightmare difficulty"".



He had a couple girlfriends throughout his life. Both relationships lasted 6 months. Both ended up with him being left for someone else. One even kept seeing him because she really enjoyed having sex with him; but the spark was gone, destroyed by her rationalization that if she cheated on him, she never loved him. On the heels of this latest heartbreak he had showed his first cracks. To try to win her back... He lied and he did it to invite pity.

When everything was lost he told her that he had been diagnosed with a congenital condition that may have no effect, or end up being fatal. Arteriovenous malformation, also known as AVM. Popularized by the TV drama Six Feet Under. It was a low in his life. He reasoned at the time that she was lying on having cheated on him, so that made them even. He soon gave up the rationalization because it didn't matter to him. He didn't need to explain it. He was heartbroken, he was betrayed, he was being lied to, he just wanted to give her something, anything, she could use to build thoughts that brought her back to him. It worked out for something... She started cheating on the other guy with him. However he was her love interest who sucked in bed, he had become her boy toy. Eventually they ultimately stopped seeing one another as he was beginning university.

He began university with a ton of charisma, made friends all over the place and then he saw her. The girl was to him the most beautiful sight he had ever seen. He decided then and there he had to get to know her. When she was sitting next to one of his newer friends he decided to join him and he started striking a conversation. They hit it off. The next day there was no sign of his friend and it was the woman that out of nowhere decided to approach him and sit next to him in class. They hit it off even more. They spent the class chatting, they went out to lunch and soon enough all his new friends, acquaintances really, slid to the background as he began spending every day with her, in and out of class.

He wanted to see her so much that since she got off at his same metro station he started waiting for her at the metro station. She was always glad to see him. He was always glad to see her. Eventually she revealed that she had a boyfriend. Then she never spoke of him again and he never asked. They spent day after day together, inseparable. They went out to eat sushi. They smoked joints and chilled at the park. When he moved into a house in the city she started joining him home to watch TV series on his bed. Netflix and chill before Netflix was a thing. Everyone knew he loved her, her included. Everyone thought she loved him at school, that they were together, they were the only ones knowing that wasn't the case. She had a boyfriend and they didn't talk about him.



After a couple long distance relationships where he saw his ex-girlfriends a couple days every couple weeks, this one was his first daily intimate relationship. It was new to him. It was wonderful. The only factor he had to curate was not being needy. That was the only requirement. Unspoken, like everything else. She had a boyfriend, if he showed he needed her, she would have to push him away. He held up his end of the bargain for a year, then two. She never broke up with her boyfriend. The first year she never missed a lesson, the second year she started missing about a day a week. It wasn't about him. It was physiological. He told her he had feelings for her, just because he didn't want to leave it unsaid. She said ""We have a connection, but you know what the situation is..."" then she couldn't find the words to continue and he cut her off to ease the burden he'd placed on her. ""Say no more."" He said. And then that event too went onto the pile of unspoken things. Once, about a year and a half into their relationship, at an uncharacteristic point where he wanted to understand more he asked point blank ""What's he called? You never told me what's his name."". She told him the name and asked if he wanted to know more. He said no.

She claimed she wanted him at her graduation ceremony, he was afraid of it. He was afraid of meeting him, of seeing them together. Could he bear it? He didn't know how. He didn't believe it. Then yet another summer came. They were apart for summer break, hardly any contact. However they had their first joint project together, so she reached out, but it was just to inform him to do his part and that she had done hers. He chose to postpone until he was back, it felt too overwhelming to do their project alone when he should be on vacation. He was out of town. He met one of his exes at the beach. They were supposed to go out that night with her current boyfriend and all her exes, weird shit, but it was normal for her. Nothing romantic or sexual. He didn't feel quite himself ever since the request to do his part of the joint project. He was agitated, unnaturally so. He called his mother for advice. He asked whether he should go out or stay home and sleep it off. She told him to go out. He complied. That simple, innocuous choice, changed everything. He went out but the world started feeling more and more surreal, he didn't know it yet, but his mind was conjuring up his first psychotic breakdown.



Things stopped making sense that night. He watched his thinking grow magical under his own eyes as coincidences piled up. He knew his thinking wasn't the truth. It didn't feel like the truth. It had a different narrative quality to it.

He doesn't like to rehash the details, as though the madness might grip him again if he just remembered it too well. Something about the flashlight on his phone turning up on its own each time something excessively weird happened on top of the specific things he couldn't explain...

Everything felt surreal, coincidences grew into meaning, and meaning didn't grow into madness, the madness was already there, it just didn't have contents yet. Only purpose. And the purpose was creating agency and novelty in a world of restraint and fully optimized systems who were too predictable.

Funny thing was, he already knew he was going to break and go insane, he could tell his ego had cracks in it ever since the incident with the bitemark girl. He just figured he'd had two more years, that he would break after university was over and he couldn't see her anymore. He was wrong.

He tried giving away his phone because the flashlight was making him nuts, the following day he recovered it and took a train, fear gripping him as he dashed back home. Nonsense, delusions and magical thinking filled his head. He knew they were false, foreign; but he had those instead of his sanity and they were compelling.

Sanity was just a concept his inner world didn't match anymore, he was as sane as insanity could be. He reasoned sanely, he recognized sanity, but every fiber in his being believed the delusions, he could tell. Everything except him, somewhere, underneath and in-between the madness. He just had to pull through as numbers started haunting him, everytime he looked at the phone there was the number 33, pattern recognition was all over the place, highjacking his recency in order to achieve undue salience.

Back home everyone saw a madman. He saw a madman and, what was probably worse to him. When he opened up the computer to do his part of his joint assignment. He couldn't. He was floored. He wanted to. He really did. He just couldn't, he didn't know where to begin, where to continue, how to continue. It looked like an Herculean task. He was no longer one of the brightest minds in the country. He wasn't a mad genius. He was just mad.



He made it home. The surreality didn't stop, the world seemed to change by the day. Were trees always that tall? Had he jumped to a different world where trees were taller? It was scary. Why did leaves move with the same rhythm as the song he was listening? He wanted to see her. He wanted to hear her voice. He always felt safe around her. He couldn't, it was summer. School wasn't in session. They were meant to be together he'd just realized. He wanted to stop. Nothing in him seemed to help. He was elated at the thought of hearing her voice. Giddy even. They were friends, right? He called her. It wasn't like him. ""Why are you calling me?"" Her tone was abrupt. She'd never had a tone like that with him. ""I-I wanted to hear your voice."". Unfiltered truth came out. ""You can't call me like this."". His mood shattered. He'd never called her before. He apologized and the call ended. Had he written something to her that made this response reasonable? He couldn't remember now... Oh no, he could. He had written some nonsense about a saint with his name the other day... What was happening to him?!

His best friend invited him over; he was going out with friends. He joined them. The evening felt chaotic. Too much he couldn't follow. Conversations seemed too quick, he could respond but he wasn't in it. He just went along. It felt like he was running to keep up while everyone else was relaxing. Thoughts reframing simple conversations into surreal concepts, he laughed sometimes. When he spoke he made very little sense, so he preferred to listen. It wasn't his style. It was his style now.

Eventually the evening turned into night and his friend invited him to his house. They watched some TV together. The first episode of Rick and Morty. It felt way too relevant, like somehow he was every character in the show and everything spoke to his life events. He cried, not because he was sad, because he found it moving. His friend invited him to stay the night. He accepted. They stayed up some more, he was starting to wonder if life was real or a computer program, like the matrix. What would happen if it was like the matrix? Oh God... What if he just realized that it was a computer program and his best friend was took over by the matrix and obligated to kill him? Oh God, he was in danger. His friend wouldn't be able to control himself. Panic set in. He knew his thoughts didn't make sense, but he believed them, his emotions matched them. He had to get some sleep.

They went to sleep. He couldn't fall asleep. Words raced through his head like crazy. He couldn't stop them. What was happening to him? He never thought in words. Now they were racing and he was scared. Only one thing could help him. Calling her. It was late, very late. He was out of his mind. He had to stop. He was feeling terror. Utter terror. She seemed like the only one that could help. He'd tell her that he was sorry for calling her late, he was panicking and he didn't know who to call. He'd confess what he was going through. It would be okay. He called her again. She spoke before he could reply ""YOU CAN'T CALL ME AT THIS HOUR!!! STOP!!!"". She hung up on him. He didn't manage to say anything. He'd fucked up. Now he was feeling dread AND heartbreak. He knew his life was in shambles. His friend saw him unable to fall asleep and panicking and called his mother. She came to pick him up. In that moment he understood, his old life was over.



He was back home, with his parents. His life didn't make sense. Writing to her was out of the question, even his delusional self didn't have any doubts anymore. He'll see her back at University when it resumed, no point digging his grave further. His mother started worrying more and more visibly. She started talking with the rest of his family, his step-sisters got involved, his twin sister too. They were whispering behind him so that he couldn't hear them say how much of a mental case he was. He could read everything. He had no idea how to tackle any of it. A part of him wanted to get angry, that's how he dealt with people conspiring behind his back. They were conspiring to help him, sure enough, but they were conspiring and their worry wasn't helpful. He had never felt more marginalized, not by his bullies, not by those who betrayed him or laughed at him. Their worry was dehumanizing and it left him no good recourse.

His twin sister didn't partake in the worrying and virtue signaling. Whenever she showed up he could feel his bearings come back to him. Not entirely, but somehow with her around things felt more manageable. She was bossy sure, but she didn't patronize him, not like the others, his mother especially. She engaged with him, the others engaged with themselves and used him as proxy. She didn't ask him to parade around their own bullshit. She was the first to place an appointment with a psychologist. He met one, then another, then another. Money, money, more money, no help. He had gotten stable over the course of a couple weeks. Not exactly sane, but more eccentric and impaired than anything else. On one hand symptoms diminished somewhat, on the other he learned to mask them better.

A couple months later school was back in session. He wasn't himself. He showed up, she was there. She was still kind. She treated him like always. The her from the phone calls had all but disappeared. He wasn't well however. He could tell his interactions with her were full of nonsense. Still, he didn't want her to remember him like this. He asked her to take a picture with him. It was their first picture together, and their last. The following day he put on his charismatic persona, befriended a transfer student and introduced them, joked with them for a while. He didn't want her to be alone after he left. He had some demigod delusions running in his head, he couldn't follow anything in class, but he managed to push them aside for the time he was with them. he accompanied her to the train station, they talked like old times, she sent him a song she made. It was beautiful. A nice memento. Then they parted ways. It would be the last time he saw her.

They wrote to each other initially, nothing consequential. Nothing much. Just a message here and there, sometimes a bit of madness slipped through. He'd wrote to her he was better and he was thinking of coming back to university, but he never did. Last time he tried he decided to go by bike without even checking the road. Some nonsense about the universe would lead him there. The universe instead lead him to a guy in casual clothes, wearing sunglasses and staring at him. He got spooked and told him to go fuck himself before resuming. The guy came over and told him he was a cop, he believed him, but still he thought he'd be funnier if he said ""Yeah, and I'm Peppa Pig"", so he did. The cop called his cop buddies on duty, which rushed over. They threw his bike to the side of the road, cuffed him and brought him to the station. He posed no resistance whatsoever. On the way there they put the cuffs on him too tight, he told them they were hurting him. They were. They told him he was resisting. He wasn't. Then between his vulnerable state and his parents coming over they took pity on him and released him without charges.",4,1768562204.0,Antipsychiatry,1,1.0,False

# The Weekend Warrior Problem

You know the pattern. Monday through Friday, life takes over. Work, family, exhaustion. No time for Spanish.

Then Saturday comes. You carve out two hours. You drill vocabulary, work through a textbook chapter, maybe watch something with subtitles. You feel productive.

By Monday, it's mostly gone.

This is the weekend warrior approach to language learning. And research shows it's one of the least effective ways to build lasting skills.

# Why Daily Beats Weekly (Even If It's Less Time)

The science here is clear. Distributed practice—spreading learning across multiple shorter sessions—beats massed practice almost every time.

A [meta-analysis of classroom learning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12189222/) found that distributed practice produces superior retention compared to cramming the same total time into fewer sessions. The effect is consistent across different subjects and age groups.

For language learning specifically, [research on vocabulary retention](https://journals.openedition.org/lexis/5652) shows that spacing out encounters with new words—even if it means less total study time—leads to better long-term recall.

The reason comes down to how memory works. Your brain needs time to consolidate information, moving it from working memory into long-term storage. When you cram, you're trying to stuff more in before the previous material has been properly filed away.

Short daily sessions give your brain overnight to process what you learned. The next day, you're not starting from scratch—you're building on a foundation that's been strengthened while you slept.

# The Habit Advantage

There's another reason daily practice works: it becomes automatic.

You've probably heard that it takes 21 days to form a habit. That's a myth. The actual research, from [a 2010 study by Phillippa Lally](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674) at University College London, found that habit formation takes anywhere from 18 to 254 days, with an average of about 66 days.

The complexity of the behavior matters. Simple habits (drinking water with lunch) form faster. Complex habits (doing 50 sit-ups daily) take longer.

Here's the good news for language learners: reading for 15 minutes falls on the simpler end of that spectrum. It doesn't require special equipment, a trip to the gym, or overcoming physical discomfort. You just need a book and a few minutes.

And once the habit is formed, you don't have to think about it anymore. It's just what you do. The willpower cost drops to nearly zero.

# Why 15 Minutes Is the Sweet Spot

Fifteen minutes is short enough to fit anywhere and long enough to matter.

It's short enough to be non-negotiable. Everyone has 15 minutes. Not everyone has an hour. When your practice session is small, you can't use ""no time"" as an excuse. Waiting for coffee? That's 15 minutes. Lunch break? Easy. Before bed? Done.

It's long enough for real engagement. You can read a chapter, work through a dialogue, or listen to a podcast segment. Fifteen minutes of focused practice is meaningful. You'll actually get somewhere.

It's sustainable. The number one predictor of language learning success is consistency over time. A routine you can maintain for months beats an ambitious schedule you abandon after two weeks.

# The Compound Effect

Small daily investments add up faster than you'd think.

* 15 minutes/day = 91 hours/year
* That's roughly equivalent to a semester of college language instruction
* After two years: 180+ hours, enough to reach basic conversational ability in an ""easier"" language

But there's something the raw numbers don't capture. Those hours are distributed across 365 sessions, each one reinforcing and building on the previous ones. That's 365 opportunities for memory consolidation. 365 chances to encounter vocabulary in new contexts.

The weekend warrior who logs the same 91 hours across 45 two-hour sessions doesn't get nearly the same benefit. Less consolidation time, more forgetting between sessions, more time spent re-learning what was lost.

# How to Make It Stick

# Anchor It to an Existing Habit

The easiest way to build a new habit is to attach it to something you already do. This is called habit stacking.

* After your morning coffee, read for 15 minutes in Spanish
* During your commute, listen to a podcast in French
* Before bed, read one chapter of your book in German

The existing habit serves as a trigger. Coffee → Spanish. The connection becomes automatic.

# Make It Easy

Remove all friction. Keep your book on your nightstand, not in a drawer. Have your podcast app ready on your phone. If the materials are right there, you'll use them.

The harder you make it to start, the less likely you are to follow through.

# Protect the Streak

There's something psychologically powerful about maintaining a streak. Once you've done something for 10 days in a row, you don't want to break the chain.

Some people track this with apps. Others use a simple calendar and mark off each day. The method matters less than the visibility—seeing your progress builds momentum.

One important note from the research: missing a single day doesn't reset your habit formation. What matters is getting back on track immediately. Miss one day, fine. Miss two, and you're building a new habit—of not practicing.

# Keep It Enjoyable

This is crucial. If your 15 minutes feel like a chore, you won't sustain them. The habit needs to be at least mildly pleasant.

This is why reading stories works better than drilling textbook exercises. You're actually engaged. You want to know what happens next. The 15 minutes don't feel like a sacrifice.

Find materials you genuinely enjoy. If you hate romance novels, don't force yourself through one just because it's ""good for learning."" Read mystery, sci-fi, historical fiction—whatever keeps you turning pages.

# What to Do With Your 15 Minutes

The best use of short daily sessions is comprehensible input—reading or listening at your level. Here's why:

It's self-paced. You can go as fast or slow as you need. No teacher moving on before you're ready.

It's measurable. Pages read, chapters finished, podcasts completed. You can see progress.

It compounds. Every session builds on vocabulary and patterns from previous sessions.

It's enjoyable. When you're following a story, time passes quickly.

You can certainly mix in other activities—vocabulary review, grammar exercises, speaking practice. But for a single 15-minute daily habit, reading or listening gives you the most return.

# Starting Tomorrow

Here's a simple plan:

1. Pick your anchor. What existing habit will trigger your practice? Morning coffee, lunch break, evening wind-down?
2. Prepare your materials. Get a book at your level, queue up a podcast, bookmark a story. Make sure it's immediately accessible.
3. Set a minimum. Fifteen minutes is the target, but five minutes is better than zero. On hard days, give yourself permission to do less. Just don't skip entirely.
4. Track it. Use an app, a calendar, or a notebook. Make your streak visible.
5. Protect the habit. For the first two months, treat your 15 minutes as non-negotiable. After that, it'll be automatic.

# The Long Game

Language learning isn't a sprint. It's a years-long project. And the people who succeed aren't the ones who found three hours on Saturday. They're the ones who found 15 minutes every single day.

That's not exciting advice. There's no hack, no shortcut, no secret technique. Just small consistent effort, compounding over time.

But here's the thing: those 15 minutes will become part of your day. You won't have to force yourself anymore. You'll just read in Spanish because that's what you do before bed. And a year from now, you'll be surprised how far you've come.

After that i didn't bring it up, we went out on rides, for coffee and long car rides, i even made her confident on how to drive car on city traffic, then she told me she had past and if i heard it i wont be pursuing her, we both were really comfortable with each other and then she told me her past, i didn't judged her and told her that it's fine and i still like you.
We even made little future plans on going to hill stations and long rides.

Then suddenly one day the replies seemed less enthusiastic and daily calls shifted to after 2 days then weekly later none at all, we only texted and she became distant, i aksed her whats the issue and she said it was nothing. After some more days she became as her normal self and we ztarted talking normally and I didn't stress over it for long,
Then i aksed her that will we ever be together in the future or not, and i was left on seen.

After 2 days left on seen and after observing she posted stories and still didn't replied, i removed her from everywhere and even deleted the Spotify blends and collaborative playlists, sent video recordings and voice notes of playing guitar and singing for her, all for nothing.

Ik it's futile to msg her after such long time and since i myself removed her, this seems desperate but deep within i do want to msg her.

Instead of deepdiving, I took the first recommendation I found, a shop called Refined.

Not only was the coffee great, the pour over experience was incredible. The Barista was so friendly and knowledgeable and clearly had such a passion for the coffee. Then, I had an idea:

""What if instead of looking up more shops, I just asked the most passionate barista at each shop which shop I should go to next?""

And so that's what I did. I said, ""If I only could visit one more coffee shop while I'm here, what shop would you suggest I go to?""

He pointed me to pure gold: A little tucked away shop in a back alley called Untitled Espresso Bar. 

If you go to Hanoi, Vietnam and don't go to Untitled, you're missing out.

The owner, Ti, is behind the bar pouring love into every cup. The shop feels less like a cafe and more like a little community, with most people being regulars that know each other, and the roaster himself sitting and enjoying the ambiance. Then, as it turns out, this unassuming little microroastery inside this hidden gem of a shop is being run by an award winning roaster. 

Then, of course, they gave me their recommendations for shops. The other shops were also very nice, however these two, and Untitled in particular, really impressed me. I'm not sure I've had a better pour over experience anywhere.

1qed96c,https://www.reddit.com/r/screamintothevoid/comments/1qed96c/on_tea/,On tea,"I used to be heavily into tea. This was before prices skyrocketed for the higher quality varieties like Silver Needle white tea or Japanese Gyokuro. I would order specific tea variants directly from their respective countries and provinces. The highest quality teas/estates are found there.

These were my favorite vendors:

If you want the best Japanese green tea available it can be found on o-cha. Gyokuro generally considered the best and sencha a close second.

The best Indian teas, such as Darjeeling, can be found on teaemporium. I usually went for the second or autumn flush varieties, which tasted the best to me. First flush reminds me too much of perfume and I’m not into that when drinking tea.

The best Chinese white and yellow teas can be found on teaspring. I usually stuck with Bai Hao Yin Zhen for Silver Needle, which is considered the best. I would also get Bai Mu Dan considered second only to Silver Needle.

-

I stopped ordering it entirely because of how ridiculous the prices got for the high end varieties. And once you’ve had that level of quality, going to lower end teas kind of sucks ass, which is how I ended up getting into coffee.

On Coffee will be for another time though.

I’m 20, she’s 21, and I’ve never really been in a relationship—just a few talking phases. So I don’t have much experience, and some of those situations left me mentally hurt and needing time to heal. I still carry a few insecurities and fears that I’m trying to work through.

I met an amazing woman on Christmas Eve while bar hopping. I approached her with probably the cringiest line ever—I told her her colleagues looked like the “hippie gang from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and that I wasn’t sure which movie would suit someone as stunning as her. I added that if I figured it out, she could message me.

The next morning, she actually did. I told her her vibe reminded me of Caroline from that film and suggested we grab coffee. Somehow, that worked. We didn’t text much before our first date—just coordinated time and place. After coffee, we went to a museum and had a great time.

Our second date included our first kiss, and by the third date we had a lot of fun together—we talked, teased each other, flirted a bit, and shared a few personal experiences. I asked her to see Avatar a few days later, but she said she had a stressful week. I suggested some times I could do, but then heard nothing for three days. She had warned me she’s a bad texter, even leaving her best friend on read for days, but I still found it frustrating because we had kind of talked about plans.

Eventually, she replied, said this week won’t work, but next Thursday is fine, and apologized for the late reply due to work stress. I kept my response short because I was a bit annoyed and also reminded of past experiences with someone who breadcrumbed me.

Now I’m stuck. I really like her, but I’m unsure if she’s still as interested. At the same time, I want to text her because something reminded me of her and I’d like to share it, but I don’t want to seem clingy or needy, or waste energy on someone who might repeat what I’ve been through before. My mind is all over the place, and I don’t feel like I’m thinking clearly.

So, should I reach out by text, call, or just wait? Or am I overthinking this? ",1,1768561817.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

then one day I realized I wasn't living, I was just not dying.

I've spent the last year deep diving into how high performers actually structure their days. not the bullshit productivity porn you see on YouTube. the real stuff. I studied dozens of books on flow states, listened to every Tim Ferriss podcast about routines, read research on circadian rhythms and willpower depletion. 

here's what I learned: most people are optimizing for the wrong things.

## stop trying to  find time  and start designing your energy

here's the thing nobody tells you about productivity. time management is fake. energy management is real.

your brain has roughly 4 hours of deep focus capacity per day. that's it. you can fight this with caffeine and willpower, but you'll just burn out faster.

**the real strategy**: schedule your hardest creative work during your biological peak hours. for most people that's 2 4 hours after waking. not after you've already answered 47 emails and attended three meetings.

I started blocking 6am 10am for deep work only. no phone. no internet. just my writing and a cup of coffee. this single change did more for my output than any productivity hack ever did.

the book  When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  by Daniel Pink completely changed how I think about this. Pink is a bestselling author who synthesizes decades of chronobiology research into actually useful insights. he breaks down exactly when to do different types of work based on your natural energy curves throughout the day. 

honestly? this is the best book on productivity I've ever read. not because it teaches you to do more, it teaches you to do the RIGHT things at the RIGHT times. 

## your routine should protect your creativity, not kill it

most morning routines are just performative bullshit. cold showers, 47 supplements, meditation for exactly 23 minutes. exhausting.

here's what actually matters: **reduce decision fatigue and protect your best hours.**

I wear the same thing every day. I eat the same breakfast. I start my day the same way. not because I'm some minimalist monk, because I don't want to waste mental energy on stupid decisions.

Steve Jobs did this. Obama did this. it's not about being boring, it's about reserving your cognitive bandwidth for things that actually matter.

**my actual morning flow:**
* wake up naturally around 5:30 6am (no alarm, I go to bed early enough that this happens)
* water + coffee, nothing fancy
* 10 minutes of journaling, brain dump everything spinning in my head
* 3 4 hours of deep creative work (writing, strategizing, building)
* light workout or walk around 10am when my focus naturally dips

that's it. no ice baths. no 90 minute yoga session. just structured simplicity.

## work in sprints, not marathons

here's where most people fuck up. they try to sustain focus for 8 10 hours straight. your brain literally cannot do this.

the research is clear: you need recovery between intense work sessions.  The Power of Full Engagement  by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz breaks this down perfectly. both authors are performance psychologists who've worked with world class athletes and executives. 

their main insight? elite performers don't work more hours, they oscillate between intense focus and complete recovery. they treat energy like a muscle that needs both stress AND rest to grow.

this completely changed my work structure. now I do 90 minute deep work blocks followed by genuine breaks. not checking email breaks. actual physical movement, walking outside, completely disconnecting breaks.

I also use   [Centered](https://www.centered.app) for focus sessions. it combines gentle focus music with work/break timers and tracks your deep work hours. insanely helpful for building the habit of actually taking breaks instead of just grinding until you hate everything.

## protect your evening like it's sacred

your evening routine determines your morning routine. if you're scrolling TikTok until midnight, you're not waking up ready to crush creative work.

I stop all work by 6pm. hard stop. after that it's reading, spending time with people I care about, maybe some light strategizing in my journal. but no grinding, no email, no  just one more thing. 

 Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker is probably the most important book I've read in the past five years. Walker is a neuroscience professor at UC Berkeley and one of the world's leading sleep researchers. 

this book is BRUTAL. it details exactly how sleep deprivation destroys your cognitive function, creativity, immune system, and basically everything that makes you human. after reading it I became obsessive about sleep hygiene. dark room, cool temperature, same bedtime every night, no screens 90 minutes before bed.

best decision I ever made. my mood improved, my writing got sharper, my ability to handle stress skyrocketed.

## build systems that run without you thinking

the goal isn't to have a perfect routine you need to consciously execute every day. the goal is to build systems that become automatic.

 Atomic Habits  by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)
is the blueprint for this. Clear is a habits researcher who breaks down the science of behavior change into actually actionable steps. 

his main framework: make good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. make bad habits invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying.

I use this constantly. want to read more? put books everywhere you might sit down. want to stop doomscrolling? delete the apps and make them annoying to reinstall. 

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI powered personalized learning app developed by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from high quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio podcasts based on whatever you want to learn, whether that's productivity strategies or relationship skills. 

What's useful is that you can adjust the depth, from a 10 minute summary when you're commuting to a 40 minute deep dive with examples when you really want to understand something. It also builds an adaptive learning plan around your specific goals, which evolves as you engage with the content. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic tone that makes even dry topics entertaining during workouts or cooking. 

Honestly, it's been helpful for replacing mindless scrolling with actual learning. Makes progress feel less like a chore and more like something that fits naturally into the day.

I also track my habits in Finch app. it's a mental health app disguised as a cute bird game, but it's genuinely effective for building consistency. you take care of a little bird by taking care of yourself, tracking habits, journaling, setting intentions. sounds cheesy but it works because it makes habit tracking actually enjoyable instead of another chore.

## the real secret: design a life you don't need to recover from

here's what I learned after obsessively studying routines and productivity. the point isn't to squeeze more output from your body through sheer discipline. 

the point is to build a life that energizes you instead of draining you.

most people optimize their routine to survive a life they hate. better strategy? change the life.

I restructured everything around this question: **what would my ideal Tuesday look like?**

not some fantasy vacation Tuesday. just a regular, normal Tuesday that I'd be genuinely excited to live. 

then I reverse engineered my work, my schedule, my commitments, and my boundaries to make that Tuesday possible as many days as possible.

that's it. that's the real productivity hack nobody wants to hear because it requires making hard changes instead of just downloading another app.

you probably don't need a better morning routine. you probably need a life that doesn't require you to escape from it every evening.",1,1768561591.0,ArtOfPresence,1,1.0,False

I’m thinking 3 styles...,"Hi, I’ve been thinking about what a good menu is and how to make a menu more readable and understandable. I’m thinking about three styles and I’d love your opinion.

My first observation is from ordering SOPs: baristas always ask walk-ins about their taste preference, like sour, sweet, or bitter. So I began designing the first menu based on taste tags.

My second thought is from origin maps: we often want to try different beans from different origins, so I got the idea that we can also use origin as a filter to help people choose a cup of coffee.

And my third thought is: what if we can visualize the flavor of a coffee into a picture and use it as an introduction card? That feels easier now with AI tools generating one.

Please share your thoughts on my brave ideas, and tell me which one you think is actually useful in daily operations. I may turn these three ideas into real menu designs...",1,1768561570.0,Coffee_Shop,1,1.0,False

Ok let's start from the very start it going to be a very long story maybe after telling this my heart will feel a little bit less uneasiness ok so i was a nerd type of kid with very strict parents i usually spent a lot of time in my room studying ig from class 6th to class 8th and 9th that's what I do or watch time but it kinda gets boring and in a day i get my parents for like 30 minutes to play games that's how my life was then my cousins introduced me with anime i watched Naruto and before that i was nerd introvert guy with less Friends and not a single female friend even so after watching anime my distance grows more often it was like i relate to the show so much i grow a fond of anime characters so much where i started to avoid real peoples so till class 10th i had like no friends at all before that i used to have good friends at class 5th but classes got shuffled and then I don't talk that much studies so till 10th i didn't make any good friends its like if i exist or not it doesn't matter to anyone till class 10th after that i decided i can't do like this and in class 11th my old friends were in the same class as me I build up confidence and i make hell lots of friends and female friends too but when i look deep inside i have no one who hate me because of my personality i was kind smart so I have never have a personality and when i look inside of me i found a hole that still cannot be filled i have family friends but I couldn't get open to my problems to them in friends boys have their own problem to begin with and family i can't make them worry i had no one who I could scream my problems and cry to begin with so i decided to have a person in my life who could support me in my tough time and i support her so at the start of my 11th my tution also started so I begin to go on first day I check out eveyone but then one beautiful girl came i was mesmerized i mean it was like when you see anyone and be like she is cute like that and on first day of class she used to answering questions she was hell smart so time went on and one she started to talking to me I was literally like there are people who talked to me like wow i had no talking skills at all but she still talk to me and then time went on and on people used to ask her in class who you like to talk to the most she told my name to them when i heard it i was so shocked its like the hole maybe it could be filled i used to travel to a certain amount of distance where my father used to come and pick me so her lane was same she wait for me and we walk together and talk everyday I don't usually have anything to talk but she let me engage and I also try my best by googling what should I talk to a girl lol cmon i was new and then one day she changed her stream btw it was maths she changed the stream and left the tution i asked we will still be friends she said bye you were a good friend i told her i want to know you more she said it was just a month and you are attached to me?

1qed45d,https://i.redd.it/w0ze7go51pdg1.jpeg,The person in my mirror is apparently a catfish,"
So I've come to realize that the reflection staring back at me every morning is a straight-up liar.

Like, I look in the mirror and see this exhausted woman who clearly needs more sleep, better skincare, and possibly a time machine. The bags under my eyes have bags. My ""smile lines"" are doing way too much smiling without my permission. I'm basically one bad night's sleep away from being mistaken for a haunted Victorian doll.

But then I'm out in the world and people are... complimenting me? Calling me beautiful? One person literally used the word ""sexy"" and I looked behind me to see who they were actually talking to. Just me and the wall? Okay so you're clearly hallucinating, got it

It's like everyone else got a completely different version of me and forgot to send me the updated file. They're seeing as some confident, attractive woman. 

I WANT to believe them. I really do. Part of me is like ""okay, maybe they're onto something and my mirror is just a hater."" But my mirror is literally showing me a PowerPoint presentation every day titled ""Reasons You Look Like You Need a Vacation (36 Slides).""
The other part of me is convinced everyone's either being polite and need glasses.

But seriously...How do I fire my reflection and hire whatever version of me everyone else is apparently seeing? Because she sounds like she has her life together and I'd like to meet her.

Just another coffee reflection...

I have several years of animal care in the professional industry.

  
I was told during the interview that they would be interested in allowing me to conduct classes, however, the manager has done her best to discredit me saying to the other workers that she doesn't think I am certfied due to an incident that happened with an adoptable dog that lives with 2 other dogs at the facility.

The dog in question has been there in for 8mo and is not doing well. I have recorded evidence of neglect since I started. Let's call him Bear.

Bear was severely emaciated with hip bones exposed and all ribs showing. Its a championed bloodlined hound with one of the worst body conditioning scores I had ever seen, so I was sneaking him food. And tons of it.

  
He has gained at least 15lbs in the last 3 weeks. Now, only 3-4 ribs are showing.

  
Buuut 3 weeks ago, he was doing fine with other dogs, especially smaller ones. His confidence is so low right now and he's so anxious that he shows many stereotypical behaviors (spinning, baying, self-mutilation by stress chewing and intense reactivity that he has even pulled a toy dog's leg through the kennel gate with injury) and they want me to leave this dog alone outside with other dogs next to it that are low energy. Crazy.

  
I have video of him hanging out in a play group with toy dogs and he was enjoying himself. I started him on snuffle walks throwing a piece of kibble into the grass and did this for breakfast and dinner while ensuring he found it and ate it. Everything was working and he was on a schedule, Bear was doing better.

  
I am gone for 3 days in a row, come back and let him out with a play group of 4 dogs and he immediately attacked a client's dog. I still feel awful about it. 

  
Bear needs socialization because social enrichment is a key component in enrichment as researched by Purdue University.

  
Afterwards I was told not to let him out with any dogs. Ever. 

  
He is seperated by a wall of fencing causing intense barrier aggression and lives in almost solitary confinement for most of the day. He goes outside for 2hrs during the week and may have a chance to spend 30min one on one with a person a day if that and the weekends they are only let out to potty then back into the concrete kennel. That's it. No interaction, just out then back in.

  
Now, he is more aggressive than ever. Like foaming at the mouth in the fear that he is outside with any dog in sight, bouncing from wall to wall causing his paw pads to bleed.

2 seperate people have offered to adopt him since I started almost 2mo ago but because ""their backyard was not big enough."" They were denied. 1 potential adopter said they would hire a trainer to work with and still was denied.

I got a cattle dog when I lived in a studio, but we were hiking, running on the bike, working on behaviors, socializing....he is doing great! Lots of AKC titles and not overweight. 70+ behaviors down! 4 sports he participates in, so, I find it to be BS.

Y'all, Bear is almost feral. He poops his kennel, not even waiting to go outside anymore and tries to attack anything that isn't human. Soon he will snap.

  
This dog is only 2yrs old and it's devastating to see.

  
The manager's brother adopted him, took him hunting one time and brought him back within the week because ""the dog don't hunt."" 

This is not the first time this has happened either. My manager informs me that they have had 3 dogs euahanized because of serious aggression that they were displaying over time. 3! This would make the 4th.

  
On a seperate note, we were informed last week that she was going to start taking earnings from our paychecks for the food orders that are put in for the team. I had wondered how they paid for that since I would see all this food, but was never offered any. I certainly have not signed a form saying that was okay either.

  
My manager is disrespectful to me and has said that ""I don't have any common sense.""

  
Is she right? No. If she were then why is Bear's behavior getting worse and why was he emaciated?

  
What is my next step dog pros? I serisouly need some guidance here.

If I study and develop only in Moldova, the opportunities to continue my education or work in other countries are quite limited, because the country is not part of the European Union.

Romania, on the other hand, opens many more doors: education there gives the opportunity in the future to study, work, and grow in any European country. That is why I am increasingly leaning toward this option.

As for my future profession, I am very interested in design. However, I have an important question: how can I succeed in this field and eventually achieve a good income? I don’t want to just study — I want to build something of my own.

Another idea I have is to open a coffee shop. I imagine it as a space where I could express myself through design, create a special atmosphere, and bring my own ideas to life. I feel that this would make it easier for me to combine creativity with business.

1qeczz0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeczz0,Help me decorate my sofa corner!,"Hi! I've lived in my house for a month now, and am slowly chipping away at making it a home. 

I like the colors I've chosen for my living room so far. Everything is still a WIP, however the sofa corner bothers me even when I visualize everything done. This end of the room looks quite unfinished because there's just a huge high wall surrounding the sofa. I'm still planning to apply a ceiling molding that's around 6 inches wide (so the wallpaper's top edge is poorly measured on purpose haha), plus paint the ceiling and all trims with a bit darker shade of the muted pink that I painted the bookshelf wall with. I will also purchase a 4 inch trim for the doorway arc and replace the current plain white skirting boards with a wiser one, paint all that same as the ceiling, and install a bronze glass door. I am also yet to install a brass curtain rod and hang curtains, and get some of the missing furniture (a proper desk chair, desk light, and a pouf or two. Plus more books since I had to toss most due to moving!) I don't know if adding art would work here or make the room feel too restless with how lively the wallpaper already is?

It doesn't help the plain feeling that I cannot put any fragile items on the coffee table because I have a dog that whips down everything with his happy tail. I would not like to put very many holes in the genuine log wall on the right hand side of the couch, but otherwise I'm open to everything. I was considering this one painting to put on the wallpaper wall, but alone, it is quite small. Maybe an artsy wall shelf to display my fragile glass items? Hanging plants? A rug could do the space some good too, but I have been struggling to visualize one that fits he space. I would really love an irregular squiggle rug since the layout of my couch, table and chairs is not exactly symmetrical either. I've also considered a small hidden shelf behind the couch to hold my water bottle etc so the actual coffee table could be pulled more to the middle.

I've aimed for muted pink, medium wood, brass and orange tones in this room but I'm open to any suggestions! The rest of the house is mainly within the red, orange and yellow scale. ",3,1768561050.0,interiordecorating,5,1.0,False

*January 15, 2026*

This is weird so I need to know if I'm crazy for going as far as I did.

I have a condition of chronic pain. The way I explain it to people without chronic pain is that if pain were on levels from 1 to 10, normal people are at most at a 2 or 3 from day to day where people with CP are at more like a 6. Like imagine stepping on a Lego or hitting your funny bone, that's a very brief but excruciating 8. It's like if you pulled a muscle and so there's pain and discomfort if you move it, but pretty much daily. Some days I am higher on the scale, rare blessed days I'm more a 4 or by some miracle lower.

Overall I am active and operate well. I do own canes but I only use them on days when I'm 7 or above. Such a day came this past Sunday.

On top of my full time job, I have a part time. Due to being physically and legally disabled, I had all the paperwork already filed with my job in case I ever need accommodations. I have a handicap marker on my license plate and the placard on my rear view mirror and the works.

I was recently moved to a location closer to my home. I love my new team. My boss Amy is really great. My colleague Casey and I get along okay but were the same position as assistant coordinators to Amy. The reason I was moved to that location was that it expanded and they needed more hands so they added me.

Casey has wanted a promotion for a long time and everyone knows it. I was pretty open that I don't. Lol any promotion from my position would be a fulltime and...I already have a fulltime job. I do this job to pad my savings and because I frankly like the job. Being busy also helps with my anxiety.

I mean Casey works hard but she also likes to talk over me or rush to take charge of something before I can when I clearly was getting to it. She then announces it. ""Oh I handled that for you, OP. Don't worry!"" And at first I was annoyed but over time I was like alright then, but you didn't have to. I talked to Amy about this. I want to pull my weight but it can be challenging and redundant when Casey is racing to beat me to it. The point was for us to split tasks evenly. Amy said she would talk to her and I don't know what came of that but things didn't really change much so I just accepted it.

So when I came in Monday with my cane, everyone had questions. I emailed Amy Sunday night so she knew but I tend to be private so what I told everyone else was that I have a condition and sometimes I need a cane but not always.

Amy accommodated me. She assigned me tasks that required little to no movement. I was very grateful and got everything done pretty early so I called over the radio if there was anything else I could do. Casey said no she's got it so I just handled admin stuff that's usually on the backburner. Literally replied with ""okay I'll tackle the admin list then"" and Casey said no she's got it but Amy followed that with a thank you to me and confirmation that this would be helpful.

I still needed my cane yesterday (Tuesday) and it was similar. I completed most of the admin to-dos and Amy was so relieved to have it done. She thanked me for coming in and doing all that instead of calling out. Casey made a comment that she could've helped but I said that's okay and thanked her for handling the more physical tasks.

We ended up walking to the parking lot together and she asked which car was mine so I pointed at it. Then she said ""so I know you're not disabled, by the way."" And I asked what she meant. She just repeated herself and said ""so no cane tomorrow, okay? I won't tell. Just no cane tomorrow.""

👀

I stood there like what the fuck? But i was meeting my best friend and just left to make it on time. I met my BFF Joy at the bar and we had a wonderful time. I brought my cane but tbh I didn't always use it. For example, I didn't use it to walk from my table to the bar to request another drink or when I got up to hug Joy goodbye.

Today, when I woke up, my pain was higher than my normal so I took my cane along. I texted Amy that I have my cane but doing okay in small bursts so put me in Coach lol I was having a good time at my main job and didn't give Casey a thought.

I arrive at my part time job and Casey saw my cane and went red. I mean like the way I looked when the Eagles lost to the 49ers lol just SUPER MAD. I greeted everyone and she ignored me completely. We got our assignments and she snidely said to me ""Well can you handle that with your cane and all?"" In a tone that even made Amy turn to look at her like WTF. I said I can manage and thanked her for her concern and we went about our work. Once again she raced to beat me to things and saying over the radio ""don't strain yourself, OP, I did x-task or got y-done""

I was so confused until about an hour ago when we finished work she again walked with me to the parking lot but this time showed me a video. It was me. It was me at the bar last night with Joy. I was just like...um why do you have a video of me - that's weird. She says it's proof. I asked of what? And she said it's proof I'm not disabled as I acted so ""wounded all day at work"" but suddenly don't need my cane at a bar.

What???? I wanted to explain that that's just not how CP works. Like yes I can stand up to hug my friend or get up and walk 3 strides to order a new drink but I can't, for example, lean over and organize a bottom drawer without a chair to sit in. I wanted to explain the CP is just an umbrella and under it are a myriad of experiences and abilities and that honestly, if she had left my tasks alone, I'd have done them. She didn't give me the chance and said ""no cane tomorrow. I'm serious. Or I'm going to Chad"" (Chad is Amy's boss).

I said ""About what?"" But she was already walking away from me and just got in her car.

It's just weird. And oddly Chad would know this is bs because his boyfriend has CP too. I'm not so much worried about being ""found out"" or anything but it's just weird and I'm literally typing an email to Amy CCing Chad about this weird behavior because it's just odd. Am I crazy to want to preemptively explain this? I am anxious ans paranoid in general so I don't want to overreact or make things worse.

Edit: I sent the email and also thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy for feeling weirded out.

Also I will be simply blocking anyone who is saying this is fake. I don't have time for your bs to be frank.

I also texted Amy and Chad.

Edit 2: JESUS CHRYSLER DRIVING CHRIST that's a lot of notifications...

I'll edit to try to reply all here because there isn't enough coffee in the world...

It's morning and I'm still about at a 7 and it's cold today so even if I didn't want to bring my cane, i would have to. I texted ahead so Amy can start thinking about tasks today.

For some common themes I've noticed, yeah my pain scale Lego idea wasn't on scale. Stepping on a Lego was the funniest thing I could think of that hurts so I wanted to paint a picture. I wasn't making a clinical pain chart lol feel free to use your own theatre of the mind scenarios to help people without chronic pain have an idea of what it's like.

Also I don't understand the vague ""don't use the term CP"" comments sorry. In this post it means chronic pain. It's within that context 🤷‍♀️ sorry but I just don't get the issue here or of its upsetting...? Idk

Amy and Chad have both responded so we will see how today goes. Anyway this was my first break in my FT job so I have to get back to it.

*January 16, 2026, 1 day later*

I was asked a lot to updateupdate  when i got off work so here it is. 😬 Today was… weirdly quiet, which almost made it worse. Not sure what everyone knows but they at least know somethings up.

I wasn’t even in the same area as Casey during check-in and i have bo clue when she actually arrived. I usuallysee her as our shifts are the same hours. Turns out she’d been assigned to the back office doing other tasks (hours reduced), while I was put at the admin booth at the entrance handling paperwork and spreadsheets ( they definitely took advantage of because I’m good at it 🤣). So we didn’t cross paths at all at first.

I actually turned ona voice recorder app as soon as I got to work, just in case. I also added a shortcut on my phone so I can start recording quickly if I need to just in case. I didnt wanna be caught off-guardlike before. I did feel a little silly doing it, but I’d rather feel silly than unprepared, you know?

I didn’t see Casey until near the end of the shift, and even then it was barely a glimpse. She looked up, saw me, and immediately turned away. Like full on avoidance. It made my stomach drop. I just turned away and minded my business. Amy was very reassuring but also vague at first. I didn't like that and I think my face said so and she said she doesn't like all the red tape and such either but to be patient because they need to go through all the right channels and steps.

Amy let me go home early, but she told me to log my full hours anyway and made it clear she and Chad are actively talking about this and taking it seriously and I am almost certain she and he had been texting the whole shift. She also walked me to my car and said that will continue for now until everything is resolved.

About an hour after my shift ended, I got an email from her (Chad CC'd) saying that tomorrow (Friday), Casey will be assigned to admin duty in the back office unless something changes before the shift, and that we should not be interacting at all. It's a long weekend so I figure all the behind the scenes stuff will be happening then.

I also found out that Casey already “presented her evidence” That includes the video she showed me before and another video from yesterday (Wednesday). Apparently she filmed me at a local winery during Wine Wednesday (there’s a clip of me getting up to grab a bottle a few steps away, and later another clip of me standing up and doing a small little celebratory dance after a tabletop game win). That’s the part that really messed with my head because hold on when did she start recording me? For how long?

I mean i could maybe believe coincidence once, like, okay lightning struck and its weird. Same town, same general area, blah blah blah. But twice, 2 different days??? Two different places?? That’s when it stopped feeling like my paranoia getting the best of me and started feeling… unsettling. I’m honestly starting to wonder if this is something that might need police involvement, as some comments suggested, and I hate that my brain even went there but I mean what other options are there right now??

I’m typing this from a bar right now, but not the same one as before thank god. It is still local to the school (teachers come here a lot) and it’s Thirsty Thursday, so there’s a bigger happy hour discount if you show your school ID. Joy is with me, and a couple other friends are on their way. Joy had been here during my shift in case I needed any backup fast.

That said, my head is absolutely on a swivel. So is Joy’s. I don’t feel relaxed the way I normally would. I keep scanning the room without meaning to ans when people get too close to me or stand in any way facing me I look up to see if it's her. It's fucking weird.

I’m still trying to process all of this, and honestly I’m confused more than anything...I keep going back and forth between “maybe this is nothing” and “this doesn’t feel normal”

Right now I’m just documenting everything and doing what HR tells me to do, but I don’t like how small and watched this situation is starting to feel and I hate that I'm recording every moment I can in case she pops up.

If nothing else, I’m safe tonight and will be staying at Joy's...I’m not alone and work has made sure we’re separated for now. I guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings. So unless something crazy happens o won't be updating until this is resolved.

Wish me luck 🙏

Edit: I just replied to a followup email answering some recurring questions HR asked...

My answers al ended up centered around: I have never directly or indirectly invited Casey out anywhere.

We are not friends outside of work and have never socialized one-on-one.

I was also asked whether I feel safe at work. Right now, yes, because management has taken steps to separate us and has been present and supportive. I've yet to be alone at all at work. I’m continuing to follow their guidance and document everything as instructed.

I’ll update if anything materially changes, but for now I’m letting HR handle it outside making a non-emergency police report in the morning.

1qecojq,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1qecojq/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Coffee in hand. Mind already halfway across the planet. One minute I’m thinking about a backstreet breakfast I had years ago, the next I’m wondering why we all rush so hard just to forget to live.
Travel taught me something early on:
Most people only see the surface. Snap a photo, tick a box, move on. But the real stories? They’re always just off to the side — in the noise, the mess, the conversations that don’t make it onto Instagram.
Life’s a bit like that too.
If you’re reading this feeling stuck, tired, or questioning everything — good. That means you’re paying attention. Comfort is overrated. Curiosity isn’t.
So wherever you are this morning — city, village, job you love or job you’re plotting your escape from — take a breath. Look around. There’s more going on than you think.
Anyway… coffee’s kicking in now.

Not just physically stuck, but mentally and spiritually flat. You know that feeling where you're going through the motions but nothing feels... alive?

Turns out, real transformation isn't about following some celebrity's routine or copying their exact workout plan. It's about understanding how your mind, body, and spirit actually work together. I pulled insights from neuroscience research, spiritual psychology, and literal centuries of wisdom traditions. No fluff, just what actually moves the needle.

Here's what I learned that changed everything.

Your Body Keeps the Score (Literally)

There's this groundbreaking book called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. He's one of the world's leading trauma researchers, studied this stuff for 40+ years. The basic idea: your body stores every emotional experience, every stress response, every moment of shame or anxiety. It's all sitting in your tissues, your nervous system, your gut.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about why you can't stick to habits or why certain workouts feel impossible. It's not willpower, it's your nervous system fighting you. Insanely good read. Like, I highlighted half the damn book.

The practical takeaway? You can't just ""think positive"" your way into transformation. You need somatic practices that release stored tension. Try:

Vagus nerve stimulation through cold exposure - start your showers warm, end them cold for 30 seconds. Work up to 2 minutes. This literally resets your stress response and builds mental resilience. The neuroscience backs this up hard.

Yin yoga or restorative movement - not the sweaty power yoga, the slow kind where you hold poses for 3-5 minutes. YouTube channel ""Yoga With Kassandra"" has incredible yin sequences. This accesses the parasympathetic nervous system and releases fascia where emotions get trapped.

The Spiritual Piece Nobody Talks About

Most glow up advice skips this entirely, but every spiritual tradition for thousands of years has said the same thing: you can't transform what you don't accept first.

Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach (she's a psychologist AND Buddhist teacher, insane combo) broke this down perfectly. She won multiple awards for this book and it's used in therapy programs worldwide. The core concept: self hatred will sabotage every goal you set. Your brain literally cannot move toward what it thinks it doesn't deserve.

I know that sounds woo woo but the neuroscience is clear. When you're in shame, your prefrontal cortex (decision making, impulse control, planning) goes offline. You're running on survival mode, which means short term dopamine hits and self sabotage.

Brach's RAIN technique is genuinely life changing:

Recognize what's happening (I'm binging, I'm scrolling, I'm avoiding)

Allow it to be there without fighting it

Investigate with kindness (what am I actually feeling right now?)

Nurture with self compassion (what do I actually need?)

Try this next time you're about to blow off the gym or eat your feelings. The awareness alone shifts 80% of destructive patterns.

Also, Insight Timer app is incredible for guided meditations on self compassion. Way better than Headspace imo, more authentic teachers and it's free.

The Physical Transformation Follows Mental Shifts

Once you've addressed the nervous system stuff and the self worth stuff, the physical habits actually stick. Wild how that works.

Atomic Habits by James Clear (sold over 15 million copies, every productivity expert references this book) has the best framework I've found. His core principle: you don't rise to your goals, you fall to your systems.

Instead of ""I want to lose 30 pounds"" (outcome focused, lots of room for shame), try ""I'm someone who moves their body daily"" (identity focused, builds self efficacy). Then make it stupidly easy. Like, embarrassingly easy.

Habit stacking - attach new habits to existing ones. After I brush my teeth (existing habit), I do 10 pushups (new habit). After I pour my coffee, I do 2 minutes of stretching. The barrier to entry is so low you can't talk yourself out of it.

Environment design - put your workout clothes next to your bed. Delete food delivery apps. Put your phone in another room at night. Behavior change is way easier when you're not relying on willpower.

The 2 minute rule - any new habit should take less than 2 minutes to start. Don't plan an hour workout, plan to put on your shoes and step outside. Momentum handles the rest.

For anyone wanting a more structured approach to building these kinds of transformation habits,  BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""build unshakeable self worth as someone who struggles with body image"" or ""develop consistent movement habits despite depression.""

The app pulls from sources like the books mentioned here, psychology research, and expert insights in personal development. You can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles, which makes the whole process feel less isolating. The voice customization is surprisingly helpful, especially when you're tired and need something energetic to keep you engaged during commutes or walks.

What Actually Moves the Needle Daily

After absorbing all this, here's what consistently works:

Morning sunlight exposure within 30 minutes of waking - this sets your circadian rhythm which controls everything from metabolism to mood to sleep quality. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. Just 5-10 minutes outside, no sunglasses.

Protein focused breakfast within 90 minutes of waking - stabilizes blood sugar, reduces cravings, supports muscle retention. Doesn't have to be fancy. Greek yogurt, eggs, protein shake, whatever.

Movement you don't hate - stop forcing yourself to do HIIT workouts if you hate them. Dance, hike, swim, lift, box, whatever makes you feel alive. Consistency beats intensity every single time.

Daily check ins with yourself - 5 minutes of journaling or just sitting quietly. Sounds basic but this builds the internal awareness that prevents self sabotage. The app Finch is actually great for this, it's like a tamagotchi that grows as you build healthy habits.

The Unsexy Truth

Real transformation is slow, non linear, and boring most days. You're not gonna have some dramatic montage moment. You're gonna have 200 days of showing up when you don't feel like it, of choosing the boring healthy option, of sitting with discomfort instead of numbing it.

But here's what nobody tells you: that process makes you unfuckwithable. When you've proven to yourself that you can rewire your brain, regulate your nervous system, and show up consistently, external validation stops mattering as much.

You become the kind of person who doesn't need motivation because you've built identity and systems. That's the real glow up.

The physical transformation is just a side effect of becoming someone who genuinely likes themselves and knows how to show up. And yeah, that's worth every uncomfortable moment.",1,1768559381.0,NextGenMan,0,1.0,False
