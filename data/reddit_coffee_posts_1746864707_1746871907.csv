months? Idk we never asked each other out or have
had many proper discussions. I feel like l'm going
crazy! He works FIFO and I noticed that condoms
had run out very quick considering we don't use them
I bought it up and he said that they weren't as full as I
believed they were and he used a couple when we
first started having sex and then used a couple for
his toy which he doesn't use bc he doesn't like and a
couple months ago there were heaps! I feel like he is
always coming up with excuses or getting mad at
me whenever I feel hurt and he kinda puts it back to
him that he feels worse when I share my feelings
than Ido. I met his friend last night and my bf started
an argument over me giving my male friend my b√≠s
jumper to borrow while we had coffee outside, I
didn't see an issue with it personally but he did and
that's fine I'd love to talk about it privately so I can
understand what I did wrong and to note down that's
something I'm not supposed to not be berated in
front of his mate. They also both ganged up on me
through the night saying I don't have friends,
informing his friend of my kinks and what not and 1
was just so uncomfortable! We played never have 1
ever and one question was have u ever had sex with
a married person and he said not married but
engaged and I said why would u do that and he
explained she was in an ab*sive relationship and I
would do the same if I were him and I'm just thinking
no tfl wouldn't I would have helped her not fuck her!
He's so sweet one moment and then ends up being
this just deeply unsettling person and I'm about to

I moved to Berlin a few years ago, and while it‚Äôs an amazing city, I found it hard to make real connections beyond the usual circles. Dating apps weren‚Äôt the right fit, and big events often felt overwhelming.  
  
So I thought: what if we could swipe through casual meetups instead of profiles?  
  
That‚Äôs how FLIP was born.  
  
üí° It‚Äôs a swipe-based app where people create or join real-life meetups ‚Äî from grabbing a coffee to going for a gym session or a night out.  
üéØ You swipe through events, apply to join, and the host chooses who joins.  
üí¨ Once accepted, everyone gets added to a group chat to connect before the meetup.  
  
We‚Äôre currently live in Berlin on iOS (Android coming soon!), and in this early stage, I‚Äôm especially looking for:  
‚Ä¢ üéØ Feedback on the UX and swipe flow  
‚Ä¢ üêû Any bugs or confusing moments  
‚Ä¢ üí° New feature ideas  
  
This is just the MVP ‚Äî many more features are coming, including better discovery, categories, and more local cities.  
  
Thanks so much for checking FLIP out! I‚Äôll be hanging out here all day, so feel free to drop questions, feedback, or even a ‚Äúhi.‚Äù üôè

1kj6mrg,https://i.redd.it/hb86kmfkfxze1.jpeg,"New to mokapot, low yield","I got a mokapot about two weeks ago and I‚Äôve been making some delicious coffee. I am wondering though what I‚Äôm possibly doing wrong since I seem to have a low yield. There‚Äôs always quite a lot of water left in the base.

Here‚Äôs what I do: I fill with water from the tap up to the vent ring. Put the filter on it with about 17 grams of coffee. I use an aeropress filter on the top part and screw it closed. 

I use an induction converter plate and heat it on  4 (medium heat). It takes about 8 minutes before it starts to brew. When it starts to brew, I turn it to the lowest setting. After a short while the pot starts to leak at the mid section. I then take it off the heat and let it brew until it stops. I then pour the coffee. So it never really finishes on its own.

I‚Äôve been reading that it could be because it‚Äôs new, I need to tighten it more, or not use a filter. 

Thing is, I love the way the coffee tastes like this. I just want to try and get a bit more out of it. 

Oh, it‚Äôs a 3 cup Moka pot and I am using preground Illy Tostato Classico ground for Moka pot. ",1,1746870736.0,mokapot,0,0.67,False

Im an international student applying who‚Äòs graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and sustainability and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Major: Agriculture or Sustainability

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A‚Äôs in every single other subject :( (For my freshman and sophomore year ONLY) But this year I have a 41/42 in the IB syllabus. 39/42 average in the junior year, note that the IB entails college level classes. I know my grades aren‚Äôt the best, which is why I‚Äôm putting my extracurriculars below. I‚Äôm going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. But a cumulative of 4 or near 4 for the junior and senior year.

SAT = 1500

I have multiple subject highest awards and I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC‚Äôs:

I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc‚Ä¶). This was paid work and I spent over 1500 hours doing this (worked for 1 month every summer for the past 5 years), I was paid a cumulative salary of 650 USD, I am an international applicant so the wage rates are extremely low and pathetic in my country :(.

I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop a website to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month, I also received government funding for the website and worked as an intern for the ministry of agriculture in my country for 3 years. During my time at the ministry, I wrote a speech that the minister of health delivered in legislative assembly. 

I also helped draft a set of new laws that will help mimimise wastage and contribute to a zero-waste economic model in my country. I conceptualised them and proposed the idea to the governor of my state. These regulations were adopted by the local government and are now being implemented in pilot districts :)

Wrote and published 15 blogs that were viewed more than 5000 times on agriculture in my particular country and ways that will help us move toward a more sustainable future. I wrote a 10,000 word research paper as well, on the sustainability of paddy production in my country.

School related EC‚Äôs: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired a committee in Model United Nations. In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government, with experience as an ambassador to the administration for 6 years.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children on sustainability and the importance of minimising waste. I also helped donate books to fund a small library, while creating a lesson plan that was implemented on sustainable development. I also helped provide fundraise stationary for all the students at the school.

External LORS: One from the minister of health (super high impact, talks about my commitment to environmental health), my other one will be from the manager of the estate I worked for for 5 years, extremely raw and impactful

Internal LOR: from my management teacher who has supported my love for sustainability throughout my high school journey (10/10) and my amazing English teacher who knows me super well (8/10), I am not sure how my counselor will write but I am hoping for a 7/10 at least!

If you‚Äôre still here, genuinely, thank you :). üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ. Please let me know what you think of my application, I‚Äôve always wanted to go to Cornell. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",1,1746870366.0,chanceme,0,1.0,False

Angela has always been money-oriented, but after our parents' passing left insufficient funds for lavish living, I assumed control of family finances.

When I learned she disliked dorm life, I specially invited her to my villa. For a year, everything seemed normal.

Today, however, I noticed something odd. Her flowing dress fluttered in the wind, revealing a thickened waistline. ""What's with your stomach?"" I asked. ""It looks larger.""

""Just indulging in desserts to celebrate Jude's company going public,"" she laughed.

Thinking of my husband's hard-won success, I accepted her explanation at face value.

""Remember tonight's banquet,"" I said, embracing her. ""I've prepared a gift.""

As a jewelry designer, nothing brought me more joy than crafting pieces for loved ones.

Little did I know this celebration would become my lifelong nightmare.

Jude and I met in college. Though aware he was an illegitimate child, I loved him regardless. Our four-year marriage remained childless - my infertility, diagnosed during our second year. I wept on Jude's shoulder as he comforted me: ""We don't need children.""

Guilt drove me to abandon design and become a homemaker. Under my support, Jude's career flourished until this IPO triumph.

At the banquet, we clasped champagne glasses and walked hand-in-hand through cheering crowds, memories of our wedding night flooding back. Fireworks boomed as I fastened Angela's diamond necklace - my creation for her.

""It complements your complexion perfectly,"" Jude remarked, his gaze lingering on her plunging neckline. My beautiful sister had matured into voluptuousness, but my husband's stare felt improper.

Sudden drowsiness overwhelmed me. ""I need to rest,"" I declined Jude's escort. Back in our bedroom, feverish sleep claimed me.

I awoke paralyzed, a dark figure crushing me. Coarse male hands stifled my screams.

Though repulsed, my traitorous body responded to the violent intrusion.

As searing pain tore through me, perverse pleasure followed - a cruel betrayal of flesh and spirit.

Chapter 2

Dawn...

In the depths of slumber, I heard the door creak open. Though reluctant to wake, consciousness clawed its way back.

Morning sunlight filtered through lace curtains, illuminating the opulent bedroom. Clothes lay scattered across the floor. The air carried faint traces of last night's illicit encounter.

Beneath golden satin sheets, angry red marks peeked through, chronicling the betrayal etched into my skin.

A gasp shattered the silence.

My eyes flew open to find Jude framed in the doorway, flanked by his mother and Angela.

My mind emptied.

The damning marks on my chest burned like brands.

Trembling fingers brushed them as fragmented memories pierced through - ragged breaths, scorching palms, moonlight blurred by intoxication.

No dream after all.

""Explain this.""

Jude's voice cut like frosted steel. When I met his gaze, revulsion stared back. Behind him, Angela's diamond necklace glinted coldly against her throat.

""I...""

Words died as the sheets slipped. Mother-in-law lunged, crimson nails tearing at my hair.

""See how this slut betrays my son!"" Her shriek mingled with my screams.

Angela covered her mouth. ""Sister, why?""

Clutching the blanket, I was shoved back onto the mattress. ""I was raped!"" The plea tore from me. ""I didn't know‚Äî""

""Lies!"" The old woman twisted her grip. ""You're just trash Jude discarded now."" Her diamond ring carved into my cheek as I choked out: ""Check the surveillance‚Äî""

""Coincidentally broken,"" she sneered. ""But redemption exists. Since your barren womb wasted my son's legacy..."" Her nails dug deeper. ""...let your sister bear his heir. Properly.""

The world tilted. ""What?!""

Beneath the roaring Porsche engine outside, my bleeding palms left crimson stains on Egyptian cotton.

Chapter 3

""Forgot to tell you, your sister is already pregnant with Jude's child,"" Mother-in-law said. ""Didn't she tell you?""

""Sister, I know your health has always been poor and you can't bear children. You'll divorce eventually anyway. Since that's the case, why not let me take your place?""

I looked at her. When we were children, my playful sister fell through ice in winter.

Still experiencing my first menstrual cycle, I jumped into the freezing water to save her.

My body never fully recovered since then, leaving me infertile.

Our parents died too young, leaving only some money.

I used it to raise my sister and fund Jude's business. Never imagined the two people I treated best in this world would betray me together.

Suddenly yesterday's ordeal didn't seem the worst anymore. Greater horrors awaited.

I stood up, pushing past them to rush into the bathroom.

Turning on the shower, I scrubbed my body until hot water blended with tears on my chest, though the marks clung like branding irons.

As I washed, I cursed my own stupidity. I'd ignored too many signs, lost in domestic fantasies until disaster struck, revealing my naivety.

Now I didn't even care to investigate last night's assailant. I washed everything away, organizing my chaotic thoughts.

When steam cleared from the mirror, I saw blood beading from the bite mark on my collarbone.

Some wounds become tattoos even time can't erase.

That afternoon, Jude returned to sit on the camel-colored sofa we'd chosen together. Sunlight through lace curtains wove spiderwebs across his face, making him look unfamiliar yet more authentic than ever.

""I never thought you'd sleep with someone else,"" he said. ""You're disgusting.""

""You're the betrayer,"" I coldly countered. ""Never imagined you'd screw my sister.""

""Oh? She told you?"" Jude raised an eyebrow. ""Your sister's a good woman. Knowing you're barren, she volunteered to help. You should thank her. Without her... after this incident, I'd truly want divorce.""

""You mean you don't want to divorce me?"" Absurdity choked me.

""Correct. I'm showing mercy."" He crossed his legs, flashing that smug smile he used with business partners - now appearing venomous and false.

""You've always managed household affairs well, been my capable assistant,"" he said. ""You're useful. Finding replacement would be troublesome. Though Angela could substitute... but would you really let her marry me? Or do you actually want divorce?"" He circled me like a fox.

""You love me deeply, I know."" His breath grazed my ear. ""Though you slept with someone, I can consider it an accident. I can forgive you.""

Sudden grief overwhelmed me. I remembered college days folding paper cranes whenever missing him, palms overflowing by nightfall.

He'd smile at those cranes, kissing me: ""You really love me.""

And I'd kiss back: ""You know I do.""

""Let's divorce."" My voice emerged calmer than expected.

Until he slammed me against the coffee table, hand crushing my throat.

His thumb stroked my pulsing artery, suddenly tender like during his proposal: ""Why? Aren't my terms generous enough?""

""No. I see through you now."" I gasped for air.

Powerless against his strength, I realized even if dying here, I lacked energy to drag him to hell.

Yesterday's violation and today's upheaval, had drained me completely.

He abruptly released me. Collapsing on the floor clutching my throat, I understood - this first violence in four years of marriage would also be the last.

""I'll grant your wish,"" he said. ""But you leave with nothing.""

From the moment I arrive until the moment one of us leaves, we are constantly staring at each other. And I really mean constantly, every other minute we are nervously stealing glances until we catch each others eyes and just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt look away.

But, I found out earlier this year that he‚Äôs engaged, and his wedding is this fall. He had gotten engaged right before we met, actually.

We greet each other and have had some conversations here and there, but we generally keep our distance verbally (the eye contact feels like a more intense way of communicating anyway). But, his friends speak to me, and keep tabs on what‚Äôs happening in my life. His colleagues greet me and invite me for coffees. His own brother treats me like a gym buddy.

If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even more recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion.

I've actually found a Pepe fudder from way before it really took off, and if this account shown in the links below held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth.

[https:\/\/x.com\/AltcoinDailyio\/status\/1654893606292062209](https://preview.redd.it/m5srsj28cxze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6570daf3dc119b724991346cb2ccae22fb32320)



What this means is you never want to pay attention to anything people are saying about something (yes I know this is kind of contradictory to this whole post but stay with me here). Even if someone says that Kendu is cooked or whatever, just do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now (which we've just broken out of today, see:¬†[legendary comeback on the charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1khjdkl/kendu_just_brokeout_nothing_is_stopping_this_now/)) but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to a little lower from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot straight back up to 50-100 milly, which is probably what is going to happen from here seeing the massive reversal in the wider market today.

Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

Look at the past Shiba Inu profit chart from release to ATH's:

[shib chart before and after mooning](https://preview.redd.it/p6qqmdracxze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=302281c3b9b916d90706c5191706a61369fe90ee)

  
And what is KENDU you may ask? Well let me explain...

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

Noob that needs some advice: I'm in the market for a new machine, but I'm looking for something specific.

Currently, we have a Philips LatteGo 5400, but I'm not satisfied with the quality of the espresso, as it's not really espresso, but more like 'strong coffee'. I feel like, whatever settings I tweak, whichever type of bean I put in, it's never strong enough and the crema is always disappointing.

So I wanted to switch to the Sage express impress. However, my girlfriend (who mostly drinks cappuccinos at home) thinks this makes coffee 'too much hassle'. She doesn't like the whole steam wand idea and would prefer to keep the brewing process restricted to 'pressing a button'. 

Is there a machine out there that provides portafilter-style true espresso, while at the same time having the option of brewing a hassle-free cappuccino? I looked at the Specialista Opera, with its automatic milk-wand-jug-thing, but even that's kind of a hassle as you have to clean it by hand every time.

This principle focuses on reducing or eliminating substances that don‚Äôt become part of the final product, but still carry significant environmental and health burdens.

Historical Violations That Made This Principle Necessary:
	‚Ä¢	Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl‚ÇÑ): Once widely used as a solvent and cleaning agent, it was later found to be highly toxic to the liver, ozone-depleting, and a probable human carcinogen. Its use in labs and industry declined sharply‚Äîbut only after significant damage.
	‚Ä¢	Benzene: A fantastic solvent in terms of chemistry, but a well-established human carcinogen. It was used casually for decades before its health risks were taken seriously.
	‚Ä¢	Chloroform and Halogenated Solvents: Common in synthesis and extraction, many of these solvents are toxic, persistent, and contribute to air and water pollution. Yet for decades, their use was standard practice.
	‚Ä¢	Large-Scale Solvent Waste in Pharma: In traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing, up to 80‚Äì90% of total materials used can be solvents. Many of these were toxic or environmentally damaging, used in enormous volumes, and disposed of with minimal control.

Modern Applications of This Principle:
	‚Ä¢	Solvent-Free Reactions: Some reactions can be carried out in the solid state or in the melt, eliminating solvents altogether‚Äîthis is now common in greener syntheses and materials chemistry.
	‚Ä¢	Supercritical CO‚ÇÇ: A non-toxic, non-flammable, and recyclable solvent used in processes like decaffeination of coffee and precision cleaning. It replaces more hazardous organic solvents.
	‚Ä¢	Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: These are custom-designed liquids that can be non-volatile and low-toxicity, ideal for reactions where conventional solvents pose risks.
	‚Ä¢	Aqueous Chemistry: Using water as a solvent is becoming increasingly common, especially in biocatalysis and certain types of polymer synthesis, thanks to its safety and abundance.
	‚Ä¢	Solvent Recovery Systems: When solvents must be used, closed-loop systems now allow recovery, purification, and reuse‚Äîsignificantly cutting down waste and exposure.

Choosing safer solvents‚Äîor cutting them out altogether‚Äîcan dramatically reduce the environmental footprint and human risk of a chemical process. It‚Äôs one of the most practical and high-impact changes any lab or plant can make.

My journey was not easy, at least for me. I studied at least 2 hours a day, squeezing in every minute I could, even while spending time with my family or caring for my lovely daughter. There were moments of tension, especially with my wife, as I tried to balance fatherhood and preparation. I used my driving time to listen to video training instead of music, and even arrived at the office early just to utilize time for study before work. It was tough, but it was worth it, big time!

The exam quite challenging and I aim to finish the exam at 100 questions and I felt I was doing great until 100 question. The exam did not stop and it continues, with 55mins left. I felt exhausted and wanted to take a break and drink some water but I didn't and continue the exam.

Every next button I clicked, I always say ""please make it stop"" - Thinking that I already passed it - I keep myself in the positive side.

After reaching 125th question and clicking next, it still continue and my head started to hurt. I stopped for around 1-2 mins and breath and trying to clear my mind and gather myself. I said ""I am still in the game"".

After reaching 150th question with 3mins left in the clock, I read it carefully and making sure that I will answer it correctly. After clicking next, it redirect me to survey and quickly complete it and ended the exam.

I go directly  to water station and drink plenty of water as I felt dehydrated due to the exam. I go to the lobby after and saw a flipped printer paper and assistant immediately handed it over to me. I didn't read it yet as I am afraid of the result. It took me 5 mins to check it and I firstly saw the ""Congratulations!"" and I was like ""at last! I made it!""",9,1746868615.0,cissp,2,1.0,False

I am married, my wife is my rock but of course we dont vjve with literally everything eachother does (which is no problem honestly, just fleshing out here). 

I'm looking for someone who nerds out over the same stuff as me, I'm a huge introvert so it's unlikely in-person meet ups will be a thing for a while unless you live in another country (which will drastically lower that chance üòÖ). 

Brief summary of my likes:

* Heavy Metal
* Vidya Games (Xbox gamer)
* Coffee (huge coffee snob, probably my biggest passion)

I was a single mom of two, and very anxious about dating to begin with. Their father is about as useful as a fly, only seeing them every other weekend and never following parenting rules/safety guidelines which in turn makes my life harder. 

Anyway : so I met my boyfriend and we were inseparable, he was very kind and respectful and just honestly the man of my dreams in every way possible up until he wasn‚Äôt. I lived alone, with my kids and my dog in my OWN HOUSE in a nice development that was equally 20 minutes away from my grandparents who are very involved in my kids lives (to which I‚Äôm so grateful for because they‚Äôre all I really have). 

My boyfriend lived over an hour away, and by 6 months had chosen to move into my house. He was then driving close to 3 hours a day to work, and back and had school twice a week to which he would come home late. I understood it was a lot for him, and so I made up in anyway I could. 

I packed his lunches, prepped his coffee, did his laundry, I did all the shopping, I mean everything. He had to do nothing aside of mow my small lawn maybe once a week in the summer or ‚Äúfix stuff‚Äù so my grandpa didn‚Äôt have to. 


Fast forward - by September/Nov. we were looking for a house closer to work for him, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to move too far because of emergencies. Well, we end up falling in love with a nice wooded almost 4 acre property, with a shop for him of course - an hour and 10 minutes from my family. We settled on the house, and ever since then he has been a literal fucking nightmare. 

Treating me like shit, constantly snapping on me and the kids, never wanting to actually be around me, the list could go on and on and on. Now granted, he‚Äôs the one who ‚Äúwanted a property with acreage and didn‚Äôt want neighbors‚Äù and he finally got that, but now does nothing but complain about all of the work it takes. 

The property has a beautiful pond, and I‚Äôve always wanted Koi. I have no friends around here, no family no nothing. He wanted to fill the entire pond in with dirt, I didn‚Äôt. He helped me restore it, and he‚Äôs helping me catch fish to remove because it‚Äôs overcrowded. Well. That came with a big price, and I wasn‚Äôt aware of that either. It just seems like anything I do want to do or enjoy he has to have a problem with, or he‚Äôs ‚Äúconstantly trying to prove a point or teach me a lesson‚Äù. 


I take care of my two girls, I got a puppy for us because he hated my dog, like I do all the cooking, cleaning, caring for my kids, grocery shopping, prepping, laundry, etc etc etc. but if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù enough with the OUTSIDE WORK - I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpulling my weight‚Äù. It‚Äôs like the dude wants me to do everything and THEN SOME and suffer in the meantime. I mean did he think he was just gonna have to work, come home and sleep and do nothing aside of that? With a property like this?? 


It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day weekend, and he saw me busting my ass all day yesterday trying to catch up on cleaning the girls room, cleaning the house, making dinner, cleaning up, laundry, shower and bedtime with my kids, vacuuming the rest of the first floor‚Ä¶ he left a bucket of fish on the patio and told me to ‚Äúgo dump it‚Äù while I was busy doing everything and I forgot about it because of the other SHIT I WAS DOING. 


He comes in here at 3:30 in the morning, wakes me up RUDELY to tell me ‚ÄúI have a lot to clean up tomorrow - the animals outside got fish guts  all over the place‚Äù because I forgot about the bucket‚Ä¶ he knows I don‚Äôt sleep well, he knows I get anxious and upset easy, and here I am two hours later and can‚Äôt sleep. I said ‚Äúdude you could have just gotten it for me you saw all the shit I was doing and I forgot‚Äù. He said ‚Äúyou expected me to do that for you‚Äù and I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just doing something nice for somebody when you see they‚Äôre busy doing everything else dude‚Äù. 


I‚Äôm constantly doing things without even thinking twice and I‚Äôd give you the shirt off my back, my grandparents raised me that way. Maybe that‚Äôs the problem, I expect men to men like the old days and I just don‚Äôt think they exist anymore. 
He was sitting on his ass on the couch while I was doing all of the above mind you. 


I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, so I guess my main question for all the men on here is : Why would you uproot your girlfriend and her two kids over an hour from everybody and everything she‚Äôs ever known and promise things would get easier when you‚Äôre not tired from driving 3 hours a day and then turn into a monster the week you move into the new house?

I have bought a Bambino Plus. The thing is standing around here now for a long time...
Now I'm looking for a suitable grinder.

I only drink cappuccinos, rarely an Americano or a pure espresso.

My budget is around 500 euros and I prefer single dosing.

I live in a 2-person household. I brew espresso in the morning and 2-3 times at the weekend, so not very often.

I would like to try different beans, I prefer dark ones but I would also like to try light ones from time to time.

After a very long search, I came across the following models:

Niche Zero (very expensive rather absurd would cost me 700 euros)

--> DF 64 gen. 2

--> DF 54

--> Eureka Mignon Zero

Which grinder would you recommend for my needs?

I am not and probably won't be an absolute coffee nerd in the near future, so I probably won't upgrade anything.

Lucy and I have worked together for about a year, and we have a pretty friendly workplace relationship. We're not super close... I wouldn't even say we were friends - more like coworkers who sometimes grab coffee or lunch together. Still, I really like Lucy. She's a lovely person and I enjoy her company whenever we hang out.

Lucy had never been in a serious relationship before. But, she had told me on several occasions that finding a partner, and someone to settle down with, was something she really wanted. So I was thrilled for her when, after Christmas, Lucy told me that she'd met someone! Let's call him Ryan. She tells me that Ryan is a single dad with three kids (He and his ex have been split up for over three years, before their youngest was born). It sounded like Lucy and Ryan had gotten very serious very quickly. In fact, she told me that Ryan wanted her to meet the kids for the first time that upcoming weekend. She seemed nervous about this, but very much up for it. All in all, Lucy seemed happy in her new relationship, and I was happy for her.

Coincidentally, that very weekend I was attending a gig with my boyfriend, and we randomly bumped into Lucy and Ryan. She introduced us, and we decided to grab a drink all together. Ryan seemed pleasant enough at first. However, a big red flag started waving when, at one point during our conversation, pretty much unprompted, he started going off on a rant about his ex - the mother of his three kids. He tells us that she‚Äôs crazy, unreasonable and barely lets him see the kids. He tells us that his ex wouldn't let the kids meet Lucy earlier that day, but that he was so thankful for how Lucy was understanding about the whole situation. Then, he pulls out his phone and shows us this co-parenting app that he has to use when messaging his ex - it‚Äôs one that filters out abusive language. He said it like, ‚ÄúCan you believe I have to do this?‚Äù... Keep in mind he's divulging this information to myself and my boyfriend, who he has known for a grand total of 45 minutes. Afterwards, my boyfriend and I agreed that we thought that particular interaction was very odd and that something with Ryan felt off in general.

For the next few weeks, I didn't see much of Lucy. I was travelling quite a bit, so wasn't in the office as much. However, I was home this week - so Lucy and I got lunch together on Wednesday to catch up. I asked her about how things were going Ryan? She tells me that their relationship is going well and that they are very serious about each other. However, she says that Ryan is very stressed out because situation with his ex and the three kids. Lucy then starts telling me how difficult his ex is, saying she‚Äôs crazy, a psycho, who unfairly prevents him from seeing his kids for no good reason. The narrative is, Ryan's ex has a new fianc√©, so she is trying to push Ryan out of the picture completely and replace him as a father figure. Also, she tells me that Ryan's ex often calls the police on him and falsely accuses him of all sorts of things - an example of how ""crazy"" she is. Then, Lucy reveals that Ryan only gets to see his children once a week, in a court-ordered supervised visit at a contact centre. She also mentioned that neither Ryan's parents nor any of his family have any access or visitation with the kids (weird - because why would he tell Lucy he was going to introduce her a few weeks ago, when he knew it wouldn't be possible?) To be honest, a lot of this just feels off to me. I suspect that there could more to this situation than Lucy has been told.

When she was telling me all this, I didn‚Äôt say anything. I know that sounds bad... and if it were a close friend or family member, I‚Äôd having no qualms about going, ‚ÄúHey, this situation with his ex sounds concerning"" or, ‚ÄúMaybe we should run a background check on this guy""... But since Lucy and I aren‚Äôt that close and we're coworkers, I didn‚Äôt want to overstep a boundary or make things awkward around the office. So I just said stuff like, ‚ÄúWow‚Äù and ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù in response and left it at that. I feel quite guilty about this. Because even though we're not close, I wonder if I should‚Äôve said something or at least expressed some concern... I just want to make sure she‚Äôs being careful and not ignoring any red flags. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to cross any boundaries when it isn‚Äôt my place or honestly, really isn't any of my business. I'm also operating with very little information here and I'm aware could be making massive leaps and unfair assumptions about Ryan.

Has anyone else ever faced a situation like this with a coworker before? I'm unsure of how to approach things, or if I should just stay out of it. I want to do right by Lucy, but I don't want to overstep. I also have to consider workplace dynamics and how this might be impacted if Lucy reacted badly to my expression of concern.

And before I go into detail, I would like to emphasise once again: every post-op situation is individual. My contribution is intended to give you hope that it won't stay bad forever - at least in all probability.

I'm 34, f, healthy in general. My gallbladder was removed after I suddenly developed pancreatitis in January '25. Everything happened very quickly after that. Operation: early March. There were times in the first few weeks after the operation that I regretted having the operation because I didn't feel that my life would be any easier as a result of the new circumstances. But I always reminded me of the fact, that another pancreatitis might cause more problems.

I am now almost 3 months post-op and in the last two weeks my body has suddenly decided that we have adapted better to the situation. I generally didn't take any medication, but adhered to very strict guidelines, especially when it came to nutrition. It was a trail and error process. Wholemeal products and more fibre in general helped me a lot. That doesn't mean that I can now eat everything again without any problems. It's a slow process. I'm back to coffee since one week. Yesterday I ate chocolate for the first time! And it worked! A great success. I lost a lot of weight, as my weight was normal before the whole process started, it scared me, but it all makes sense, cause I am still on a low fat diet.

I had a doctor appointment one week ago. Which I can recommend, if you're facing general digestion problems after surgery. I also had an ultrasound as I'm still worried that my pancreas is causing me stress again. Everything is normal and looks good again. The check-up helped me to keep a clearer head and face the situation with more patience.

PATIENCE! This is the most important piece of advice I can give to anyone who doesn't have a completely normal life again immediately after the operation. It may take three months, but it may also take a year. I don't know when I'll be able to go through life completely carefree again with regard to this situation. But I do know that it will get better.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments! Good luck and a lot of patience for everybody who's struggling right now reading this.",3,1746867572.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

<------------------------------------<O>------------------------------------->

# INTRODUCTION

 A Cyberpunk Masterclass (for GM) second advice : It‚Äôs Always a Caper. (CRB p.393)

My friends and I spent a lot of time planning heists when we played Shadowrun a long time ago. u/Sparky_McDibben asked me if I had any advice. I don't know if it will be useful for her him. But I bet some newly GM and players might get some good stuff from it.

The general idea is to get the most out of the skills available in the game and ensure that everyone finds their place.

Depending on the heist and the target, the Fixer gives fees to increase the chances of success. These fees are independent of salary. 

<------------------------------------<O>------------------------------------->

# INTELLIGENCE

It all starts with intelligence. Without information, it's impossible to make informed decisions and therefore to plan a course of action. That's why the biggest mistake a GM can make is to limit access to information.

My players are looking for :

* Location plans
* NET architecture structure and defenses
* Guards and special Enforcers
* Entry point

**Passive Intelligence**

Library search: My players always roll for this skill. So I always prepare a table of results based on the quality of their roll. The information is general, but can sometimes provide a specific research lead.

Local Expert: a very limited skill in geographical terms, I prepare a table if my players have it for the location of the action. Information and VD are more advantageous than library research.

Bureaucracy / Business: If the target is a corporation or a public service, they investigate it through official requests for information from the Town Hall or through connexion in other corporation.

Rumors: I prepare a table if there's a Media player at the table. This is certainly the most effective way to get leads. BUT not all rumors are true.

**Active Intelligence**

They mingle with the environment, especially the bodegas, where certain people could provide information or rumors about their target. (Acting + Conversation / Lip reading)

They find out if there are any illegal activities linked to their target (Streewise or Local expert to identify important and ""underground"" people in the area (fixers, gang leader, etc...) and then Conversation, Bribery or Persuasion).

They generally stake out the area they wish to attack/plunder. They obtain information on certain rounds of guard duty, on the people who work in the area under surveillance, on the comings and goings of important people, etc... They then follow one or two targets to identify where they live.

This phase is very important depending on the result I will provide :

* The names of certain employees/members of the organization who manage their target.
* Human Resources weak points: the name of a member who takes drugs, who loses a lot of money gambling, who is unhappy with his internal status, who has trouble seducing men or women.
* Security weak points : a kibble pizza delivery which doesn't follow the due process, an electric failure that will randomly black out the left part of the building, an antenna which boost the signal because it's hard to connect to the datapool, a guard badge easy to steal during is coffee break at the local bodega, etc....
* Location plan.

**Complementary Active Intelligence**

With the information obtained above, the players begin phase 3 of the information gathering process. This phase is more dangerous than the others. The aim is to obtain inside information. They will interrogate, bribe, blackmail, corrupt an insider. (Bribery, Interrogation, Persuasion, Charismatic Impact)

Sometimes, they even perform pre-infiltration (acting, stealth, conversation, E/S, conceal/reveal, lip-reading) to gather information themselves inside the company.

* A media want to write an article
* A rockerboy want to visit and a fan will make it happens
* An executive wants to do business with this corporation

The lead role focuses attention while his ""assistant"" goes to the bathroom and uses the opportunity to gather more information. He also sometimes leaves a few bugs.

Depending on the result I will provide :

* Guards ID and schedule
* Net archi plan
* Location plan
* An ally who will help them the day of the heist.
* Whatever they were looking for

<------------------------------------<O>------------------------------------->

# PLANNING

 With all the data gathered they will start planning.

The style: Based on the intelligence they will decide if the go stealth mode, Fight mode or a combinaison of the two.

Inside work: They always try to have an ally on the inside, which happens during phase C of intelligence gathering. They'll use him or her in the best possible way to sabotage the most dangerous elements inside the site. (Active defense, a guard with a heavy weapon, whatever).

Complementary crew: depending on the task at hand and the information available, they may hire a complementary crew member with a specific skill or piece of equipment they need. Sometimes they ask the fixer to do this, explaining that the job requires an extra person.

Diversion: They'll try to create a diversion to attract the attention of the NCPD or any other protective force. A gang is the best solution. It costs a little money, but they've learned that delaying the arrival of the ""police"" is vital to their survival.

Escape routes: They always have two ways to escape. One safe, the other dangerous (passing through the combat zone as quickly as possible).

Infiltration:

* Entry point
* NET archi acces point
* Waypoints to the target
* Backup plan in case of alarm

Combat mode

* Type of weapon to use (depends a lot, you can't go full ""boom"" all the time)
* Entry point : this is crucial and they spend quit some times to decide where.
* Setting priority. Examples :
   * Kill the Heavy weapon user as soon as possible.
   * Kill the autofire dude ... he will use suppressive fire and that's gonna be an issue.
   * Go the the server room then establish a security perimeter

They have a squad leader (Tactics), they have a communication devices and spare. They test it and have a backup plan in case they have no communication for one reason or another. They have a role in the combat team and try to follow established tactics based on the information they have. 

<------------------------------------<O>------------------------------------->

# EXECUTION

**Infiltration**

1. They want to access a NET architecture and will let the Netrunner do is magic
2. The infiltration team will then process to advance toward their goal.
3. The back up team (guys with low level in Stealth) are waiting nearby.

**Combat**

They keep in mind the CQB five pillars :

* Gaining access
* Making entry
* Securing the space
* Moving to adjoining spaces
* Command/control of the team and the subsequent actions. 

They keep in mind that the first thing that die when shit happens ... is the PLAN. That's why they gather the more Intelligence they can. It allows them to ""improvise adapt overcome"". 

<------------------------------------<O>------------------------------------->

# CONCLUSION

 They like it because I provide them with intelligence when they use the right method to gather information. They like it because sometimes... everything goes according to plan. They like it because sometimes there are unpredictable variables that derail the plan. They like it because it's fair. They like it because I take into account their original ideas when they are credible. ",1,1746867118.0,stackborn_for_CPR,0,1.0,False

I am no doctor, but my ent has no idea wtf he is talking about so I took it into my own hands. I am a fucking LPR mastermind and it seems LPR confuses everyone even on this sub. Here is exactly what LPR is in the simplest way and why it happens to your body.


There are two components to LPR. 

1. The muscle called your LES, sits above the stomach and is supposed to be tight to hold in stomach acid

2. The stomach contents knows as pepsin, which splash into your throat and remain dormant there if your LES is weak


Think of the LES as a bouncer at the bar. He‚Äôs supposed to be tough, not let any one in who shouldn‚Äôt go in. But if the bouncer is weak? People gonna walk right past him. When people you don‚Äôt want get into the bar, it turns into a shitty night.


1. What is the LES

The LES is a circular band of smooth muscle at the junction of the esophagus and stomach. It‚Äôs involuntary (you can‚Äôt consciously control it). Its job is to stay tightly closed to prevent acid and stomach contents from refluxing up‚Äîunless you‚Äôre swallowing, belching, or vomiting.

That smooth muscle will loosen up temporarily when you drink alcohol, caffiene, consume thc, eat a heavy meal, amongst other things. 

If you do these things consistently, aka drink caffiene all day, are an alcoholic, smoke weed all day, binge eat before going to bed, well you‚Äôre LES stays loose a lot. If you‚Äôre younger and dealing with LPR, it‚Äôs almost guarenteed your repeated daily lifestyle is the cause. Good news? Changing those factors almost guarantees it will tighten over time. 

When ur LES is loose, stomach acid contents known as pepsin splash out of the LES because it is open. If you drink a cup of coffee, the LES is only open for a lil bit, not long enough for anything wild to happen. Drink coffee every hour, every day, every year? Well, things start adding up. Your LES is pretty much always open, which causes pepsin to be constantly entering your throat = LPR.


2. What is pepsin?

Pepsin is why you probably went to the doctor in the first place. Pepsin is stomach acid, and it‚Äôs in ur throat when u have LPR. Pepsin is not supposed to be in ur throat, and when it is it causes damage. Good news? If you cut out the lifestyle changes (particularly for people under 50, which seems to be the practical cause for most cases), then your LES will tighten up very quickly, aka no more pepsin entering your throat! Bad news? That pepsin is still there, and there are pretty much only 3 ways to get it out, all of which you need to do to guarantee quick recovery.

1. Strict low-acid diet with no slip ups.
2. Acid reducer medications
3. Gaviscon UK


1. You must do a strict low-acid diet. Your throat repairs fast, but it takes 4-6 weeks for your throat to naturally clear out all the pepsin that‚Äôs staying in there. Bad news? If you eat ANYTHING acidic, which is like fucking everything you probably enjoy eating, well? The pepsin doesn‚Äôt go anyway. Meaning, if u DONT do a strict low acid LPR diet for 4-6 weeks, u WILL keep reactivating pepsin and that shit will NEVER go away. Yeah. It sucks. But 4-6 weeks in the grand scheme of life is fucking nothing. And if u r strict with it and cut out whatever lifestyle choices loosened your LES, then the pepsin will go away. Your diet is the BIGGEST part of this shit. If you don‚Äôt fix the diet, medicine won‚Äôt do shit. You really don‚Äôt have a fucking choice unless you wanna live with symptoms continuously, that shit will hangout in ur throat until u make the change.

Next thing:

2. Acid reducer medications. Famotidine, Omeprazole, there‚Äôs a few others. Personally, Famotidine did the job for me. I took Famotidine 40mg 30min before breakfast, 40mg 30min before dinner, helps reduce a lot of the acid. But this is like 10-20% of the equation. It helps, but not far as much as option 3‚Ä¶.

3. Gaviscon UK! UK UK UK! NOT the fucking US version!!!!! Seriously, you can get it on Amazon shipped from the UK. Why is it not in the US? Because the FDA is a scam and this country‚Äôs medical industry is bullshit. They won‚Äôt approve high amounts of sodium alginate. Why? Who fucking knows, but it‚Äôs sketchy and weird. Anyways, you have to order this. I mean, you don‚Äôt got a choice here. Not only does it create a raft that floats on the top of your stomach (sodium alginate) which literally prevents stomach acid from coming up, aka letting the les heal and stopping pepsin from entering, but it ALSO prevents the pepsin from being activated or reactivated. In my case, when I have symptoms it pretty much immediately goes away. So the 2 factors I previously mentioned ab LPR (tightening LES and deactivation Pepsin), it literally kills 2 birds w one stone. They have an alternative u can buy in the US called Reflux Gourmet, but it follows the FDA‚Äôs rules of limited sodium alginate, so it does not where near the job and it DOES NOT neautralize the pepsin. So this only kills 1 bird with one stone. That is no fun.



Listen. You‚Äôre goal is to

1. Tighten the LES. If you believe you had a shittyy lifestyle, then you probably did. And that is probably why u have LPR. If u believe ur lifestyle was the cause, well that‚Äôs great news. Because it was likely that you did things that temporarily loosened the LES, but did it so frequently that it stayed open. If u stop consuming thc/drinking energy drinks/eating late at night, well ur LES is almost guarenteed to do its jobs when those factors aren‚Äôt there, aka stay tight.

2. The next equation is neutralizing pepsin and preventing it from reactivating by eating a low acid diet. When you neutralize pepsin long enough, your body is like ‚Äúyeah this isn‚Äôt supposed to be here, there‚Äôs no reason this is here, it‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù That takes about 4-8 weeks, but then it‚Äôs over AS LONG as you don‚Äôt go back to whatever shitty lifestyle u had that kept ur LES open. 


You can defeat this. If you‚Äôre younger and under 50, which most in this sub seem to be, your LPR is almost guarenteed to be caused by lifestyle factors. Lock in for 2 months, absolutely no hiccups. Even 1 night of messing up can put u at day 1. 


Don‚Äôt let this ruin your life. LPR won‚Äôt shorten your lifespan, but it will ruin ur quality of life. Sacrifice 2 months of a boring lifestyle for a lifetime of symptom free living????? The choice is yours ",4,1746866542.0,LPR,1,0.84,False

Found out I have an ATM gene mutation. I was told my geneticist consider getting breast MRI starting now. I was cautioned that false positives, especially on first breast MRIs are high, and not to panic if something comes back abnormal. I was also told even with the ATM mutation my risk at my current age is still low. The risk compounds with age. I got a bi-rads 3. They saw moderate BPE and bilateral diffuse non mass enhancement. Recommendation is 6 month follow up. Problem is, I was planning on getting pregnant. That's why I even got tested for the ATM gene. I've been on prenatal vitamins for months, had my OBGYN preconception visit, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is sitting on my coffee table. I've waited a long time to be ready to have a baby, and I was so excited that I finally feel ready. I can't wait 6 months. So I got a second opinion. They saw the same things plus an area of focal non mass enhancement on the right side. The first opinion said since I want to get pregnant,they could biopsy a representative area of the non mass enhancement (meaning there's no mass to biopsy but they could look one of the areas that lit up), and they suggested the left side. The second opinion suggested since I want to get pregnant, they might biopsy the right side only. To top it all off I have a severe health anxiety disorder and this is all incredibly triggering. 
I feel absolutely devastated about delaying pregnancy for months. And confused about how much reassurance a biopsy will give me when there's diffused non mass enhancement. I've talked to my doctor's but they keep saying it's up to me how I want to move forward. How can it be up to me??? I didn't study this stuff. I'm beside myself over bi-rads 3 which I know is less than 2% chance malignancy. Part of my wants to ignore all this, chalk it up as a false positive (doctors are saying 'probably benign"") and just get pregnant. But then I panic at that idea.

How do I make her understand it made me feel horrible?","I (28M) went back home for a family wedding and unfortunately got into a serious accident, which landed me in the hospital. It's been rough - lots of pain, and I've had to undergo some surgery. My girlfriend (25F) drove all the way to visit me and help for a few days, which I appreciated.

After visiting, on her way back home, she mentioned she'd be meeting up with an old 25M friend she hadn't seen in a while. I was under the impression it would just be a quick coffee catch-up or something brief. Later, | found out they ended up going shopping together and got dinner too basically spent 1-2 hours hanging out while I was still lying in a hospital bed recovering.

I told her I wasn't happy about it and that it didn't feel great. It made me feel forgotten, maybe even a little undervalued. She thinks I'm making a big deal of nothing and that I'm just being overly jealous.

Like if they didn't go shopping, I wouldn't have minded as much. She says they were just walking around she saw something she liked and she ran in and bought it while he waited outside but I find that hard to belive with her habit of taking her time to buy clothes.

I fully trust her and don't doubt her and the other guy for a second, but she doing all this while I'm in the hospital suffering was so unexpected and shocking. 

Edit 1: I was just out of a procedure and in a lot of pain I wanted to just get on a call and talk with my gf. Is it not normal to feel jealous and angry that she's unavailable because she's literally out having fun with another guy. 
And I fully trust her when she said its just a friend this was just catching up and not a date. Please stop calling my partner a cheater.

Edit 2: It seems like I'm being a bit immature about this. I shouldn't feel bad that my gf hung around with a friend and recharged herself for a few hours at the mall. I'll talk to her and let her know i was being an immature ass. It's just I'm in a lot of pain and am feeling very selfish. I promise I'm not usually like this. Thanks for everyone who called me out.

I‚Äôve gone through quite a few pod brands available here in India. Thought I‚Äôd share my ranking in case it‚Äôs helpful to others! Would love to hear your experiences too‚Äîor suggestions for other brands I should try.

Tier 1 ‚Äì Nespresso Original
Nothing else available locally comes close in terms of quality, consistency, and overall experience. These are the gold standard.

Tier 2 ‚Äì Starbucks, Illy
	‚Ä¢	Starbucks: Offers a wide variety. The Blonde Roast is surprisingly good, but some others (like the Espresso Roast) were a letdown.
	‚Ä¢	Illy: Classico is a solid pick, especially when it‚Äôs discounted. A decent alternative to Nespresso originals at a better price.

Tier 3 ‚Äì Coffeeza, Blue Tokai
	‚Ä¢	Coffeeza: Pretty good value, especially if you‚Äôre into flavored pods.
	‚Ä¢	Blue Tokai: Meh. Feels like a downgrade from their caf√© drinks or other coffee offerings.

Tier 4 ‚Äì Nescaf√©, Davidoff
Only worth considering if you‚Äôre out of better options. Drinkable with milk, but the experience is closer to glorified instant coffee.

Tier 5 ‚Äì Avoid: Caramelly, Vero, Bonhomia

Posting from my throwaway account because of obvious reasons. 

So, I (29F) and my fiancee (35M) have been together for 9 years. We had sometimes our ups and downs, but overall we have a really loving, supportive and healthy relationship. I can say we overcame a lot of challenges to be together and here we are..

I‚Äôve started my actual job 6 months ago and since a CrossFit is nearby my job I decided to go on that one. 

Every morning my routine is to go to Cross Fit, drink coffee with a group of friends I made there and then go to work.

As I mentioned I made a lovely group of friends whose ages of mostly of them are almost 50. I don‚Äôt actually care about our age differences because we go along so good and they are all lovely ladies who were friends before me joining, they‚Äôre friends for almost two years of going into the same workout group. 

We also happen to go out sometimes outside of the Crossfit, we have night outs together, celebrate birthdays, share a group chat on whatsapp, etc.. (you get the vibe). 

Now, there is one lady (40F) we‚Äôll call her Becca, who is really attractive and has a great body. For context: based on rumors (since I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone) she was married, but then decided to leave her husband and marry her sister‚Äôs husband who got her pregnant. She now shares a son (17M) with his sister‚Äôs husband, whom I don‚Äôt know if is still married with him. 

Becca now lives only with her son, she has her own apartment and also is still involved with her parents and sisters, so it means they didn‚Äôt cut her off. 

I heard this story from one of our group members but Becca don‚Äôt know if any of us know her history because as long as I am a part of the group we all are loving and caring with her just like we are with one another. 

I am not the type to judge people by their own choices and I never once in my time knowing her, did not say backhanded compliment, comment or make her feel bad. 

Becca, on the other hand, had made some remarks about me. In the beginning she was really distant towards me, she also had nothing to say when someone gave me a compliment. There is a friend in the group, let‚Äôs call her Ella (50F), who is the most genuine person I‚Äôve ever met, she is the most selfless person, caring and loving. 

When I started going on workouts she was the first one to talk to me and step by step all of the other members of the group started to warm me up and welcome me, except Becca. 

Ella always says that if she had one ideal daughter in law for her son, or if she ever had her own daughter she would love to look like me, to be like me, Ella always makes sure to compliment me, to hug me, she even send me reels on insta with those lovely quotes (lol I love her). Other members also love and respect me, give me compliments, they are lovely ladies just like that. 

When they do that, Becca always go silent. Sometimes she says as a joke ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compliment her this much she might not touch the ground‚Äù. 

I always brushed her off, and I am aware that some people suffer from jealousy so I am not here to fix them nor to call them out why they are feeling that way. 

After day passed, Becca started to talk to me more, open up more, and I really thought she is past that jealousy thing. 

Now, back to the main reason why I am doing this post, I felt like a little context and background is needed so you can all have the full picture. 

One day she stopped by my office (I work alone and she lives 3 minutes away). So I ordered some coffe for us since I had no clients, during that time my fiancee came to visit me. I introduced them and since a client came, I left them to talk for a couple of minutes until I finish my task. My fiancee in the general is really talkative and he jokes around with people, and I could hear them talk, he talked like he is talking to a friend of mine, nothing flirty, nothing fishy. 

Becca‚Äôs energy COMPLETELY changed, she laughed at him, she changed her attitude, but I brushed it off. 

When I joined them, my fiancee sat near me and hugged me, Becca stayed a little more and then got up and she was gone. 

That same day in the evening she felt the need to write on our group chat ‚Äúhey, guess who I hang out today with, (my name)‚Äôs man, she is nothing compared to him * laughing emoji *‚Äù. 

I replied: ‚Äúlol, Becca, do you want me to give him to you?‚Äù 

Becca: ‚Äúnooo, you would kill me, I want to live a little longer hahah‚Äù. 

Other group members started to say how I deserve my fiancee to be perfect since I am perfect and how there could never be a good enough guy for me (they didn‚Äôt meet my fiancee). 

I dropped it and didn‚Äôt reply any further, and just after that Becca replied to them saying ‚ÄúI am just kidding, (my name) is a superstar, I really liked that he was friendly, but he doesn‚Äôt compare to our friend, I hope they have a lifetime together‚Äù. 

I liked her message and that was it for the day. The next morning, she mentioned to another friend (who is not in the group chat) the same thing, and the friend ironically said the same thing that other group members said about me. 

Becca laughed it off and used it as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. 

After that day, I did not change my behavior towards Becca, I still was the same with her and she left it at that. She also didn‚Äôt mention my fiancee anymore, only if I mentioned him sometimes. 

We started to hang out more, I really like her humour, she started to laugh with me more, she visited me at my workplace time to time and I thought that I overthinked the situation about my fiancee. I really grew to like her and in some kind of situations I even helped her. 

Two nights ago, we had a girls night out because of one of the group members birthday. After hanging out, I talked on the phone with my fiancee because he said he‚Äôll come and get me when I‚Äôm done and since I live a little more far from the other girls, I was the first one to leave the table, I greeted every one of them, and Becca just when I was about to leave, said in a joking tone ‚ÄúIs your fiancee outside waiting for you? Can I come with you?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes, do you want to go instead of me? But I am afraid you‚Äôll be heartbroken‚Äù I also said in a joking voice. She laughed and said ‚Äúnever say never‚Äù, I laughed and said ‚Äútry it‚Äù. 

Now, we have these dynamics in the group to mock each other, but Becca said anything like that to anyone else, except me. 

I felt a little rage coming from inside but I didn‚Äôt let that to show off and I left the table smiling. 

I know, that what I felt is on me, but for the first time I am in this situation where a friend might have a thing for my man. 

I know I may be overreacting or insecure, but given the history of Becca, I know if she didn‚Äôt have a problem to cross a boundary with her sister‚Äôs husband, she won‚Äôt have a problem breaking a boundary with my relationship either. 

I can‚Äôt control how she feels, the only thing I can control is how I respond to that situation. I also know that I can‚Äôt stop the world from hitting my fiancee, I should only be concerned about how he reacts to it, which speaking of, he never gave me any doubts.

I‚Äôve been brewing with a moccamaster using fresh beans from a local specialty roaster here in London for about 6 months. I ask the barista to grind it for Moccamaster on their commercial grinder. I‚Äôve brewed some cups immediately after buying the coffee, so freshness shouldn‚Äôt be the issue - but I still get the same, slightly underwhelming result.

My setup:
	‚Ä¢	32‚Äì34g coffee to 500ml filtered water
	‚Ä¢	Paper filter, rinsed with boiling water
	‚Ä¢	Start brew and manually stir/agitate during the bloom (first 20‚Äì30 seconds) for even saturation
	‚Ä¢	Let it brew through normally on slow (no bypass or pause)

The issue:
Despite the fresh beans, good ratio, and care with technique, the coffee consistently tastes muddy and dull - lacking the clarity, brightness or definition I get from a barista-made filter.

Is this likely down to the grind (possibly too fine?), or the nature of the beans (some are natural processed)? I‚Äôm loathed to chuck ¬£00‚Äôs at a grinder as I‚Äôm essentially getting the use of one at the coffee shop 2mins round the corner and it doesn‚Äôt seem like this is the problem. Could it really be down to just needing to use filtered water?

Appreciate your help! ",3,1746864717.0,Moccamaster,3,1.0,False
