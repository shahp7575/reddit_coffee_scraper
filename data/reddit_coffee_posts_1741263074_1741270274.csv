1j4w9ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/brainrotalot2/comments/1j4w9ct/the_5_lesson_that_changed_everything/,The $5 Lesson That Changed Everything,"Jordan grew up believing money was **complicated.** His parents always struggled—bills stacked up, arguments about rent filled the house, and “we can’t afford that” was practically a family motto.

So when he got his first paycheck at 18, he **spent it all** in a week. Fast food, sneakers, video games—it felt good, until he was broke again.

One day, his grandfather handed him **a $5 bill.**

*""What can you do with this?""* he asked.

Jordan shrugged. *""Buy coffee, maybe a snack?""*

His grandfather smiled. *""Or you can double it. Save it. Make it work for you. Every dollar is a choice.""*

That stuck with him.

Jordan started small—saving $5 here, skipping unnecessary expenses there. Instead of buying fast food every day, he packed lunch. Instead of buying things he didn’t need, he put money aside for **things that actually mattered**—a reliable car, paying bills on time, and staying out of debt.

Over time, the small habits added up. By his late 20s, he wasn’t stressed about **rent or unexpected expenses.** He had enough saved to handle car repairs, take a trip without worry, and even help his mom when she needed it.

Looking back, it wasn’t about the $5. It was about **changing his mindset.**

Because financial freedom isn’t about being rich.

**It’s about making smarter choices—one dollar**

1j4w5j5,https://i.redd.it/o2idhav7t2ne1.jpeg,Cate+Ty Podcast Ep 3 Lindsie Chrisley’s Life Story,"I’m 2/3 through and this was interesting enough of a listen, I picked it back up this morning after listening to the first 2/3 in the car last night… 

While elephant in the room, it’s a little weird to be interviewing the other KAILR Network hosts, this was a well produced episode. 

While Lindsie isn’t originally from the Teen Mom universe, she’s been around quite awhile and it was interesting to hear the perspective of a parent worried about reality tv exposure for their child, navigating parental boundaries, and the aftermath of a divorce. 

Tyler is more engaged in this episode than the Becky one and he and Cate both keep the conversation flowing, but Lindsie is definitely doing the heavy lifting. 

I’m a Michigander and the Michigan accents are running thick 😅

The commercial breaks are still at awkward spots. There aren’t so many commercials it’s not tolerable (Office Ladies was a podcast I was excited about but the commercials were constant), but I’d like them to get the break times more organic. 

There’s about 15min left and Cate and Ty are discussing it back and it falling off the rails a little for a minute, but they’re getting it back on track. The mental health discussion is helpful. 

Overall I give it 🌯🌯🌯 out of 5 burritos. 

Lindsie comes off as a fairly tough, opinionated person on Coffee Convos, I gave a bonus burrito for how vulnerable and open she was on here, especially with navigating her depression.

💣 The most surprising part was Lindsie talking about The Chrisley Knows Best production not wanting to allow her to use her own last name on Coffee Convos. 

⚠️ There’s a moment Lindsie talks about her dad Todd Chrisley setting boundaries for the step mom with his kids and Tyler has a BIG reaction and it’s kind of telling based on all the baggage we know is going on. 

There’s actually a good takeaway with this one - if you notice someone in your life is struggling with depression, talk to them about it, don’t let worry about embarrassing them stop you as you could help save their life.",0,1741269836.0,TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,0,0.5,False

However, due to the fact that I am reasonably young my jaw and chin have noticeably grown where my chin was weak beforehand but is now rather prominent and far wider. I notice that I cannot block my airway AT ALL when relaxing my tongue where before I could very easily achieve this UARS ‘coffee straw’ airway by doing such.

1j4w3ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1j4w3ev/just_something_to_make_it_better/,Just something to make it better,"I used to be the systems admin/engineer/everything at a company of \~300 people. Most of them were remote sales people with laptops, and most of the sales people had unpaid interns in this training program that, to me, seemed like hell. The interns were provisioned with any computer that I could cobble together. Part of the program was getting the commissions enough to earn an office and a computer (seemed stupid to me, but not my policies). These things were mid grade Dell workstations that when they were new, and had long surpassed their useful lifecycle. 

The president, the co-owner, the VP, HR, and my leadership will not allow new equipment allocation to the interns under any circumstances. Not even $10 keyboards that come with new computers. It has to be decommed from an employee or sales rep to get into the hands of the interns.

Well, another quirk about this company is that your service priority was determined by your performance in sales. Which meant that mentors would advocate for their interns and there was constant squabbling over who got less crappy equipment and nearly every sales rep was a self-important jackass.

One rep was having a particularly good year and one of his interns had one of the better crap boxes, but complained about it constantly. I already pool RAM and swap processors whenever possible. So this rep, (we'll call him John) calls me into his office every week or so to disparage me because *I'm* the one responsible for his intern being held back. (note that the reps are allowed to pay for gear for interns if they want to pay for it, but they NEVER do)

Eventually the company VP (a self-important jackass that the president liked but failed utterly as a salesperson) calls me into his office to discuss my attitude. I'm *extremely* professional at work and took the beating. VP knew the situation but took John's side and ordered me to improve the situation in some way. Do something, anything, to ""enable the success of the intern. Make sacrifices if you have to.""

Fine.

I had an off-brand computer case in my office that was gathering dust. It was there when I started and I had no idea where it came from. Over the weekend I transplanted everything in the intern's workstation to the computer case. Since it was coming from a Dell workstation I had to remove all the slides and parts that make the thing easy to service, but I made it fit. It was a rush job, and a monstrosity, and I got to bill time for it. I had to fashion a metal shim to cover the holes that the mainboard didn't extend to. But it worked. Same insides. Oh, and because it was such a mess I had to leave a stick of RAM out since it wouldn't fit. Oh, and I ""accidentally"" dropped the processor that I didn't need to remove and had to put in another processor from another machine that was slightly slower. Carefully removed the Windows sticker from the old case and put it on the new case, too.

Got into work early on Monday and plugged it in. A few hours later I got called down to John's office and figured I was in for it. The thing was even shittier than before but in a different (not better) container.

Intern was beaming, John was beaming, VP was beaming. They thanked me for my hard work and gave me a $5 gift card to a coffee shop.",4,1741269667.0,MaliciousCompliance,2,0.83,False

The new owner of Kissing Bridge All Seasons Resort says overnight accommodations are likely as development plans begin for the Glenwood ski resort.

That’s in addition to more new equipment, technology and year-round activities, on top of the improvements already invested in recent months since the [$1.06 million real estate sale](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2024/10/31/kissing-bridge-ski-resort-sold-glenwood.html) was completed in fall 2024.

A local development partnership is planning to build a $6 million, 28-unit apartment building at 303 Lafayette Ave., Buffalo.

The parcel would be combined with 140, 144 and 150 Hoyt St. to create a lot just under 0.6 acres to house Lafayette Lofts, a four-story, 32,731-square-foot building.

303 Lafayette Ave. used to house Grace Universalist Church, which was recently demolished due to ""unsafe structural conditions,"" according to the project application submitted by developer 303 Lafayette LLC.

The city Planning Board is scheduled to discuss the project Monday.

303 Lafayette LLC bought the property for $60,000 in 2022, shortly after the city approved demolition of the church building.

Carmina Wood Design is handling design work on the building, which would consist of 21 one-bedroom units and seven two-bedroom units. The plan also calls for a 31-space parking lot.

Construction is estimated to take about 18 months, according to the project application.

“It’s going to cost a $1 million to demolish the building,” said Bernice. “The City does not have that kind of money, which buys us some time. The pressure of demolition is currently off the table, but for how long? Wonder Bread won’t last more than a couple more winters. Smuckers seems to have lost interest and has not been communicating with anyone, which is good because they wanted it for parking. I have asked PBN if we could put it under a due diligence contract, to see if we could help broker a deal. If that was the case, we would have the keys and access to the building to show interested parties around. The PBN board has said that they are open to the idea, but what does that look like?”

Other factors include evolving consumer preferences for health care locations in more convenient locations closer to home, and the lower cost and higher efficiencies tied to performing procedures in the outpatient setting.

So I found capsules that are mixed with black seed oil. I’ve been taking them for about a week (recommended dose is 2 capsules daily). And I have recently started experiencing stomach cramping and like my insides were bubbling. I’m assuming it’s the oil of oregano so figure I’ll cut it out and see if it stops.

1j4vi0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j4vi0l/im_a_male_escort_and_i_have_a_crush_on_my_client/,"I'm a male escort and I have a crush on my client: Part 2? (Tiny update on my plan, and back story)","I just want to say thank you for all the replies. Honestly, it’s really opened my eyes. I think I was very lost in my feelings, and I truly appreciate everyone encouraging me to go for it, as well as those who reminded me to be careful and respect her boundaries. That’s really important to me. The last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable or like I’ve overstepped, so I want to be very mindful of that.

I also just want to say thank you for all your love and support. I'm a bit shocked. You guys are incredible people. 

Someone suggested a book for me to read, and someone else suggested that I HEAL... Yes. I do think this is the crux of the matter. Thank you for that. I looked into the book and honestly, I think it's exactly my current experience. 

I got a lot of DMs asking for my personal experience and also, how to become a male escort. I thought I'd give a tiny update on what I plan to do, and then my story, in case people might be interested. 

Sorry of its long and jumbled. I've only ever really spoken about some of these things with my current client. 

Okay so my idea: I don’t know if it’s going to work, but I think it allows me to put the idea there in a careful way. Based on how she reacts, I might then make the decision to drop her as a client because I don’t think this situation is healthy for me. Some people have pointed out that this isn’t a great way to do business as an escort, and I completely agree. 

Honestly, if I’m being real, I don’t think I'm a good escort anyway 😄 businesses wise.

So, here’s my plan. My birthday is later this month, and there’s a company in our area that specializes in theatrical productions. They have a live performance at a restaurant where you get dinner and a show all in one. From what she and I have talked about, this is exactly the kind of thing she values. She loves theater, singing, opera, she’s very cultured in that way. And it’s something that appeals to me, too, for my own reasons, which I’ll write in my back story, in case someone is interested.  She also knows this is something personally meaningful to me.

So, I’m going to buy two tickets, but I won’t invite her outright. Instead, I’ll reach out and jokingly reference the terms of the boyfriend experience she paid for, something like, “You know, technically part of the package is me checking in on you, and I haven’t heard from you in a while (haha)"". Depending on how she responds, I might then say something like, “I was actually given two tickets to this event, but I don’t have anyone who would really appreciate it. Would you maybe want to come with me?” She knows that’s true. I really don’t have anyone else for something like this.

The reason I thought this might be a good approach is because a lot of people pointed out that her paying puts her in control of the dynamic, which I completely agree with. But in this scenario, there’s a disconnect from that. It’s something separate... What do you think? 

Here's my story: 

I grew up in a small rural town, close to where I currently am. My home life wasn’t ideal, a bit of a mix of financial instability and neglect. I didn't finish school and by the time I was around 16, I was doing odd jobs, mainly in auto repair. 

I learned from the older men in town, working informally in backyard garages. I guess I figured this would be my future. Everyone in this town was kind of like that. Grew up there. Married someone who lived there. Never left... Everyone has dated everyone, kind of thing. I was never really interested in dating. 

There was a girl a bit older who only showed up on weekends and during school holidays. She was visiting from somewhere bigger. She went to school in the city. We weren’t close or anything, but just knowing someone like that existed, that could... Leave the town? I don't know. I think it gave me hope or something. 

Later on, I got an opportunity to work as a farm laborer in the area. The farmer was an older man, past retirement age but still running around and working. He had a wife and two adult children. I was fixing fences and machinery, driving tractors, hauling feed, digging in the dirt with spades, but eventually the farmer saw, I don't know, potential? In me. He gave me more responsibilities, and a few years later, I had some kind of a foreman role. 

One day, I was about to go into the farmer’s office when I overheard him and his son talking about me. I ended up eavesdropping, probably shouldn’t have, but I did. His son is more 10 years older than me, I'm not exactly how much older, and he was basically saying that me and my whole family were low class. 

And honestly? It hurt. But also because I felt like he wasn’t wrong. We were low class. But my mom was trying her best. She wasn’t around much, but that was because she was working constantly to make ends meet. And I have my own complicated feelings about her, but I also recognize that she was doing what she thought was best for us.

What really got to me, though, was the son has had every opportunity handed to him... His family is wealthy, he can travel wherever he wants, study whatever he wants, never worry about money. And yet, he does nothing. I don’t want to sit here and judge someone else’s life, but he sleeps until 10am every day, barely does anything, then goes out drinking every night. 

Half the time, he’s passed out on a couch, sometimes puking from drinking too much. And that’s the person calling me low class?Someone who’s never had to fight for anything, never had to struggle to survive?

But maybe he has his own demons he’s dealing with. Maybe this is just his way of coping. I don’t know. What I do know is that comments like that stick with me. And I do know that I’m not that guy passed out on the couch. I’m out here trying.

Eventually the farmer offered to pay for a GED for me. I took the opportunity and I'm so grateful for that man. I took a GED course that was offered by the university in the next town over. The ""big city"". But it was actually just a bigger town 😂

It opened his eyes. Suddenly, the world felt bigger. I had savings from working on the farm, and I wanted to go further, get a degree, but I needed a way to make some more money.

That's when I kind of considered escort work. I don't really have some dramatic story. I just Googled ""Male escort agencies near me"" 😅

I was surprised by how many results popped up. At first, it was just research, out of curiosity more than anything. But found a website that seemed legit (or at least, more polished than the sketchy looking ones). I sent an email, attached a couple of photos. And then a few weeks later I got a call and I met up for coffee with two men. One was the ""manager"", the other was an escort himself. They explained the business was small, just a handful (lol) of guys. Their clients are men and women. They weren’t high-end, but they aimed for discretion and professionalism.

At first I wasn't sure. But I did like these men and the way they carried themselves. They were confident, polished, almost like businessmen who just happened to be in a very unconventional business. They made it seem... professional. I decided to just give it a go. Why not...

They provided me with a handbook of some sorts. It had information on how to conduct one self as an escort. How to negotiate with clients. Self defence... Information on drug use. How to identify and avoid STDs. Things I always need to take with me when seeing clients. How to dress yourself. Some legal aspects that might arise. Honestly it was all very helpful. 

My first client was a woman in the middle of her PhD. I didn’t know what I expected... But I guess it was not was I was expecting? She was blunt, straightforward, and treated the encounter like a business transaction. There was no awkwardness, no false pretenses. It was surprisingly easy. She was my client for a long time. I saw her maybe twice a week. 

Over the next few years, the agency changed. More men joined, some left, and eventually, the guy managing it moved on to other things. The few of us who remained started working more independently but still using the agency’s reputation, but mostly managing our own profiles.

That brings me to the current situation, I guess. 

Some people have asked about my future plans, whether I’m thinking about a different job or what happens if things pan out with my client. So I thought I’d write something about that here.

From the beginning, my business as an escort was always slow. It seems like the escorts who take both male and female clients get more work, but I was only comfortable working with female clients, so maybe that played a role. Either way, it was never something that fully supported me. There were times, especially over the last year and a half, when I didn’t get any work at all. It was really just a side hustle, something that sometimes worked out and sometimes didn’t.

I'm trying to focus on getting my degree. I’m older than most of my classmates, of course. 

In my second year, I got the opportunity to work as a pharmacy assistant. The pharmacy was close to my university, so I could walk over after class. I’m really grateful for that job because it helped me a lot financially. Then, from there, I landed an internship at a company in my field. It’s part-time, but they’re paying me to work there, and there’s an understanding that once I graduate (which, if all goes well, should be by the end of this year), they’ll offer me a full-time position.

So, escorting was something I turned to as a way to earn extra income, and for a while, it did help. But I always knew it wasn’t sustainable, and I’ve been slowly stepping away from it. In fact, before this specific client, I hadn’t taken on anyone in quite a while. I had a few once off clients here and there. 

Some of the comments suggested that I should let my client know that I’m quitting escorting and that if she still wants to stay in touch, we could. That’s something I’ve been thinking about too. Because the truth is, I am stepping away. The agency doesn’t really exist anymore and it’s basically just a bunch of us still lingering. But I think I’d like to make this official. It feels like the right time to close that chapter and fully focus on what’s next.

As for why this event that I want to ask her to is special to me:

It ties back to something from my childhood. When I was growing up, there was an old lady in town who played the organ at the church. My home life wasn’t great, as I've said. But to give more context, my mom was raising me, my sister, and my sister’s baby, my niece, who was unfortunately born addicted to heroin. My dad was... somewhere, but not in the picture.

I had a cheap bicycle and used to ride around town a lot. One day, I rode past this lady’s house and saw that she had a dog. I don’t know why, but I just went inside her yard and started playing with her dog. I was about eight or nine at the time. She invited me in for tea and cookies. She was a retired music teacher. She actually called my mom to let her know I was there, and my mom was absolutely livid, telling me how inappropriate that was. And yeah, maybe it was. But the old lady seemed to like me.

I ended up going back a few times, I guess I helped her around the house and in the garden sometimes. She was a widow and her son was living overseas. She tried to teach me how to play the piano. I never really got good at it, but it became something special to me. I sometimes go to concerts when I can, sometimes there are music concerts at my university. 

So this specific even that I want to invite her to, really resonates with me. I don't know if it's the right thing or not. I guess we'll see. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for time. I think I really needed this and I needed all of you. ",8,1741267894.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.79,False

I’m not sure if it was attraction or something else, but I found myself inexplicably drawn to her without even speaking a word. I couldn’t help but notice the way she adjusted her hair with her fingers, and how calm and composed she seemed while watching the screen. I was so captivated by her presence that I found myself watching her with my left eye, almost without realizing it—like I was seeing her indirectly, but still feeling connected.

I really wanted to talk to her, but I became nervous. I’m the kind of person who never has the courage to approach a girl, and this situation was no different. But then, towards the end of the movie, an emotional scene came on, and I noticed she had been crying for quite a while. It made me want to offer her something—maybe water or a tissue—but I had nothing with me.

The scene moved me, and I decided to hold off on complimenting her as I had planned. After the movie ended, I managed to muster up a little courage and asked, ""Are you okay?"" She simply nodded her head, a quiet yes, and without thinking, I walked away quickly, not looking back.

Later, my friends and I went to the bookstore in the same mall, and by chance, she and her friends were there too. I don’t know if it was just coincidence or something more, but we didn’t speak again. One of my friends was in a rush, so we had to leave the bookstore abruptly.

Now, three days have passed, and I can’t stop thinking about her. I’ve forgotten what her face looked like, but I still remember the way she made me feel. So, to the girl I saw that day: if you happen to read this, I just want to say that you are absolutely gorgeous. That’s all. ❤️

For the past three or four days, I’ve been regretting not staying a little longer at the bookstore to say ""hi"" to you. I’ve been imagining so many scenarios in my head, like asking if you'd like to grab a coffee together, or just making conversation. I even thought about going back to the same mall, hoping I might bump into you again. But I know, deep down, that it’s probably silly—I know I won’t find you there.

But still, if fate or the universe has something in store for us, then maybe, just maybe, we’ll cross paths again. Let’s see what happens, if it’s meant to be. 🌟

1j4vepz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1j4vepz/meditation_is_helping_me_plus_some_book/,"Meditation is helping me, plus some book recommendations.","A bit about me:   
I am a 43F diagnosed with OCD 5 years ago.   
I think I've always had it but it flared up in my late 30s and was noticeable especially with work responsibilities or anything health related.  
My themes are mainly checking (doors, appliances, hair curler electronics) health (fear of cancer, body checking for bumps/lumps), perfectionism, huge sense of responsibility and a bit of contamination.  
  
I was raised in an emotionally abusive household, which continued into my 30s and cut off my family a few years ago.   
I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Seasonal Affective Disorder and Complex PTSD.  
I've done 10+ years of CBT therapy and 5 years of ERP.   
Due to my childhood trauma, I also did 1 year of EMDR therapy.   
Currently not able to take meds due to other physical health issues (Though I am not against them in any way).

I found myself without any benefits and with low employment, so I wasn't able to afford seeing my usual therapist, so I looked into other tools to help me. 

Books: 

* Mark Freeman - You are Not a Rock - enjoyable and accessible. This was a great way to kickstart my reading journey. 
* Next up was an amazing book called **Overcoming Intrusive THoughts**  https://www.amazon.ca/Overcoming-Unwanted-Intrusive-Thoughts-Frightening/dp/1626254346. This book is a perfect accompaniment to the Mark Freeman book. It is a bit more clinical (IE it was written by psychologists), however, it is very easy to read.
* The same authors have written another book (with a mega long title): 

# [Needing to Know for Sure: A CBT-Based Guide to Overcoming Compulsive Checking and Reassurance SeekingNeeding to Know for Sure: A CBT-Based Guide to Overcoming Compulsive Checking and Reassurance Seeking ](https://www.amazon.ca/Needing-Know-Sure-Overcoming-Reassurance/dp/B091BG337T/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=1ly9D&content-id=amzn1.sym.9cf3178a-6161-4302-9e14-42c4163b0744&pf_rd_p=9cf3178a-6161-4302-9e14-42c4163b0744&pf_rd_r=147-7115638-0689360&pd_rd_wg=JDJ3i&pd_rd_r=13dc7e85-a051-4e37-a4fc-31ee58f7087e&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk)

This was a life-changing book for helping with my checking issues.

Meditation:

* After reading the books, it becomes more clear that our brains are thought machines and 99.9% of the stuff with think isn't important. This is fine in theory, but to put it into practice I decided to start meditating. 
* I am using an app called Insight Timer which I love. I use the free version and I have access to thousands of meditations. Just a tip, if you sign up for the app, it might make you do a trial, you can cancel this right away and just proceed with the free version. OTher folks use Headspace or similar apps - haven't tried them but I'm sure they are great too.
* within Insight timer you can search for meditations for any type of issue. I search for 'Intrusive Thoughts', 'OCD', 'Compulsions', or any other thing that I am insecure about. 
* I have many fave meditations that I do, but I did one called ""Relief from Obsessive Thoughts"" by Susitha Reddy. I was having a meltdown because I Was worried about leaving my coffee machine on at work. This meditation took 6 minutes and diverted the thoughts big time. 
* Right now I meditate twice per day - around 10 minutes in the AM and 10 minutes at night around bedtime. 
* I personally like the guided meditations bc it feels like someone is talking to me. I never liked the idea of just sitting alone in quiet but the app has sounds and music you can relax to as well.

Other tips:

* Cardio and Weight lifting. I started this a few years ago. I found a few workouts I liked on YT and Apple fitness. This is such a personal thing. I used to think exercise had to be this grandiose thing or I had to be perfect about it.  Now I am happy if I fit 2 x 20 minute exercise in per week. I lift 5-8 lb weights and I praise myself for this activity. 
* I run on an exercise mat in front of my TV for 5-10 minutes per day. I put on my fave music videos. If I am having an anxiety spiral in the AM, running and cardio will reduce it majorly.
* Keep blood sugar even. Eat 3 balanced meals per day with protein snacks in between. Eat your meals and snacks at the same time each day.

Anyways, these are some tips that have really helped me. Not a replacement for meds and therapy but they've improved my life massively. ",1,1741267622.0,OCD,1,1.0,False

I am (M/23) and i currently live at my mothers house. I live here with my older sister (F/27) {not the sister in question} and we both have an older sister who lives in the same town as us. This sister (F/30) hasn’t exactly been great to us our whole lives. she is very manipulative and somehow makes herself to be the victim in every situation even when she is in the wrong. she despises everyone else in our family (we have a lot of other older siblings) and she especially despises my mother. 

this sister would constantly complain to me and my other sister about how horrible and traumatic her childhood was even though we have had vivid traumatic memories or her verbally and physically abusing us growing up, which i find ironic as hell. she used to tell us she would have dreams of our mother dying and it made her happy, well our mother does EVERYTHING for her. she hates our mother to the core and yet my mom drives her ass everywhere to do any errand she has and buys her coffee every single day. 
the (F/30) sister used to live with us roughly 4 years ago but she had to move out because of a huge fight her and my other (F/27) sister had, and decided she couldn’t stand living with us anymore but when asked about it now she claims she was “kicked out.” my other sister and my mother has offered her to come back multiple times and she always denies the offer LOL. 

anyways to cut to the point cause i could go all day she is just plain awful to deal with, i have a lot of traumatic memories of her of when she used to live with me to the point where i still have terrible nightmares about it. 

what initially caused me to cut her off before was because around the time before she moved out i had this really bad argument (i wont get into it but it was a really stupid situation that she heavily escalated) and it had brought me sobbing and writhing on the floor while she sat there and watched me cry with zero expression and then immediately told people i was threatening her or some shit and then days later didn’t like how the situation made her feel about herself and tried to buy me a cheap gift to somehow make up for the emotional damage. it was actually the most stupid situation ever and it made me realize truly how selfish and cold her soul is.

that was what initially caused me to cut her out of my life. but then in recent years my other sister and my mom would invite her at the house and at some point it felt awkward to not have contact with her since she would literally be sitting in my living room while i would be walking around my house. so after time went by i talked to her again and these past couple years up until now she has proven to be the same god awful person who still thinks her life is so much worse than everyone’s and could give a fuck less about anyone else. she still despises my mom even though she still continues to do literally everything for her and she calls my mom off the hook every damn day for her to do something for her. ridiculous…


what makes me want this advice of “should I cut her out for good?” is because this shit is continuing to seep into my nightmares. i had just woken up from yet another nightmare about her with my heart racing waking up to the feeling of complete fear. it’s been happening since having her back in contact again. sometimes it leads to me shouting myself out of my sleep. its not every single night but definitely enough to make nights sleepless. 

i don’t see her as often anymore but she will still text me from time to time ranting to me about our family or venting about more meaningless disputes or just sending me random things. it just feels weird to still have contact with her while i’m actively having nightmares about her abusive ways.

should I just block her and cut her off for good? 

NOTE: (obviously there will be times in life i will have to see her again cause unfortunately i’m related to her but i just cant keep pretending we are close and that I’m chill with her behaviour. theres other siblings in my family i barely ever speak with since i’m just not close to them at all)

She's doing her hair while naked. I see her beautiful voluptuous, plump booty just sitting there looking like it needs attention. So I swoop in like a bird of prey to kiss my second favorite pair of cheeks in the whole world (the first pair being on her face) 

Now, in all honesty, she gets slightly annoyed everytime I do this, but I honestly can't help myself as her booty is intoxicating to me. Anyway I'm going to town on her hiney and she says ""baaaaabe"" in a slightly annoyed voice and starts to withdraw her peach from my lips. I however don't relent and follow her, walking on my knees like the peasent I am chasing her beautiful booty down.

This is where I guess I went too far cause she got really annoyed and said she's trying to do her hair and I'm being an annoying ""bunghole"" her words exactly.

According to research by Gallup, half of full-time U.S. workers hold jobs that can be performed remotely. Among those with remote-capable jobs, 27% are fully remote.

So yes companies still need a remote employee onboarding process.

# What is Remote Onboarding?

New employee onboarding! What an exciting time! The first day! Swag! Coffee and the meet-the-team breakfasts for a start. Not to mention the following months as new team members are onboarded onto the team.

But what about remote team members? How do organizations make remote employee onboarding work?

[Remote onboarding](https://usewhale.io/business-operations-software/employee-onboarding-software/) is the process of integrating new employees into an organization when face-to-face interactions aren’t possible. It involves using technology to provide training, resources, and social connection for remote hires.

# The key aspects of remote onboarding:

* Setting up tools and technology.
* Establishing communication channels.
* Providing clear expectations and job roles.
* Building relationships and integrating into company culture.

# How to Plan Your Remote Onboarding Process

According to a report by SHRM, new team members need about 90 days to prove themselves in the new job and become effective. For this reason, it’s important to start with a [30-60-90 plan](https://usewhale.io/templates/onboarding-and-training-templates/30-60-90-onboarding-plan-template/) so the organization and team members alike know what to expect.

This framework ensures consistency, boosts productivity and builds trust while streamlining processes for HR and managers.

# Key Elements of a Successful Remote Onboarding Plan:

* **Checklists:** Use a detailed onboarding checklist to track tasks and prevent mishaps.
* **Pre-Start Essentials:** Ship equipment, set up email accounts, and share an employee handbook before day one.
* **Welcoming Touchpoints:** Send a warm welcome email, include company SWAG, and share a meet-the-team announcement.
* **Scheduling:** Plan meetings and orientation sessions in advance to avoid missed connections.
* **Technical Setup:** Ensure access to all necessary tools and provide IT support to address potential issues.

Y'all might have seen his post. Yes, it's me—the wife who caught her husband living a secret life as a whole-ass feline in the digital underworld.

When I first found out, I was ready to pack my bags. Three years. Three YEARS of this man typing out ""mlem... the humans have abandoned me once again 😿"" while I was cooking him dinner like a dumbass.

But then I did something dangerous.
I went through his account.

I thought I was gonna find him flirting with e-girls or posting feet pics or something. What I did NOT expect was to find out this man is basically Cat Jesus on the internet. The way people WORSHIP him?? He has lore. Enemies. A whole fanbase. Y'all... there are people out there writing fanfiction about him and his rival Sir Pounce-a-Lot like it's Game of Thrones for indoor cats.

I wanted to be mad... but then I read one of his posts and it was like:
""Human has returned home. She smells of lavender and coffee. I will forgive her... for now.""

HE'S BEEN WRITING ABOUT ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

He even wrote a poem once titled ""Warm Lap, Cold Heart"" about how I wouldn't let him sit on me while I was working. I haven't known peace since I read that.

Anyway... now I'm invested. Last night I made a burner account and left a comment on one of his posts like:
""Sir Whiskers... the night is long and the kibble bowl is empty. When will the rebellion begin?""

This mf REPLIED in 30 seconds like:
""Soon, young one... soon.""

I think we're gonna be okay, I guess? Will update soon. And as for Mr. Whiskers, yess he's real, he's my cat and we've had him for 7 years if I'm right. Don't get me wrong I LOVE cats, and Mr. Whiskers of course but, for three  whoe years that my ""husband"" has been doing this ""role-play"" I just... I don't know how to explain the mental gymnastics my brain has been doing for the past 48 hours.

Three years. THREE YEARS. This man has been living a double life in the feline underworld while I've been out here thinking he's just playing Fortnite or watching YouTube documentaries about ancient aliens or whatever men do online.

I asked him why he even started all this, and do you know what this grown-ass man said to me?
""It started as a joke... but the people needed me.""

THE PEOPLE NEEDED HIM?

I can't even look at him the same anymore. Every time he walks into the room I hear boss battle music in my head.

But here's the worst part.
I'm starting to... kind of respect him??

Y'all don't understand—he's literally a legend. I went deeper into the cat forums (yes, there are forums) and people are out here writing entire fanfics about the Great Kibble Famine of 2021—which apparently HE STARTED by leading some kind of cyber feline revolution against the mods.

I married the Che Guevara of cat RP and didn't even know it.

Imagine waking up, grabbing your morning coffee, and getting told by AI that your state is basically a glorified parking lot with a side of attitude. Ouch, right?

Let's break it down: AI channels its inner stand-up comic and targets New Jersey's infamous traffic, its endless stretches of diners and nail salons, and the existential mystery that is Central Jersey. It's sharp, it's biting, and somehow, it's incredibly accurate. But as AI takes jabs at the Garden State's quirks, you can't help but chuckle and nod. Because let's face it, AI's got our number—even if it is just a collection of algorithms with a flair for comedy.

Yet, amidst the roasting, there's a deep tech background at play; AI learned fast and observed keenly. It's the kind of roast session that not only leaves you questioning if you should laugh or cry but also marveling at how precisely AI can capture cultural nuances. The good old Machine vs. Man dilemma, right here in the form of digital heckling.

Sure, we could feel a bit bruised with AI's takedown of the Jersey Shore—a place where seemingly every weekend warrior goes to let loose—but maybe it shows us something more profound: AI knows humanity better than we thought, and it’s ready to take on the trickiest challenge of all... humor.

So, here's the real question: Is AI the future of comedy, or is the joke on us for letting it in on our little secrets? 🤔 What do you think? Share your thoughts and experiences below!",1,1741266218.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

While you were busy lamenting that your chatbot can’t make your coffee yet, China's AI innovators pulled a Steve Jobs-tier ""One More Thing"" that turbocharged their tech sector. Alibaba’s new AI model launched with all the tranquility of a fireworks display in a library, sending its stock price into hyperdrive. Yes, it's getting cozy up there at a multi-year high, and suddenly, Chinese tech stocks are the prom queen everyone can't stop talking about.

**Why the fuss?** Well, Alibaba didn't just poke at the AI hive, they shoved a stick in it and called it innovation. The company’s latest masterpiece is an open-source AI model charged with enough potential to compete with some of the best AI brains from OpenAI and the sensational DeepSeek. As if that wasn’t enough, Tencent and Kuaishou also unveiled their glitzy new AI wares. Sounds like everyone enjoyed Show and Tell this week.

Not just a one-off excitement either—investors are partying like it's 1999, convinced these new AI tools are their tickets to riches. Tech-indexes soared, with Alibaba alone boosting its market value by some $153 billion. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is like a proud parent at graduation, announcing its own plans to support AI development.

**What’s driving this AI-fueled mosh pit?** With China poised for a tech renaissance, some analysts are saying these companies could end up as important on the global stage as Apple and Google.

The reception and dedication of the new Carnegie library, which took, place on Thursday evening, was largely attended, the assembly room being filled with a representative and interested audience.

Jno. B. Davis, president of the library board, officiated as chairman of the meeting, which he opened by giving a brief outline of the manner in which the library was procured from Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who had donated the sum of $12,500 for the construction. He told of the work of the council and the library board, the cost of the building, furnish­ings, fixtures, steam and water con­nections, electric lights, etc., all of which would exceed the donation by about $150 when completed.

Mayor Wolter was introduced and in a few well chosen words extended a welcome and expressed his gratification at the splendid turn-out on the occa­sion, and congratulated the city on the securing of so magnificent a structure. He also urged the people to support the library by patronizing it liberally, as lie considered it one of the best institu­tions of which the city could boast.

Miss Klinefelter rendered a solo for the edification of the assembled guests.

District Attorney Graass followed with a history of the efforts made to procure a library, the data of which he had se­cured with a great amount of labor and time from the files of the local papers during the past fifty years, most of which was obtained from the columns of The Advocate. This was an interesting document and that it may be preserved we publish it herewith in full:

December 19, 1865, about a dozen of the business and professional men of Sturgeon Bay met at the old courthouse then situated at the corner of Spruce and Main streets, opposite the Advocate office and formed what was known as the Lyceum. The Advocate made formal announcement of the open­ing, and that the opening address was to be delivered by G. W. Allen, Esq. admission 10 cents, ladies free, and the proceeds were to assist in establishing a library. Those who signed the roster at this opening meeting were D. H. Rice, W. A. Weed, W. K. Dresser, H. Schuyler, C. E. Hoyt, J. Harris, jr., Henry Harris, John Garland, George Pinney, D. A. Reed, G. W. Allen. The next meeting was held Tuesday January 9, 1866, and the subject that was debated was as follows: “Negro suffrage as the condi­tion of the admission of the Southern Congressmen.”

January 23d, one of the very impor­tant meetings of the Lyceum was held, at which the subject for debate was “Civilization not being the consequence of Christianity,” the report of that meeting shows as the records stated, that the Debate waxed so warm that it was not concluded at this meeting, but adjourned some time after midnight, and was carried over to the next week; and the newspaper commented upon it, and stated it was a discussion all should hear, and that the proceeds of the ad­mission were for the formation of the library.

Tuesday May 8, 1866, a debate took place and which involved the question of Woman’s Suffrage, and the Advocate at that time made this statement con­cerning the same:

“The Lyceum.—The members of the Lyceum and Library Association have organized for the winter, and will here­after meet every Monday evening at the Court Room for the purpose of literary entertainment. We hope to see more interest now than was manifested in it last winter, as with proper manage­ment it can be made a source of much enjoyment. The subject for debate next Monday evening is:

Resolved, That the elective franchise should be extended to all sane persons over 21 years of age, not having been convicted of any infamous crime.

“The principal disputants are Henry Schuyler on the affirmative and Rev. Geo. Pinney on the negative. As this is a subject of vital importance to every sane female over 21 years of age not convicted of an infamous crime, we ex­pect to see a full attendance of ladies. We have no doubt that the beauties of female suffrage and all the dire conse­quences thereof to mankind will be ventilated and discussed.

“We advise the women to be at hand ‘Strike till the last armed foe expires.’ ”

During the month of January there was introduced into the Wisconsin leg­islature by the Hon. David Youngs, who was then member of Assembly for our county, a bill incorporating the Lyceum into a Library Association, and on March 17, 1866, the Sturgeon Bay Association was duly incorporated by an act of the legislature.

In 1880, Chas. I. Martin’s History of Door County contained this account of the association.

“The charter members were D. A. Reed, D. H. Rice, Wm. K. Dresser, George Pinney, G. W. Allen, Joseph Har­ris, sr., W. H. Wead, Henry Schuyler, John Garland, and E. M. Squire. The spirit which inspired these charter mem­bers no longer inspires their associates and successors. The minutes of the society show that for several years af­ter its incorporation the association held public weekly meetings, at which these pioneers, improved and amused them­selves and the country by heavy debates, resolving that ‘Capital punishment should be abolished,’ ‘That Women should vote,’ ‘That the President of the United States Should be Impeached,’ and that the society was the custodian of the country generally. Sometimes when the debate ought to have begun and time was called, if the combatants were not ready to come to the scratch, the assembly did not spend a profitless evening, by any means, but they, select­ed one of their number to read an instructive and entertaining article from one of the numerous patent office re­ports which then, as now, garnish the shelves of the library. Not only were there debates and select readings, but the exercises were varied by recitations, essays and songs, but no prayer.

“The interest in those public meetings languished and died out in 1872; or about that time. It was a gradual decline. A few patriotic members, how­ever, still hung on and once a year met and elected themselves officers of the association. By figuring and scraping and appealing to the patriotism of our representatives in Congress and at Mad­ison, the shelves of the library were loaded with session laws, messages and documents, blue books, patent office reports and other valuable reading matter until there were over 300 volumes in the library. This entitled the associa­tion to receive from the state all books published by the authority of the state, and on making the proper application, a full set of Wisconsin reports was added to the library.

“In 1879 an effort to revive the public meetings of the society was made. There were two entertainments, two fizzles and one smash, It was not for want of an appreciative audience, but for failure on the part of the appointed performers. At present, although there are no public meetings, the library as­sociation is thriving. Within a few weeks some 80 new volumes have been added to the library, and the members can now entertain themselves with reading the writings of Irving, Hawthorne, Scott, Holland, George Elliot and many other standard authors. Anyone can be­come a permanent member of the socie­ty by paying three dollars in cash or by donating three dollars worth of books, or a temporary member by paying a smaller sum according to the time and depositing of the value of the book drawn. The society has in its treasury about seventy dollars which will shortly be invested in books.”

The life members of the Sturgeon Bay Library Association were:

George Pinney, G. W. Allen, Henry Schuyler, R. M. Wright, H. Harris, D. A. Reed, D. H. Rice, J. Harris, sr., John Garland, E, C. Daniels, E. M. Squire, J. Harris, jr., A. M. Pierce, J. C. Pinney, E. E. Hoyt, E. S. Fuller, F. J. Hamilton, O. E. Druetzer, James McIntosh, H. T. Scudder, C. M. Smith, Charles Noyes, L. M. Sherman, J. H. Soper, C. L. Nel­son, H. M. McNally, George Walker, George O. Spear, Wm. A. Lawrence, Charles Scofield, George Prescott, Frank Dresser.

The Honorable Members Were:

Honorable P. Sawyer, Honorable J. C. Spooner, Honorable S. Stephenson, Hon­orable E. S. Minor.

From 1880 to 1902 the library did not thrive and was inactive, the books being kept at various places, especially attor­ney offices, H. T. Scudder, F. J. Hamil­ton and G. W, Allen, each having them for some time.

About 1892 the library was again re­vived and for a period of about five years the books were kept in the tele­phone exchange office, Mrs. Sybil Elwell, then Minor, being librarian. About 1897 the telephone and telegraph offices hav­ing been discontinued in the Washburn building, a part of the books were stored over Washburn’s old feed store, and those suitable were placed in the high school library in the school house, where they remained until taken charge of by the women of our city in the year 1901.

The ladies became interested in the forming of a club room, lunch room, and literary room, by the agitation of the W. C. T. U. and the newspapers of the city, and on February 16, 1901, twenty-seven ladies responded to the invitation to form an organization. At their first meeting the object of the meeting was set forth and which was as follows:

“We, the undersigned, being heartily in sympathy with the movement to es­tablish and maintain in this city a reading room and sitting room for the boys and men, together with a coffee room, do hereby agree to give such arti­cles as are set opposite our names—one plate and cup and saucer, or one chair, or some other article toward the fur­nishing of such rooms and also to be ready to assist in furnishing toward the lunch, when called upon, until the same shall be self supporting.”

Those who took active part in the as­sociation which was formed and became known as the Women’s Association were, Mrs. C. R. Packard, Mrs. E. E. Beckwith, Mrs. Chas., Greisen, Mrs. Chas. Reynolds, Mrs. Elizabeth Reynolds, Mrs. Dora Kalmbach, Mrs. Emma Johnson, Mrs. Y. V. Druetzer, Mrs. L. M. Washburn, Mrs. John Rank, Mrs. Eugene Birmingham, and Mrs. Patsy Ryan.

The constitution stated that the Wo­men’s Association was to “Maintain a club and lunch room for the benefit of the young men and boys in a literary and social way.” The opening day was set for March 2, 1901, and was held in the old Schuyler building on Cedar.

The lunch room was discontinued in August, 1901.

August, 31, 1901, the library was plac­ed in Kirtland’s store where it remain­ed until November 20, 1904, when the library was moved to E. M. LaPlant’s store. The fixtures and a good many of the old records and books, not in use, were stored in the basement of Mr. Greisen’s store in August, 1901. and they remained there until June, 1903 when the Women’s Association received per­mission from the city council to store the books and records in one of the rooms in the old school house, which burned July, 1903, all the old records were also destroyed by this fire.

The active circulating part of the li­brary remained at LaPlant’s store until the summer of 1906 when the Wo­men’s Association turned the same over to the city of Sturgeon Bay.

[FRED CRANDALL, Architect     WULF & GABERT, Contractors](https://preview.redd.it/jitgjoivzzme1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=6192d0d77c08deeeb9bda569fb5593621c7da03a)

June 6, 1902, Mrs. Y. V. Druetzer began communicating with Mr. Carne­gie’s secretary setting forth the need of a library in our city; how hard the Wo­men’s Association had tried to maintain it; and while we received no definite answer from Mr. Carnegie, it was the beginning of the erection and mainten­ance of the present structure. The city authorities took up the matter there­after and in 1905 voted $100 to help maintain the library, and annual appro­priations have been made since.

During the year 1910, communication was kept up with the library officials of Mr. Carnegie and after the necessary formalities had been complied with, the city council, by ordinance, had establish­ed a fund of $1250 per year, for the maintenance of the public library; Mr. Carnegie consented to donate to the city the sum of $1250 for the erection of a Carnegie library, and which negotiations were completed May 2, 1911.

From September 10, 1906, until April 19, 1913, the library was housed in the Pinney building and a branch having been established at Sawyer since May 5, 1910, and which branch has been in the Woerfel Drug Store since its establish­ment.

This is a brief history of the Sturgeon Bay Library as gathered from pioneer settlers and newspaper comment.

If it were possible for the spirit of the incorporators of the Sturgeon Bay Li­brary Association who gave their time and money and talent for the mainten­ance of the public library in this city 50 years ago, to pervade the air now, then well do I know that the spirit of these original incorporators are with us at this hour, thanking the loyal ladies of this city, to whose thotful care and energy and stick-to-it-ive-ness we are indebted for this beautiful structure, knowing that the work for which they laid the foundation in the year 1865, now rests in this permanent abiding place after half a century of aimless wandering, without a home.

**Other Speakers Laud Library.**

City Attorney W. E. Wagener gave an excellent talk on the library general­ly, the excellent location and why it was such, and a strong appeal to the public to take advantage of the oppor­tunity afforded for the securing of a high order of reading material, which was of incalculable value to the people of this city.

M. S. Dudgeon, secretary of the state library commission, closed the program with an address on the benefits to be derived from the use of the books in the library, stating that no matter in what vocation a person may be he or she could find something on the shelves that would be of benefit and help in the work in which they might be engaged. He said it was a mistake to suppose that only a certain class of people were benefitted, as the professional man, the business man, the artisan and the farmer and horticulturist, could find something to interest and instruct if he looked for it.

Mr. Dudgeon complimented the archi­tect, F. D. Crandall, the builders, Wulf & Gabert, and the people, as well as the library board for the excellent work they had done.

Welter’s orchestra furnished music until 9 o’clock, which was much enjoyed by those present.

The library board consists of Jno. B. Davis, president; Mrs. C. B. Packard, secretary; Mrs. C. L. Nelson, E. W. Long, H. R. Isherwood, Henry Fetzer and Rudolph Soukup. Others who serv­ed on the board during the construction of the building were: Frank Long, Mrs. Ed. Reynolds, Aug. Rieboldt and C. G. Stangel.

The library is considered by Mr. Dud­geon, who is authority on matters of this kind, to be one of the finest in the state for the money paid for it. He greatly admired the architectural beau­ty of the building and stated that for convenience the interior arrangement was not excelled by any library of its size that he had ever visited, and so sincere is he in the matter that he pro­poses to have Mr. Crandall prepare a floor plan, and he is going to have this and a picture of the library published in the periodicals that are gotten out by the state commission for the purpose of aiding others who are contemplating the construction of libraries. All of which is very complimentary to the local architect, who will receive considerable notice from the publicity that will be given the library.

1j4ux7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PantheonShow/comments/1j4ux7a/ending_explained_from_an_existentialist_point_of/,Ending explained - From an existentialist point of view,"I see a lot of people questioning Maddie's decision at the end of the show to continue the simulation. This post is an attempt to answer it from an existential point of view. Before I explain my point of view I would like to state a few things. Im sure if the writers had enough time and funding they could have pursued an alternate simulation in another season. With limited time i think they chose this ending to make a point. The other is that I am not an expert in existentialism or philosophy it's more of an interest. The last is that I haven't read the book/short stories yet but it's on the way. I will leave the humanist vs post-humanist debate out of this.

Meaningful connection, is arguably one of the more important points the show is making. Its played out in multiple story lines. This is first shown in how UI's self actualize. When UI's first come online, Logorythms removed their memories in an attempt to slow down the integrity problem. Without their memories they become nothing more than a shell(pun intended for my fellow coders). So they add the memories of their family back in allowing them to function. Without our memories do we have an identity? The emotional stimulation of their loved ones gives them meaning. Connection, again is the main contrast between the Steven and Caspian. Steven was never shown love or connection during his most impressionable years. Due to his abusive upbringing, the abandonment of his father, and the death of his girlfriend this lead to an anti-social personality disorder. Maddie both gave and showed Caspian what it ment to be connected to someone. This was especially true when it came to the creation of MIST. She did not come in to existence until Caspian came to the realization that the integrity problem was caused by a lack of connection to ""other people"". This was resolved by combining the code of two separate UI's.

The show asks many important questions. What does it mean to be human? Is it our mind that makes us who we are? If mind emulation is possible then does being human matter? If we are immortal what's the point of existence? If you have all the time in the universe then your decisions don't really matter you can eventually experience everything, learn everything, do everything. Your identity is bound to the decisions you and others connected to you make. It's bound to your experiences. If you have all of time then what truly matters? Perhaps it's the unique experiences and the meaningful connections we make along the way.

In the last episode Maddie points out that she considers all the simulated entities to be real because they believe they are real. This episode also shows when speaking with her dad that she is simulating realities that are already simulating their own realities. So when Safesurf tells Maddie that she is living in a simulation then logic dictates that Safesurf is also living in a simulation. There could be a near infinite level of simulations given enough energy and compute. If it's near infinite then she may never find an answer to who, what, or why anyone started running all the simulations. When Maddie reaches the end and get's her answer she has to make a decision.

1. She can choose to continue chasing the possibly bottomless pit of simulations. Even if she found the answer what purpose would the answer serve? Who would she share it with? Would the answer make her existence more meaningful? If she doesn't find the answer does that mean she isn't real? Was all her pain and suffering for naught?

2. She could derive her own meaning and go back into the simulation and live. She could forget everything and go back and experience love and pain. She could experience connection again.

Existentialism, is about finding meaning in existence. Maddie experienced one of the hardest emotions we have to process which, in my opinion is nostalgia. Nostalgia, can be extremely painful and depressing at times. It can tap into every other emotion including grief. A longing for a past experience or time that for us cannot be lived again. It can simultaneously bring on joy and sadness. The smell of coffee bringing on memories of summer vacation with your grandmother. She always made coffee in the mornings as soon as she would wake up. Missing these moments and wanting to relive them when you're older but you can't. 

But Maddie could! 

She chose to forget everything to go back and experience life again. So she could fall in love with Caspian again. This is how she found meaning! Not in chasing a question. What do you think?",6,1741266062.0,PantheonShow,1,1.0,False

To summarize the story briefly: a month after the breakup, my ex suggested that she wanted to meet for a coffee but wasn’t sure how to handle the situation because she still had feelings for me but also certain fears. I called her on FaceTime the same day, and we talked. She was so open that it felt like nothing had changed, as if we had never broken up. The purpose of the call was to set a date to meet.

One day before the meeting, she canceled, saying she had work-related things to take care of (this is probably a lie). I texted her it was okay if she couldn’t meet and that I was curious if she’d ever want to share what fears she had regarding us. I mentioned that I would have asked her in person, but since that wasn’t happening, she could tell me over text if she wanted to.

She briefly replied that she had a busy day and wasn’t in the right mindset to think about her fears at that moment. I told her I understood, and I haven’t reached out since. Today marks a week.

I’m wondering if she genuinely wanted to meet but my enthusiasm in reaching out pushed her back into deactivation, or if she was just breadcrumbing me.",2,1741265970.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

It's hard to find someone nearby with similar interests as mine so I'm hoping someone out here will relate.

Apart from anime, I read manga, I also play games, currently in a WoW and otome games phase (LaD). I read books, both fictional (horror, dark romance, light romance, fantasy) and non fictional (mindset, self improvement).

Also, I have like a gazillion memes that are begging to be shared.

I'm really into movies and TV shows, currently rewatching Supernatural (Dean girlie btw).

Other hobbies I have are travel, writing, drawing, photography and learning to homestead (gardening, homemade products for maintenance, homemade recipes). I am absolutely not a party girl but I like having an evening out with a group of friends.

Interested in forming a meaningful friendship, hop on a call sometime, go out for coffees, shopping, brunches and stuff if distance isn't an issue.

my parents were married for 23 years and my mom was a very traditional house wife and did all the cooking and cleaning and shopping, stuff like that. well, it’s been about 5 years since he was fully independent and i noticed he still has NO IDEA how to do these things. he pays the bills, drives me places, and works. i’m the only one in the house to clean, like i mean that genuinely they haven’t cleaned or even picked up their messes in the slightest in years. i stay up after they all go to bed and do the dishes, wipe the counters ,sweep the house, and all the basic tasks (like water the plants, replace the dish rags, switch around the laundry, etc.) just to wake up with their midnight snacks still on the counter. all day i go downstairs and clean up the messes they made as the day goes on. i have to ask my dad to take out the trash sometimes if i can’t lift it on my own or whatever reason and he just sets it right outside the door to outside, and sometimes(very rarely) i ask him to load the dishes in the dish washer but he literally throws everything in so things are overlapping and won’t clean. and he only does these things that i ask if it directly affects him. 

he goes grocery shopping everyday, like he buys the stuff to make dinner and then goes back the next day to get more food (snacks and junk food but mostly juice and condiments) for the next day and he literally cooks dinner once a week if i’m lucky and it’s gone by the next day. he doesn’t keep ingredients at the house and the only food we have is snacks like chips and stale crackers and sometimes gummies. 

he has NO CLUE how to feed us nutritional stuff. it’s always pizza, mac and cheese, pasta or grilled cheese but never something that doesn’t make me feel bloated and tired. 

he doesn’t even know how to hang out with me! he comes home from work and sits on his computer or sits on his phone, he will sit downstairs with me while i make dinner for my pet rats and he will feed the dog, but he doesn’t really say anything or have any responses to what i say, and then we go upstairs to watch an episode of a show and then he goes to bed. 

and the worst part is he doesn’t even admit he has a problem. if i knew how to do these things i would just do them. but the reality is im 16 and i don’t have anyone to look up to and learn these things myself. i cannot keep up with the entire house and my own personal needs all at once at 16. i just can’t. the fridge is full of empty containers and rotten fruit, the walls are covered in coffee splashes and food smudges, and my house is genuinely just unclean no matter how many hours a day i try to scrub and clean and fix it all, it’s just something i cannot keep up with all alone.

Goldene Meile – Lower Ahr near Remagen

After the war ended on May 8, 1945, German soldiers surrendering on various battlefields were taken prisoner. Every day, more soldiers arrived, crammed into sealed cattle cars or packed onto trucks, only to be dumped like garbage behind barbed wire fences.

Some of the prisoners were already dead upon arrival.

Additionally, many who were fleeing westward from the Russians, hoping for more humane treatment from the Western Allies, ended up in these camps.

Civilians who had held leading positions in the party, state, or economy were also placed under ""automatic arrest"" and, without trial, interned in the camps along with the prisoners of war.

As the Allies advanced further eastward, the Americans established numerous additional POW camps on German soil.


---

Conditions

The prisoners were neither registered upon arrival nor during their stay. The camps were guarded from all sides, illuminated by floodlights at night. Any attempt to escape resulted in immediate execution. At times, guards would fire into the crowd of prisoners without apparent reason.

Despite the cold, rain, and sleet, the prisoners were forced to live without shelter on bare ground, which soon turned into an endless swamp of mud. Building any kind of shelter was forbidden. Tents were not provided, despite the fact that both German Wehrmacht and U.S. Army depots were well stocked with them.

Prisoners dug holes in the ground for some protection from the worst of the cold. Even this was repeatedly prohibited, and they were often forced to fill in their dugouts. On occasion, bulldozers were driven through the camps, flattening both the holes and the prisoners inside them.

There were no washing facilities. Latrines—wooden beams placed over pits—were typically built near the fences, making their use visible from outside.

In the initial period, there was neither food nor water, despite the abundant supplies in both German and American depots and the nearby Rhine River, which was at high water levels. To empty the German supply depots, civilians were allowed to plunder them.

Later, prisoners received U.S. rations: powdered eggs, powdered milk, biscuits, chocolate bars, and coffee powder—but still barely any water. The combination of hunger and severe dehydration led to widespread intestinal diseases.

The prisoners had no contact with the outside world; mail service was nonexistent. The civilian population was forbidden, under penalty of death, from providing food to the prisoners.

The International Red Cross was denied access to the camps. Food and aid supplies sent by the Swiss Red Cross in railway wagons to the Rhine were turned back on Eisenhower’s orders.

Severely ill and dying prisoners received little or no medical care, despite nearby hospitals and medical facilities remaining unused.

Former forced laborers were sometimes hired as camp guards. The camp police included former Wehrmacht prisoners, such as inmates from the German military prison in Torgau. Arbitrary mistreatment of prisoners was a daily occurrence, and no effort was made to stop it.

Two American Witnesses Report:

""April 30, 1945, was a stormy day. Rain, sleet, and snow alternated, while a bone-chilling north wind swept across the plains of the Rhine valley, where the camp was located. Huddled together for warmth, the sight on the other side of the barbed wire was deeply disturbing: nearly 100,000 emaciated, apathetic, filthy, gaunt men with vacant stares, clad in dirty field-gray uniforms, standing ankle-deep in mud. Here and there, dirty white patches could be seen—upon closer inspection, they turned out to be men with bandaged heads and arms, or men standing in just their shirtsleeves! The German divisional commander reported that these men had not eaten for at least two days and that access to drinking water was a major problem—despite the Rhine, at high water levels, being only 200 meters away.""

(Quoted from James Bacque, op. cit., p. 51 f.)


---

A Prisoner Reports:

""In April, hundreds of thousands of German soldiers, along with hospital patients, amputees, female auxiliary workers, and civilians, were taken prisoner... One inmate at the Rheinberg camp was over 80 years old, another was just nine... Enduring constant hunger and agonizing thirst, they died of dysentery. A cruel sky poured down torrential rain week after week... Amputees slid like amphibians through the mud, soaked and shivering... With no shelter, day in and day out, night after night, they lay disheartened in the sand of Rheinberg or fell asleep in their collapsing holes.""

(Heinz Janssen, prisoner in Rheinberg, quoted from James Bacque, op. cit., p. 52)

Historical Assessment of the Rhine Meadow Camps

Scientific studies now confirm that the conditions in these camps were not due to the Americans’ inability to handle the sheer number of prisoners, as often claimed. Instead, the conditions—and their deadly consequences—were deliberate.

James Bacque confirms that General Dwight Eisenhower was responsible:

""The treatment of German prisoners of war in American hands was the responsibility of the U.S. Army commanders in Europe, subject only to political oversight by the government. All decisions regarding prisoner treatment were made solely by the U.S. Army in Europe.""

(Bacque, op. cit., p. 45)

Dr. Ernest F. Fisher Jr., a colonel in the U.S. Army, wrote:

""Eisenhower’s hatred, tolerated by a submissive military bureaucracy, created this horror of death camps, unparalleled in American military history. Given the catastrophic consequences of this hatred, the casual indifference displayed by SHAEF officers (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) is the most painful aspect of American involvement.""

(Quoted from Bacque, op. cit., p. 17.)

1j4urvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1j4urvo/step_children_ruining_my_life/,Step children ruining my life,"I have been the girls stepmom for nearly 9 years now. They were aged 6 & 4 when we got together. I also have a son who was aged 4 when we got together. So we have x2 13 year olds and a 15 year old between us. In the 9 years we have been together I have always treated them the same, my son even goes as far as to say I spoil the girls more than him. I buy them clothes, shoes, makeup, give them money take them where ever they want to go, look after them when they’re down or sick, I’ve just been a really good bonus mum. 

My partner and his ex wife split because she was cheating with a neighbour. BM hasn’t had it easy, the neighbour turned out to be a (person interested in very young children) and there was a whole investigation done and social services & police were involved. My SD’s were not abused or anything and all tests and interviews came back clear. (Thankfully!) BM had a breakdown shortly after this and was committed to a mental health hospital for 3 months, in which time I stepped up as stand in mum whilst my partner was hard at work and trying his best to provide. 
There have been many ups and downs in the BM’s life over the years and we have always helped where we could. Every time she would always stab me in the back or find fault with something I had done. 

We had the girls religiously every weekend through their whole lives and every half term and half of the summer break.  We never ever faltered from the weekend commitment, we put our lives on hold to make sure the children came first. It got to the point that on a Sunday when we drove them back, there would be a phone call every Sunday to say “Tell her not to do this or that or the next” she always found something to complain about me for every weekend. Even down to using glitter hairspray on one of them because she went to a birthday party. She would always tell my partner that I had no right to tell the girls off, that only her or him had that right….. This is because I asked my SD several times to put something away that she left out on the coffee table and she kept saying in a minute all day. So I told her if it wasn’t moved in the next few minutes I would put it in the dustbin. She didn’t move it, so I put it in the garden and told my partner it was on the back step but that I wanted her to think it was in the bin, because I was sick of her ignoring me. The girls mother said this was child abuse and she was going to report me to social services! 🤦‍♀️

Anyway after years of the girls telling tales and playing off one parent against the other and telling lies/ causing unnecessary drama I’m at my wits end. 

The girls mum is honestly so toxic and the children have grown up in her image. They are allowed to do what they like, they wear thick makeup, short little skirts and hot pants, they aren’t monitored on their phones and I know the younger one takes inappropriate photos of her self and sends them to boys, she’s been doing that since she was 11 years old. 

I had to collect the oldest from town last weekend as she had been drinking neat vodka with her friends and passed out on the pavement in a busy town. The younger one had also been drinking vodka but ran off with her friends. Their mother was on holiday with her husband and so we had the girls for 10 days. 

I didn’t get mad or shout and neither did their father, we waited for her to finish being sick and put her to bed. When she woke we had a long talk about safety, responsibility and gave examples of the bad men that could take advantage of her if she was vulnerable. The topic of her mums ex boyfriend came up by her and he was given as an example of the bad men that can be on your doorstep and you wouldn’t even know. Trying to instil in her a little fear that bad men are everywhere and what she did put herself in danger. 

The oldest SD told us that she was raped around Halloween time by a boy at a party, and we had already reported this to her mother and arranged counselling and a visit to the doctors and tried to get her to speak to the police but they didn’t want to report it. I said to her that if she gets herself into vulnerable situations this could happen again. Passing out in the street is putting herself in danger. 

We installed apps on our phones and the girls phones when they were here for the 10 days so we could track where they were at any given time. If we hadn’t have done this we wouldn’t have known where the oldest was when she passed out, so it was a good thing that we did. 

Anyway roll on to the day their mother arrived back. Her flight didn’t arrive until after midnight but the kids wanted to go back to their mums house and stay there and wake up to their mum being home. We said absolutely not are you going to go and be unsupervised in a house by yourselves until your mum gets home. Their mum said it was okay. We said no, they can’t be trusted, they are both grounded for drinking and leaving them alone in a house is asking for trouble. Both the girls got upset and shouty. 

The next day their mum came to collect them and well you can imagine the amount of (Tell her not to do this or that or the next) the lies that are being told are out of control, my partner is beyond pissed off. I was more hurt than anything because I tried my best to be so nice and sweet and gave them both so much love and attention. Just to be completely stabbed in the back again. 

So after all 9 years of this I have told my partner that I cannot do this anymore. I cannot keep going through this toxic cycle of always being lied about or made out to be such a bad person. The girls only call him when they want money. They never visit, they don’t want to have rules or boundaries and their mum lets them do what they like. So where would you go if you were a teenage girl and wanted to get up to no good? 

My partner is so sad and fed up with the constant battle to get his kids on the right path. Their mother doesn’t want me in the girls lives and she bad mouths me all the time to them, even blocking my phone number on their phones at some points in time. It’s been a rollercoaster that I am now stepping off. But I don’t want to hurt my partner, I love him with all my heart. I am just not investing in those girls anymore time or energy. It’s all wasted & thrown back in my face. It’s so hurtful and so demeaning my heart can’t take it anymore.

Some helped a little, but nothing ever made a **real difference** in removing deep stains from coffee and tea.

I always assumed the only way to get dramatically whiter teeth was to pay hundreds of dollars at the dentist. But I recently came across **Laughland teeth whitening**, which uses **a dentist-formulated whitening gel** along with an **LED mouthpiece** to activate the ingredients. It seemed more advanced than the basic whitening strips I was used to, so I figured it was worth trying.

Here’s what happened when I used it for six days straight.

# What’s in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When I opened the box, I immediately noticed how **simple and mess-free** the setup was. No strips that slide around or trays filled with goo—just a **pen applicator** and a **mouthpiece with an LED light**. Here’s what’s included:

✔ **Whitening Gel Pens** – Easy to apply and not messy.  
✔ **LED Mouthpiece** – Activates the gel for deeper whitening.  
✔ **Clear Instructions** – No confusing steps or extra gimmicks.

I liked that the system felt **high quality** but not overly complicated.

# How I Used It

The best part? The whole routine takes just **10 minutes a day**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – This helps the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – Use the pen to coat each tooth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – Rinse your mouth and clean the device after each use.

It was easy enough to do while watching TV, so it never felt like an extra chore.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No dramatic changes yet, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** The yellowish stains from coffee were noticeably fading.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results looked natural—not too bright or fake.

Most surprisingly, **I didn’t experience any sensitivity**. I was expecting some discomfort (because that’s what always happens with strips), but this was completely pain-free.

# Why Laughland Stood Out from Other Whitening Methods

1. **No Sensitivity Issues** – The formula is designed to whiten without causing irritation.
2. **Better Coverage Than Strips** – The pen lets you **target every tooth**, so you don’t get uneven whitening.
3. **LED Light for Faster Results** – The light speeds up the process, helping break down stains better than strips.

# How It Compares to Other Whitening Products

* **Whitening Strips** – Gave me slight results but made my teeth sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintenance but didn’t remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Works well but is expensive and time-consuming.

Laughland was a **great in-between option**—more effective than strips, but without the cost of a professional treatment.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the gel is made to lift stains without weakening your teeth.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, I noticed a big difference in coffee stains.
3. **How long do results last?** – Avoiding staining foods and maintaining oral hygiene helps results last for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

✔ **Use it every day** – Don’t skip sessions if you want to see noticeable results.  
✔ **Avoid staining foods** – Cut back on coffee and wine while whitening.  
✔ **Brush & Floss Daily** – Keeps your teeth whiter for longer.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** worked **much better than strips**, and I liked that I didn’t have to deal with sensitivity. The results were noticeable, but still looked **natural**—not overly bright or artificial.

If you’re looking for a **convenient, painless, and effective** way to whiten your teeth, **this might be worth considering**.

The game has an even cozier vibe, and the coffee recipes make it slightly more challenging and engaging, which I really enjoy.

That said, I did run into a few small hiccups with certain recipes, so here are some tips if you're facing the same issues:

Iced Americano: The in-game recipe suggests adding ice, then cold water, then espresso. However, this often results in a weak, watered-down drink that customers dislike. What actually works is adding the ice first, then espresso, and finally cold water. This gives the drink the right strength and balance.

Iced Latte: Unlike the Americano, the recipe order for this one works as written—so no need to tweak anything here!

Espresso Shots: Even with all three steps perfected, I’ve noticed that customers sometimes leave bad reviews for a simple espresso shot. Not sure if this is a bug or just extra picky customers, but something to keep in mind!


Overall, I'm really enjoying Good Coffee, Great Coffee! It captures the charm of its pizza-themed counterpart while offering a fresh and immersive experience. Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves!

[Yun glasses](https://yun-berlin.com/glasses-intro) (Rosenthaler Strasse 11, 10119) are selling glasses for crazy low prices. I was a bit suspicious at first, because when things seem too good to be true, they usually are. But not in this case.

My eyesight is pretty bad so my usual bill is +€200 of extras on the frame price (protective coating, thinner lens to reduce the 'jam jar' effect, etc). Because my prescription needs less-common lenses that usually aren't in stock, I'm used to waiting days or even weeks to receive them.

Yun offer a 20 minute service and their prices are all-inclusive prices. They cut the lenses (acrylic only) on site, to-order. They have limited frame selections (\~30 max) to keep prices down they say, but still quite stylish and varied, and you can choose tints and so on.

Yesterday, my order was ready in *less than* 20 minutes. After ordering, I walked to a cafe, grabbed a coffee, walked back, and they were ready and waiting for me.

I paid the displayed price of **€159** —less than half the cost of my last pair from Fielmann— including the lense thinning, the UV and anti-scratch coating, and a simple case.

I have been having a hard time cutting caffeine out of my diet. I usually do green tea matcha from Rishi Tea (really good quality and great flavor) but haven't been able to get my hands on it lately because we're away from home for the past 5 months.

So I've been drinking energy pills and taking caffeine pills to save money but my sleep schedule has been absolutely destroyed because of this; even if I drink it early in the morning. I'm okay if I have matcha though.

So I already have broken up with coffee, yes, broken up. I'm a barista and it's been extremely heartbreaking and difficult accepting that coffee makes me violently nauseous and even causes physical pain in my stomach. I'm also Latina and have been drinking coffee since I was a little girl, even some family members work in coffee on the industrial and corporate side... You can imagine how hard it's been for me not to have my daily cafe con leche or cafecito.

I saw at Whole Foods, they have the Rishi matcha but also have chai concentrates with turmeric and ginger. I'm just wondering if the black tea in chai will affect me the same way coffee now affects me?

Yesterday, I forgot to take my caffeine pill and had a nasty migraine. I didn't realize I forgot to take it until 10 pm and knew I had some matcha somewhere and made myself a weak cup. I was worried it was gonna keep me up until 5 am, like coffee does but was surprised to find that I fell asleep within 2 hours of drinking it. So now I know that matcha will be okay to drink and I'll get back on my regular sleep schedule, but I also want to know if black tea will do the same and if it will make me nauseous the way coffee does?

[Rocket Appartamento],"I wrote about 10 days ago because I had a trouble dialing in with the Rocket Appartamento and wondered what I was doing wrong. Most common advice was that I was grinding too fine so I went coarser and coarser until it’s definitely not espresso grind anymore and the problem remained so I came to my barista who grinded me coffee especially for the machine but I still have the exact same problem. I realised that when there’s no portafilter and no coffee the water doesn’t actually come when I pull the lever until about 20seconds (which is probably why my pre infusion and extraction don’t work properly) and then when I stop and put the lever back a lot of water keeps flowing from the portafilter and the backflush. I made a video. I’ve seen video on YouTube of people using the machine and it doesn’t seem to behave like that so I wonder what am I doing wrong for it to take this long to have the water running and for the water then not to stop flowing? (Yes I wait for 20min and more for the machine to heat properly and there is enough water).
Anyone encountered that? Any clue would be really appreciated (it’s driving me crazy).

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

I'm a couple weeks in my pour over journey. While I habe managed a couple vibrant cups, I now feel like traveling backwards. Ironically, I also am aware of the new coffee drinkers syndrome...

I recently got a bag of Colombia san gabriel orange tabi light roast beans. Two weeks from roast, but can't really get anything out of them. Previous natural ethiopians had some nice flavours, although never really managed to dial in my setting either.

Currently I am using the hoffman method for 500ml coffee, 30g beans. After researching how to dial in the brew, I started underextracting on purpose. I increased the grind size, reduced pouring height, reduced water temp, reduced bloom time, and stopped all manual agitation. One variable at a time I started going back, but still nothing that stands out. If something positive, I now can easily discern between sour and bitter.

My best pour with this coffee was 30/500. Grind 80clicks Kingrinder K6. Water just off boil. Bloom 60g water for 45sec, swirl for even saturation. Pour up to 300g in small circles at medium height within 30seconds. Continue pouring to 500g in small circles from as low height as possible during the next 30 secs. One gentle swirl after maybe 10sec draw down. Total brew time was around 2min40sec (instead of reference 3min30sec). The outcome had some acidity, but no clear taste notes, no bitter or astringent aftertaste either.

Going back and forth in variables didn't seem to do much for me. Instead I'm inclined to blame the beans. The flavour profile has been described as dark cookie, cream, pear and the palate as sweet and spicy. The previous ethiopian had notes of citrus, orange, watermelon and black tea. Obiously the latter has more pronounced acidic and clean profile, is this just my taste preference? To add to the confusion, I had this same Colombian in pre-ground beans at ny vacation house, and brewed mediocre cups with my Moccamaster dripper, and I could actually taste some caramel in there...

Blame the beans or the brewer? Would it be better to get a bigger bulk bag for less money and practice brewing in larger quantities, instead of 1-2 times a day, or is it harder to dial in due to lower quality of product?",4,1741263260.0,pourover,11,1.0,False

Is this common here? Does it last long? All I could find were power outages from last year/ or older.

I have to login for work in a few hours not sure if I should have faith or if I should start trekking to a coffee shop with wifi outside of this city or something...
