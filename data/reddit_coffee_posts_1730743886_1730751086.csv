1gjnsdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfricanGrey/comments/1gjnsdh/my_cag_hit_his_beak_today_should_i_be_worried/,My CAG hit his beak today. Should I be worried?,"He wanted to fly over to the coffee table and miscalculated the distance. He ended up hitting the corner with his face. He didn't yell in pain and seems fine.

I checked and there was a tiny drop of blood on his beak which dried out pretty much immediately. Now it looks like a very tiny piece is broken off, but it's not even noticeable if you don't know to look for it. Basically the tip is a bit dull now.

He's eating/drinking water no problem, and he's been talking and playing around in his cage so he seems perfectly fine. The only reason I didn't take him to the emergency vet is because he gets stressed and he wasn't actively bleeding, plus he wasn't screaming in pain and was behaving as usual.

Will his beak grow back / will he reshape it? Should I be freaking out more because I almost had a heart attack when he hit the table. Thanks!",2,1730750736.0,AfricanGrey,0,1.0,False

1gjnplz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1gjnplz/a_quick_review_on_fine_art_wedding_albums/,A quick review on fine art wedding albums,"BBBs, if you just got married you‚Äôre probably thinking of having your wedding photos printed out in an album to keep as a coffee book. I did quite a bit of research into what to buy / not buy and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found:

1. A lot of people seem to like Artifact Uprising but I honestly find their products underwhelming for the price. The colors on the photos for our $250 guest book were completely off. They tend to print them on the darker side, which I‚Äôm not a big fan of. The photos also don‚Äôt look crisp. We put up with it because it was our guest book and not the end of the world if it‚Äôs not perfect. 

2. Depends on who your photographer is and who they work with, it may or may not be worth going through them. A lot of luxury photographers work with bookbinders who do not sell direct to consumer, and they only work with professionals. For those the upcharge might be worth it (probably a few grand to start). However, I found out my own photographer‚Äôs assistant literally just uses Milk Book LMAO!!! We were quoted about $1500 when the exact same book on the Milk Book website is $500 if you design the layout yourself üíÄ

3. Girl math says if buy the milk book directly from the website, I‚Äôm making $1000 right? ü§£ Their online editing tool was the biggest PITA, but our milk book (the premium fine art wedding album) came in today and I was quite impressed by the quality!! The pages are thick, the linen feels luxurious, but most importantly the colors are gorgeous and the photos are crisp!! Milk book often has 30% off sales during the holidays and it‚Äôs super worth waiting till then to buy. 

TLDR: worth buying your album from your photographer if they work with a non direct to consumer bookbinder, otherwise Milk Book is great for BBBs

1gjnpfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gjnpfc/you_dont_owe_me_anything/,You don‚Äôt owe me anything.,"I used to wake up hours before you. You‚Äôd stay up later than me and scroll. I left you coffee, in a thermos every morning so it wouldn‚Äôt get cold. I hated those drives to the office after I had to take that new job. I could feel every inch of the gap growing between you and I. I‚Äôve had a broken heart before but never such a slow, tortuous demise. You‚Äôd talk in your sleep but besides that, you were at such peace. Such a difference between your waking state‚Äîa whirlwind of anxiety.

I‚Äôm not sure why I thought things would get better. I know you told me they would. But they never did. I saw your life improve but our relationship did not. I learned how to love you by being your caretaker. After burying the love you gave me the whole first year. I‚Äôm already a giver and it‚Äôs never transactional. When the person I love needs help, my body just moves. My mouth offers, my hands are always there to hold. You still said it was the worst years of your life. ‚ÄúOh, but not you, no. Everything with us is amazing.‚Äù I love without regrets. I learned that from old loves. But I can‚Äôt help but feel I should have been more perceptive to those words.

When you forgot our day and mine, I knew you were gone. I had psychosis that week. I kept seeing the room fill with black tar. The psych said it was stress induced. I think my understanding of the world broke. Because you weren‚Äôt real anymore. While I lay on the floor struggling to breath you disassociated in the other room. Playing your games. I know we both had to learn how to be in this world. And it was harder than most people‚Äôs journey. But I didn‚Äôt realize until that week you had been pretending to be a lover. Acting things out. Saying the words. But you don‚Äôt really understand the feelings I felt for you. Or if you did, you forgot how they once moved you. When you felt them yourself, If you ever did. 

After that conversation, you were a ghost in the house. And in the months since you moved out, where I packed your things because you couldn‚Äôt leave your screens, and your friends shuffled you out. You only reached out twice. For a ride, and for your mirror. The last thing you ever said to me, was that you didn‚Äôt owe me anything. I never thought you did, C. I just thought you really loved me. My mistake. It will be one I‚Äôll never  forget.

1gjnin5,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1gjnin5/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_25/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 25 (Part 2)","Jim drove back to Dilworth, and then he got on Park Road.¬† He would take his time driving down Park Road.¬† In fact, he went no faster than thirty-five.¬† Jim‚Äôs favorite Sunday afternoon jazz show was still on the air.¬† Jim pulled into the parking lot of the Park Road Shopping Center and parked the car.

At the Park Road Shopping Center, Jim and Sydney went to a portrait studio.¬† Sydney had planned to have their engagement photos taken.¬† Jim and Sydney stood very close to one another.¬† Both had warm and fuzzy feelings running through them.¬† After the photo session was over, Jim and Sydney gave each other a quick kiss on the lips.

After they left the portrait studio, Jim drove past the Firestone store where Jonah Marlowe was now working.¬† Of course, it was closed, being Sunday.¬† Next to the Firestone store was a convenience store.¬† Jim got a look at the fuel gauge.¬† He felt it was time to gas up.¬† He pulled in, prepaid his gas, and then he filled up the Impala.¬† Meanwhile, Sydney volunteered to go in and get a snack and two bottles of Coke while Jim filled up the car.¬† Jim expected to see at least one of his friends pull into the gas pump area and maybe say they missed him and Sydney in church.¬† That did not happen.

Sydney returned with two bottles of Coke and a small bag of hot flavored pork rinds.¬† After Jim got done filling up, he got back onto Park Road.¬† Once again, he drove slowly.¬† Jim and Sydney admired the fall colors.¬† And there was plenty of it all over Charlotte.¬† Sydney offered Jim some of her pork rinds.¬† He ate a couple.¬† After a few, Sydney felt she had enough pork rinds and put the bag in the glove compartment.¬† By just after four o‚Äô clock, Jim had reached Highway 51 and Pineville.¬† Then, Carolina Place Mall.¬† Jim asked Sydney if she would like to walk around the mall.¬† Sydney said she would.

Jim parked the car near the entrance for Barnes and Noble Booksellers.¬† That was the store they went to first.¬† Jim bought a couple car magazines.¬† Sydney bought a magazine on wedding planning.¬† Jim felt it was a good choice.¬† She also bought a magazine on honeymoon destinations.¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúI was leaning toward Charleston and maybe Myrtle Beach, like Candi and I did.‚Äù

Sydney looked through the magazine.¬† She saw there were sections on both Charleston and Myrtle Beach.¬† She said, ‚ÄúI was leaning toward both places, too.¬† Maybe this magazine will have some good ideas on what to do, and where to stay.‚Äù

After they paid for their magazines, Jim and Sydney walked around the mall some more.¬† They went into Belk.¬† They went straight to the kitchen department.¬† Jim looked at the coffee and tea pods for his Keurig.¬† There was a box of various teas, which included pods for Lipton Iced Tea, English tea, and herbal teas including orange and spice, cinnamon and one called ‚ÄúSleepy Time.‚Äù¬† Sydney saw Jim checking it out.¬† He said, ‚ÄúMaybe I should buy that.‚Äù

Sydney already had two boxes of coffee pods, one for Folger‚Äôs and the other for Starbucks.¬† She also had a box of pods for hot cocoa.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, you bought me a beautiful engagement ring.¬† Please let me buy you something.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt mind buying you that box of tea pods.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Sydney.¬† If you‚Äôd like to, that‚Äôll be okay with me.‚Äù

After she paid for the purchases, Sydney asked for a large bag.¬† Jim was carrying the bag with magazines from Barnes and Noble.¬† Sydney asked Jim to hand her that bag.¬† She put it in the Belk bag so there would not be so much to carry.¬† Then Jim volunteered to carry the bag, so Sydney handed it to him.

Jim and Sydney got ready to leave Belk.¬† They were stopped by a voice.¬† A familiar one.¬† ‚ÄúHey!¬† Jim Faulkner!¬† Sydney Cavanaugh!‚Äù

Jim and Sydney both froze in their tracks.¬† They turned around to see a woman dressed in a red business suit with a white blouse headed toward them.¬† But not just any woman.¬† It was Audrey Holbrook.¬† Jim and Sydney both heard recently that she lost her job a few weeks ago and was now working at Belk in Carolina Place Mall.¬† Audrey said, ‚ÄúJim and Sydney, what a surprise it is to see you two here.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúHi, Audrey.¬† I heard you are working here now.‚Äù

Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúHi, Audrey.¬† Good to see you.‚Äù

Audrey said, ‚ÄúGood to see you two as well.¬† I‚Äôm just working here part-time for the holidays.¬† I missed you two in church this morning.‚Äù

The three walked to a bench across from the store entrance.¬† They sat down.¬† Audrey said, ‚ÄúI heard about everything this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean about me asking Sydney to marry me?‚Äù Jim asked.

Audrey answered, ‚ÄúYes, Jim and Sydney.¬† Congrats, you two.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúThanks, Audrey.‚Äù

Then Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Audrey.¬† Thank you.¬† How did you find out?‚Äù

Audrey answered, ‚ÄúI found out from Malachi, Vince and Paulina.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I'll bet they told Julie and she mentioned it to the congregation, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù Jim asked.

Audrey said, ‚ÄúYes, she did.¬† She wants to speak to you two as soon as possible.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry.¬† We will.‚Äù

Then Audrey got a look at the bag, and then she asked Jim and Sydney, ‚ÄúWhat did you two buy from our great store?‚Äù

Sydney was the one who answered that question.¬† ‚ÄúWe bought some Keurig pods.¬† Coffees, teas and cocoa.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good,‚Äù Audrey said.

Jim said, ‚ÄúI have been wanting to try some herbal teas for some time.‚Äù

Audrey said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, Jim.‚Äù

Sydney asked, ‚ÄúDid Julie have anything new on the plans for the new church?‚Äù

Audrey said, ‚ÄúNo, Sydney.¬† She did want to announce those plans, but she had something more important to announce.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?¬† What was it?‚Äù Jim asked.

Audrey looked as though she was trying to find some words.¬† But then, they finally came out.¬† ‚ÄúDennis Jacobson passed away last night.‚Äù

Jim‚Äôs mouth dropped open.¬† Then he asked, ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

Then Sydney asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Audrey answered, ‚ÄúIt was a heart attack.¬† Massive and sudden, from what I heard.¬† An ambulance had to be called out to Patriot Auto Parts on South Boulevard.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOh, man!¬† That's so sad!‚Äù

Audrey continued to tell Jim and Sydney about Dennis Jacobson‚Äôs death.¬† ‚ÄúSomeone on South Boulevard saw the door wide open.¬† No one inside.¬† No lights on.¬† That sounded like trouble.¬† They went inside to find Dennis lying on the floor, unconscious.¬† He was also holding his chest.¬† They called for the paramedics.¬† They sent him to the hospital, but he didn‚Äôt make it.¬† He died in surgery.‚Äù

Jim and Sydney sat there, not sure what to think.¬† But Jim ended up saying, ‚ÄúI cannot believe that.¬† We all saw him at those two cars shows this year.¬† But now, he‚Äôs gone.¬† So be it.‚Äù

Audrey said, ‚ÄúJulie said she will probably end up doing the funeral.¬† No idea when that will take place.‚Äù

Sydney brought up something else.¬† ‚ÄúI understand Morgan did a solo today.¬† How did that go?‚Äù

Audrey answered, ‚ÄúIt went great.¬† As usual, she had a voice like an angel.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúI figured that.¬† I‚Äôll bet she wore something pretty.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† Her dress was pretty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was she wearing?‚Äù Jim asked.

Audrey answered, ‚ÄúYou can see for yourself.¬† Julie said she‚Äôd post a video on her Facebook page.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúSounds good.¬† I‚Äôll have to check it out.¬† I‚Äôve had my cell phone off all day.¬† I just wanted to enjoy this day with Sydney.‚Äù

Audrey smiled and said, ‚ÄúI best be getting back to work.¬† This was my only break of the day.¬† I‚Äôll be working until six this evening.‚Äù

Audrey gave Jim and Sydney a hug, and she congratulated them again on their engagement.¬† Jim and Sydney were on their way once more.

Jim and Sydney were starting to get hungry.¬† They agreed on eating somewhere in the mall.¬† Sydney said, ‚ÄúAnywhere here in the mall can be a special place to eat as far as I‚Äôm concerned.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Sydney.¬† I‚Äôll find somewhere to eat.‚Äù

But before they could find somewhere to eat, they passed a store they needed to stop at.¬† Jim pointed to it and said, ‚ÄúSydney, look.¬† Hallmark.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúOh, yes.¬† Let‚Äôs step inside.‚Äù

Jim and Sydney stepped inside.¬† They both went to the wall that had all those ornaments.¬† The first thing Jim looked for was that ornament of the 1955 Ford Fairlane.¬† It took Jim less than a minute to find it.¬† He picked it up.¬† Meanwhile, Sydney was looking for an ornament as well.¬† Jim looked at Sydney as she was looking for whatever she was looking for.¬† Jim saw another ornament that got his attention.¬† Tinker Bell.¬† One of Caitlyn‚Äôs favorites.¬† *I may go ahead and get that*, Jim thought.¬† After he got it, he walked to where Sydney was.¬† He asked her, ‚ÄúWhat did you get?‚Äù

Sydney showed Jim when she got there.¬† She told Jim that was her other surprise.¬† It was called ‚ÄúOur First Christmas Together.‚Äù¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúSydney, that is pretty, just like you.‚Äù

Sydney smiled.¬† She said, ‚ÄúThank you, Jim.¬† I think I made a good choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean about the ornament you picked out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† That one.‚Äù

Jim showed Sydney the ornaments he picked out.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, those are nice.¬† Especially the one of Tinker Bell.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† Tinker Bell is one of Caitlyn's favorites.¬† And of course, the car is for me.¬† I always get a car ornament every year.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I can see that.¬† There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.‚Äù

After they paid for their ornaments, Jim and Sydney walked the mall some more.¬† They passed J.C. Penney.¬† There was a huge flat-screen T.V. in a display window.¬† Jim and Sydney saw the Carolina Panthers taking on the San Francisco 49ers.¬† They didn‚Äôt stay long enough to see what the score was.¬† They just went back to walking.¬† They reached the food court.¬† Jim and Sydney took about a couple minutes to decide.¬† They saw McAlister‚Äôs Deli.¬† Jim had been in the mood for one of their sandwiches for some time.¬† Jim asked Sydney, ‚ÄúHow would McAlister‚Äôs Deli sound?‚Äù

Sydney answered, ‚ÄúSounds good to me.¬† I like their food.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, then.¬† McAlister‚Äôs Deli it is.‚Äù

Jim and Sydney went into McAlister‚Äôs Deli.¬† Sydney ordered first.¬† She chose broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl, a salad with ranch dressing, a bag of potato chips and an iced tea.¬† Jim opted for a ham and turkey sandwich, a chef‚Äôs salad with ranch dressing, a bag of potato chips and a Coke.¬† While they waited for their food, Jim asked Sydney, ‚ÄúAre you enjoying this special day so far?‚Äù

Sydney answered, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† And it is because I‚Äôm spending it with you.‚Äù

On the speakers, Rita Coolidge was singing ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre All Alone.‚Äù¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúI am enjoying this day also.¬† We sure did a lot today.‚Äù

Sydney asked Jim, ‚ÄúWould it be okay if I checked my phone right quick and see if I have any messages?‚Äù

Jim smiled at Sydney, and he said to her, ‚ÄúYeah.¬† Sure.¬† Go ahead.¬† Sometime soon, I may have to turn on my phone for the same reason.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† You will have to.‚Äù

Jim did turn on his cell phone.¬† Jim had his cell phone off all day, so there was a good possibility that he would have quite a bit of messages.¬† Sydney had her phone off for about five hours.¬† She turned her phone on and checked her messages, starting with her voice mail.¬† She had many messages, all from her friends.¬† April Lynn, Hannah, Allison, Marissa, Scout, Ariel, Kendra, Victoria, Brooke, Crystal, Ashley, Paulina, Jodi, Rebecca and her husband and daughters, Charity Loudermilk and the entire Courtland family.¬† They all pretty much said the same thing.¬† They congratulated her and Jim and their engagement.¬† Three of them wondered where they were.¬† Sydney texted all of them back.¬† The speaker was now playing another song.¬† Dean Friedman.¬† His song was about a girl named Ariel.¬† Right away, Jim‚Äôs mind went back to one hot summer day at Faulkner Motors.¬† It was back in 1987.¬† Jim and Sydney had a friend named Ariel.¬† Jodi‚Äôs sister.¬† She was now married to Simon Cavanaugh.¬† Sydney‚Äôs brother, and another one of Jim's friends.¬† They now had three children.¬† Their son is named Nelson, and their twin baby girls are named Kaci and Lucy.¬† Hearing that song made Jim think of that moment at his father‚Äôs used car lot.¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing like a classic song to take you back to simpler times,‚Äù he said.

Sydney looked up from her cell phone and said, ‚ÄúJim, you are one hundred percent right.¬† Any song can do it.‚Äù

Sydney was now checking out her Facebook page.¬† Jim asked her, ‚ÄúDid you find that video?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the one of Morgan‚Äôs solo in church this morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† That one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I just found it.‚Äù

Sydney showed Jim the video.¬† Sure enough, Morgan was dressed pretty.¬† She was wearing a dark blue dress with puffed sleeves.¬† Her high-heeled shoes were about the same color.¬† She was singing ‚ÄúGive Them All to Jesus.‚Äù¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúShe is dressed pretty.¬† And her voice is like an angel.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† We all know that.‚Äù

Just as Sydney said that, the food was served.¬† Jim allowed Sydney to say the blessing.¬† Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing like broccoli cheddar soup on a cool day like today.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, I do agree.¬† Maybe I should‚Äôve ordered it.¬† But I guess I was in the mood for a sandwich.‚Äù

Sydney got a look at his sandwich.¬† She said, ‚ÄúIt does look good.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs appropriate for this time of year.¬† It has ham, turkey and a little cranberry sauce.¬† Would you like a small piece?‚Äù

Sydney answered, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt mind a small piece.‚Äù

Jim cut off a small piece for Sydney.¬† After she ate it, she said, ‚ÄúJim, you are right.¬† This is good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant another small piece?‚Äù Jim asked.

Sydney answered, ‚ÄúNo, thanks.¬† I‚Äôll just enjoy my soup.‚Äù

Jim and Sydney continued to eat their food.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôll bet you don‚Äôt know how my name came about.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuppose you tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom told me this just before I graduated high school.¬† She and Dad took a trip up to Canada, to the Atlantic Provinces.¬† One of the places they went to was Nova Scotia.¬† They visited a place called Sydney.¬† They thought it was pretty and it was one of the best places they visited.¬† When they got back home to Charlotte, Mom found out she was pregnant.¬† They found out it would be a girl.¬† They decided to call me Sydney after the place they visited.¬† That‚Äôs how my name came about.¬† Sydney Dawn Cavanaugh.¬† My middle name came from one of Dad‚Äôs sisters.‚Äù

Jim looked at Sydney for a moment.¬† Then he said, ‚ÄúIt sounds to me like they made a good choice.¬† Thank you for telling me that story.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúI felt you should know.¬† I‚Äôve never told a lot of people that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSydney Dawn Cavanaugh.¬† I suppose that does have a nice ring to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† We‚Äôll have to make out our wedding invitations.¬† I will have to put my full name on them.¬† And yours.¬† Another reason why you should know.‚Äù

Jim let out a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúYes, Sydney.¬† You are right about that.¬† We need to get busy with our wedding planning.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúI asked Mom a while back about Aunt Dawn.¬† She told me she lives in South Carolina, about halfway between Charleston and Georgetown.¬† Mom said it was that little town that was hit big time by Hurricane Hugo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean McClellanville?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.¬† That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

Sydney went on to tell Jim that her Aunt Dawn never married and preached at a small but modest United Methodist Church just off U.S. Highway 17.¬† Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúMom said once that my brothers came from books in the Bible.¬† Mark‚Äôs real name is Mark Ezekiel Cavanaugh, and Simon‚Äôs is Simon Ezra Cavanaugh.¬† Mom and Dad did both so that both Testaments were represented.¬† Their first names are from the New Testament, and the middle names are from the Old Testament.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds interesting.¬† How about Alex?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kept her name simple.¬† Alexandria Michelle Cavanaugh.¬† Mom said that was for no real reason.¬† She told Alex that time and again.‚Äù

Then Jim said, ‚ÄúSydney, don‚Äôt look now, but I do think we have some company.‚Äù

Jim looked in the direction of the door.¬† Sydney turned around.¬† They both saw Vince and April Lynn approaching their table.¬† Vince was wearing a suit and a tie.¬† April Lynn was wearing a white blouse and a plaid skirt.¬† April Lynn said to Jim and Sydney, ‚ÄúJulie‚Äôs going to have your necks skipping church this morning.‚Äù

Jim said to Vince and April Lynn, ‚ÄúOh, hi.¬† We‚Äôre just enjoying a day together.‚Äù

Vince said, ‚ÄúWe heard about it in church this morning.¬† Congrats, you two.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúThanks.¬† As you two can see, we‚Äôre very happy.‚Äù

Vince said, ‚ÄúI had to bring Marissa.¬† She wanted to do some shopping.¬† She asked Hannah to come along.¬† They‚Äôre in Dillard‚Äôs.¬† I just hope Marissa doesn‚Äôt end up buying out the whole store.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Jim said, ‚ÄúOh, I wouldn‚Äôt worry.¬† I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs too much of a chance of that happening.‚Äù

April Lynn just sat there and laughed.¬† Sydney asked, ‚ÄúApril Lynn, why aren‚Äôt you shopping with Marissa and Hannah?‚Äù

April Lynn answered, ‚ÄúI just wasn‚Äôt up to it.¬† Nothing I need, anyway.‚Äù

Then Vince asked, ‚ÄúSo, what have you two lovebirds been up to today?‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see.¬† We had breakfast at IHOP near Southpark Mall, went to the Southern Christmas Show, watched trains, we rode around Charlotte some, and we even got our engagement pictures taken.‚Äù

Sydney added, ‚ÄúAll that before we ended up here.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúWe got some Christmas ornaments.¬† I got the 1955 Ford ornament from Hallmark.‚Äù

Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúI got one that says, ‚ÄúOur First Christmas Together.‚Äô‚Äù

Then Jim took another out of the bag from Hallmark.¬† He said, ‚ÄúThis one of Tinker Bell is for Caitlyn.‚Äù

Vince and April Lynn both said the same thing.¬† ‚ÄúHow nice.‚Äù

Then Hannah and Marissa showed up.¬† Hannah was pushing Marissa in her wheelchair.¬† Hannah said, ‚ÄúWell, look here!¬† There‚Äôs the happy couple!‚Äù

Sydney blushed a little.¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúHi, Hannah and Marissa.¬† I guess you can say we are a happy couple.‚Äù

Marissa said, ‚ÄúCongrats, you two.¬† Sydney, you deserve that ring.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúThanks.¬† All of you.‚Äù

Then Sydney showed everyone her engagement ring.¬† Everyone had the same reaction.¬† They all thought it was pretty and Jim had made the right choice.¬† Then another question came up.¬† April Lynn asked, ‚ÄúSo, when will the wedding take place?‚Äù

Sydney laughed as she answered, ‚ÄúWe just got engaged.¬† But trust us.¬† We‚Äôll let you know, and you will all be invited.‚Äù

Vince asked, ‚ÄúJim, have you two picked out what kind of wedding you want, a church wedding or a backyard wedding like you and Candi had?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt got that far yet.¬† We have been talking about maybe having a backyard wedding.¬† I hope we can have it exactly like the one Candi and I had.‚Äù

Marissa said, ‚ÄúOh, Jim!¬† What a wonderful idea!‚Äù

Then Hannah said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† Nothing could beat that wedding.¬† It seemed like one of the happiest days of my life because I got to see two of my best friends getting married.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean one of the happiest days of *our* lives,‚Äù April Lynn said, emphasizing the word *our*.

After a few seconds of silence, April Lynn said, ‚ÄúJim and Sydney, I suppose you two haven‚Äôt heard yet.¬† Dennis Jacobson died last night.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúYes.¬† We know.¬† We saw Audrey in Belk.¬† She told us.‚Äù

Then Marissa said, ‚ÄúJulie‚Äôs going to have to do his funeral.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Hannah said, ‚ÄúWe all know Julie doesn't like doing funerals.‚Äù

Vince said, ‚ÄúJim and Sydney, we are all glad you two are engaged.¬† We know Julie would love to do your wedding.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúI know.¬† Sydney and I would love to have Julie do our wedding.¬† We know it would make her happy.¬† We know it would make her happy.‚Äù

April Lynn said, ‚ÄúYes, you two.¬† Because you two are her friends and she does love you two dearly.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúWe know she does.¬† We just may go ahead and do that.‚Äù

Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let Julie know about it as soon as we set a date.¬† As we said, we haven‚Äôt got that far yet.‚Äù

They talked some more about last night‚Äôs dinner and engagement.¬† Then April Lynn brought up something else.¬† ‚ÄúAlex got asked out on a date this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?¬† By whom?‚Äù Jim asked.

April Lynn answered, ‚ÄúRaleigh Forester.¬† He works for a trucking business on Graham Street off Interstate 85.‚Äù

Sydney asked, ‚ÄúYou mean the man who has that little boy who never talks to girls?‚Äù

April Lynn said, ‚ÄúYes.¬† And from what I‚Äôve been hearing, Wendell Forester had best get used to talking to girls because a lot of them will be crossing his path.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known quite a few boys like Wendell,‚Äù Jim said.

Hannah asked April Lynn, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the name of this trucking business?‚Äù

‚ÄúFairburn Transport,‚Äù April Lynn answered.

That was when Jim‚Äôs cell phone rang.¬† He had it off all day but decided to turn it on after he and Sydney ate dinner because he felt his girls would possibly call him, or maybe his mother and his half-sisters.¬† Sure enough, one of his girls called him.¬† It was Chelsea.¬† She said, ‚ÄúDad, I just wanted to call you and let you know Lauren and I made it home okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, honey.¬† How was your time with Natalie and Megan?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, it was good.¬† We did a good bit of studying.¬† Lauren and Megan watched some TV and played some video games.¬† We went to church this morning, and then we ate at McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúSounds like you all enjoyed yourselves.¬† There‚Äôs some steak, salad, shrimp, bread, Jell-O parfaits and black forest cake in the fridge.¬† Help yourselves.‚Äù

Chelsea said, ‚ÄúThank you, Dad.¬† That sounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou may have to make some fries.¬† Use the deep fryer if you need to.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† We can do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.¬† We‚Äôll be home soon.‚Äù

Then Chelsea asked, ‚ÄúDo you need me to drive to Nana Wendy‚Äôs house and get Lindsay, Valerie and Chelsea?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Chelsea.¬† That‚Äôs okay.¬† Sydney and I will get them.¬† We may go there and stay for a few minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† You two be careful coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, honey.¬† I‚Äôm going to go so I can call your Nana Wendy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† Say hello to her and our aunts for us, okay?‚Äù

Jim said he would, and then he ended the call.¬† Then he called his mother.¬† He said, ‚ÄúMother, I‚Äôm close to your house and I would like to stop by and see you and pick up my daughters.‚Äù

Wendy said, ‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† You know I always enjoy seeing you.‚Äù

Then Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Mom.¬† I will be bringing Sydney along with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† I‚Äôd love to see her, too.‚Äù

After Jim ended the phone call, he told Sydney they would be going to his mother‚Äôs house.¬† She said that would be okay.¬† Then they asked for take-out boxes for their food, and they had their drink cups refilled.¬† Vince, Marissa, Hannah and April Lynn said good-bye to Jim and Sydney, and that they would see them later.¬†

Jim drove to his mother‚Äôs house in Ballantyne, which was not far from Carolina Place Mall.¬† The sky above was now pitch black.¬† There were a few houses already decorated for Christmas, and it was only the middle of November, and Thanksgiving was about a couple weeks away.¬† When Jim called Wendy, he did not tell her about him and Sydney being engaged.¬† Jim wondered if she and his half-sisters attended church services this morning, or even if she heard about asking Sydney to marry him.¬† He would soon find out.

Jim parked his Impala at the curb in front of Wendy‚Äôs house.¬† The garage door was open, revealing Wendy‚Äôs BMW and Emily‚Äôs Camaro.¬† Charlie‚Äôs Toyota was parked in the driveway.¬† The porch light was on.¬† Jim and Sydney made their way up the front porch.¬† Wendy looked out the living room window.¬† She smiled as she saw Jim and Sydney walk past the window.¬† Wendy quickly walked to the front door and she let them in.¬† Just about as quickly, Wendy asked Jim and Sydney to sit down in the living room.¬† There were two sofas situated across from one another.¬† Jim and Sydney sat down on one of them.¬†

Wendy fixed five glasses of iced tea.¬† One for herself, one each for Jim and Sydney, and one each for Emily and Charlie.¬† Just as Emily and Charlie showed in the living room, they sat down in the two recliners in the room.¬† Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn were still upstairs in the guest room where they had been staying.

Jim started off by saying, ‚ÄúI guess you all are wondering why we are here.‚Äù

Wendy said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† And we‚Äôre guessing it‚Äôs not just to pick up your girls.‚Äù

Jim and Sydney looked at each other, and they smiled at each other.¬† Then Jim said, ‚ÄúMom, Emily and Charlie.¬† We have something major to tell you.‚Äù

Wendy, Emily and Charlie looked at Jim and Sydney.¬† For a moment, there was some silence.¬† Jim and Sydney just smiled at one another.¬† Then, Emily finally said, ‚ÄúJim and Sydney, you two are keeping us in suspense.¬† What on earth is it?‚Äù

Jim took Sydney‚Äôs hand, the one with the ring.¬† Sydney asked, ‚ÄúJim, can I tell them?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, honey.¬† Sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúWendy, Emily and Charlie.¬† Jim and I are engaged!‚Äù

Sydney showed the three her engagement ring.¬† Emily said, ‚ÄúSydney, that is gorgeous!‚Äù

Then Charlie said, ‚ÄúSydney, that ring is so beautiful, just like you!‚Äù

Then Wendy said, ‚ÄúJim, you did make a good choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, all of you.¬† I think God meant for Sydney and I to be together.‚Äù

Emily asked, ‚ÄúJim, how did you propose to her?¬† Did you do anything special and romantic?‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúI started off with a special dinner made by me.¬† Steak, baked potatoes, boiled shrimp, bread and salad, and Jell-O parfaits and black forest cake for dessert.¬† After that, I took Sydney to the utility room to show her something.¬† I used my die-cast car collection made into a heart.¬† I also used those cars to make out a question.¬† But not just any question.¬† I popped the question to her.¬† And she said yes!‚Äù

Their mouths nearly dropped.¬† Wendy said, ‚ÄúJim, I have to say that getting you started on die-cast cars when you were very young did you some good.‚Äù

Then Emily said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say.¬† I can see why you enjoy those cars, Jim.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen is the big day?‚Äù Charlie asked.

Jim said, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt gotten that far yet.¬† I just popped the question to her.‚Äù

Wendy said, ‚ÄúJim and Sydney, you two know we‚Äôre happy for you.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúThanks, Wendy.¬† We are so happy.‚Äù

Wendy asked everyone if they would like another glass of iced tea.¬† Everyone said they would like iced tea.¬† Jim said he would help her in the kitchen.¬†

Jim and Wendy went into the kitchen.¬† Meanwhile, Sydney and Charlie went upstairs to see if Jim‚Äôs girls were about ready to go home.¬† Emily said she had to go to the bathroom.¬† Wendy said to Jim, ‚ÄúI sure am glad to see you happy with someone special.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúI suppose it was about time to get back into living.¬† I did say time and again that I was not about to allow anyone in my life if she would not accept my girls.¬† I always knew Sydney would.‚Äù

Wendy said, ‚ÄúJim, life is worth living.¬† I told you that a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mom.¬† Maybe I‚Äôm glad to have someone to love and marry, especially with the holidays coming.‚Äù

Then Wendy had a question about the upcoming holiday season.¬† ‚ÄúJim, do you and the girls have any special plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe just the usual stuff.¬† Thanksgiving dinner at my house.¬† Then we‚Äôll put up the tree with those new ornaments we got today.¬† And of course, I‚Äôll have to get presents for my girls.¬† Santa Claus still does visit my house.‚Äù

Wendy let out a laugh and said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† And Santa still stops here as well.‚Äù

Then Jim asked, ‚ÄúMom, do you think I am making the right move, I mean as far as asking Sydney to marry me and all that?‚Äù

Wendy said, ‚ÄúJim, I think you are.¬† Sydney has always had a crush on you.¬† She did seem hurt when you and Candi started dating.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mom.¬† So did April Lynn.¬† But they got over it.¬† And we were still friends.‚Äù

Wendy put the glasses of iced tea on the table.¬† Then she said, ‚ÄúJim, it just so happens I have some cheesecake in the fridge.¬† How about some?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind?‚Äù

‚ÄúCherry cheesecake, Jim.¬† Your favorite.‚Äù

Jim was quick to accept.¬† Wendy took the cheesecake out of the refrigerator, along with a tub of Cool Whip.¬† She asked Jim to call everyone to the table.¬† Emily showed up first.¬† Then came Charlie and Sydney, followed by Lindsay and Valerie and Caitlyn.¬† Everyone sat down and helped themselves to cheesecake.¬† They had some good food and good conversation.¬†

After all that, Jim and Sydney and the girls were ready to head for home.¬† Jim took Park Road all the way back to Dilworth.¬† This time, he left the top up on his Impala.¬† The air was starting to get quite chilly and he did not want his girls getting sick, especially with the holiday season approaching.¬† There was very little traffic on Park Road, so Jim had no trouble getting home.

Jim parked his car in the garage.¬† They all went straight into the house.¬† They went into the house to see Chelsea and Lauren sitting at the table, eating some of the leftovers of last night‚Äôs dinner.¬† They did not make fries, as Jim said they could do.¬† Chelsea did not eat steak, but she did eat a big bowl of salad, a yeast roll and some Jell-O parfaits and cake, both topped with Cool Whip.¬† Lauren asked Jim and Sydney, ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù¬†

Jim said, ‚ÄúIt was pretty good.¬† We enjoyed ourselves.‚Äù

Then Chelsea asked, ‚ÄúSydney, did Dad pop the question?‚Äù

Silence, for a moment.¬† Then, Sydney gave the answer.¬† ‚ÄúYes, girls.¬† He did.‚Äù

Sydney showed them the ring.¬† All five girls had the same reaction.¬† They all thought the ring was pretty.¬† And all five were happy for Jim and Sydney.¬† Especially Caitlyn.¬† At first, she didn‚Äôt want Jim and Sydney to be together.¬† Now, she was happy to accept Sydney.¬† True, she and Valerie never really knew their mother, until Jim told them about her.¬† After they all got a look at Sydney‚Äôs engagement ring, the girls went on to bed.¬† Jim and Sydney decided to stay up a little longer.¬† They went outside on the front porch.¬† They wanted to make a wish on the first star they saw.¬† And they did.¬† Jim and Sydney stayed up until after the eleven o‚Äô clock news.

Just before they went to sleep, Jim and Sydney talked about what they wished for when they saw that first star.¬† Jim said he just wanted to be happy knowing he was about to marry someone who would accept his daughters.¬† Sydney said she wanted to be happy as well, but there was something else she wanted.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, I really do want to have a baby.‚Äù

Jim hesitated for a moment.¬† Then he said, ‚ÄúSydney, I guess I could go for one more child.¬† I think we can make that happen.‚Äù

¬†

üòä

¬†

A fun and exciting weekend came to an end, and now it was Monday morning.¬† Jim and Sydney both went back to work.¬† At her office, Sydney showed her ring to Rachel.¬† Later in the day, Sydney drove to Faulkner Motors and showed the ring to Walter, Renee, Jerry and Paulina.¬†

Meanwhile at Queen City Chevrolet, Jim told everyone about his weekend.¬† Mark and Simon were happy for Jim.¬† They had to be.¬† After all, Sydney was their sister.¬† Jonathan Marlowe and Joseph Daniels were also happy for Jim and Sydney as well.¬† Everybody was so happy that they decided to go ahead and start playing Christmas music on the speakers.¬† The first song played was Diana Ross doing her version of ‚ÄúMy Favorite Things.‚Äù¬†

Jim expected April Lynn to ask him to join her for lunch.¬† That didn‚Äôt happen.¬† But before long, all that excitement would fade away.¬† Julie showed up at the dealership.¬† She asked Jim, Mark and Simon to come to an emergency meeting at her house later that evening.¬† From how Julie talked, it didn‚Äôt sound like good news.",2,1730750100.0,writers,1,1.0,False

To give some background, I am a 28 year old female. I've been doing OTF since early 2021 and have attended 3-5 times a week consistently. I focused on protein, counting cals, etc. and still could not lose any weight. So I recently started semaglutide. It has been effective and I've finally been able to lose weight at a healthy rate. Well, after they upped my dose to .5 I had a terrifying experience after OTF. I was shaking uncontrollably, lightheaded, blurred vision, thought i was going to have to go to the hospital. My nurse friends said it was low blood sugar (never have dealt with this) so I drank some pineapple juice and ate crackers and eventually felt better. I was so scarred after that I took a break for a week. I went back today and had the exact same reaction AGAIN. Has anyone else had this happen? I know it has to be the semaglutide. 

Other factors: I made sure to eat a little bit of breakfast but it usually makes me feel bad before working out. I drink Celsisus in replacement of coffee.

the worst part?

Naruto is actually really good at being a ninja, specially in infiltration since he can pull epic pranks witouth getting caught by all the security systems around teh village. sure, he avoids doing anything really harmful or that can distraught the functioning of the village

and he has a ongoing beef with Tobirama (this is an AU where nobody died) where he breaks in the old Senjus labs to substittue the albino's coffee to decaf and also to move every piece of furniture exactly three quarters of a n inch to the left, while Tobirama wrecks his brain to up his security system.

(Tobiramam would never admit it, but he actually loves this ongoing beef, it keeps his skills sharp).

Hasharama being Hashirama loves the pranks, the only reason he has a pc is to watch Naruto's new uploads.

all the while Minato and Kushina are pulling their hairs out because Narutois a master infiltrator not seen in centuries, but he rather waste his time making stupid vidoes than actually put his talent to good use for the village all becuase, in his words 'it's funnier and it makes more money', which only adds to their frustration, because Naruto makes twice the ammount of a regular S-rank with just one video.",1,1730749847.0,NarutoFanfiction,0,1.0,False

###Afterthoughts

A few days ago I got my Thanksgiving offers. At first it just showed a pack of rolls and veggies, which it said I had to complete my big bonus by the 23rd to unlock. But a day or two after that, it let me pick out my thanksgiving offers. I was pretty excited about that, because I don't like a lot of the offers normally like the turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy, etc. I could've gotten a bigger ham, but I don't like ham *that* much, so I just went with the one with the lowest total price I could find. I do still have a rebate for some free rolls, but our store was sold out.

I'm kind of happy our store was sold out of rolls tbh. (And the Tyson popcorn chicken.) It made me have to go grab some more offers, which turned out to be the Cocoa Classics, and they had the two flavors I've been wanting to try! I'm sipping on the French Vanilla right now, and it's pretty decent. It tastes almost like French Vanilla coffee but without the actual flavor of coffee. Not much of a cocoa flavor to it, which I expected since I've been drinking their Caramel ones.

&nbsp;

It's a slight profit loss hitting the bonus, but I'm okay with that since I needed to make progress towards my bigger bonus. My Weekend Warrior bonus was crap ($1 / 10), and I expect the bonuses to get worse and worse throughout this month as they usually do.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

###Time Spent

I generally plan my hauls over the course of an hour or two while I eat breakfast/lunch and play with my pets.

I usually spend around 45-70 minutes in the store, which includes my regular grocery shopping. I could easily cut that down to 30-45 but I like to take my time.

###Food From Deals

The other week I made some taco meat. Deal items included taco seasoning and ham (I substituted half for the beef, couldn't taste the difference). I served it with pasta instead of the tortilla shells. Not as tasty, but I have way too much pasta that needs to get eaten. Although, there are some decent stacking deals on hard shells between Ibotta + Fetch right now.

I also made a lasagna. Cottage cheese, ham (subbed half the meat), noodles, pasta sauce, and most the seasonings were deal items. Beef wasn't, and the ""cheese"" wasn't. I used bettergoods plant-based ""cheese"". It's pretty decent. I wouldn't use it on a pizza, but in lasagna? I can barely taste the difference, and my stomach is much happier. 

&nbsp;

Here's some things I've made in the past: [High Protein Tomato Crackers](https://imgur.com/a/A9hdce7), [Hot Sausage Cups](https://imgur.com/a/pIHSYJg), [Peanut Butter Fudge & Chocolate Hazelnut Fudge](https://imgur.com/a/GT2gd2S), [Chocolate Cherry Pie](https://imgur.com/a/9S5p6U6)

1gjnbrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1gjnbrf/review_chat_gpts_6month_travel_itinerary_for/,Review chat GPTs 6-month travel itinerary for South America ,"People who‚Äôve been - let me know if this looks like a decent rough idea for a travel plan! What would you add/get rid of etc. 

Here goes: 

Here‚Äôs a revised itinerary beginning in January, with travel timing adjusted to make the most of the seasons, weather, and regional events. This plan also considers practical travel routes for a seamless journey through South America.

January: Argentina (Patagonia & Antarctic Cruise)

	1.	Buenos Aires: Start in Buenos Aires, where you can experience summer weather and vibrant city life. Spend a few days exploring cultural sites, local cuisine, and neighborhoods like Palermo and La Boca.
	2.	Patagonia:
	‚Ä¢	El Calafate: Fly or take a long-distance bus to El Calafate. January is perfect for visiting Los Glaciares National Park and Perito Moreno Glacier.
	‚Ä¢	El Chalt√©n: Continue to El Chalt√©n, ideal for hiking in summer weather with longer daylight hours. Hike to Laguna de los Tres for views of Mount Fitz Roy.
	3.	Ushuaia: Travel to Ushuaia for the Antarctic cruise. January is high season for Antarctica, with good wildlife sightings and stable conditions.

Tip: Summer is peak season, so book accommodations and your Antarctic cruise well in advance.

February: Chile (Atacama Desert)

	1.	Santiago: Fly or take a bus from Ushuaia or Buenos Aires to Santiago. February is summer, perfect for exploring Santiago‚Äôs markets and parks, with day trips to Valpara√≠so and Vi√±a del Mar for beach time.
	2.	Atacama Desert (San Pedro de Atacama): Fly or bus to Calama, then transfer to San Pedro. February is warm and dry, ideal for exploring Valle de la Luna, stargazing, and seeing Tatio Geysers. Consider a multi-day tour to explore more remote parts of the Atacama.

March: Bolivia (Salt Flats and High Altitude Wonders)

	1.	Uyuni Salt Flats: Cross from San Pedro de Atacama to Uyuni on a 3-day tour, which often includes colorful lagoons and high-altitude landscapes. March is great for salt flat reflections if there‚Äôs residual rain.
	2.	Sucre: Travel by bus or flight to Sucre, where the climate is mild. Enjoy this colonial city with visits to historical sites and markets.
	3.	La Paz: Take a bus from Sucre to La Paz. Wander the Witches‚Äô Market, and consider a day trip to Valle de la Luna or biking the famous ‚ÄúDeath Road‚Äù for a thrilling adventure.

April: Peru (Lake Titicaca, Cusco, and Machu Picchu)

	1.	Lake Titicaca (Puno): Take a bus from La Paz to Puno on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca. April is the end of the rainy season, so expect lush scenery and fewer crowds on the lake and its islands.
	2.	Cusco and Sacred Valley: Head to Cusco by bus or train. April is shoulder season, ideal for fewer crowds but still relatively good weather. Explore Cusco, Sacred Valley, and nearby villages, and acclimatize for higher altitudes.
	3.	Machu Picchu: Hike the Inca Trail (pre-booked) or the Salkantay Trek for a more budget-friendly option. The weather in April is ideal for trekking, with greener landscapes and clear skies.

May: Ecuador (Quito, Amazon, and Gal√°pagos Islands)

	1.	Quito: Fly from Cusco or Lima to Quito. Spend time exploring the city‚Äôs colonial center, nearby Otavalo Market, and local cuisine.
	2.	Amazon Rainforest (Cuyabeno Reserve): May is a good month for rainforest tours in Ecuador‚Äôs Cuyabeno Reserve. Enjoy a multi-day jungle lodge tour to spot wildlife and immerse in indigenous culture.
	3.	Gal√°pagos Islands: May is also one of the best months to visit the Gal√°pagos, with mild weather, abundant wildlife, and fewer tourists. Opt for a budget-friendly island-hopping tour to Santa Cruz and Isabela Islands, enjoying pristine beaches and unique wildlife.

Tip: Book Gal√°pagos flights and tours in advance, as they tend to fill up quickly, even during shoulder seasons.

June: Colombia (Explore Culture, History, and Caribbean Beaches)

	1.	Bogot√°: Fly from Quito to Bogot√°. Take a few days to explore the city‚Äôs museums, such as the Gold Museum, try Colombian coffee, and visit Monserrate for panoramic views.
	2.	Medell√≠n: Travel by bus or fly to Medell√≠n, where the weather is mild year-round. Explore Comuna 13, coffee farms, and nearby Guatap√© for culture and beautiful landscapes.
	3.	Cartagena and Caribbean Coast: Fly or bus to Cartagena. June is an ideal time to explore the city‚Äôs historic walled center and nearby beaches, with warm Caribbean weather.

July: Brazil and Argentina Border (Iguazu Falls and Return)

	1.	Iguazu Falls: End your journey at Iguazu Falls, an ideal destination for July‚Äôs drier season. Experience both the Brazilian and Argentinian sides for different perspectives of this natural wonder.
	2.	Rio de Janeiro or S√£o Paulo: From Iguazu, consider a final stop in either Rio or S√£o Paulo to soak in Brazil‚Äôs culture, vibrant food, and nightlife before departing.

Additional Tips

	‚Ä¢	Weather & Seasons: January is summer in Patagonia and Antarctica, perfect for warmer weather in those regions. The itinerary progresses northward as winter approaches, reaching the warmer countries as weather becomes ideal.
	‚Ä¢	Peak & Shoulder Seasons: This plan avoids peak season in popular spots like Machu Picchu (April instead of June-July), while still timing high-demand locations like Antarctica and Gal√°pagos in optimal months.",0,1730749630.0,backpacking,3,0.17,False

I‚Äôm going through my travel photos from Vietnam in 2009 and trying to geotag them all. My wife and I spent a few nights in Dalat. Back then, there were hardly any backpackers around, which was brilliant! We did an 18km trail tour with just five of us. From my photos and travel journal, we visited three dodgy suspension footbridges, Tiger Cave Waterfall, and a local group living in the forest harvesting coffee beans.

I can‚Äôt remember the exact name of the tour, but after a quick browse on the internet, it seems like it was called the Heaven Gate Trek Tour or something similar. Does anyone know the walking route on a map so I can try to geotag my photos along that route as best as I can?

1gjn9s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulum/comments/1gjn9s7/detailed_trip_itinerary_review/,Detailed Trip Itinerary & Review,"My husband and I recently returned from a weeklong trip to the Yucatan peninsula, spending a few nights in Tulum. This sub was very useful in gathering information (as well as unwarranted anxiety...) so I figured I'd share my experience here in case it is helpful to anyone. We did 3 nights in Tulum, 1 night in Valladolid, and 3 nights in Isla Mujeres. I won't share details about the latter 2 since this is the Tulum sub, but we absolutely *loved* both places and I'm happy to elaborate if anyone has questions. I will note that we really didn't have much interest in spending any time in the Tulum beach/hotel zone, based on what I've heard regarding the prices, greenwashing, corruption and overtly tourist-centered nature. We saved our ocean/beach chilling time for Isla Mujeres.

**Day 1:** We flew into the Cancun airport and picked up our rental car from **Yes Rent a Car**. They were great to work with - very simple and transparent. They picked us up from the airport and shuttled us to the office down the road. What we were quoted ($196USD for 4 days with full insurance and on-board wifi) is exactly what we paid. We got a no-frills VW sedan with squeaky breaks, but it was clean and ran well. They required a $500 deposit which was returned to me upon returning the car. Could I have found a cheaper rental with less insurance? Probably, but they had great reviews and having never driven in Mexico before, we didn't want to risk not having full coverage. The drive down 307 was fine. Drivers are a bit chaotic and everyone passes each other, but we stayed to the right, stuck to the speed limit, and let people pass us. We stopped for tacos and beers at **El Rincon de la Tia**, a little roadside place right outside of Centro. Very good and cheap. Stopped at Super Aki for snacks and water then checked into our hotel at **Sonido Del Mar Hotel and Yoga Loft** in La Veleta. This hotel is so wonderful. The neighborgood is cute and walkable, and I think we paid like $45/night for a simple but nice studio-style room, and it included a daily light breakfast with coffee and fresh juice. Super friendly and attentive staff. The atmosphere was very peaceful, with a pretty outdoor area and pool and a rooftop yoga shala with daily classes available. A couple of very cute and sweet cats also live on the property. Seems like an underrated gem, as one night we were the only people staying there. That night we went to **Palma Central** for salsa night, and omg it was such a vibe. We wished that we'd participated in the salsa lesson/dancing, but we were so tired from traveling. It was still really fun to drink mezcalitas and people watch/listen to the band play. Didn't try any of the food stalls since we were still full from lunch, but the options looked good. This is a must if you're in town on a Tuesday.

**Day 2:** Took a yoga class at the hotel ($150MXN) that was mostly attended by folks who live in the neighborhood, which was cool. Then went to **Laguna Kaan Luum** ($300MXN tourist entry) for a few hours. We really liked it here, it was super chill will mostly local families hanging out. It's technically a cenote but feels more like a lake, since the perimeter is shallow. Very nice water, swings and structures to take photos on, drinks and coconuts available for purchase. After we went to **Holistika** for lunch at their vegan restaurant and to do the art walk (free!) which was very cool. The grounds here are beautiful and very zen, would love to go back and try a yoga class. For dinner that night we went to **La Negra Tomasa** for amazing seafood tostadas and tacos, **Batey** for drinks, then **Mistico Garden** for more drinks and hookah. Can't recall what we paid at each place, but it was all quite reasonable.

**Day 3:** We originally planned on going to Xplor, but decided we wanted to go somehwere less corporate after seeing the chokehold that Xcaret has on the entire state lol. Found and booked **Selva Maya Eco Adventures** the night before, and it ended up being the highlight of our time in Tulum. A 4-hour timeslot cost $80USD and included a buggy ride 20 mins into the jungle (or could ride an ATV for extra cost), 9 ziplines, a rock climb/rappel wall, swiming in two cenotes (one partially covered, one cave) and lunch/beers. A photographer came along and took photos the whole time, with optional purchase at the end. The staff were all so kind and funny, and informative about the surrounding jungle and Mayan history. Highly recommended if you're looking for a bit of jungle adventure but want to support a local business. After that we decided to check out the beach. Didn't have the energy to visit the ruins, so we opted to just find beach access and swim for a bit. I think that this was the one part of the trip that we felt stressed. Not that anything bad happened, but it just wasn't clear where we were supposed to go and constantly felt like we were doing something wrong. First tried to go through the entrance to the ruins and immediately had non-official parking attendants trying to con us into parking there with what turned out to be false info. We ended up entering through the national park instead ($90MXN) and drove until we found a parking lot that we were allowed into (**Playa Pescadores**, $300MXN). Saw a small bit of the ruins from there, and the views really are stunning. There was zero seaweed, the water was perfect. Would like to have spent more time there especially after spending money on parking, but had enough sun by then. That night we stayed in La Veleta, having dinner at **Veleta Market,** which had a really cool and lively vibe. I ordered from the Thai kitchen while my husband ordered from the Burrito kitchen and both meals were soo good. Can't recall prices but they were reasonable. We finished the night with drinks at **Ukami** which also had a really fun atmosphere. Didn't eat anything, but the sushi looked great.

**Day 4:** Checked out of the hotel and headed to the **Coba** ruins on the way to Valladolid. Definitely worth a visit. It would have been much more impactful if we'd hired one of the guides, but was more of a quick visit for us. There's a good amount of shade, and we rented bikes which was like $3USD and a comfortable and fun way to see all of the buildings. The nearby village (Francisco Uh May) had a ton of artisan and food vendors, and I wish we had stopped to shop but my husband was antsy to get to Valladolid (which was awesome, highly recommend an overnight stay.)

**Day 5:**  Drove back to Cancun and returned our rental car. Turns out that the office was far enough away from the airport that we were very easily able to get an Uber to the Isla Mujeres ferry (25 minute drive for only $20USD) which was a very pleasant surprise.

**Things we wanted to do but didn't have time for:**

* More food! There are a million restaurants and street vendors we'd like to have tried, but between having complimentary breakfast every day and not having very big appetites, we only ate at a few places.
* More cenotes! The ones we did visit were amazing, but I wanted to see more. We drove by a few of the famous ones en route to Coba, but my husband is an anxious traveler and wasn't keen on making too many stops for the sake of time.
* Visit one of the Mayan villages such as Xunaan Kab
* Azulik Uh May museum - seems like it could have been a sort of ripoff, but does look very beautiful

**Overall Takeaways:** While I can certainly see some of the issues that many people have with Tulum, especially in comparison to other Mexican cities and towns, we had a really great time. I think this is definitely a place where the type of traveler you and type of experience you're looking to have can make a huge difference. My perception might be different if we had spent time in the hotel zone which seems to be where a lot of people's issues lie. We purposely avoided places that were very expensive and felt that we did not spend a lot of money. The most expensive meal we had the entire trip was at the Tampa airport on the way home lol. Every person we met in each of the towns we stayed was SO warm and kind. I did not once feel unsafe in the areas we went. Even walking around at night, I felt safer than I do walking around the downtown of the Northeastern city I work in during my lunch breaks. Everyone sort of just minds their own business? Sure, it was a bit jarring to see the National Guard patrolling around in trucks with guns, but that's just how it is. Driving/getting pulled over was absolutely our biggest concern based on stories, and I'm happy to report that we did not have any issues. Whenever we went through police checkpoints from Cancun to Tulum to Valladolid and back to Cancun, we just smiled and nodded and they waved us through.

First I want to make very clear that I have read a LOT about this and know what I'm doing. I'm also going to quit if I start to feel unhealthy or get some concerning symptoms and problems. 

  
So, I have always been a good weight. But Then I ended up in horrific abusing marriage with a man who SAd our 1year4month old son until he was 3 without my knowledge. During all this I developed a really really bad bulimia. I threw up everything. Then we separated (or more like escaped when he slept) and from 2022 I have not thrown up.

I have however become fat and I hate it. I want to be me again. 

I'm 169cm tall and about 118kg. So I'm most definitely overweight. Normal typical weight for me is 65kg so I have a lot of weight that I have to lose. 

I decided to try a 30 day fast. I will drink water, a sugar free energy drink in the morning to substitute my coffee with milk and take some strong good vitamins. That's basically it. My body is not going to starve because I have so much fat stored up for energy. 

I will update my progress here like a diary. Let's see how it goes! ",0,1730749487.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.5,False

How do I cope with this?,"Sorry if this gets too long, its my 2nd reddit post. There is a TLDR at the bottom of this

I (25F) struggle with a very long friendship slowly fading away. This friend (27F), lets call her Y, and I have known each other roughly since 2014 and been friends roughly since late 2014/early 2015. To paint you a picture, we're from the same small city. During my competitive sports phase back then we trained together 5 or 6 times a week because my club didn't have any girls my age. Later we even moved in together for uni & I basically chose my uni accordingly. We have lived together (with two different friends) since 2018 until she moved out this January after finishing her degree. During our time together we have supported each other a lot during messy break ups & hurtful dating experiences she had and really messy family drama that I had going on. I would have called her one of my 2 best friends & imagined her being my maid of honour if I got married.

Here's the thing. I started to notice us growing apart during her time working on her master's thesis last summer and into the second half of '23. It started slow with me noticing two things. One, she would be very busy with her job, her thesis & other stuff & often declined when I asked if we could cook dinner together (which we had done regularly for years since moving in) or do other small things together to accommodate her sparse time. Yet she would make time for a weekly meet up and cooking night with some other friends. Ngl that stung. Two, there was some tension when I came back from meetings with her ex boyfriend (25M, call him X). Now before you go off judging me on that, hear me out! I've known him for the same amount of time and we were in a local youth organisation together. During their relationship, he and I would do Marvel movie nights because her and my boyfriend (25M, 6 years and going strong) don't like the franchise as much. They both knew & were okay with it because they know for sure we would never everrrrr be more than platonic. We also hung out together & did double dates etc. X and Y broke up earlier last year because they grew apart, nobody cheated or anything nasty like that. It was very cordial & drama free.

Because of that & the talks I had with Y, I knew it was okay if I kept meeting him. I asked her. We had movie nights at his place & met up for coffee in nearby cafes. Then it got a little messy. X and Y had some instances where they drunk hooked up again & both sent emotional messages. But in the end they stayed separated. Now during this time I tried to stay out of their way while simultaneously trying to comfort my best friend as best as I could. I was closer friends with her after all. But she explicitly stated it was okay if I kept meeting him despite all this & so I did. I was closer with her, but he was/is my friend too. The only thing I didn't do is update her as detailed as before about his life when I came back home & she asked me how he was. Because (attention), I knew he didn't want me to. He didn't want as much contact with her or contact at all for that fact after their messy make outs. He wished her all the best but simply didn't want her in his life. He showed me texts between them where he tells her to please stop contacting him, which she sadly ignored a couple of times before relenting.

Now why is that relevant? Because when it came to the point that I asked her to have a chat about our friendship & how we could stay in touch with her moving abroad after graduation, she brought this up. Mind you, it had been 6 months of me not updating her much at this point. I was stunned, because I didn't expect this to come up at all. The problem is, we didn't talk about much else afterwards, topic wise. We didn't talk about us spending less time together, even though I started the conversation with it, and we didn't talk about how we could handle our friendship moving forward. I don't remember why we ended the conversation before we could cover those topics, but the fact remains that we did. And afterwards our daily lives continued basically unchanged, with no time to sit down again and properly talk about it.

And then she went abroad, first about 6 timezones away, now in our timezone again, but she rarely ever touches her phone now. Reposts the occasional story of her workplace but nothing much else. Granted she doesn't seem to make exceptions for anyone and wants to be present at what she does as much as possible. Which, fair honestly. However, this doesn't change the fact, that this makes it hard/impossible to properly have a talk and maybe give us closure. It took me and my current roommate (which was here when she lived here & she is also freinds with) 3 weeks to get her to reply to our request for a call. And I don't think in this situation she would make time for a solo call with me. This situation leaves me here, grieving our friendship and lost with how to proceed. I have talked to a few friends about this and also to my boyfriend, but I'm very hesitant because I don't wanna make her look bad to our friends or sth like that. And thats basically where my problems come from. I don't really know how to handle this friendship fading away or how to grieve it. Because honestly, nobody teaches you that, its all about romantic break ups annoyingly. So does any of you have advice for me on how to move forward?

TLDR: A friendship is fading out & I can't get closure because the other person moved abroad & is now rarely ever on her phone for anything. So I can't really contact her to talk it out. I need advice on how to handle the situation & find closure",1,1730749404.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I've researched much on this topic & when you manifest, you must ""feel"" with your body....so far anything I have TRIED to FEEL has not manifested, because I am not really feeling whatever I am manifesting could possibly happen.

But now...hmmm.....

My gym randomly closed.  I have been going there for a year...I met a couple of people and I am not THERE to MEET people...that is KEY to understand.  I am there to work on my goals of keeping my legs strong because I feel better overall & younger when I am ""strong""....but I have met a couple of people.

Never ""interested"" in any of them...one was particulary interested in me but he was married & I wouldn't let it escalate out of the gym.  He did ask me out for coffee & I have met his wife a couple of times, but I said I would go if his WIFE was coming....so obviously we NEVER went & he just laughed.  I will miss him, he ended up joining a different gym.

Anyway, I was very upset when the gym closed it was part of a routine.  I am horrible at routine & for some reason because it was so close to my house, I was so proud of my routine & I hate change as most of us humans do - BUT the exercise is valuable to my Health so I have to suck it up and try this new gym.

Somethiing came over me ""like a breath of fresh air"" when I looked the gym up on line...and my immediate thought was....MAYBE I am SUPPOSED to go on THIS PATH NOW....and immediately after that thought a thought popped in that said specifically - ""This is possibly where you may actually meet someone that will be important to your life"".  I wasn't searching for that thought, it came up.

So my first day at the GYM was Saturday & I felt ""electricity"" go thru me when I walked in....there are LOTS of people in this gym, my old gym was very sparse & mostly people MY AGE.  I always date OLDER so I thought maybe someday at my old gym an old dude would come along and we would hit it off - naturally, I am NOT LOOKING. 

But I could not HELP but be looking around Saturday, there were ALL kinds of ages & shapes and sizes & the equipment is much better & I could feel my YOUTH coming back into my body by just looking around. 

I've grieved for 2 years over a 10 yr relationship with the person who I thought was my soulmate & to even get to the gym was depressing & demoralizing.  I feel re-energized & I know that it shows...and I feel different when I am there.

Wish me luck for a healthy & happy rest of my life because I think I have at least found a place where I FIT in.

I drink a lot of water daily, and I‚Äôve always struggled with reusable bottles that eventually end up smelling weird or getting grimy inside. The idea of a **self-cleaning, UV-C purifying water bottle** sounded like a dream come true for someone like me who‚Äôs always on the go and doesn‚Äôt want to constantly worry about bacteria in my water. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at how it‚Äôs been working out for me.

# Why I Decided to Try UVBrite

A few months back, I started looking for a new water bottle. I wanted something easy to carry, ideally insulated, and with a bit of tech to keep it clean. I read about the **UVBrite water bottle** and its **UV-C light technology**, which kills up to 99.99% of germs, bacteria, and viruses in the water. Knowing that **UV-C technology** is used in hospitals and water treatment, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not give it a try?‚Äù

The idea of being able to drink purified water from almost any source appealed to me. I often fill up at random water fountains or taps when I‚Äôm out, and having the peace of mind that UVBrite would handle any lurking bacteria was a huge plus.

# How UVBrite Works ‚Äì The Tech Behind the Purification

The UVBrite bottle uses a **UV-C LED light** that emits UV rays into the water, effectively destroying bacteria, germs, and even some viruses. It works by breaking down the DNA of these microorganisms, which means they can‚Äôt reproduce or cause any harm. You simply fill the bottle, press a button, and the UV-C light activates for a cycle that lasts about 3 minutes. It also has an **automatic self-cleaning cycle** every 6 hours, which I appreciate because I don‚Äôt always remember to rinse my bottle daily.

One of the reasons I wanted a UV-based bottle was to avoid constantly washing it. I‚Äôve had other bottles that start to smell no matter how often I clean them. With **UVBrite**, I‚Äôve noticed a big difference ‚Äì even when I leave water sitting in the bottle overnight, it stays fresh.

[**Check out more details here.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Impressions: Design and Ease of Use

When the UVBrite bottle arrived, I was impressed by the design. It‚Äôs made from double-walled stainless steel, which gives it a sturdy feel. It‚Äôs a bit heavier than plastic bottles, but the extra weight is worth it since it keeps my drinks either hot or cold for hours. I‚Äôve tested it with coffee, and it stayed warm for at least 10 hours, which was great.

The button on top is simple ‚Äì one press for the standard purification mode (90 seconds) and a longer press for the **Blitz mode** (180 seconds) for water from natural sources like rivers or streams. It‚Äôs straightforward, no fuss, and I found the indicator light helpful to know when the cycle starts and ends.

# How Effective is the UV-C Purification?

So, here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt have a microscope to test for bacteria, but I‚Äôve been drinking water from various sources, including public fountains, with no issues. The water tastes and smells fresh every time, and I don‚Äôt get that metallic or stale taste that some other bottles have. It‚Äôs also a game-changer for travel. I used to carry a small filter or buy bottled water, but now I just take UVBrite and can refill almost anywhere.

The self-cleaning feature has been a huge benefit too. I used to worry about my bottle getting gross if I didn‚Äôt wash it every day, but the UVBrite‚Äôs self-cleaning cycle has kept it fresh. I give it a quick wash every few weeks, and that‚Äôs about it.

# Pros and Cons of the UVBrite Water Bottle

# Pros

* **Self-Cleaning Every 6 Hours**: This is probably my favorite feature because it means I don‚Äôt have to worry about bacteria building up inside.
* **UV-C Purification for Germ-Free Water**: The UV light technology is solid and works well, especially for someone like me who drinks a lot of water and fills up from different sources.
* **Insulated Design**: Keeps drinks hot or cold for up to 12 hours, which is perfect for when I want to keep my water chilled or enjoy warm tea throughout the day.
* **Rechargeable Battery**: It lasts around 60 cycles on a single charge, which has been enough to last me a couple of weeks without needing a recharge.

[**Find more about it here.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Cons

* **Price**: It‚Äôs on the higher end for a water bottle, but I think the UV-C tech and self-cleaning feature make it worth it if you‚Äôre serious about clean water.
* **Heavier Than Plastic**: The stainless steel makes it durable, but it‚Äôs a bit heavier than other bottles, which may not be ideal for everyone.
* **Only Works with Clear Water**: This bottle is not designed for murky or heavily contaminated water, so if you‚Äôre outdoors and the water isn‚Äôt clear, you‚Äôll need an extra filter.

# Real-Life Testing and Durability

After a month of using the **UVBrite Water Bottle** almost daily, I can say it‚Äôs held up well. I carry it in my backpack, drop it into my gym bag, and it‚Äôs even taken a few accidental falls without any issues. The bottle doesn‚Äôt have any noticeable wear, and the UV-C light still works as it did on day one.

The battery life has also been pretty solid. I charge it about once every couple of weeks, which is convenient. Plus, the USB charging feature means I can easily charge it anywhere if I need to.

# Who Would Benefit from UVBrite?

In my opinion, this bottle is great for anyone who‚Äôs active, loves to travel, or is just really particular about the cleanliness of their water. I think the **UV-C purification** gives you extra peace of mind, especially if you‚Äôre filling up from unknown sources. The **self-cleaning** aspect is also perfect for people who might be prone to forgetting to clean their bottle regularly (like me).

If you‚Äôre on the fence because of the price, it‚Äôs worth thinking about how much you‚Äôll save by not buying bottled water. Plus, the environmental benefit of cutting down on plastic waste makes it even more appealing.

# Final Thoughts

All in all, the UVBrite water bottle has been a great addition to my routine. The **UV-C purification** works as promised, and I love not having to worry about bacteria or funky smells in my water. It‚Äôs a bit pricier, but considering that it‚Äôs both a high-quality water bottle and a **water purifier**, I think it‚Äôs worth it.

This bottle is definitely geared toward people who prioritize clean water and want a low-maintenance way to keep their water bottle fresh. I‚Äôm happy I made the switch, and I can see myself using UVBrite for a long time.",1,1730748793.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

Hopefully I'm posting in the right place. But those are photos of what I passed through my bowels yesterday.... I am concerned and Appreciate any advice. Just want to say I will be going to the doctors, just figured I'd see if anyone has any insight. Thank you

After drinking some black coffee, I had to run to the bathroom, 2 different times. Felt like all the fluids in my body were about to come out of me. I obviously had diarrhea and there was a lot of mucus (a lot!)

As seen in those photos, I saw a round looking long piece of ""worm"" ? Or possibly pieces of my intestinal walls? It was in a circle as shown. As you can see in the next photos, the ""worm"" is extended into a long piece of gross looking string? It looks grayish and extended to several inches.   Looks to be jelly-like consistentency? 

There were several other little pieces of these but much much smaller in my stool. But I have never had to run to the bathroom like that so bad, and never had diarrhea that just felt like complete water (maybe once when I took miralax!) 

I had twisting abdominal pains/cramps, pretty bad when this was happening and they went away afterward.

As I'm drinking my coffee right now this morning, I can feel my stomach tensing up again and twisting, but no BM today yet

1gjmxj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gjmxj0/my_first_love/,My first love ,"The first night when you showed me the moon and told me how pretty it looks, I fell in love. 

When we had coffee together under the night sky and you asked that we sit away from the crowd, I fell in love.

When you took my hand and we ran and cut through the crowd, I fell in love. 

When I lost you in the crowd and we didn't have our phones and then I saw you waiting and looking at me while I was getting patted down at the security check line, I was so relieved and I fell in love. 

When you took pictures of me, idle, just being myself, I fell in love. 

Whenever you smiled, I fell in love.

When I saw you in the yellow flowery sundress at the airport when you came to pick me up, I fell in love. 

When you took me to feed the birds at the park early morning, I fell in love. 

When you stayed waiting for me at night while I was getting my flight details sorted when you could have left for home, I fell in love. 

When you said let's go to the roof at night, I fell in love. 

When you came to visit me at the park when I was alone and lonely, I fell in love. 

When you showed me the streets of your city, telling me the history and significance of places, I fell in love. 

When you gifted the book about love to me, I fell in love. 

When you didn't have the right words to explain and you said ""I'll email it to you,"" I fell in love. 

When you sent the first of many emails sharing your thoughts about love and life and the things you've written about them, I fell in love. 

When we were sitting next to each other in the auto going back to your place, I fell in love. 

When we went to the Taj Mahal, the greatest monument about love, and you showed me the glowing stones by flashing your phone's light on it, I fell in love.

When you said you wanted me to come to drop me at the airport, I fell in love

Whenever you text me the blue hearts and the pink flowers, I fall in love.

Whenever I was around you, I was everything and you were my everything. Your words, soul, beauty, intelligence and most importantly presence, I will long forever and ever. 

I couldn't even write/say that I love you even though you'd sign off your emails saying ""love you."" Such a shame. I, deserving, will think about what could have been my entire life. I took days to think and respond to your emails, thinking and writing about love and you responded in the next day or two with great insights. You'd have all the answers.

Anytime I look at the moon now, I remember your face. It's what you get for talking about the moon with that beauty of yours. Whenever I'm drunk and smoking a cigarette which I shouldn't be smoking, I remember you. I remember us. 

It's my cowardice that I cannot be with you, grow old with you, and see the different versions of you. As a coward, I'll say it here anonymously that I love you. I am sure you knew that I loved you as well. But the more radical thing would have been to not act on it given our circumstances. So stupid to radicalize it. Such a disgrace to the emotion of love. I didn't fight for you. I didn't fight myself. I didn't know how deeply you affected me until it was too late. If the circumstances were different, we were meant to end up together. It would have been a fairytale for generations to idealize.

Your love taught me everything and I'm eternally greatful. 

When I read Dostoevsky's White Nights, the line ""My God, a moment of bliss. Why, isn't that enough for a whole lifetime?"" reminded me of you. 

No matter what happens in the future, the moments with you are enough to make me feel loved my entire lifetime. I could write books about what I experienced with you. I was loved by a poet. I consider myself lucky to have crossed paths with you. I heard someone say that some relationships dont have a name and I agree. We can't put labels on our relationship - it was something life changing. Your love - I have never experienced anything more truthful than that. Your love and wisdom will always radiate from within me. I'll share the love you gave me and try to make everyone around me feel as loved as you made me feel. To show them what's possible. Love's the strongest drug to ever exist; thanks to you I experienced it. Thanks to you I felt alive.

1gjmvqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gjmvqb/am_i_overreacting_wife_claims_it_wasnt_an_affair/,Am I Overreacting? Wife claims it wasn't an affair ,"Wife and I married for 13 years.  Last year, after her mom passed, she went off the deep end a little.  Took up some self destructive habits in order to numb the grief.  We have two children together, and I saw her slowly navigating a path to actual self harm, so I tried my best to help realize that she was on a dangerous path and that, while I am 100% by her side through her grief, our family needs her.

She took this as me trying to ruin her fun.

A male friend (single) from our social circle started getting closer to her.  I found out he was texting her constantly on Snapchat.  When she would leave me at home with the kids to hang out with friends (he is a part of that group), she would often complain about me, and on a couple of occasions she hung out with him alone after everyone else had gone home.

He was regularly taking buying her coffee and bringing it to her place of employment.

There was an evening where three of them were supposed to go to dinner, but the third backed out and she still had dinner alone with him.

She was spending money buying him gifts (like merch from a concert that he wasn't able to attend).  She claimed he was supposed to pay her back.

Last fall, I confronted her about it and said that this looks very much like an emotional affair, if not a physical one.  She claimed that he is ""like a little brother"" and said ""ew"".

Part of me believes her.  Part of me thinks she was on legit self denial.  But moving on... 

I asked her to break contact with him.  She agreed to lesser contact, saying that I'm really misreading the situation but that she didn't want me to end our marriage over it.  I also confronted him.  He said the same and agreed to some boundaries.

Lesser contact lasted a couple months, then he became a problem again.  Basically lots of attention from him again, crossing boundaries, and the two of them became the topic of gossip.  At this point, my wife agreed that maybe it really did look bad, and agreed to redouble her insistence on boundaries.

This lasted a couple months, and the boundaries started being crossed again.  

[Edit: I also need to point out that along this time, I confronted him a second time and ""asked"" him to stay away from my wife and children (my daughter is 12, very well endowed due to early puberty, and he has a habit of hugging her from the front with both arms).  He agreed, but within a month the contact had resumed.]

At this point, I asked her to completely break contact.  She refused, saying she didn't want to seem rude or make things uncomfortable.  She still insists that his intentions are innocent, as are hers, and that there's nothing romantic or sexual going on.  When I bring up my discomfort, she acknowledges it by saying ""I understand that this is a sore spot for you""

The guy has recently been outed as having caused problems in several marriages and multiple women have expressed that they feel harassed by him.  He was also caught entertaining the romantic attention of a teenage girl (he is 33 and was in a mentorship role over her)

Even still, my wife maintains that he is simply very outgoing and misunderstood.

A am considering giving her an ultimatum: break all contact with him or face divorce, with no room for ""accidents"".  If I catch her even saying hello to him in passing, it's over.

This isn't about her having a male friend.  It's about her having gone outside of our marriage to another man to complain about me, and then openly refusing to break contact with that man after i expressed my concerns, dismissing and downplaying my concerns.

1gjmvb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhs/comments/1gjmvb9/blaming_system_issues_on_the_staff/,Blaming system issues on the staff,"So I had an appointment with my GP today about a mole I've developed. I've seen him for years. He seemed a bit different today so I asked him if everything was okay. 

He had been in the surgery since 7am had just had a coffee all day (it was 2pm) because it was a busy day. 

I know everyone's experience with their GP is different, and of course the media narrative is to hate GP's, b it I've been registered at 5 different practices in the past 10 years due to moving for work. 

And yes, I've really struggled to get an appointment sometimes. It is deeply frustrating and of course I want to lash out. 

But then when I see my doctor finally, I realise they are in the same boat. Everywhere I've been registered, the doctors only get 10 minutes per patient because they are cramming in as many patients per day to try and meet the demand. Of course it's still not enough, and people get mad and take it out on the GP or the receptionists. 

You have bad or lazy people working in every profession. But in my experience with NHS Gp's or hospitals, I've always seen the vast majority of staff working flat out for their patients in a system that's under pressure. The system just doesn't have enough capacity. 

The staff are victims in that system too. Yet, people somehow find it acceptable to blame doctors and nurses for the fact that there isn't enough capacity. They cannot control the system, they can only do their best. They cannot magic up more staff or make waiting lists vanish. My daughter is a nurse and faces this all the time, and she constantly finds herself apologising for system issues that aren't her fault. But I know she's a damn good nurse who goes above and beyond for her patients. Same with my GP, he leaves work 2 hours late every day, missing vast amounts of time with his 3 young children.  

Imagine you're doing everything and more for your patients, only to be told you're not doing enough. It must suck. I know people have mixed views on the new government but I'm glad that they're investing in the NHS as it was always a pride of Britain. 

But it makes me wonder, why do we blame those who don't have any control? It's like blaming a bus driver that there aren't enough seats. ",4,1730748494.0,nhs,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre exploring new ideas for Duolingo and would love your feedback on a potential AR feature we‚Äôre considering.

Imagine learning a new language in your own space. With this AR feature, you‚Äôd interact with virtual characters around you‚Äîat a caf√©, in a library, or even in your own living room‚Äîusing just your phone. This gamified experience will allow you to practice conversational skills in natural, real-life contexts without needing any extra equipment. You‚Äôd earn points for each interaction and receive feedback on your performance based on the conversations you have with the NPCs (non-player characters).

Whether you‚Äôre ordering a coffee, asking for directions, or chatting with a virtual local, you‚Äôll be immersed in a fun, interactive game-like environment that helps reinforce your learning. This approach not only makes practice enjoyable but also builds confidence and fluency in everyday conversations.

What do you think of this concept? Is this something you‚Äôd find useful or enjoyable? Do you think practicing conversations in everyday settings would help with fluency?

We‚Äôre trying to gauge interest and get any feedback that could help us refine the concept. Any thoughts or suggestions are really appreciated!

[$1000] ,"So, I have been using a DeLonghi EC 155 that I purchased used for $20 about 3 years ago. I'm not even persuaded that it's working the way it's supposed to, but I have no comparison point. I'm looking to upgrade and I have the following desires:

1. I live in a bachelor apartment with very limited counter space, so for me, something smaller would be desirable.
2. However, I anticipate that I could move into a bigger space within the next 1-2 years. By that time, I'd be open to considering a bigger machine (perhaps an automatic machine?) so a part of my indecisive self wants to have something that holds resale value a bit or is often available for sale second-hand. Obviously if I love it I wouldn't upgrade it, but it sits in the back of my mind how much people rave about their Jura E8s. For now, I'm more looking at semi-automatic machines.
3. Budget - < $CAD 1000 but obviously I'd prefer something cheaper if the gains are marginal!
4. Location/other preferences: I'm in Canada. My favorite drinks are lattes, and that's essentially the only thing I drink. Some people might judge me about my predilection for the sugary syrups... In terms of experience, I'm fairly new - I only started delving into this world after getting my EC 155. I'm not even confident that the shots I'm pulling are that good! I already have a Zwilling Enfinigy burr grinder, so I suppose it doesn't need to come with a grinder though if there's something awesome I wouldn't necessarily rule out a machine for having something extra.

1gjmf0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1gjmf0f/identity_crisis_i_think_im_a_lesbian_i_dont_know/,identity crisis i think im a lesbian i dont know i need desperate advice,"hi! this is probably going to be quite long so apologies in advance but any advice is much appreciated. i am almost 20 yrs old and im in the middle of a sort of identity crisis.

i have a core memory of when i was 10 or 11 yrs old playing with my friends outside. i was standing by one of them and i say, ‚Äúif i could‚Äôve chosen my gender from birth, i‚Äôd choose no gender at all‚Äù. this plays into a whole lot later, but fast forward to the middle of 6th grade. i go to an arts school, have a queer friend group, and in a very stereotypical way i realized i was a lesbian. 

outside of the house i was very loud and proud about it, especially due to the support of my friends. but back at home, i was struggling a lot with the idea of coming out. this was 2016, where there was an influx of lgbt content on youtube, especially around ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù. i felt almost obligated to tell everyone, and after a not-so-great reaction from my sister (who i am very close with now she was just like 10 and ill-informed), i just felt super ashamed. one day my mom takes my phone for whatever reason and after finding a lesbian one-shot from my wattpad account i come out to her. there was a good awkward period, but after that she asked me if i wanted to go to a local pride parade and all was well.

then tragedy struck (puberty)

puberty was the lowest point in my life because i had to become a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, when all i really wanted was to have control and be me. fast forward to 9th grade and i came out as nonbinary. when i started telling my friends, one of them said ‚Äúthen i guess you‚Äôre not a lesbian anymore.‚Äù she was straight so she didn‚Äôt really have a say in this, but since at that time i didn‚Äôt know that nonbinary lesbians were a thing, i just assumed that she was right and i couldnt be a lesbian anymore.

i started trying to find a name that suited me, went between labels like nonbinary, demiboy, trans man, and eventually a gay transmasc for around 2 or 3 years. i started testosterone shortly after turning 18, and that was it.

except it wasn‚Äôt; i knew i wasnt a woman, and i told myself that i liked only men even though i didnt, but i suppressed everything because i was tired of confronting something new and having to come out over and over again. it came to the point where i wasnt able to relate to gay media the way i did before. the months were going by and i was stuck in the house, didnt have any friends where i had recently moved to, struggled getting a job, and overall too depressed to do any self reflection.

a little while after turning 19 i finally got a job at a local coffee shop, which was my inevitable entrance towards an environment with other queer people (and where i‚Äôd finally started to interact with people in general). as time went by i‚Äôd get closer with my coworkers, and i‚Äôd slowly start to drop my mask, and it became harder to put off coming to terms with my identity. i cared less and less about my gender, and i realized that gender to me was how i defined it. ive identified as genderqueer ever since, but my attraction to women and non-men was creeping up on me more and more. 

i remember around 2-3 months after starting my job i was on a closing shift with a coworker of mine (who i will call C). from the start i wanted to be friends with her; on the first day i met her she asked if i needed a ride home even though i barely talked to her that day. we share a lot of the same interests and i recently went to a drag show with her. but back to the closing shift‚Äî at work we‚Äôre able to put on almost any music we want as long as it‚Äôs appropriate, so when i went to turn off the music for the night she goes ‚Äúdont worry they‚Äôll definitely know it was me‚Äù. the music in question was a 90s lesbian rock playlist which i am still digging through spotify trying to find. but something hit me that day. 

trying to decipher the feeling further at work i realized how less attracted to men i am then i thought i was. i dont like holding long conversations with them, i didnt really like being complimented by them, and i even though they‚Äôre visibly attractive, inside i dont feel much. the feeling is all too familiar to my younger lesbian self. so i started looking into more lesbian media, and the relatability is THERE. i remember seeing a thread by a butch artist in where they talked about the feeling of coming full circle with their identity just like i did, and it lingers in my mind. at that drag show i went to with C, the host asked for the lesbians in the crowd to shout. C did, yet i looked down in silence. for the rest of the night i felt this emptiness within myself, and it felt like the peak of all my confusion and doubt i had been dealing with for so long. 

despite all this, part of me still says that i‚Äôm attracted to men. maybe it‚Äôs the fact that im genderqueer that confuses things. maybe im scared to admit that i was wrong about my past, or that im coming back to where i started. overall, i just dont know what to do, and i‚Äôm hoping that this can reach anyone with a similar experience

It's separated enough from cars that dining out is a generally pleasant experience, even if that surface parking lot messes up the pedestrian experience a little bit.

Father's Office and Pasta Sisters have been the great driving forces of this area but it's such a shame there are so many useless furniture stores. In my opinion, HD Buttercup should close and make space for a food hall perhaps, a-la-Grand Central Market in DTLA or Chelsea Market in NYC.

The remaining stores could potentially be retail, something Culver City is lacking in general. Perhaps a store like J. Crew/Madewell, Zara or Buck Mason would fit in with the crowds, which are more accessible and have a wider appeal than those indie fashion stores in the Platform. But there's nothing wrong with having more coffee shops and maybe a bar. I also envision more benches/seating.

1gjm975,https://www.reddit.com/r/voyager/comments/1gjm975/star_trek_voyagers_finale_and_the_voyager/,"Star Trek Voyager's Finale and ""The Voyager Conspiracy""","***Please note - Spoilers ahead.***

Firstly, I really love Star Trek Voyager. A wonderful show. The pilot, many episodes throughout the seasons, the brilliant cast, some fantastic episodes not just of Voyager, but Star Trek in general (e.g. Blink of an Eye), great special effects, beautiful musical soundtrack and super characters along with an interesting premise of a ship and her crew trying to get back home whilst keeping their Federation morality.

I just felt a little confused as to why the series finale just suddenly ended abruptly as if it was just a regular episode, rather than a more rounded wholesome story to show us them reuniting with family, or TNG's zooming out of the ship on a happy note. And/or showing us the majestic shot of the Voyager flying in the skies of Earth at the beginning of the finale.

I also personally would have preferred if Janeway had ended up with Chakotay (given the build up) and Seven had ended up with Ensign Kim. Given you had a happy ending for characters like Torres and Paris. I'd also love to have seen the Doctor meeting Data and playing a round of golf, or a bemused Janeway and Picard observing the two having endless ""small talk"" (similar to Data with a Starfleet Captain in an episode of TNG).

Just a suggestion which I thought might have been a good idea for the Finale. Taking a concept/story point from the episode *The Voyager Conspiracy* into the Finale itself to get them home and provide a reason for what the ship's sensors did detect (and which the crew could not explain)*.*

The Finale could have had the Borg use the same type of time travel attempt we see in the film ""First Contact"" to seize (and assimilate) the Caretaker technology and devise some new form of space travel that could take an entire Borg fleet within minutes directly to Earth to overwhelm Starfleet. Rather than any future Janeway coming back in time, you keep the story as a self fulfilled time travel story (similar to *The Voyage Home, or First Contact*) where events always happened. The Borg are trying to replicate how the USS Voyager got to the Delta quadrant in the first place. 

Voyager could have come across this Borg hub after detecting similar technology to the Caretaker Array (minus the Reactor). Detected the Borg opening up a vortex back to the point before the destruction of the Array. And ultimately Voyager makes the decision to stop them, at the potential cost of having to travel all the way back to the start of their journey and in time (it is unknown at this point if they can travel back to the present day). Defeat the Borg, make it back to the present day to the Borg Hub and then have saved the critical element of the Caretaker Array (the Reactor) with Voyager THEMSELVES grabbing the Caretaker reactor (cloaking Voyager using the Borg's own technology or plan and grabbing the reactor). They could then destroy the Borg Hub after the Borg steal it from them again (create a trap that both sides spring on each other like in similar stories in the series) and destroy the entire Hub at the same time as travelling back home to within sighting of Earth thus maintaining the timeline, and having a happy ending on Earth. Add in Janeway saving a Seven who tries to sacrifice herself for the crew. 

  
You can utiise the blue beam detected by Voyager's Sensor logs in *The Voyager Conspiracy* at the original Caretaker array. That always happened. It's Clearly in the Sensor logs, though there was insufficient data to ascertain what, or who it was. No one in the Conspiracy episode could explain it. The explanation can be that it is Voyager itself (after future Voyager acquires the Reactor by stopping the Borg and using Borg technology to conceal herself from the past Voyager or Kazon from the past) tractoring the Reactor away from the explosion and back into the Time vortex to the present day.

  
You could utilise the same opening scene for the Finale of Voyager returning and the Celebration party, except everyone lives (shouldn't have any main character dying, nor change the timeline). This time show them meeting/celebrating with loved ones and the whole 30 years later angle. 

[Voyager uses a Caretaker wave to make it home](https://preview.redd.it/ql8rjdr7nxyd1.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=fda038eb2c7902c8667e7bde85aabce69c687453)

Maybe end with Admiral Janeway touring the bridge of the new USS Voyager B at the space dock above Earth which does a celebratory swing by Jupiter, and fade to credits with the music as Janeway says ""Set a course. For home.""  
  
Might be cheesy, but I felt it would have felt more complete and a cohesive story that utilised the whole blue tractor beam. And you'd still have the Borg element that the writers wanted as well. Without the ""breaking/changing events"" of having future characters coming back in time and destroying their own timeline.  
  
  
So have an actual Time travel story where events always happened this way. Like in First Contact. Not changing history, but being part of established events. The original Caretake array gets Voyager home to complete the whole story. And show us the arrival and reunion with families.  
  
Janeway ending up with Chakotay. Seven ending up with Harry. B'elanna with Paris. One of the next generation (like the latter's child, or Icheb) perhaps getting assigned to the next Voyager when they grow up.¬†  
  
At the celebration at end, have Barclay part of the Voyager family. Cameo of Data appearing to duet with the Doctor and them talking small talk non stop.

  
Just an idea anyhow. 

*Borg message: ""We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. We will take your distinctiveness and make it our own. We will take away your Coffee...""*

Janeway: *""I don't think so. Prepare for ramming speed!""*

We‚Äôre exploring new ideas for Duolingo and would love your feedback on a potential AR (Augmented Reality) feature we‚Äôre considering.

Imagine learning a new language in your own space. With this AR feature, you‚Äôd interact with virtual characters around you‚Äîat a caf√©, in a library, or even in your own living room‚Äîusing just your phone. This gamified experience will allow you to practice conversational skills in natural, real-life contexts without needing any extra equipment. You‚Äôd earn points for each interaction and receive feedback on your performance based on the conversations you have with the NPCs (non-player characters).

Whether you‚Äôre ordering a coffee, asking for directions, or chatting with a virtual local, you‚Äôll be immersed in a fun, interactive game-like environment that helps reinforce your learning. This approach not only makes practice enjoyable but also builds confidence and fluency in everyday conversations.

What do you think of this concept? Is this something you‚Äôd find useful or enjoyable? Do you think practicing conversations in everyday settings would help with fluency?

We‚Äôre trying to gauge interest and get any feedback that could help us refine the concept. Any thoughts or suggestions are really appreciated!

I wake up, drink coffee and stay awake for three hours and then sleep again. Like 12-13 hours.

I still function, get things done in my own way, as you can imagine this much sleep is starting to affect my life in a negative way. Can I get a recommendation regarding solving this issue? I have a appoinment with my doctor on the 13th, I will discuss this issue with them, but in the meantime what should I do?

","Deep space has always seemed beautiful to me. The endless void that stretches beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths, the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena offer a gateway to the unknown. It‚Äôs a place where the boundaries of science blur, paving the way for discoveries in regions untouched by human knowledge.¬†

When you‚Äôre floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can often weigh heavily upon you and the solitude and boredom of space can be‚Ä¶. *haunting*, and I would agree. In the vastness of the Interstellar void, you are but a whisper, merely insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Earth could never match the exhilarating isolation of space.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

My mission was anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I‚Äôd rather spare you the details‚Äîfor your own safety. Just know this: I wasn‚Äôt a man of faith, not before. But now... I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.¬†

Three weeks ago, HQ had intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. We‚Äôve encountered similar transmissions before which are often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites‚Äîthis one was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶quite different.¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \*

When I emerged from my standard cryo-pod, there was an incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A message from HQ‚Ä¶ I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

""Captain Cross... We‚Äôve received a transmission from the Rosette Nebula... but something‚Äôs off. The signal is weak, distorted‚Äîbarely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can‚Äôt trace the source.""

I blinked at the flickering display, trying to wrap my head around it. The Rosette Nebula? That‚Äôs over 5,000 light-years away‚Ä¶ *How is it reaching us now?*

""Are we certain that the signal is not from a stray satellite?"" I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser. It hummed to life, producing the liquid in seconds.

""Confirmed, Captain,"" the comms officer responded, his voice steady. ""The signal‚Äôs unique‚Äîit‚Äôs being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated to penetrate the dense dust clouds of the Rosette Nebula. No other tech in this sector uses this frequency.""

I stared at the monitor, unsettled. The nebula's gas clouds might be interfering... but a signal from that distance? It shouldn't even be possible.

‚ÄúPatch it through,‚Äù I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me. There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of notations

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúHave we deciphered them yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the first 3 notations‚Äù

‚Ä¶. A-N-N‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently working to decode the remaining characters‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll maintain standby for any incoming transmission. Have we received any data bursts or signals from the Nebula Explorer V1?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We‚Äôve isolated Connors in quarantine protocols. It appears he's gone into self-confinement for now, but we're working on extracting him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four weeks since our last deployment and four days without contact. Are we certain he‚Äôs stable?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain. His biometrics are active and nominal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off. I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶ Maybe I should initiate a manual inspection.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. Protocol is clear‚Äîyour directive is to remain on standby. We can‚Äôt authorize an EVA transfer to the other vessel. Resume your current assignments and await further instructions.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day‚Äù¬†

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‚ÄòAffirmative, Captain.‚Äô‚Äù

I‚Äôve been running diagnostics on the ship‚Äôs propulsion systems for the past few days, ensuring all modules are functioning within optimal parameters. My next task was to recalibrate the oxygen filtration system, but honestly, that‚Äôs routine at this point. HQ had also assigned me to monitor deep space comms, the Nebula Explorer V1 was the vessel sent before me. Between that and the scheduled exterior hull inspection later this week, I‚Äôve had my hands full.¬†

Still, none of these tasks were enough to distract me from the uneasy silence coming from Connors. Four days without contact‚Äîit‚Äôs gnawing at me‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúConnors, have you ever thought about what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù I asked him one evening, the low hum of the ship‚Äôs systems providing a backdrop to our conversation. We were in the common area, sipping recycled coffee as we stared out at the stars.

He leaned back in his chair, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou mean besides the endless void? Yeah, I‚Äôve thought about it. But what‚Äôs really out there? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ vast emptiness. It can get overwhelming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. On one hand, it‚Äôs beautiful. On the other, it‚Äôs suffocating. It‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling of isolation.‚Äù

Connors sighed, scratching his chin. ‚ÄúYou know, when I signed up for this mission, I thought I‚Äôd be doing something monumental. Discovering new worlds, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs worth it. The solitude can feel like a weight pressing down on you.‚Äù

I chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúYou signed up for the trip, Connors. You knew what you were getting into‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he replied, but I noticed a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. ‚ÄúJust promise me you won‚Äôt get lost out there, okay? I‚Äôd hate to have to send a search party after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, my friend,‚Äù I said, raising my coffee cup in a mock toast. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a pact. If either of us goes quiet for too long, the other comes looking.‚Äù

*‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù*

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Ä¶.*

A slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused‚Ä¶.straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room.¬†

*Until the alarms deafened me‚Ä¶.*

""Status report!"" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. ""Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes.""

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? an asteroid? No, the Ships AI must have identified it‚Ä¶

I gripped the console as I focused on the blaring alerts. ‚ÄúDivert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!‚Äù I commanded.

I couldn‚Äôt see outside; for some reason, it was dark and blurry. The vessel slammed into something. I hadn‚Äôt engaged my safety harness, and I was violently ejected from my command seat, my body tumbling against the bulkhead.

The AI hummed, its voice urgent, piercing through the chaos.

*WARNING... WARNING... WARNING...*

I couldn‚Äôt see outside. I didn‚Äôt know what I had hit‚Äîsome unseen object in the void‚Äîuntil it became silent. The alarm ceased, leaving an eerie quiet in its wake. My heart raced as I pushed myself upright, the cold metal of the console digging into my back.

‚ÄúStatus report!‚Äù I shouted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the dread that clawed at my insides.

‚ÄúSystems compromised,‚Äù the AI replied, its tone dispassionate as ever. ‚ÄúShields at fifty percent. Hull integrity fluctuating. Unknown entity detected‚Äîlocation: 030 mark 18.‚Äù

I blinked, struggling to comprehend. Unknown entity? ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòunknown entity‚Äô? Can we identify it?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. Visual feeds are compromised. Recommend initiating external scan.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension knotting deeper. ‚ÄúDo it. Get me eyes on whatever we collided with.‚Äù

As the AI began its scanning process, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. The darkness outside my viewport felt oppressive, swallowing the starlight, as if the universe itself was watching me. I fought against the rising tide of panic.

‚Äú*Come on, come on‚Ä¶‚Äù* I muttered under my breath, staring at the flickering display as it struggled to process the input.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a shadowy silhouette drifting just beyond the hull. A massive structure, alien and unsettling, loomed ominously against the void. Its surface was textured, like a complex web of dark materials, pulsating with an eerie glow.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù I breathed, fear coursing through my veins. ‚ÄúAI, enhance the scan! Identify that structure!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnhancing now,‚Äù it responded. The screen pulsed as the AI processed data, but the results were slow. A dread began to settle in my gut‚Äîa feeling that whatever lay before me was more than just an object in space.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù the AI finally said, ‚ÄúI cannot identify the structure. Preliminary scans indicate it emits an unusual energy signature. Suggest caution in approaching.‚Äù

Caution? I was already too close. My heart raced as I tried to think clearly, weighing my options. Should I attempt to maneuver away? Or would it be better to try and communicate?

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at me. Just then, a series of faint vibrations reverberated through the ship. It felt like a heartbeat, rhythmic and steady, sending shivers down my spine.

‚ÄúAI, did you detect that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúAffirmative. The structure appears to be reacting to our presence. Energy levels are rising.‚Äù

With a sinking feeling, I realized the entity had noticed me. Whatever it was, it was alive‚Äî*and it was watching*\*\*.\*\*

‚ÄúPrepare for any incoming transmissions,‚Äù I ordered, adrenaline pumping through me. ‚ÄúWe need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù

But as I waited, the silence returned, heavier this time, as if the very fabric of space held its breath. I felt utterly exposed, trapped in a cocoon of darkness, with only the unknown entity before me.

‚ÄúAI, keep the shields at maximum,‚Äù I commanded, feeling a knot of fear tighten in my stomach. ‚ÄúIf it decides to attack, I want to be ready.‚Äù

Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

The darkness outside the viewport pressed against the hull like a weight, a reminder of the vast, uncaring universe surrounding me. I could almost feel the cold expanse of space wrapping around my ship, isolating me further from any sense of normalcy. My mind raced, piecing together the fragments of what had just occurred. What had I hit?

I forced myself to take a deep breath, steadying my pulse. I had to assess the situation. I fumbled for the control panel, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I reestablished my grip. The interface flickered to life, the dim glow illuminating the command deck like a distant star in the void.

‚ÄúAI, status check!‚Äù I commanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

‚ÄúSystems are nominal,‚Äù the AI replied, its synthesized voice echoing through the stillness. ‚ÄúHowever, navigational sensors are offline, and visual feeds remain compromised. Energy levels are fluctuating within normal parameters.‚Äù

Normal? The word felt almost absurd in this context. ‚ÄúWhat about external scans? Can you provide any data on what we collided with?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ no significant anomalies detected in the immediate vicinity. The object is classified as an unknown entity. Energy readings indicate a strong electromagnetic field surrounding it.‚Äù

I squinted at the monitor, frustration gnawing at me. ‚ÄúGive me a visual feed if you can.‚Äù

The screen pulsed, and for a brief moment, static danced across the display before settling on an image‚Äîa vast, shadowy mass drifted silently beyond my hull, its contours indistinct in the darkness, yet undeniably present.

‚ÄúCan you enhance that?‚Äù I asked, my breath catching in my throat.

‚ÄúEnhancing image‚Ä¶ completed,‚Äù the AI responded. The silhouette sharpened, revealing a complex structure, interwoven with what appeared to be organic-like tendrils that pulsated faintly, as if alive.

My heart raced; *‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?*‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown,‚Äù the AI repeated. ‚ÄúFurther scans are required to ascertain its properties and intentions. Recommend maintaining a safe distance while attempting to establish communication protocols.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. Communication? I didn‚Äôt want to communicate with whatever the hell this thing was

‚ÄúCan we initiate contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúAttempting to establish contact,‚Äù the AI replied, the console lighting up with a series of beeps and whirs.

I gripped the edge of the control panel, anticipation thrumming in my veins. A moment passed, the silence wrapping around me like a shroud. Then came the response‚Äîa low-frequency hum, resonating through the ship, sending vibrations rattling through the hull.

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I whispered, staring at the screen as it displayed a notation.

‚ÄúUnidentified transmission detected,‚Äù the AI stated. ‚ÄúFrequency modulation is inconsistent with known communication methods.‚Äù

It sounded almost‚Ä¶ organic, like the pulse of a heartbeat echoing in the stillness.

‚ÄúCan you decode it?‚Äù I pressed, every instinct telling me to be cautious.

‚ÄúOnly three Initials; A-N-N....Insufficient data to decipher further intent or meaning. Recommend further analysis and monitoring.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Here I was, a speck in the void, facing a phenomenon that defied everything I knew about the universe. I was on the edge of discovery‚Äîor *destruction*.

‚ÄúPrepare to initiate a deep-space scan of that entity,‚Äù I ordered, forcing myself to maintain focus despite the rising tide of uncertainty. ‚ÄúAnd keep the shields at full power. I don‚Äôt want to find out what it can do.‚Äù

A small static came when the AI replied, ‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain.‚Äù

As I settled into my seat, the weight of isolation pressed down on me again. I was alone, drifting through the depths of space, waiting to uncover the secrets of an entity that seemed all too aware of my presence. Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúCaptain Cross‚Ä¶ Report your findings‚Ä¶‚Äù

I straightened in my seat, adrenaline coursing through me. ‚ÄúCommander Hayes, I‚Äî‚Äù My voice faltered for a moment as I glanced at the ominous mass on the screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve encountered an unknown entity in the vicinity. The collision has compromised navigational sensors, but I‚Äôm attempting to assess its properties.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown entity?‚Äù Hayes‚Äôs tone was sharp, laced with urgency. ‚ÄúAre you in danger?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain my composure. ‚ÄúThe entity appears to be‚Ä¶ alive, or at least it has organic characteristics. It‚Äôs emitting a low-frequency signal that I‚Äôm currently analyzing. I recommend sending a probe to gather more data before we make any decisions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We cannot risk losing another asset. Maintain distance and gather intel from your current position. Can you confirm the object‚Äôs stability?‚Äù

‚ÄúStability is unclear. It‚Äôs pulsating and‚Äî‚Äù My words caught in my throat as the entity shifted slightly on the screen. *It‚Ä¶‚Ä¶What the fuck‚Ä¶. It seems to be reacting to my presence.‚Äù*

‚ÄúIs it attempting communication?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I admitted, my eyes narrowing at the screen. The pulsing intensified, the low hum deepening in tone, resonating in a way that felt almost‚Äîintentional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ trying to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaptain, you‚Äôre to prioritize your safety above all else. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary,‚Äù Hayes warned, his voice steely.¬†

I clenched my fists, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúCommander, if this entity poses a threat, we might not have the luxury of waiting. If we don‚Äôt act now, we could lose the opportunity to understand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour priority is to ensure the safety of the mission,‚Äù he repeated firmly. ‚ÄúMaintain monitoring and keep me updated. HQ out.‚Äù

The comms went silent again, leaving me in the oppressive quiet of the command deck. I glanced at the console, the waveform still pulsing in front of me. The low-frequency hum began to shift again, its rhythm changing, more urgent now.

‚ÄúAI, can you analyze that change in the signal?‚Äù I asked, my heart racing.

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ The signal exhibits patterns reminiscent of communication methods unrecognizable,‚Äù the AI reported. ‚ÄúPossible attempts to convey a message. However, the modulation remains unique and indecipherable.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you approximate its intent?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. However, it may imply curiosity or caution.‚Äù

Curiosity or caution? In the cold embrace of space, either could spell destruction.

‚ÄúActivate the external camera feed,‚Äù I ordered. The display flickered, and the viewport illuminated, revealing the entity in full view. It's dark mass loomed large against the backdrop of stars, its tendrils undulating slowly, almost as if they were breathing.

‚ÄúAI, initiate a slow rotation of the ship. I want to get a full visual of this thing without moving too close,‚Äù I instructed, hoping to buy time while my mind raced through the possibilities.

‚ÄúAffirmative,‚Äù the AI responded, and the vessel began to turn.

As I watched the entity shift and ripple in the starlight, an unshakable feeling of dread settled over me. I had ventured into the unknown, and now *I was staring into the abyss, waiting for it to gaze back.*

After what felt like an eternity, a rhythmic sound echoed through the metallic hull of the vessel.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to ignore it, but the noise was relentless, like a heartbeat in the silence of space. There was something far more terrifying awaiting me beyond that sound‚Äîsomething that could lead the mission into‚Ä¶..*Annihilation*.

¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

The sound grew louder, filling the empty corridors of the vessel

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tightened my grip on the control panel, feeling a chill creep up my spine despite the warmth of my suit.

I scanned the monitors, hoping to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat might explain the noise. Yet, the screens showed nothing but the static hum of deep space. The vast darkness loomed beyond the hull, pressing against the ship as if something massive and unseen watched from the void.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to focus on the entity‚Ä¶. *But this noise‚Ä¶* this endless, insistent drumming‚Ä¶ was like a warning, echoing from some primal depth I couldn‚Äôt understand.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the bridge. I forced myself to breathe, slow and steady, but my heart raced in time with that infernal beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

A faint voice crackled through the comm system. ‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. That voice‚Äîit sounded distorted, stretched by static, but familiar. *Impossible*.¬†

*Conners? My voice ached‚Ä¶..*

‚Äú*Ethan‚Ä¶.‚Äù*

The lights dimmed entirely, and the darkness became suffocating. The sound now pounded in my ears.

I turned, but I was alone. Or so I thought. In the shadows at the edge of the bridge, a figure began to form, outlined by the faint emergency lights. The face came last‚Äîhis face. *Conners*. He stared at me, hollow-eyed, as if peering from some eternal abyss.

*""Did you think it would end with me?‚Äù* he whispered, his voice barely more than a rasp against the drumming beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

Panic clawed at my mind as I took a step back, my boots heavy, rooted to the floor. I tried to speak, to explain, but words failed.

And then, as I watched, he stepped forward, his gaze burning with a fury that transcended death, his figure shifting and flickering like static on a broken screen.

‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶..‚Äù he murmured, each syllable dripping with bitterness. ""*You will face it too as I have faced*‚Ä¶..*Complete and utter‚Ä¶.Annihilation*""

How to boil Water

To boil water would seem to be a very- simple thing, and yet the late Charles Delmonico used to say that very few people knew how to do it. 
"" The secret is,"" he said, "" in putting good fresh water into a neat kettle, already quite warm, and setting the water to boiling quickly, 
and then taking it right off for use in tea, coffee, or other drinks, before it is spoiled. 
To let it steam and sim- mer and evaporate, until the good water is in the atmosphere, and the lime and iron and dregs only left in the kettle, 
is what makes a great many people sick ; and it is worse than no water at all."" 
For water boiled like this, and flavored with a few drops of lemon juice, 
Mr. Delmonico used to charge as much as his best liquors ; and he often recom- mended it to his customers and friends who complained of loss of appetite.

My (35M) situationship (27F) ended things, and I still miss her intensely. I cannot come to terms with the thought of her being out of my life completely. Here‚Äôs the background:

# About Us:

I‚Äôm American, and she‚Äôs Turkish. We both live in Europe‚ÄîWe've both only lived here a few years and are somewhat isolated socially, as making real friends here at our age as foreigners can be tough. I only have a couple of close friends nearby, and she has just one girlfriend.

# Why She Was Special:

It‚Äôs been almost a year since we met, and I haven‚Äôt felt this kind of connection with anyone else in a very long time, if at all. She‚Äôs one of the very few people in my life who ‚Äúcharged my battery‚Äù instead of draining it. Being around her felt easy and natural‚Äîshe brought a calmness into my life that I didn‚Äôt even realize I needed. There was no drama, no unnecessary tension. She was just there, showing up for me in small but meaningful ways that I hadn‚Äôt experienced before.

My love language is touch, and she seemed to understand that without me ever needing to say it. She would reach for my hand, put her arms around me, or give me gentle massages, always without being asked. Her warmth and attentiveness made me feel deeply cared for, in ways I didn‚Äôt expect.

Beyond that, we were in sync on so many levels‚Äîour political views, lifestyle choices, and sense of humor. We just clicked, effortlessly. I‚Äôve honestly never laughed so much with a romantic partner: she has a sharp, witty humor that matched mine perfectly. Our conversations flowed, whether we were being serious or joking around. We could spend hours talking or just being silly, and it always felt like we were on the same wavelength. Our chemistry was a connection that made me feel alive and understood.

# Why I Held Back:

One of the biggest reasons I hesitated was the uncertainty around a potential job opportunity I was offered by my old company back in the U.S. I was offered a position that would have nearly doubled my salary, but it required me to relocate. If I accepted, I‚Äôd be moving in a few months. I didn‚Äôt want to commit to her while knowing that I might soon have to leave here for good. The thought of getting even more attached, only to uproot myself and end things, felt irresponsible and unfair to both of us. I thought it was better to keep things light, even if that meant holding back on my true feelings.

There was also the question of our cultural and religious differences. She‚Äôs a moderate Muslim, and I‚Äôm a Western agnostic. I had concerns about how our families might react and how these differences might play out if we became serious. I imagined the potential challenges of integrating our worlds‚Äîhow our families might struggle to connect, the language barriers, and whether our differing beliefs could become a source of tension over time. These concerns added to my hesitation, making me wonder if it was wise to dive into a serious commitment.

Ironically, after months of uncertainty and holding back, the job offer eventually fell through. I found out that I‚Äôd be staying in Germany after all, right around the time that things fell apart with her. The realization stung; all my reasons for hesitating suddenly felt hollow. Here I was, choosing to stay in Germany, yet the person I wanted most was no longer there to stay with me..

# What Happened:

Last summer, we both went back to our home countries for vacation‚Äîme to the U.S., her to Turkey. Near the end of her trip, she sent me a message that blindsided me: she had met someone new in Turkey, a 25-year-old soldier, and said she had ‚Äúfallen in love‚Äù with him. Now, they‚Äôre in a long-distance relationship.

I‚Äôve tried to make sense of how she could ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù after just a few days. It seems sophomoric/naive. Either it was some super rare, once-in-a-lifetime connection that felt destined, or he swept her off her feet with some mind-blowing sex, and maybe love-bombing on top. She told me they talk on the phone constantly, keeping in touch as much as possible. In my skeptical (and admittedly biased coping) mind, I imagine him as a charming, good-looking player‚Äîsomeone who knows exactly how to keep girls hooked, possibly even stringing along others around the world. 

At first, I played it cool and wished her the best, though I mentioned my concerns about her possibly getting hurt. In my experience, a young, handsome soldier isn‚Äôt exactly the ideal candidate for a committed, celibate, long-distance relationship. She offered to stay friends, but I declined at the time, thinking it would be too painful. It didnt seem fair that she could have me as a friend still, and also this new lover, when I had no one to replace her as a lover.

About a month ago however, I asked if she‚Äôd meet up for coffee and a walk. I wanted to get everything off my chest for some closure. I was ready to finally tell her everything I‚Äôd held back‚Äîhow much she meant to me, how much I regretted not being open, and that I loved her. But she turned down the meeting, saying she didn‚Äôt want to meet while she was with her new boyfriend, as she wouldn‚Äôt want him doing the same to her. Although disappointed, I understood and decided to text her instead, pouring out everything I felt. I laid all my cards out on the table. I told her I‚Äôd planned to ask her to be serious with me when we both got back from our vacations. I shared how deeply hurt I‚Äôd been by her sudden shift to a new relationship and how it felt like a missed opportunity for us. It was hard, and I ended up even crying for the first time in many years while typing it all out. she told me she cried too. Of course also calling me dumb for waiting so long, which she was right. 

Before we ended though, I asked her to be clear: if she knew she‚Äôd never want to see me again, even if her current relationship didn‚Äôt work out, I wanted to know. She said she didn‚Äôt see any reason why we couldn‚Äôt reconnect if she were single. It gave me a bit of hope, and we left things on a good note.

A couple of weeks later, I texted her after hearing about a recent terrorist attack in Turkey, to send well wishes to her family and friends. She responded quickly and well, and a short message turned into a three-hour text conversation including a few short voice messages, it was mix of small talk, current events, and even a bit of our usual joking around. I shared a bit about my recent dates, partly to show I was trying to move on. But I couldn‚Äôt help mentioning how much I missed her, hoping she might reconsider.

Her response was kind but firm‚Äîshe said she didn‚Äôt want to meet as long as she was still with him. It hurt, but I appreciated her honesty.

I‚Äôve been dating others since, but the void hasn‚Äôt gone away. I think about her constantly, and I‚Äôve even muted her on social media in order not to reminded but despite it I still sometimes manually search and check her stories. My life feels much lonelier and emptier without her in it. It doesnt seem to be getting better over time like everyone says and like I myself thought it would.

# My Thoughts and Questions:

* How likely is it her long-distance relationship will last?  based on the info here, or even general probabilities, your personal experiences etc. 
* Is there potential for us to repair our relationship and be in a committed one after what‚Äôs happened?
* Speculation on whether she would have chosen to end things with me for this new guy regardless of the circumstances.
* Consideration of whether it‚Äôs worth holding onto hope that she might come back into my life in some way.

I find myself at a crossroads, needing to decide between keeping my hopes alive or fully detaching myself from her. This means potentially erasing or blocking her number and disconnecting on social media altogether. As someone who tends to overthink, I‚Äôm looking for strategies to calm these obsessive and sad thoughts and feelings that keep resurfacing.

1gjlwj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gjlwj4/my_narcissistic_sister_25_is_threatening_suicide/,"My narcissistic sister (25) is threatening suicide, doesn't want to work, and is trauma dumping on my mother","Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (28F) have always known my sister was selfish. It was little things when we were little. But she was ""the baby,"" and has been treated that way her entire life.

She is living at home with my parents working part-time. She is not helping out financially whatsoever, other than paying for her own meal or two here and there. No bills, no ""rent,"" no¬†*nothing*.

Around 2020, right when ADHD blew up on Tiktok, my sister decided she had it. (ADHD is real, and it is under diagnosed in women. However, my sister quite literally never showed any signs of this.) She was put on Adderall and has never been the same since. She leaves her pill bottles out where everyone can see them and brings them everywhere - the kitchen table, the coffee table, and talks non-stop about her meds, especially Adderall, like she's special.

My mom has spent thousands of dollars on psychiatrists, therapists, and medications. She paid all of my sister's college tuition, all of her moving costs, her furniture in college, etc. She'll even pay for her gas. My parents have been supportive of her this entire time. In fact, up until a couple years, ago, I always said she was their favorite.

She's losing lifelong friends with her current attitude and outlook on life. Everything is about how mentally ill she is, how she can't work, she doesn't want to find a full-time job, and she wants to sit at home all day doing nothing.

She sends my mom paragraphs of trauma dumping. I have to admit that my mother isn't the most empathetic person, but I don't know how anyone would respond to the stuff she sends. ""Everything is about money"" ""I don't want to work"" ""I've been suicidal for months""

Today, her trauma dumping caused my mother to have an absolute meltdown. My grandfather (my mother's father) is sick on hospice in the ICU, and we don't think he's going to make it. My grandmother is calling and texting sporadically throughout the day because she's old and doesn't know what to do. They live five hours away, and my mother is the breadwinner - she has visited them half a dozen times in the last two months.

So, my sister's multiple paragraphs of meltdowns and trauma dumping, including mentioning she's been suicidal for months, caused my mother to cry and vomit, and clear her work schedule for the day.

My sister wants my mom to spend thousands of dollars so she can go to some therapy place in the mountains. One of her college friends went to a place like that, and wouldn't you know it, that was right around the time all her troubles started.

I'm not saying my sister is faking everything. But she is very performative - jiggling her legs violently, violently shaking while sitting to show how she is now suddenly ""hyper"", and surrounding herself with tiktoks and therapy speak that reinforce her belief that the world revolves around her.

We are not close and never have been. I don't know what to do. She is displaying telltale signs of narcissism and manipulation. She's throwing out that she's been suicidal the past few months. 

I think it's really a cry for help, but **I truly don't know what other help she can get.** At a certain point,¬†***she***¬†has to make the choice to see things in a different perspective, surround herself with positive people, and dump therapists who are encouraging this brain rot.

I've been through severe mental health struggles. I have been intensely suicidal. I have been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 14. I get how serious this is.

But my mom, who is nearing 60, and my dad, in his mid-60s, **cannot continue like this.** I don't know what I can do or what advice I can give to them, and how I can help out my mom.

1gjlvmc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjlvmc,Moving plants cross-country in winter,"I'm moving across the US next month (December) with 34 of my plants (see photos and list at bottom). It's possible the weather will be nice, and my plants will be fine, but I need advice on what to do if the worst happens and it's below freezing the whole drive. We're travelling from New York to Ohio to Illinois to Kansas to the Rockies, so we'll be decently far north unless winter storms force us to take a longer, more southerly route.

My partner and I are planning on renting a box truck (like a Uhaul) and towing our only car behind it. There's limited space in the cab of the box truck, which means most or all of the plants will have to go either in the back of the box truck or in the towed car. There would be no heat source in either. The plants will absolutely be coming inside our hotel room with us when we stop every day.

So to my questions:

1) Is it possible for the plants to survive the daytime ride in the box truck or car if the temperature is cold? What is too cold? How can I help keep them warm without a heat source?

2) Which plants should get priority for going in the heated cab? Which ones are more sensitive to the cold?

3) How can I prevent frostbite when transporting plants from the vehicle to the hotel room and vice versa? One time I moved my plants in the winter, and some of them completely froze and died in the 30 seconds it took me to walk them from the apartment door to the heated car, so I'm paranoid.

We have multiple reasons for not driving the car separately. If driving the car with the heat on is truly the only way to save the plants, then we can make it happen.

Here's a list of the types of plants involved, as I understand they all have different temperature requirements:

- a silver squill
- a mistletoe cactus
- some kind of watch chain succulent (x3)
- a pincushion cactus
- a Haworthia of unknown variety
- a kalanchoe
- an aloe vera
- a gasteria of unknown variety
- a snake plant
- a ZZ plant
- a peace lily
- an orchid
- a Venus fly trap
- an anthurium
- a sago palm
- a Begonia rex Princess of Hanover
- an African violet
- a lucky bamboo
- a large-leafed plant we have yet to identify (see last photo)
- a croton
- a coffee plant
- an African mask plant
- 2 different Dracaena fragrans
- a Ctenanthe oppenheimiana
- a Kimberly Queen fern
- a maidenhair fern
- an Epiprenum pearls and jade
- a Codieaum variegatum Batik
- a Chamaedorea elegans
- 2 mums that may or may not be alive by next month

How do I set boundaries without building walls? Am I naive, or is MGOW/Redpill where I need to put my focus?","To preface, I'm (31m) battling depression and am extremely lonely in life. I moved to a new city, and am struggling to meet people. I have hobbies and stuff i go out to do stuff, but people dont want interaction. Maybe with me, maybe with people in general. In this PNW city people look at you strange if you speak to them with a hello. I feel embarrassed by saying hello or good morning to coworkers I see every day, and to be met with ignoring. Its not particularly a mean city, but it's not nice in any sense of the word. 

I use dating apps, and have mostly terrible experiences. I get plenty of matches, but the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of them make me feel like I'm putting on a show. I am a performer by trade, so I know this feeling of coming off stage. Either I have to put on a show to ""prove"" how funny/charismatic, or pay for a drink/boba/coffee to prove I have a job/income. It's to the point where I feel like I'm looking over my shoulder with every interaction, wondering how much I have to prove myself. 

Then even if I decide I want to go on a second date, they have to reciprocate that desire. And when dates (women) hesitate and are unsure, I cut bait because I know already I don't live up to her ideal and she has her thumbs that she's surely using to keep looking, so why waste my time being 3rd or 4th choice

I went on one date that I thought went well. A lot in common, very easy conversation. And then she's like ""I dont feel a spark, but I'd love to be friends."" To which I said no thank you. I don't want to be around wondering, having a crush on someone, and them start dating someone and feel more worthless than I am.

Am I being to harsh on myself by cutting these ""opportunities"" off? Like I'm really depressed and could honestly use a friend, but being a friend by consolation prize doesn't seem right. As lonely as I am and depressed, the only info I can find to help is redpill/men going their own way stuff, which has its problems. Or maybe it doesn't have problems and I'm truly ignorant to how to operate with other humans? How does this cutting people off at the first one or two red flags, not become a self fulfilling prophecy of being alone? How can I look out for myself and my boundaries, while not kicking everyone out of my life? Or does everyone just generally treat everyone like shit now, and I need to get on the band wagon? I'm genuinely asking. It just feels like all the ""don't date/work on yourself"" advice while it can be ""productive,"" I'm still lonely, and don't feel any more closer to a single person. It just makes me feel broken, unworthy of love, and a burden on everyone else's oxygen supply. It feels to me like i have to prove more stuff and worthiness (income/body/show), rather than just being accepted. If I have to prove myself then why date? I'm going to look suspiciously at everyone and not trust anyone. Because then that means they're after my resources (time/energy/money/focus), and it's for them. I don't want to be used, but I also don't want to be lonely. Maybe I am naive in my viewpoint, but how does one navigate going on their own and that depression?

What are potential downsides of adopting redpill/mgtow or those types of philosophies? I've generally tried to stay away because some ideas I just don't resonate with, but this feeling of being used to prove my worth doesn't resonate with me either.",1,1730746042.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

Each time I killed her, she came back, her memory wiped clean. ‚ÄúWhy do you look so pale?‚Äù she asked one evening, concern etched on her beautiful face. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to answer. Instead, I clenched my fists, the urge to silence her again bubbling beneath the surface.

One night, I decided to try something different. I wanted to see how far I could push it. ‚ÄúMaybe if I strangle her,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúit will be different this time.‚Äù I crept up behind her as she washed the dishes, and with a swift motion, I wrapped my hands around her throat. She gasped, her eyes wide with confusion. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù she managed to choke out before I squeezed tighter.

As her body went limp, a sick thrill coursed through me. But when I awoke the next day, she was sitting on the couch, flipping through a magazine. ‚ÄúHey, you! You scared me last night!‚Äù she teased, a playful grin on her face. ‚ÄúYou just disappeared after dinner. I thought you were going to help me with the laundry!‚Äù

I felt a mix of anger and despair. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember?‚Äù I shouted, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúI killed you! I've killed you over and over!‚Äù The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. She looked at me, confusion washing over her features. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? You‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. ‚ÄúI have to end this,‚Äù I thought, my mind racing. I grabbed a heavy object from the table and swung it at her head. The sickening crack echoed through the room. She collapsed, and for a moment, I felt victorious. But once again, the next day, she was back. ‚ÄúMorning, honey‚Äù she smiled , rubbing her head. ‚ÄúI made breakfast.‚Äù

I was trapped in this nightmare, a twisted game I could never win. Each time I killed her, I felt the thrill, but it was always followed by the crushing weight of reality. No matter what I did, she would return, blissfully unaware of my sins. 

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just stay dead?‚Äù I screamed one night, my voice breaking. She looked at me, hurt and confused. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù she whispered. 

It was a twisted cycle, one that left me more hollow with every act yet here I was picking up the knife once again.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

What I'm going to do about it.,"Please construe this post as me being extremely angry and trying to calm myself down. I'm going to be fine. I'm not looking for validation, sympathy, or advice (though if you have either of the last two to offer, that'd be appreciated). 

I'm in grad school right now, and among my fellow students with two exceptions they see me as a freak. They (usually) don't say that directly, but I know it's true. I see them walking past in their happy laughing groups. No one invites me to shit. I see it in the way they smile at me. The way everyone looks at eachother when I join a group. The way they pause before answering me. They see me as a freak.

If you're reading this you're probably thinking I'm just being paranoid. And I am. I think 75% of the laughter in my ears is imaginary. But 25% is STILL A LOT. They talk around me. When they talk to me they look at eachother like I'm the punchline of a secret joke.

IT DIDN'T FUCKING USED TO BE THIS WAY. I thought I had beat this shit. Before I came here I had a friend group. They were normal, they were nice, they saw me as one of them. They didn't make me walk behind them when we went somewhere. They didn't do the stupid little half smile people here do at me. They didn't roll their eyes when they thought I couldn't see. I sometimes have thoughts that it was all in my head, but it wasn't. I'm 100% sure.

Everything fucking sucks. I wish I could just hate them rather than being so desperate for them to like me.

Okay, tantrum over. 

It's not as bad as it is in my head.  Yes, people think I'm weird, but it's hopeful that that hasn't always been the case. It means it's not inevitible and can be fixed. 

There's been times in my life that I've been flat-out unwelcome everywhere I go, and this isn't one of them.  I played poker with some friends Friday. They looked at me when I was speaking. No one talked over me. I messed up socially at one point, but not in an irreversible. There was some inviting-to-things that excluded me, but I had lunch with one of the people earlier that day. Just because people think I'm weird, doesn't mean they hate me, or that it's inevitible. **It's going to be harder this time** because I'm going from weird and chaotic to normal rather than quiet and emotionless to normal, and I spend a lot more time around these people, but **it is possible, and it is going to happen**.

And I have one friend who likes me, respects me, and doesn't think I'm weird. Or if he does, not more than he sees himself. Nobody else sees him as weird or akward. He's invited me to join his events and we get coffee every week. He genuinely likes me and wants to be around me. I'm still not used to that, but I like it. It's more than a start, but it's also a start.

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm done trying to be special, distinct, funny, or interesting. That will come later. But for now, I'm going to focus on being **nice**, **regulated, and inquisitive.** I think if you're those three things (within normal bounds), it's very hard for people to see you as a freak, or see yourself that way.

2. I'm experimenting with constant, unconditional, honest self affirmation, and a variety of tactile and therapy techniques to make my brain more receptive to these new habits. Already things are starting to change.

I'm still frustrated but writing this helped. I'm proud of myself for fixing this before, I'm proud of myself for trying this hard this time. I like myself. There's no certainty for me or anyone, but I believe it'll be okay. TThanks for reading.

I am looking to start a mobile coffee cart in NJ for events (weddings, corporate offices) and farmers markets. I want a machine that can grow with higher volumes and stand strong well without it being too bulky as I need it to be very mobile. I am expecting to service around 60 people most days but would like the flexibility to service 150+, if I do work bigger events like weddings.

My criterias are pretty simple I feel:  
\- Plumbable  
\- Dual Boiler  
\- NSF certified  
\- Small enough to fit a coffee cart with a lottt of room  
\- Budget: most bang for your buck. Ideally wouldn't want to go more than 5k, but if a machine calls for bigger price tag that is worth the extra jump, then that's okay  
\- (Would be nice) if it looked clean and modern, la marzocco lookss

I have read through, I believe, every single post on this thread related to coffee carts, and I am still unsure on what machine to purchase :/ I have read most people recommend the GS3, Linea Mini, and the Lucca A53. Here are my thoughts on all of them

GS3:  
\- it seems to be a strong work horse, but I've read some posts here that the price tag is being carried by the LM clout... is that true?  
\- if not the GS3, then what else?  
\- the price tag.... but is it worth it?  
Linea Mini:  
\- i have read that there are options more worth it for that 6k price tag, but I honestly haven't found any that are NSF certified commercial grade and compact enough to move around.  
\- this would be my ideal, but i have also seen that some people say this won't be capable in higher volume environments  
Lucca A53:  
\- issues with steam consistency  
\- this would be my 2nd ideal, but i have also seen that some people say this won't be capable in higher volume environments and...  
\- i don't personally like the look

\*if there is a commercial grade version of the lelit bianca, I would buy it in a heart beat. well actually... could the lelit work if my state doesn't care for the NSF tag and/or if its not commercial grade\*

I have reached out to my local espresso suppliers/repairs, and they haven't been all too helpful as they either ghost me or just sell whatever machines they are affiliated with. I am also reaching out to my local municipalities to see what their regulations are for machines, but I don't think its not much more than being NSF certified and commercial grade, but IDK if people think otherwise. ALSO if you guys have any suggestions of online retailers that are not biased that I can reach out to as well for suggestions or even purchasing from, please let me know. Thank you so much!!!

This summer I thought I'd try an experiment to see how life is without caffeine and quit pretty cold turkey. I went from coffee to black tea for a week or two and then started drinking caffeine free tea, which I'm still doing.

Before this summer, and especially the last ten years or so, I have always been very hot. Sweating tons and dying in the summer, and walking around in t-shirts and thin sweaters in the winter. However since i stopped drinking anything with caffeine about 3-4 months ago i felt *cold* a lot more often. I've even cranked up the heating in my apartment and now agree with my coworkers that yes, our office is in fact fucking cold. I would usually sit and sweat in a t-shirt while at least one of my coworkers went home to work because she were too cold.

I didn't feel much of any other negative side effects really, which seems mean to say when having read some other experiences in this subreddit. 

Have anyone else had the same experience?

Edit: This isn't a complaining post. I'm more curious which bodily functions cause this and how caffeine impacts those functions. Higher stress? Higher heart rate? ",1,1730744388.0,decaf,3,0.67,False

I work from home most days, so typically I'm at home working when she gets back from school or work. 

When she comes home, she has her unwinding routine which includes getting changed, making coffee, going to the bathroom, etc., during which she's extremely irritable and short tempered. No biggie, I've learned to keep my distance while she's at it, but recently she's started demanding that I confine myself and my cat in my home office with the door shut until she's finished her business (specifically while going to the bathroom). If I refuse, she'll throw a tantrum and get super upset with me for not cooperating with her demands.

This has been making me feel like a nuisance at my own home and led to repetitive fights between us lately. I totally get that she needs her space, and she can have it for as long as she desires, but I don't feel comfortable with diminishing myself like that in order to please her.

1gjl3g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1gjl3g6/for_future_reference/,For future reference. ,"I made a post earlier about what would happen if I caved into my cravings and drank coffee and had nicotine a few hours before my PET CT scan.

January of 2023 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. Additionally, I was diagnosed with primary mediastinal Lymphoma so I had a large mass over my heart in my chest. I underwent constant treatment for the better part of 12 months and only recently earlier this year was determined to be in remission.

The post I made this morning was an anxiety-filled question to see if partaking in a few indulgences would seriously negatively affect the results of my scan. I sought comfort and sound advice to help prevent me from sabotaging myself. I have had to reschedule a PET in the past because I did not follow the guidelines. But, I was genuinely freaking out this morning because I am terrified of the possibility of the disease coming back, ruining some great opportunities I've been able to line up for myself recently (new job, relationship, etc...).

To those who provided thoughtful and genuine advice in my previous post, I thank you wholeheartedly. Navigating all this shit has been some of the most physically and mentally demanding obstacles throughout my life. And I am only 29! Cancer sucks and I'm thankful to have an outlet such as this one to ask people for genuine advice.

I ended up talking to my oncologist about everything this morning. And she helped bring me back down to reality. On top of prescribing anti-anxiety meds to help.

So here's the update! My original post was deleted because I have not disclosed my diagnosis. Hope this counts as one and I can make posts in the future without them being deleted.

Edit: Forgot to mention that around noon I received a call informing me that I would need to reschedule the PET for tomorrow because of a water leak! Me and my mother started laughing hysterically about it. ",4,1730744184.0,cancer,5,1.0,False

This was donated to my nonprofit to sell for our music lessons program. 

I have only found 2 other LF&C #90 online, and they were both painted at some point. This one isn't and I don't believe ever has been. 

I can't decide if it's so hard to find online because it's super rare or if it's because they just aren't that important or sought-after. 

Any ideas on a value on this to sell? If you know of a specific place to sell it, that would be great too. 

Someone in my community FB group told me it was rusty and worthless, but I have reconditioned cast iron skillets that looked worse than this. I just don't want to do anything to this one until I know what we've got and if I should or not.
