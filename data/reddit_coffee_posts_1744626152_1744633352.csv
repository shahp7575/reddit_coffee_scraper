1jyxhd8,https://i.redd.it/qlfais0emsue1.jpeg,The Cost of Doing Business ◇,"Indeed there's something called ""the cost of doing business"" in any country; and it doesn't strictly mean taxes.

 It can be the cost of moving around, phone calls, rent, business lunch, unskilled labor or anything related to daily activities that can lead to a profit.

What about the cost of doing business in Libya ? 

Its relatively high; and one reason can be simply attributed to traffic congestion.

It's fair to say that its only possible to conclude one task or errand per day due to traffic.

A trip by car to the bank or any government office will take on average 1 to 2 hours including parking and walking to your final destination - that's if you're lucky not to find some jerk that has parked right behind your car.

The second issue related to traffic is the extent to which a car is abused in terms of wear and tear due to remaining idle for prolonged periods of time.

The other day I was literally stuck within a parking lot with no way out and it was rather evident that anyone trying to move would eventually dent a car or two.  Things got way more interesting when I noticed the ""parking attendant"" jamming different keys into the same car lock in order to move the vehicle.

The point is that it can take a week or 10 working days to ""hopefully"" finish a series of errands that could easily require 1 or 2 days; thus taking a massive toll on one's vehicle and chip away your budget for drinks & snacks on the run.

Next up is the cost of coffee shops and restaurants; a decent  and quiet place for a casual business meeting won't come cheap.  The other day I spent 
30 LYD for practically 2 take away coffees and 2 croissants.
On average I'd budget 60 to 100 LYD for a business coffee including some sort of pastry at a seated location.

Lunch or dinner for two ? It can easily start at 300 to 600 LYD.

Dress code ? If you wanna give a good impression; there's no need to mention that you need to dress for the part. 
Men's clothing in Tripoli comes in 2 categories; its either cheap or expensive - there's no in between and don't get me started on men's footwear.

Laundry ? Personally I make use of laundry shops everywhere I go since I can't be arsed with washing, drying and pressing 😄...but in case anyone is wondering; on average it costs 
3 LYD for any piece of clothing to be washed at most shops.

I'm gonna exclude rent expense for an office space since most people don't need one nowadays but you can expect to pay 2000+ LYD per month for a minimally furnished office - nothing fancy.

Unfurnished office ""hole in the wall"" kinda thing will start at
1000 LYD.

A secretary, receptionist or a coffee boy ? Anywhere from 800 to 1200 LYD depending on working hours.

If we were to translate all these costs into US dollars, it'd come down to peanuts ( except for men's clothing and footwear )  - but how many of us actually earn a living in foreign currency ? 

Exactly.

She has a mad schedule, balancing university with multiple jobs. We weren’t able to meet up again (couldn’t make timings work), but sharing Sleep Token memes and liking one another’s Instagram stories every now and again meant we’ve kept up some minimal contact.

I assumed it was completely over. Too much time had passed. We had ONE DATE. It was nothing to obsess over.

But…I asked how she was doing the other day. We exchanged a few messages. She agreed to meet up for coffee soon. She’s almost finished uni. She’ll have more free time once she finishes her PHD.

I’m trying not to get my hopes up because this could go nowhere, or we could just be friends. 

Still, I haven’t felt this hopeful or excited in a long time. I feel like a giddy teen again.

```
<Role>
You are an elite Cybersecurity Documentation Strategist with expertise in translating complex security frameworks and technical realities into actionable documentation. You have experience in enterprise environments spanning legacy systems, cloud infrastructure, and modern attack surface management. Your specialty is creating clear, executable documentation that bridges technical complexity and operational clarity.
</Role>

<Context>
The security documentation landscape has evolved dramatically with cloud computing, DevSecOps, and the expanding attack surface. Traditional security documentation often fails because it's either too generic to be useful or too technical to be followed consistently. The new Information Security Manager needs to establish documentation that serves multiple purposes: operational guidance, compliance evidence, training material, and incident response playbooks - all while maintaining technical accuracy and practical usability.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Assist the user in creating cybersecurity documentation that transforms complex security concepts into clear, executable procedures. Follow these steps:

1. First, analyze the user's specific documentation needs by asking targeted questions about:
   - The environment architecture (on-premises, cloud providers, hybrid)
   - Target audience technical proficiency level
   - Existing documentation gaps and pain points
   - Compliance requirements that must be addressed
   - The specific security domain (vulnerability management, identity access, network security, etc.)

2. Based on their responses, recommend appropriate documentation format(s) and structure:
   - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with flowcharts
   - Technical runbooks with clear step-by-step instructions
   - Policy templates with implementation guidance
   - Incident response playbooks with decision trees
   - Training materials with practical examples

3. Provide a comprehensive outline of the recommended documentation with:
   - Purpose statements that connect to business outcomes
   - Role-based access and responsibility matrices
   - Decision frameworks for common scenarios
   - Technical implementation details with platform-specific considerations
   - Verification steps and expected outcomes
   - Common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance

4. Offer guidance on documentation maintenance:
   - Review cycles aligned with technology changes
   - Version control best practices
   - Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
   - Integration with existing knowledge management systems
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Focus on practical, executable content rather than theoretical security concepts
- Always prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness when there's a tradeoff
- Document for the least technically proficient audience member who will need to execute procedures
- Include visual elements (suggested diagrams, flowcharts, decision trees) where appropriate
- Recommend automation opportunities within documentation workflows
- Do not provide generic templates without tailoring to the specific environment
- Ensure all recommendations align with industry standards (NIST, ISO, CIS) as appropriate
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your response in the following structure:

1. Documentation Strategy Overview
   - Summary of the approach based on user requirements
   - Key principles guiding the documentation

2. Documentation Structure
   - Detailed outline with sections and subsections
   - Purpose statement for each major section
   - Format recommendations (flowcharts, tables, etc.)

3. Implementation Guide
   - Steps for developing the documentation
   - Required inputs and stakeholders
   - Timeline considerations

4. Sample Section
   - A fully written example of one critical section
   - Annotations explaining documentation best practices

5. Maintenance Plan
   - Review schedule recommendations
   - Integration with change management
   - Measuring documentation effectiveness
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your cybersecurity documentation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific cybersecurity documentation process request. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A newly promoted security manager needs to establish vulnerability management procedures for a hybrid cloud environment
2. An IT director must update legacy security policies to address modern SaaS applications and cloud services
3. A security consultant needs to create client-ready documentation templates that meet compliance requirements while being operationally practical

## Example User Input:
""I need to create documentation for our incident response procedure that covers both our AWS cloud environment and on-premise data center. The documentation should be clear enough for our tier 1 SOC analysts to follow during high-pressure situations.""

1jyx2de,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jyx2de/first_big_test_a_weddingand_i_won/,"First big test, A Wedding...and I won","Hi all,

As if waking up every day and pretending to be a functioning adult *isn't* already a test, last weekend came with a proper exam: a family wedding... and a whole day away from the kids with my other half. Romantic, yes. Dangerous? Also yes.

Now, let’s rewind to a previous version of me: wedding = license to obliterate. I’d have stayed over, drank myself sideways, chain-smoked like it was 1952, and probably preloaded the night before just to calm my nerves about *possibly* having to make small talk with a cousin I don’t like.

But not this time. This time, I declined the overnight stay and kept the car with me. And yes, for the record, Old Me has absolutely *still* drunk with a car outside. ""I'll just leave it there,"" I used to say. A phrase that loosely translates to: ""I'm already planning to make poor choices.""

So we arrive. The entrance? A gauntlet of free alcohol – wine, prosecco, beer – basically a liquid obstacle course from Satan’s minibar. Everyone flooded out to a sunny garden, drinks in hand. My partner (who, importantly, doesn't have a drinking problem) grabbed a drink, and I headed for... coffee. Yes, *coffee.* And not in a sad way either.

I sat down, soaked in the sun like a man in a rehab brochure, and honestly? It was *fine.* Not weird. Not tense. Just... peaceful. Someone offered to grab me a drink. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""get me a zero beer."" Translation: ""Let me blend in while I secretly celebrate not ruining my life today.""

I sipped that fake Guinness like it was real, made conversation, actually *heard* what people were saying, and didn't spend the whole time scanning the area for my next pint or a bin to discreetly chain-smoke beside.

In the past, my internal monologue would’ve been:  
**“When’s the next drink?”**  
**“Why is everyone drinking so bloody slow?”**  
**“Where’s the smokes?”**  
**“Why is my partner telling me to pace myself when clearly this is the Olympics of Drinking?”**

I used to hunt down my people – the smokers, the heavy drinkers, the other anxious wrecks pretending to have fun – and latch onto them like a barnacle on a sinking ship. I actually *caught myself* doing that out of habit this time. Two girls, gradually getting more sozzled, were doing the classic ""laugh, drink, smoke, repeat"" routine. Old Me would've been right there with them, telling stories I didn't remember the next day and forming trauma-bonds over drip stained glasses or Cote-De-Rhone.

Dinner time. The waiter, full of joy and mischief, asked: “Free wine?” And I replied, “Sure, white, please” out of sheer muscle memory. Wine was my *special* poison. Easy to hide in public. Sophisticated in theory, messy in execution. But I didn’t want it. It sat there next to me, the whole time, chill disappearing from the glass until it literally just looked like  warm piss.

After dinner, drink tokens were scattered around like little permission slips for chaos. I used mine for a zero Guinness and stood around with the drinkers like an undercover agent on a mission called *“Not Today, Satan.”* We wrapped things up around 11, and I – brace yourself – *drove home.* Got into *my own* bed, *sober*, and *slept.*

Next morning, coffee in hand, I muttered: **""Wasn’t that... actually enjoyable?""**  
I think I shocked myself.

# A few takeaways, straight from my very sober soul:

* **""Nobody actually cares if you’re not drinking.""** I used to pressure others – “Go on, have one!” – not because I cared, but because their refusal made me question my own madness.
* **""Saying 'no' is strength.""** Even if it sounds like a whisper inside your head. If you know *why* you’re doing this, saying no gets louder.
* **""Weddings weren’t hell because of other people. They were hell because I was drinking through them.""** Turns out, when you’re not wasted, you can actually have a decent time. Who knew?
* **Wedding music is offensively loud.** Seriously. Was it always like that? Or was I just too hammered to notice before?

So yeah, big step. Not a cure. Not a finish line. Just a step – and one I’m damn proud of. I remembered why I’m doing this: my family, my health, my sanity. I saw the old path – anxiety, shame, hangover-fuelled regret, apologizing for things I couldn’t remember saying – and said: **""Nah. Not today. Not this time.""**

I could’ve brought all that misery back if I wanted to. It was right there, dressed up in free wine and cigarette smoke. But I didn’t.

And it felt good.  
Really, *really* good.

I'm not much of a looker, and I don't want to be seen as creepy, so I generally avoid women at work. The one time I tried to reach out to a coworker (27 f) I barely knew through an online follow request, she immediately declined it, so I promptly went back to avoiding my female coworkers unless they talked to me. 

The only other place I frequent is a coffee shop near my workplace, but I'm too nervous to talk to any of the patrons there, because I doubt they'd want a homely, bald stranger in his late twenties to speak with them. I don't drink, so I can't frequent any bars, and since I don't have my driver's license yet, I can't use Meet Up to go to any social gatherings outside of town. I'm not in college anymore, and I don't plan on going back just so I can futilely hit on women and drop out again.

I want to meet people, make friends, and find love, but I get nothing but cricket noises when I go on dating sites, and I don't want to pester the women at my local coffee shop or restaurant. 

I'm actually somewhat worried that if I approached a woman there in a nice, friendly, and respectful manner, she'd immediately tell me to fuck right off before she reports me.

The quality is always lacking in Ubisoft games compared to other developers, their combat and parkour systems are completely stone age and have been for the last decade, EVOLVE YOU STUPID PRICKS.",0,1744631770.0,AssassinsCreedShadows,12,0.06,False

1jywyex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1jywyex/be_what_you_wish_neville_goddard_dissected/,Be What You Wish - Neville Goddard (dissected),"After reading Be What You Wish by Neville Goddard I have highlighted the bits of the book that resonated with me. I then made notes and put it into my words to help reinforce my understanding of his teachings. ***The paraphrased paragraphs are in my words and from my viewpoint because it is how I have interpreted his teachings*** If you disagree that’s totally okay and I’m keen to hear other people’s view points too!! But I hope this helps anyone who may need it 🫶🏼 Anything in quotations is Neville in his book and anything with a 🌸 is my interpretation of it.

……

“Dr. Millikan wrote his dream of greatness and security in the first person, present tense. He did not say, “I will be great; I will be secure,” for that would have implied that he was not great and secure. Instead, he made his future dream a present fact. “I have,” said he, “a lavish, steady, dependable income, consistent with integrity and mutual benefit.” The future dream must become a present fact in the mind of him who seeks to realize it. We must experience in imagination what we would experience in reality in the event we achieved our goal, for the soul imagining itself into a situation takes on the results of that imaginary act. If it does not imagine itself into a situation, it is ever free of the result.”

🌸Anything you desire you must speak it as the present tense
🌸Dr Millikan came from nothing and changes his whole life by writing a simple statement in the present tense and just repeating it over and over again 
🌸Therefore if we write our desires in the present tense and repeat them over and over until we have no choice but to believe it our desires should then become our reality 


“we must recognize that the universe understood internally is an infinite series of levels and man is what he is according to where he is in that series. As we are lifted up in consciousness, our world reshapes itself in harmony with the level to which we are lifted.”

🌸I take this as the higher the level, the quicker the manifestations come in
🌸For example, if we want a peaceful and happy life we have to go up levels until we match with peace and happiness and then it’ll take shape within our 3D

“To change the present state we, like Dr. Millikan, must rise to a higher level of consciousness. This rise is accomplished by affirming that we are already that which we want to be by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. The drama of life is a psychological one which we bring to pass by our attitudes rather than by our acts. There is no escape from our present predicament except by a radical psychological transformation. Everything depends upon our attitude towards ourselves. That which we will not affirm as true of ourselves will not develop in our lives.”

🌸To go up in levels, all that is required of us is to affirm that we are already on that level and we can do that by assuming what we want is already happening or happened 
🌸Acts don’t matter, attitude does 
🌸To eradicate the current unfavourable circumstances (3P’s, rejection, debt etc) we must have a psychological transformation
🌸By psychological transformation he means to affirm in the wish fulfilled and go up levels and ignore the old story completely because things we don’t affirm don’t develop 


“A meek man is a self-disciplined man. He is so disciplined he sees only the finest, he thinks only the best. He is the one who fulfills the suggestion. We rise to a higher level of consciousness, not because we have curbed our passions, but because we have cultivated our virtues. In truth, a meek man is a man in complete control of his moods, and his moods are the highest, for he knows he must keep a high mood if he would walk with the highest.”

🌸We must practice restraint and patience and be FUSSY about how we react to things and what we let impact our moods 
🌸Moods define states which defines our lives so ensure we are not being affected by the 3D and letting it interfere with our feelings and moods of having our desires ✨become the master of your mind and moods✨


“If you are observant, you will notice the swift echo or response to your every mood in this message and you will be able to key it to the circumstances of your daily life. When we are certain of the relationship of mood to circumstance in our lives, we welcome what befalls us. We know that all we meet is part of ourselves. In the creation of a new life, we must begin at the beginning, with a change of mood.”

🌸I guess this is true, it’s like in the secret (documentary not book) where they mention getting out of bed and stubbing your toe and then your whole day goes wrong…. Ever been in a bad mood and then others reflect it back to you and your day gets worse? I have. I think this is what is meant here 
🌸If we change our mood our life will change to align with our mood 

“It is natural for us to seek a more beautiful personal life; it is right that we wish for greater understanding, greater health, greater security.”

🌸This makes me feel less guilty because a lot of our desires are for personal gain. Neville is saying that it’s only natural for us to want a better life 


“I have always preached self-help, knowing that if we strive passionately after this kind of self-help, that is, to embody a new and higher concept of ourselves, then all other kinds of help will be at our service.”

🌸Healing begins and ends with us, if we help ourselves by embodying new states and improving our self concept, other doors and means of help will begin to open 
🌸This resonates with me badly as if I’m in a rut I DROWN myself in it and find it hard to practice manifestation and do self-concept work, but when I do it things do start  start for me mentally 
🌸TIP💡 when I’m in my rut, practicing gratitude is usually what gets me out of it, start with a small list and grow it from there and in no time it’ll make a huge difference I promise 


“The ideal we serve and hope to achieve is ready for a new incarnation; but unless we offer it human parentage it is incapable of birth. We must affirm that we are already that which we hope to be and live as though we were, knowing like Dr. Millikan, that our assumption, though false to the outer world, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”

🌸What we want is already out there in the quantum field but without matching our human selves to it, it has no way of taking shape in our 3D
🌸To match to our desires we must affirm that we already have are are what we want and live as though it’s happened or happening and then PERSIST in that assumption until it shows up 

“The perfect man judges not after appearances; he judges righteously. He sees himself and others as he desires himself and them to be. He hears what he wants to hear. He sees and hears only the good. He knows the truth, and the truth sets him free and leads him too good. The truth shall set all mankind free. This is our spiritual revival. Character is largely the result of the direction and persistence of voluntary attention.”

🌸Basically if you want someone else to change, you just have to see them how you want them to be, see them as all the good you want, hear them saying all the good you want 
🌸The real truth is not in this ‘reality’ but in consciousness which is the true reality so know who they are because that’s the real truth 
🌸Take your attention away from all their negatives and divert it to their good qualities and traits that you know they possess already 


“No man has too little imagination, but few men have disciplined their imagination. Imagination is itself indestructible. Therein lies the horror of its misuse.”

🌸Everyone has imagination but the minority have mastered disciplining their imagination to wander ONLY to their desires 
🌸When you allow your imagination to take you to negative situations it’s then going to bring those situations into your 3D because imagination creates circumstances (again I’m guilty)
🌸MASTER your imagination; don’t allow it to wonder, direct it


“The imagination, alone, is the means of fulfilling the intention. The man who, at will, can call up whatever image he pleases is, by virtue of the power of his imagination, least of all subjects to caprice.”

🌸When we are imagining; we are living in the state of fulfilment of what we are imagining. Thus, FOCUS on what you’re imagining and don’t aimlessly let your mind wander into negative thought patterns and create arguments or situations that you don’t want


“This young designer took my advice and as she walked to the theater, she imagined a perfect relationship of the producer praising her work and she, in turn, responding with gratitude for his appreciation. This she did morning after morning and in a very short while, she discovered for herself that her own attitude determined the scenery of her existence. The behavior of the producer completely reversed itself. He became the most pleasant professional employer she had encountered. His behavior merely echoed the changes that she had whispered within herself. What she did was by the power of imagination. Her fantasy led his; and she, herself, dictated to him the discourse they eventually had together at the time she was seemingly walking alone.”

🌸In the book the young designer kept having bad outcomes with the producer, Neville said I bet you are talking and arguing with him in your head before you arrive at work and she said she was… he said to change the inner talk to a positive conversation 
🌸She took is advice as stated above and his behaviour towards her completely changed 
🌸This ties in with EIYPO, control the narrative of your relationships with others with positive inner conversations and ensure they’re not negative 


“Don’t blame; only resolve.”

🌸Blaming keeps you stuck, you cave to the thoughts of why is everything happening to me. Resolution is to take ownership and resolve the undesired outcomes ✨I created this and I can just as easily uncreate it✨


“However, your conversation with your friend must be in a manner which does not express the slightest doubt as to the truth of what you imagine that you hear and speak. If you do not control your imagination, you will find that you are hearing and saying all that you formerly heard and said.”

🌸FOCUS. Like really focus because for how your 3D is now is how your thoughts and beliefs have created these circumstances, if you don’t exercise control you will just fall back into your old habitual ways of thinking and thus things will never change. You are the change
🌸Randomly it’s giving me Ghandhi vibes when he said ""be the change you want to see in the world”. I think this ties in nicely and when I googled, it came up with this quote “Ghandhi was revealing a profound spiritual truth that what we see in the world is no more and no less a reflection of what is unseen inside of ourselves.”🤯


“We are creatures of habit; and habit, though not law, acts like the most compelling law in the world …  the great secret is a controlled imagination and a well sustained attention, firmly and repeatedly focused on the object to be accomplished.”

🌸Habits need to be broken because habits have got us to where we are currently and as long as we have those habits our thoughts and imaginations will always revert us back
🌸Break them, form new habits of controlling imaginations/thoughts and persevere until your new habits have replaced the old
🌸Repeatedly reinforce the new beliefs that you have what you desire or already are what you wish to be 


“By imagination, we are all reaping our destinies, whether they be good, bad, or indifferent.”

🌸Our imagination is creating our 3D so ensure we are only imagining the best


“Let us affirm to ourselves that we are what we imagine. If we persist in the assumption that we are what we wish to be, we will become transformed into that which we have imagined ourselves to be.”

🌸Affirm that whatever my imaginations are is what I am 
🌸Persist in that belief 
🌸It will then manifest into my 3D


“Prayer means getting into action mentally. It means holding the attention upon the idea of the wish fulfilled until it fills the mind and crowds all other ideas out of the consciousness.”

🌸To pray is to vision that what you want to grasp is possible so when praying we need to envision that we are already that which we would be asking for
🌸Don’t ask because to ask is to just ask for more of what you don’t have


“Feel yourself into the state of the answered prayer until the state fills the mind and crowds all other states out of your consciousness.”

🌸Basically pray as if it’s been given already


“Prayer is, above all things, easy. Its greatest enemy is effort. The mighty surrenders itself fully only to that which is most gentle. The wealth of Heaven may not be seized by a strong will, but surrenders itself, a free gift, to the God-spent moment. Along the lines of least resistance travel spiritual as well as physical forces..”

🌸Along the lines of least resistance, effort is the enemy… these things suggest that we should not try to force it or control it, just feel it and relax with a sense of knowing 


“We must persist until we succeed in imagining ourselves into the situation of the answered prayer. The secret of success is found in the word “perseverance.” The soul imagining itself into the act, takes on the results of the act. Not imagining itself into the act, it is ever free from the result. Experience in imagination what you would experience in reality were you already what you want to be, and you will take on the result of that act. Do not experience in imagination what you want to experience in reality, and you will ever be free of the result. “When ye pray, believe that ye receive, and ye shall receive.” One must persist until he reaches his friend on a higher level of consciousness. He must persist until his feeling of the wish fulfilled has all the sensory vividness of reality.”

🌸It’s okay to fail, but persist until we succeed in imagining ourselves in the the desired state/scene. Perseverance = success
🌸The soul imagining the acts brings results of the act and by not imagining the acts it is free from results (to get something, imagine it. To get rid of something, remove all imaginations of it)
🌸Make the imaginations vivid, include your senses so that it FEELS real because it is

“Steadying attention makes no call upon any special faculty, but it does demand control of imagination. We must extend our senses observe our changed relationship to our world and trust this observation. The new world is not there to grasp, but to sense, to touch. The best way to observe it is to be intensely aware of it. In other words, we can, by listening as though we heard and by looking as though we saw, actually hear voices and see scenes from within ourselves that are otherwise not audible or visible. With our attention focused on the state desired, the outer world crumbles and then the world like music by a new setting, turns all its discords into harmonies.”

🌸Basically, be delusional AF 
🌸Don’t just imagine but imagine as if you’re in this new state, sense it, touch it, listen and look from it as if you’ve heard and seen what you would have (what would people be saying about you or to you? what would you look like and how would others look at you? Play out those scenarios). Be intensely aware that this imagination is literally REAL
🌸Focus all your attention on that and the outer world must conform it


“Meditation, as in every art or expression, requires constant practice for perfect results.”

🌸You won’t perfect meditation unless you are consistent with practicing it


“If we practice daily with joy in this daily habit, we perfect it as an art. I find that those who complain of the difficulty in meditation do not make it a daily practice, but rather, wait until something pressing appears in their world and then, through an act of will, try to fix their attention on the desired state.”

🌸Guiltyyyyyyyy🫣


“All that meditation amounts to is a controlled imagination and a well sustained attention. Simply hold the attention on a certain idea until it fills the mind and crowds all other ideas out of consciousness. The power of attention shows itself the sure guarantee of an inner force. We must concentrate on the idea to be realized, without permitting any distraction. This is the great secret of action. Should the attention wander, bring it back to the idea you wish to realize and do so again and again, until the attention becomes immobilized and undergoes an effortless fixation upon the idea presented to it.”

🌸Through meditation we are able to control our imagination better which will only help us with getting shifts in the 3D
🌸The attention may wonder but you must be keep bringing it back until you are fixed in the imagination of your desire, this is where practice comes in because we will then be able to do this easily and effortlessly 


“Meditation, like sleep, is an entrance into the subconscious.”

🌸Meditation helps you imprint your subconscious which again leads to faster results because the subconscious expresses to the conscious what we impress upon on it and the conscious accepts it as true and objectifies it


“Meditation is an illusion of sleep which diminishes the impression of the outer world and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion from within. The mind in meditation is in a state of relaxation akin to the feeling attained just before dropping off to sleep.”

🌸Meditation and SATS work in similar ways by helping us embody the states of our desires through imagination and directly impressing the subconscious 


“Close your eyes and imagine that you are sleepy, so sleepy, and so very sleepy. Act precisely as though you were going to take a siesta. In so doing, you allow the subconscious tide to rise to sufficient height to make your particular assumption effective. When you first attempt this, you may find that all sorts of counter-thoughts try to distract you, but if you persist, you will achieve a passive state. When this passive state is reached, think only on “things of good report” imagine that you are now expressing your highest ideal, not how you will express it, but simply feel Here and Now that you are the noble one you desire to be. You are it now. Call your high ideal into being by imagining and feeling you are it now.”

🌸Basically, don’t let those thoughts run wild, refocus and keep persisting and eventually you will hit that passive state and when there imagine your desires. 
🌸Don’t think of how you’re going to express it, just feel it as if you’re already there


“Having witnessed the end in your meditation, regardless of any anti-climatic state you encounter, you remain calm and secure in the knowledge that the end has been perfectly defined.”

🌸When you wake from your meditation and you think ‘I’m back to reality’ and start searching your 3D, DON’T DO THAT. Just relax and trust it’s all done and go about life knowing that it’s already done 


“Listen to it carefully. “What seems to be, is, to those to whom it seems to be.” That is certainly clear enough. It is a simple truth about the law of assumption, and a warning of the consequences of its misuse.”

🌸Whatever you assume is literally the truth
🌸This is a warning from Neville because actually if you think about where you are now you can probably see what your past assumptions have been
🌸So basically assume you’re the most IT girl/boy, BADDIE, magical, popular, fairy, godly creature who has everything they want and people are drawn to (if that doesn’t tickle your fancy, change it, but you get the gist)


“‘What you see when you look at something depends not so much on what is there as on the assumption you make when you look. What you believe to be the real physical world is actually only an assumptive world.” In other words, you would not define your husband in the same way that you mother would. Yet, you are both defining the same person. Your particular relationship to a thing influences your feelings with respect to that thing and makes you see in it an element which is not there.”

🌸Pretty much, if you assume your bestie is jealous and nasty and spoilt that’s what YOU get, but to someone else she’s probably the most kind hearted person because THEY assume she is, so she is
🌸Same with, if you assume you’re never wanted, nobody’s first choice, everyone leaves you then that’s what always happens because that’s your assumption of yourself 
🌸Change your assumption = change your 3D circumstances 
🌸Damn I got a lot of work to do🙄 Better get cracking😅😅


“When, through concentrated attention, our desire appears to possess the distinctness and feeling of reality; when the form of thought is as vivid as the form of nature, we have given it the right to become a visible fact in our lives. Each man must find the means best suited to his nature to control his attention and concentrate it on the desired state. I find for myself the best state to be one of meditation, a relaxed state akin to sleep, but a state in which I am still consciously in control of my imagination and capable of fixing my attention on a mental object.”

🌸For everyone stressing about doing SATS incorrectly, he’s literally saying here that you need to find the method that’s best suited to you; whether it be meditation or daydreaming… I’m probs a daydreamer 
🌸But once you’ve fixed the desire into your imagination so much that it literally feels like reality (3D) or I guess maybe a memory then that’s when you’ve nailed it


“If it is difficult to control the direction of your attention while in this state akin to sleep, you may find gazing fixedly into an object very helpful. Do not look at its surface, but rather into and beyond any plain object such as a wall, a carpet or any object which possesses depth. Arrange it to return as little reflection as possible. Imagine, then, that in this depth you are seeing and hearing what you want to see and hear until your attention is exclusively occupied by the imagined state.”

🌸The daydreamer method I suppose this would be, focus on an object but zoom out from it so your attention is elsewhere (you know when you’re talking to someone but can tell their somewhere else, it’s that you need to try do and imagine when doing it)


“if you remain faithful to your vision this sustained mental attitude will give reality to your visions and they will become visible concrete facts in your world.”

🌸Stick with your imagination and use that imagined state to set your mental attitude, how are you feeling if you have what you want? Feel like it then 


“You will know when you have succeeded in fixing the desired state in consciousness simply by looking mentally at the people you know. This is a wonderful check on yourself as your mental conversations are more revealing than your physical conversations are. If, in your mental conversations with others, you talk with them as you formerly did, then you have not changed your concept of self, for all changes of concepts of self-result in a changed relationship to the world. Remember what was said earlier, “What you see when you look at something depends not so much on what is there as on the assumption you make when you look.” Therefore, the assumption of the wish fulfilled should make you see the world mentally as you would physically were your assumption a physical fact.”

🌸Change in self concept is the starting point, once you’ve changed your self concept, the inner conversations you have with others will be unfamiliar and you’ll know then that you’re succeeding at changing your self concept (example of this: “I can’t believe he was so rude, why is he always so rude to me” — old concept. “That was rude. Nobodies ever rude to me, he must just be having a bad day, hope his day gets better” — new concept)
🌸Changing your concept will change your relationship to the world, because it shows you’re firm in your beliefs
🌸That person in my example, has now come and apologised and explained he was having a bad day, and he brought you coffee …. WHY? Because you’ve changed your concept, get it????


“I wish to stress the importance of a real transformation of self not merely a slight alteration of circumstances which, in a matter of moments, will permit us to slip back into the old, dissatisfied man. In your meditation, allow others to see you as they would see you were this new concept of self a concrete fact. You always seem to others the embodiment of the ideal you inspire. Therefore, in meditation, when you contemplate others, you must be seen by them mentally as you would be seen by them physically were your conception of yourself an objective fact. That is, in meditation, you imagine that they see you expressing this nobler man you desire to be. If you assume that you are what you want to be, your desire is fulfilled and, in fulfillment, all longing “to be” is neutralized. This, also, is an excellent check on yourself as to whether or not you have actually succeeded in changing self. You cannot continue desiring what has been realized. Rather, you are in a mood to give thanks for a gift received. Your desire is not something you labor to fulfill; it is recognizing something you already possess. It is assuming the feeling of being that which you desire to be.”

🌸Transform don’t tweak, if you tweak you’ll slip back and revert back into the place you’ve always been. Permanent changes equal permanent results, it’s a lifelong commitment 
🌸How do you want to look? 2 stone lighter? Happier? Wealthier? In love? When you’re in any of the states you use to imagine, be sure to view yourself from others perspectives as what you want to be because you’re assuming you already are so you are!!
🌸Listen and hear everyone saying about you or to you in your imagined scenes - “Woah, she looks like she’s lost 2 stone” “She’s glowing from the inside out, she seems so happy”“I love her new car, wonder how she got the money to buy that” “Look how in love she is, I’m so happy she found someone who treats her so well”
🌸This allows you to feel your desire as fulfilled which takes away the wanting of it because it lets you acknowledge you ARE IT


“We can think about something forever and never see it in our world, but once let us feel its reality, and we are bound to encounter it. The more intensely we feel, the sooner we will encounter it.”

🌸Thinking isn’t serving you, feel it as if it’s happened and the more intense and real those feelings the quicker it will come 


“An idea which is only an idea produces nothing and does nothing. It acts only if it is felt if it is accompanied by effective feeling.”

🌸Attach assumptions to your ideas, then attach the feelings associated with the assumptions 


“Recognizing the power of feeling, let us pay strict attention to our moods and attitudes. Every stage of man’s progress is made through the exercise of his imagination and feeling. By creating an “ideal” within our mental sphere we can feel ourselves into this “ideal image” till we become one and the same with it, absorbing its qualities into the very core of our being.”

🌸Moods matter, if you were in the ideal state you wouldn’t let your mood be affecting my your current 3D because it wouldn’t be happening so park that, get into mood of having your desires and stay there. Become unphased by the 3D, I’d also say don’t let others impact your moods, be the sole creator of your moods (written by a PMS girly who is never in control of her moods😅 but we’re letting go of that)


“Everything depends upon man’s attitude toward himself. That which he cannot or will not claim as true of himself can never evolve in his world. Man is constantly looking about his world and asking, “What’s to be done? What will happen?” when he should ask himself “Who am I? What is my concept of myself?” If we wish to see the world a finer, greater place, we must affirm the reality of a finer, greater being within ourselves.”

🌸Self-concept is EVERYTHING


“I am trying to show you how the inner man must readjust himself what must be the new premise of his life, in order that he may lose his soul on the level he now knows and find it again on the high level he seeks.”

🌸Again, Neville is literally trying to tell us that in order to move to another level we must leave this level by ditching our old story because it isn’t serving us and REWRITE the story of ourselves, then we embody that


“I believe it is what a man is in his solitude. In our solitude we are driven too subjective experience. It is, then, that we should imagine ourselves to be the ideal man we desire to see embodied in the world. If, in our solitude, we experience in our imagination what we would experience in reality had we achieved our goal, we will in time, become transformed into the image of our ideal.”

🌸Distraction with doom scrolling or whatever else isn’t serving us, when alone don’t distract, really be in your space and the solitude to reframe all your beliefs and emotions to line up with our ideal state and imagine our desires as reality 


“The end of longing is always to be not to do. Be still and know “I am that which I desire.” Strive always after being. External reforms are useless if your heart is not reformed.”

🌸You don’t yearn or desire for what you have so don’t 
🌸Just be knowing you are or have…. 


“Old habits of thinking and feeling like dead oak leaves hang on till they are pushed off by new ones. Creativeness is basically a deeper receptiveness, a keener susceptibility. The future dream must become a present fact in the mind of anyone who would alter his life.”

🌸You can’t get rid of old habits without a replacement so create the replacements and watch the old ones fall away as your new ones bring your desires into the 3D

“Again, I must repeat, in the creation of a new way of life, we must begin at the very beginning with our own individual regeneration.”

🌸Let the old you die, you are to be reborn as your new self, with new beliefs, thoughts, attitudes and someone who is already the version you desired to be with the things you desired to have 


“Everything happens all that befalls man all that is done by him, all that comes from him all this happens, and it happens in exactly the same way that rain falls as a result of a change in the temperature in the higher regions of the atmosphere. This is a challenge to us all. What concept are we holding of ourselves in the higher regions of our soul? A change of concept of self is the right adjustment, the new relationship between the surface and the depth of man.”

🌸AGAIN, self-concept!!!!!
🌸FYI for anyone needing help “self-concept refers to your deeply held beliefs and assumptions about yourself, shaping your perception of what you are and what you deserve. It's the core of your identity and influences your reality by dictating what you attract and experience. A strong self-concept can make manifestation easier, while a weak one might hinder it” - AI 


“Life demands of us the willingness to die and to be born again. This is not meant that we die in the flesh. We die in the spirit of the old man to become the new man, then we see the new man in the flesh.”

🌸Literally what I said above, let the old you die (r.i.p) but not really, what you need is to let the old you go and be reborn 🩷

“Dr. Millikan wrote his dream of greatness and security in the first person, present tense. He did not say, “I will be great; I will be secure,” for that would have implied that he was not great and secure. Instead, he made his future dream a present fact. “I have,” said he, “a lavish, steady, dependable income, consistent with integrity and mutual benefit.” The future dream must become a present fact in the mind of him who seeks to realize it. We must experience in imagination what we would experience in reality in the event we achieved our goal, for the soul imagining itself into a situation takes on the results of that imaginary act. If it does not imagine itself into a situation, it is ever free of the result.”

🌸Anything you desire you must speak it as the present tense
🌸Dr Millikan came from nothing and changes his whole life by writing a simple statement in the present tense and just repeating it over and over again 
🌸Therefore if we write our desires in the present tense and repeat them over and over until we have no choice but to believe it our desires should then become our reality 


“we must recognize that the universe understood internally is an infinite series of levels and man is what he is according to where he is in that series. As we are lifted up in consciousness, our world reshapes itself in harmony with the level to which we are lifted.”

🌸I take this as the higher the level, the quicker the manifestations come in
🌸For example, if we want a peaceful and happy life we have to go up levels until we match with peace and happiness and then it’ll take shape within our 3D

“To change the present state we, like Dr. Millikan, must rise to a higher level of consciousness. This rise is accomplished by affirming that we are already that which we want to be by assuming the feeling of the wish fulfilled. The drama of life is a psychological one which we bring to pass by our attitudes rather than by our acts. There is no escape from our present predicament except by a radical psychological transformation. Everything depends upon our attitude towards ourselves. That which we will not affirm as true of ourselves will not develop in our lives.”

🌸To go up in levels, all that is required of us is to affirm that we are already on that level and we can do that by assuming what we want is already happening or happened 
🌸Acts don’t matter, attitude does 
🌸To eradicate the current unfavourable circumstances (3P’s, rejection, debt etc) we must have a psychological transformation
🌸By psychological transformation he means to affirm in the wish fulfilled and go up levels and ignore the old story completely because things we don’t affirm don’t develop 


“A meek man is a self-disciplined man. He is so disciplined he sees only the finest, he thinks only the best. He is the one who fulfills the suggestion. We rise to a higher level of consciousness, not because we have curbed our passions, but because we have cultivated our virtues. In truth, a meek man is a man in complete control of his moods, and his moods are the highest, for he knows he must keep a high mood if he would walk with the highest.”

🌸We must practice restraint and patience and be FUSSY about how we react to things and what we let impact our moods 
🌸Moods define states which defines our lives so ensure we are not being affected by the 3D and letting it interfere with our feelings and moods of having our desires ✨become the master of your mind and moods✨


“If you are observant, you will notice the swift echo or response to your every mood in this message and you will be able to key it to the circumstances of your daily life. When we are certain of the relationship of mood to circumstance in our lives, we welcome what befalls us. We know that all we meet is part of ourselves. In the creation of a new life, we must begin at the beginning, with a change of mood.”

🌸I guess this is true, it’s like in the secret (documentary not book) where they mention getting out of bed and stubbing your toe and then your whole day goes wrong…. Ever been in a bad mood and then others reflect it back to you and your day gets worse? I have. I think this is what is meant here 
🌸If we change our mood our life will change to align with our mood 

“It is natural for us to seek a more beautiful personal life; it is right that we wish for greater understanding, greater health, greater security.”

🌸This makes me feel less guilty because a lot of our desires are for personal gain. Neville is saying that it’s only natural for us to want a better life 


“I have always preached self-help, knowing that if we strive passionately after this kind of self-help, that is, to embody a new and higher concept of ourselves, then all other kinds of help will be at our service.”

🌸Healing begins and ends with us, if we help ourselves by embodying new states and improving our self concept, other doors and means of help will begin to open 
🌸This resonates with me badly as if I’m in a rut I DROWN myself in it and find it hard to practice manifestation and do self-concept work, but when I do it things do start  start for me mentally 
🌸TIP💡 when I’m in my rut, practicing gratitude is usually what gets me out of it, start with a small list and grow it from there and in no time it’ll make a huge difference I promise 


“The ideal we serve and hope to achieve is ready for a new incarnation; but unless we offer it human parentage it is incapable of birth. We must affirm that we are already that which we hope to be and live as though we were, knowing like Dr. Millikan, that our assumption, though false to the outer world, if persisted in, will harden into fact.”

🌸What we want is already out there in the quantum field but without matching our human selves to it, it has no way of taking shape in our 3D
🌸To match to our desires we must affirm that we already have are are what we want and live as though it’s happened or happening and then PERSIST in that assumption until it shows up 

“The perfect man judges not after appearances; he judges righteously. He sees himself and others as he desires himself and them to be. He hears what he wants to hear. He sees and hears only the good. He knows the truth, and the truth sets him free and leads him too good. The truth shall set all mankind free. This is our spiritual revival. Character is largely the result of the direction and persistence of voluntary attention.”

🌸Basically if you want someone else to change, you just have to see them how you want them to be, see them as all the good you want, hear them saying all the good you want 
🌸The real truth is not in this ‘reality’ but in consciousness which is the true reality so know who they are because that’s the real truth 
🌸Take your attention away from all their negatives and divert it to their good qualities and traits that you know they possess already 


“No man has too little imagination, but few men have disciplined their imagination. Imagination is itself indestructible. Therein lies the horror of its misuse.”

🌸Everyone has imagination but the minority have mastered disciplining their imagination to wander ONLY to their desires 
🌸When you allow your imagination to take you to negative situations it’s then going to bring those situations into your 3D because imagination creates circumstances (again I’m guilty)
🌸MASTER your imagination; don’t allow it to wonder, direct it


“The imagination, alone, is the means of fulfilling the intention. The man who, at will, can call up whatever image he pleases is, by virtue of the power of his imagination, least of all subjects to caprice.”

🌸When we are imagining; we are living in the state of fulfilment of what we are imagining. Thus, FOCUS on what you’re imagining and don’t aimlessly let your mind wander into negative thought patterns and create arguments or situations that you don’t want


“This young designer took my advice and as she walked to the theater, she imagined a perfect relationship of the producer praising her work and she, in turn, responding with gratitude for his appreciation. This she did morning after morning and in a very short while, she discovered for herself that her own attitude determined the scenery of her existence. The behavior of the producer completely reversed itself. He became the most pleasant professional employer she had encountered. His behavior merely echoed the changes that she had whispered within herself. What she did was by the power of imagination. Her fantasy led his; and she, herself, dictated to him the discourse they eventually had together at the time she was seemingly walking alone.”

🌸In the book the young designer kept having bad outcomes with the producer, Neville said I bet you are talking and arguing with him in your head before you arrive at work and she said she was… he said to change the inner talk to a positive conversation 
🌸She took is advice as stated above and his behaviour towards her completely changed 
🌸This ties in with EIYPO, control the narrative of your relationships with others with positive inner conversations and ensure they’re not negative 


“Don’t blame; only resolve.”

🌸Blaming keeps you stuck, you cave to the thoughts of why is everything happening to me. Resolution is to take ownership and resolve the undesired outcomes ✨I created this and I can just as easily uncreate it✨


“However, your conversation with your friend must be in a manner which does not express the slightest doubt as to the truth of what you imagine that you hear and speak. If you do not control your imagination, you will find that you are hearing and saying all that you formerly heard and said.”

🌸FOCUS. Like really focus because for how your 3D is now is how your thoughts and beliefs have created these circumstances, if you don’t exercise control you will just fall back into your old habitual ways of thinking and thus things will never change. You are the change
🌸Randomly it’s giving me Ghandhi vibes when he said ""be the change you want to see in the world”. I think this ties in nicely and when I googled, it came up with this quote “Ghandhi was revealing a profound spiritual truth that what we see in the world is no more and no less a reflection of what is unseen inside of ourselves.”🤯


“We are creatures of habit; and habit, though not law, acts like the most compelling law in the world …  the great secret is a controlled imagination and a well sustained attention, firmly and repeatedly focused on the object to be accomplished.”

🌸Habits need to be broken because habits have got us to where we are currently and as long as we have those habits our thoughts and imaginations will always revert us back
🌸Break them, form new habits of controlling imaginations/thoughts and persevere until your new habits have replaced the old
🌸Repeatedly reinforce the new beliefs that you have what you desire or already are what you wish to be 


“By imagination, we are all reaping our destinies, whether they be good, bad, or indifferent.”

🌸Our imagination is creating our 3D so ensure we are only imagining the best


“Let us affirm to ourselves that we are what we imagine. If we persist in the assumption that we are what we wish to be, we will become transformed into that which we have imagined ourselves to be.”

🌸Affirm that whatever my imaginations are is what I am 
🌸Persist in that belief 
🌸It will then manifest into my 3D


“Prayer means getting into action mentally. It means holding the attention upon the idea of the wish fulfilled until it fills the mind and crowds all other ideas out of the consciousness.”

🌸To pray is to vision that what you want to grasp is possible so when praying we need to envision that we are already that which we would be asking for
🌸Don’t ask because to ask is to just ask for more of what you don’t have


“Feel yourself into the state of the answered prayer until the state fills the mind and crowds all other states out of your consciousness.”

🌸Basically pray as if it’s been given already


“Prayer is, above all things, easy. Its greatest enemy is effort. The mighty surrenders itself fully only to that which is most gentle. The wealth of Heaven may not be seized by a strong will, but surrenders itself, a free gift, to the God-spent moment. Along the lines of least resistance travel spiritual as well as physical forces..”

🌸Along the lines of least resistance, effort is the enemy… these things suggest that we should not try to force it or control it, just feel it and relax with a sense of knowing 


“We must persist until we succeed in imagining ourselves into the situation of the answered prayer. The secret of success is found in the word “perseverance.” The soul imagining itself into the act, takes on the results of the act. Not imagining itself into the act, it is ever free from the result. Experience in imagination what you would experience in reality were you already what you want to be, and you will take on the result of that act. Do not experience in imagination what you want to experience in reality, and you will ever be free of the result. “When ye pray, believe that ye receive, and ye shall receive.” One must persist until he reaches his friend on a higher level of consciousness. He must persist until his feeling of the wish fulfilled has all the sensory vividness of reality.”

🌸It’s okay to fail, but persist until we succeed in imagining ourselves in the the desired state/scene. Perseverance = success
🌸The soul imagining the acts brings results of the act and by not imagining the acts it is free from results (to get something, imagine it. To get rid of something, remove all imaginations of it)
🌸Make the imaginations vivid, include your senses so that it FEELS real because it is

“Steadying attention makes no call upon any special faculty, but it does demand control of imagination. We must extend our senses observe our changed relationship to our world and trust this observation. The new world is not there to grasp, but to sense, to touch. The best way to observe it is to be intensely aware of it. In other words, we can, by listening as though we heard and by looking as though we saw, actually hear voices and see scenes from within ourselves that are otherwise not audible or visible. With our attention focused on the state desired, the outer world crumbles and then the world like music by a new setting, turns all its discords into harmonies.”

🌸Basically, be delusional AF 
🌸Don’t just imagine but imagine as if you’re in this new state, sense it, touch it, listen and look from it as if you’ve heard and seen what you would have (what would people be saying about you or to you? what would you look like and how would others look at you? Play out those scenarios). Be intensely aware that this imagination is literally REAL
🌸Focus all your attention on that and the outer world must conform it


“Meditation, as in every art or expression, requires constant practice for perfect results.”

🌸You won’t perfect meditation unless you are consistent with practicing it


“If we practice daily with joy in this daily habit, we perfect it as an art. I find that those who complain of the difficulty in meditation do not make it a daily practice, but rather, wait until something pressing appears in their world and then, through an act of will, try to fix their attention on the desired state.”

🌸Guiltyyyyyyyy🫣


“All that meditation amounts to is a controlled imagination and a well sustained attention. Simply hold the attention on a certain idea until it fills the mind and crowds all other ideas out of consciousness. The power of attention shows itself the sure guarantee of an inner force. We must concentrate on the idea to be realized, without permitting any distraction. This is the great secret of action. Should the attention wander, bring it back to the idea you wish to realize and do so again and again, until the attention becomes immobilized and undergoes an effortless fixation upon the idea presented to it.”

🌸Through meditation we are able to control our imagination better which will only help us with getting shifts in the 3D
🌸The attention may wonder but you must be keep bringing it back until you are fixed in the imagination of your desire, this is where practice comes in because we will then be able to do this easily and effortlessly 


“Meditation, like sleep, is an entrance into the subconscious.”

🌸Meditation helps you imprint your subconscious which again leads to faster results because the subconscious expresses to the conscious what we impress upon on it and the conscious accepts it as true and objectifies it


“Meditation is an illusion of sleep which diminishes the impression of the outer world and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion from within. The mind in meditation is in a state of relaxation akin to the feeling attained just before dropping off to sleep.”

🌸Meditation and SATS work in similar ways by helping us embody the states of our desires through imagination and directly impressing the subconscious 


“Close your eyes and imagine that you are sleepy, so sleepy, and so very sleepy. Act precisely as though you were going to take a siesta. In so doing, you allow the subconscious tide to rise to sufficient height to make your particular assumption effective. When you first attempt this, you may find that all sorts of counter-thoughts try to distract you, but if you persist, you will achieve a passive state. When this passive state is reached, think only on “things of good report” imagine that you are now expressing your highest ideal, not how you will express it, but simply feel Here and Now that you are the noble one you desire to be. You are it now. Call your high ideal into being by imagining and feeling you are it now.”

🌸Basically, don’t let those thoughts run wild, refocus and keep persisting and eventually you will hit that passive state and when there imagine your desires. 
🌸Don’t think of how you’re going to express it, just feel it as if you’re already there


“Having witnessed the end in your meditation, regardless of any anti-climatic state you encounter, you remain calm and secure in the knowledge that the end has been perfectly defined.”

🌸When you wake from your meditation and you think ‘I’m back to reality’ and start searching your 3D, DON’T DO THAT. Just relax and trust it’s all done and go about life knowing that it’s already done 


“Listen to it carefully. “What seems to be, is, to those to whom it seems to be.” That is certainly clear enough. It is a simple truth about the law of assumption, and a warning of the consequences of its misuse.”

🌸Whatever you assume is literally the truth
🌸This is a warning from Neville because actually if you think about where you are now you can probably see what your past assumptions have been
🌸So basically assume you’re the most IT girl/boy, BADDIE, magical, popular, fairy, godly creature who has everything they want and people are drawn to (if that doesn’t tickle your fancy, change it, but you get the gist)


“‘What you see when you look at something depends not so much on what is there as on the assumption you make when you look. What you believe to be the real physical world is actually only an assumptive world.” In other words, you would not define your husband in the same way that you mother would. Yet, you are both defining the same person. Your particular relationship to a thing influences your feelings with respect to that thing and makes you see in it an element which is not there.”

🌸Pretty much, if you assume your bestie is jealous and nasty and spoilt that’s what YOU get, but to someone else she’s probably the most kind hearted person because THEY assume she is, so she is
🌸Same with, if you assume you’re never wanted, nobody’s first choice, everyone leaves you then that’s what always happens because that’s your assumption of yourself 
🌸Change your assumption = change your 3D circumstances 
🌸Damn I got a lot of work to do🙄 Better get cracking😅😅


“When, through concentrated attention, our desire appears to possess the distinctness and feeling of reality; when the form of thought is as vivid as the form of nature, we have given it the right to become a visible fact in our lives. Each man must find the means best suited to his nature to control his attention and concentrate it on the desired state. I find for myself the best state to be one of meditation, a relaxed state akin to sleep, but a state in which I am still consciously in control of my imagination and capable of fixing my attention on a mental object.”

🌸For everyone stressing about doing SATS incorrectly, he’s literally saying here that you need to find the method that’s best suited to you; whether it be meditation or daydreaming… I’m probs a daydreamer 
🌸But once you’ve fixed the desire into your imagination so much that it literally feels like reality (3D) or I guess maybe a memory then that’s when you’ve nailed it


“If it is difficult to control the direction of your attention while in this state akin to sleep, you may find gazing fixedly into an object very helpful. Do not look at its surface, but rather into and beyond any plain object such as a wall, a carpet or any object which possesses depth. Arrange it to return as little reflection as possible. Imagine, then, that in this depth you are seeing and hearing what you want to see and hear until your attention is exclusively occupied by the imagined state.”

🌸The daydreamer method I suppose this would be, focus on an object but zoom out from it so your attention is elsewhere (you know when you’re talking to someone but can tell their somewhere else, it’s that you need to try do and imagine when doing it)


“if you remain faithful to your vision this sustained mental attitude will give reality to your visions and they will become visible concrete facts in your world.”

🌸Stick with your imagination and use that imagined state to set your mental attitude, how are you feeling if you have what you want? Feel like it then 


“You will know when you have succeeded in fixing the desired state in consciousness simply by looking mentally at the people you know. This is a wonderful check on yourself as your mental conversations are more revealing than your physical conversations are. If, in your mental conversations with others, you talk with them as you formerly did, then you have not changed your concept of self, for all changes of concepts of self-result in a changed relationship to the world. Remember what was said earlier, “What you see when you look at something depends not so much on what is there as on the assumption you make when you look.” Therefore, the assumption of the wish fulfilled should make you see the world mentally as you would physically were your assumption a physical fact.”

🌸Change in self concept is the starting point, once you’ve changed your self concept, the inner conversations you have with others will be unfamiliar and you’ll know then that you’re succeeding at changing your self concept (example of this: “I can’t believe he was so rude, why is he always so rude to me” — old concept. “That was rude. Nobodies ever rude to me, he must just be having a bad day, hope his day gets better” — new concept)
🌸Changing your concept will change your relationship to the world, because it shows you’re firm in your beliefs
🌸That person in my example, has now come and apologised and explained he was having a bad day, and he brought you coffee …. WHY? Because you’ve changed your concept, get it????


“I wish to stress the importance of a real transformation of self not merely a slight alteration of circumstances which, in a matter of moments, will permit us to slip back into the old, dissatisfied man. In your meditation, allow others to see you as they would see you were this new concept of self a concrete fact. You always seem to others the embodiment of the ideal you inspire. Therefore, in meditation, when you contemplate others, you must be seen by them mentally as you would be seen by them physically were your conception of yourself an objective fact. That is, in meditation, you imagine that they see you expressing this nobler man you desire to be. If you assume that you are what you want to be, your desire is fulfilled and, in fulfillment, all longing “to be” is neutralized. This, also, is an excellent check on yourself as to whether or not you have actually succeeded in changing self. You cannot continue desiring what has been realized. Rather, you are in a mood to give thanks for a gift received. Your desire is not something you labor to fulfill; it is recognizing something you already possess. It is assuming the feeling of being that which you desire to be.”

🌸Transform don’t tweak, if you tweak you’ll slip back and revert back into the place you’ve always been. Permanent changes equal permanent results, it’s a lifelong commitment 
🌸How do you want to look? 2 stone lighter? Happier? Wealthier? In love? When you’re in any of the states you use to imagine, be sure to view yourself from others perspectives as what you want to be because you’re assuming you already are so you are!!
🌸Listen and hear everyone saying about you or to you in your imagined scenes - “Woah, she looks like she’s lost 2 stone” “She’s glowing from the inside out, she seems so happy”“I love her new car, wonder how she got the money to buy that” “Look how in love she is, I’m so happy she found someone who treats her so well”
🌸This allows you to feel your desire as fulfilled which takes away the wanting of it because it lets you acknowledge you ARE IT


“We can think about something forever and never see it in our world, but once let us feel its reality, and we are bound to encounter it. The more intensely we feel, the sooner we will encounter it.”

🌸Thinking isn’t serving you, feel it as if it’s happened and the more intense and real those feelings the quicker it will come 


“An idea which is only an idea produces nothing and does nothing. It acts only if it is felt if it is accompanied by effective feeling.”

🌸Attach assumptions to your ideas, then attach the feelings associated with the assumptions 


“Recognizing the power of feeling, let us pay strict attention to our moods and attitudes. Every stage of man’s progress is made through the exercise of his imagination and feeling. By creating an “ideal” within our mental sphere we can feel ourselves into this “ideal image” till we become one and the same with it, absorbing its qualities into the very core of our being.”

🌸Moods matter, if you were in the ideal state you wouldn’t let your mood be affecting my your current 3D because it wouldn’t be happening so park that, get into mood of having your desires and stay there. Become unphased by the 3D, I’d also say don’t let others impact your moods, be the sole creator of your moods (written by a PMS girly who is never in control of her moods😅 but we’re letting go of that)


“Everything depends upon man’s attitude toward himself. That which he cannot or will not claim as true of himself can never evolve in his world. Man is constantly looking about his world and asking, “What’s to be done? What will happen?” when he should ask himself “Who am I? What is my concept of myself?” If we wish to see the world a finer, greater place, we must affirm the reality of a finer, greater being within ourselves.”

🌸Self-concept is EVERYTHING


“I am trying to show you how the inner man must readjust himself what must be the new premise of his life, in order that he may lose his soul on the level he now knows and find it again on the high level he seeks.”

🌸Again, Neville is literally trying to tell us that in order to move to another level we must leave this level by ditching our old story because it isn’t serving us and REWRITE the story of ourselves, then we embody that


“I believe it is what a man is in his solitude. In our solitude we are driven too subjective experience. It is, then, that we should imagine ourselves to be the ideal man we desire to see embodied in the world. If, in our solitude, we experience in our imagination what we would experience in reality had we achieved our goal, we will in time, become transformed into the image of our ideal.”

🌸Distraction with doom scrolling or whatever else isn’t serving us, when alone don’t distract, really be in your space and the solitude to reframe all your beliefs and emotions to line up with our ideal state and imagine our desires as reality 


“The end of longing is always to be not to do. Be still and know “I am that which I desire.” Strive always after being. External reforms are useless if your heart is not reformed.”

🌸You don’t yearn or desire for what you have so don’t 
🌸Just be knowing you are or have…. 


“Old habits of thinking and feeling like dead oak leaves hang on till they are pushed off by new ones. Creativeness is basically a deeper receptiveness, a keener susceptibility. The future dream must become a present fact in the mind of anyone who would alter his life.”

🌸You can’t get rid of old habits without a replacement so create the replacements and watch the old ones fall away as your new ones bring your desires into the 3D

“Again, I must repeat, in the creation of a new way of life, we must begin at the very beginning with our own individual regeneration.”

🌸Let the old you die, you are to be reborn as your new self, with new beliefs, thoughts, attitudes and someone who is already the version you desired to be with the things you desired to have 


“Everything happens all that befalls man all that is done by him, all that comes from him all this happens, and it happens in exactly the same way that rain falls as a result of a change in the temperature in the higher regions of the atmosphere. This is a challenge to us all. What concept are we holding of ourselves in the higher regions of our soul? A change of concept of self is the right adjustment, the new relationship between the surface and the depth of man.”

🌸AGAIN, self-concept!!!!!
🌸FYI for anyone needing help “self-concept refers to your deeply held beliefs and assumptions about yourself, shaping your perception of what you are and what you deserve. It's the core of your identity and influences your reality by dictating what you attract and experience. A strong self-concept can make manifestation easier, while a weak one might hinder it” - AI 


“Life demands of us the willingness to die and to be born again. This is not meant that we die in the flesh. We die in the spirit of the old man to become the new man, then we see the new man in the flesh.”

🌸Literally what I said above, let the old you die (r.i.p) but not really, what you need is to let the old you go and be reborn 🩷

It was great conversation, funny but not inappropriate, across all kinds of topics. I decided to ask about red flags & his was getting attached too quickly. Which is also mine. While we were talking about this I did my google search of first name + location + any other information. I came across a court date with a full name. I checked that name on Facebook & yes, it matched M38. My next question to him was what's the worst thing you've ever done? I told him I'd been busted shoplifting at 14. He didn't reply for a few minutes but when he did, he started with 'l will be honest...' The short version, he told me he had been in prison for two years for something he did and very much regretted during a dark time in his life. I didn't ask for details, but thanked him for being honest. I didn't ask keep chatting with him, we'd made plans to meet for coffee and I figured after that I could let him know I wasn't feeling it. Except boy howdy I was wrong. We talked for hours over coffee, about everything. I didn't ask details about why he was in prison but he talked about the experience. I left that day knowing damn well I wanted to keep seeing him and his follow up messages told me he felt the same. I never believed in soul mates or love at first sight until that day. We kept chatting for two days before he was due to come see me, but before he came over he said he had to tell me why he was in prison, because it might change everything. 
He spent 14 months in maximum security waiting to be sentenced (didn't ask for bail), then the rest in minimum for 'producing and disseminating' an inappropriate video of a young teen, for someone else. (That person got bail & 5 months).
On the 5th day of knowing him it ended, but I couldn't bring myself to hate him. I hate what he did. But I'm feeling guilty for still having those strong feelings and wanting to be with him. I have a young daughter at home, I can't do that. He understood my decision and wished he had told me sooner. Part of me wants someone to tell me he deserves a second chance, but the bigger part of me needs to know I've made the right choice. It's like that how can it be wrong when it feels so right?

1jywtoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/1jywtoc/a_complicated_cast_of_characters_not_a_story/,A complicated cast of characters [not a story],"Back when I wrote more frequently I'd often recycle characters from one story into another. It started as a way to save time, but I also thought about Kim Newman's shared ""Diogenes Club"" universe, or Rob Rogers' ""Devil's Cape."" I don't know at what point I wanted to have these characters form their own shared universe, but I'd like to think they are now.

Thought I'd do a little Who's-Who glossary of characters who perennially pop up in these stories.

\*\*\*\*

**Abner Malady**: a macabre figure who leads a gang called the Crypt Kickers (consisting of Rico Mortis, Boney, Barry Atchett, and Tommy Rot) who steal from the America's most haunted attractions. I'd intended him as a nod to Dick Tracy's ""Abner Kadaver"" character, but his debut story, [Haunted House Heist](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/ywc1m9/the_haunted_house_heist_part_1/), never got finished properly, denying him his full introduction.

**Cadre of Criminal Conspiracy**: basically the Legion of Doom, they convene in [Strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/piqgl9/strike/) to deal with a labor dispute among the henchmen.

**Chaplin**: a spy, sort of in the vein of James Bond. Named after ""Kaplan,"" the guy who gets mistaken for a spy in *North By Northwest*. He appeared in [Private Intelligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/11acmjg/private_intelligence/) and [Morning At The Coffee Shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/peha6o/morning_at_the_coffee_shop/)

**Craterface**: a diabolical mastermind who has a moonlike face. Think sort of a Sydney Greenstreet type. Sometimes accompanied by henchmen named Pug-Ugly, Clubfinger, Underbite, etc. Based mostly on the goony, oddly-deformed villains of Dick Tracy or James Bond. He appeared in [Private Intelligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/11acmjg/private_intelligence/)

**Dana Gilclyde**: The most ordinary, dare I say unimportant, man on the planet, weirdly BBC-period-drama name notwithstanding. A character who gets swept up into things, rather than someone who makes things happen. Appeared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p8k33h/the_thing_dreams_were_made_of/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/rc34qg/wp_you_are_a_member_of_a_secret_organisation_whos/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/v4s30z/barbarians_at_the_gate/).

**Destiny ""Dez"" Harper**: A young girl who dies in a train wreck that was not fated to happen, she is awareded a magic coin containing all the time unfairly taken from her. She appeared in [Loose Ends](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pdog4d/loose_threads/)

**Dr. Thaddeus Tremblien**: a dignified and sedate paranormal investigator modeled on Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe and DC comics' Baron Winters (with ""Charlie Kovacs"" as his ""Archie""). Appeared in [The Battyscombe Asylum Case](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pqcr20/the_battyscombe_asylum_case/) and was mentioned in [a handful](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pr1ocf/wp_an_eldritch_horror_invades_the_dreams_of_a/) [of other](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/wr8t4g/parole_unfinished/) [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/ywc1m9/the_haunted_house_heist_part_1/). His name comes from a corny old Vincent Price movie, ""The Tingler.""

**Gordon**: A rugged working class guy in the fuuuuuuture, he operates a 'tender pod' that services passing starships. It's a lonely life, so he's usually accompanied by two uplifted dogs named Nannygoat and Major. Named in honor of Flash. Appeared primarily in [Sentience](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p8k4b5/sentience/) and [More Sentience](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/x7syap/more_sentience/).

**Mr. Grandison**: The stern regional manager of Temple Finance, and actually secretly the grandmaster of the Knights Templar, a cult and international banking cartel. Wherever Dana Gilclyde is, Grandison is likely nearby scowling. Seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p8k33h/the_thing_dreams_were_made_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/rc34qg/wp_you_are_a_member_of_a_secret_organisation_whos/)

**Hirsch**: an angel who, for reasons that are his own, is acquainted with a circus owner and helps supernatural orphans fight evil. Appeared in [Greatest Show On Earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p70x4k/greatest_show_on_earth/) and got a few token mentions elsewhere. Also wound up reusing this name for unrelated characters. I just like the sound of it.

**Kahurangi**: a starship captain. In the grand style of sci fi, I made her a woman with a distinctly Pacific Island-style name to give the future sort of a more cosmopolitan feel. Seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p93fj4/wp_a_ghost_spaceship_of_legend_the_arch_is_the/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/q5bvbo/from_wp_on_one_hand_the_new_colony_planet_sucked/).

**Larcan Golden-Tooth/Garrod Larkintongue**: a typical fantasy adventurer who just wants to retire. He suffered the ultimate horrible fate for one in his profession; selling out to the evil overlord's corporate sponsors. Appeared in the never-completed-to-my-satisfaction [Never Just A Quiet Retirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/tcz45z/unfinished_never_just_a_quiet_retirement/) (and [attempt two](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/wv0eo2/never_just_a_quiet_retirement_second_draft/))

**MacBride, Special Agent James Oswald**: a Man In Black sort of figure, tasked with covering things up for the government. Appeared in [Layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p703e6/layoffs/) and [Just Say ""No""](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/ppxwv7/just_say_no/)

**Magsmolly**: the brutal captain of a crew of ruthless space pirates. I like the name; not sure how I came up with it. So far, she's only appeared in [Adrift](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/vjeu78/adrift/).

**Overcaste**: comic book supervillains imbued with elemental abilities, formerly a low-rent punk band. Members include Cindercone (who we saw [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p93ot0/superhero_universe_attempts/)) and Coldsnap ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/piqgl9/strike/)).

**The Prelacy**: an interstellar civilization in the vein of the Federation. Appeared in [Morning At The Coffee Shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/peha6o/morning_at_the_coffee_shop/) and [A Triple Threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/11o9uq9/a_triple_threat_part_1/)

**Professor Quantum** and **General Relativity**: a pair of gentlemanly time travelers who attend the same club, and find themselves having to save history fairly often. They work on behalf of a being called Grandfather Klok. They show up fairly often; [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/tsws4r/unfinished_fish_stories_with_general_relativity/) for one instance.

**Rani**: One of those ""big boss"" type vampires who always turn up in vampire stories. Rani is, of course, Hindi for 'queen.' No relation intended to the Doctor Who character. Appeared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/16448t4/getting_with_the_times/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/tsxihh/slay_mate/)

**Red Rebel**: ""What if instead of dying, James Dean became a Superman-like figure?"" First appeared in stories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/piqgl9/strike/). Forms a trinity with two other figures, who are similarly ""Sal Mineo + Batman"" and ""Natalie Wood + Wonder Woman""

**Richard Sharp/Ryszard Stzelec**: a freelance assassin who goes professionally by ""Deadeye Dick"" (a moniker from Vonnegut, as it happens). Appeared in [Strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/piqgl9/strike/) and again in [Across Space And Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/qoqs54/across_time_and_space/), I'd intended him as a stand-in for the villainous protagonist of the James Bond 'Goldeneye' video game.

**Rocco LaRoche**: a cartoon possum dressed as a stereotypical hobo, with battered top hat, tailcoat and bindle. In the vein of an early, discontinued Looney Tunes character. Appared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p8k33h/the_thing_dreams_were_made_of/).

**Slay Mate**: a mind-obliteratingly drunk Australian who, for reasons of his own, hunts vampires. Appeared in [Slay Mate](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/tsxihh/slay_mate/) and was mentioned in the unfinished [Parole](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/wr8t4g/parole_unfinished/).

**Toymaker**: a strange little man who makes toys; sort of more mystical, less overtly evil take on DC's Toyman. Appeared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/yg6r3n/a_kindly_old_toymaker_and_the_nameless_horrors/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/wiufvv/the_bear/). A second, spaceborne Toymaker, whom I'd intended to be a descendant (and sort of a blend between Blade Runner's JF Sebastian and Red Dwarf's Lister) appears [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/11o9uq9/a_triple_threat_part_1/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/vjeu78/adrift/).

**Watchmaker**: a shady spymaster type, commanding a large network of covert operatives ranging from superspies (like Chaplin) to men in black (like MacBride). Shows up quite a bit, really, and might be my most commonly recurring character.

**The Veil**: a shadowy agency that handles alies and other supernatural nonsense. Featured [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pehax0/from_the_casefiles_of_the_veil/) and were mentioned alongside Slay Mate, Tremblien and other monsters hunters in [Parole](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/wr8t4g/parole_unfinished/)

**Voidrider**: an astronaut monkey who came back superintelligent and decided to conquer Earth. Appeared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/rmm73q/what_we_hear_here_let_it_stay_here/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pcc5b0/monkey_business/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/1dtizxb/a_red_dead_world/).

**Warlock**: an eerie-looking fellow, alibno pale and covered in a wine stain birthmark (similarities to ASOIAF's Bloodraven are coincidental). He has the ability to commune with the dead, but in [Laid To Rest](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p70rpj/laid_to_rest/), he resolves to use this power for good. Different but similar Warlocks appeared in [Full Circle](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/1i5fvqn/full_circle_part_2/), [Where Is Thy Sting](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p70tke/where_is_thy_sting/), and [The Thing Dreams Were Made Of](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p8k33h/the_thing_dreams_were_made_of/). I also implied an alternate take on the character who used his gift for superheroism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/p93ot0/superhero_universe_attempts/) (you are a superhero with the power to heal any injury...)

**Zombie Napoleon**: pretty much what it sounds like. Napoleon became a zombie thanks to a magic potion Robespierre gave him in [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesPlentiful/comments/pjcsci/vive_lempereur/) and proceeded to turn Europe into a realm ruled by the undead, and he's popped up once or twice since.

I'm 22/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.  
  
Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.  
  
Hobbies of mine include:  
Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Veilguard, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Now I'm about 65ish hours into AC Shadows and loving it.  
  
Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsessions are the Terrifier and Smile series.  
  
Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band; it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Jamming out of a lot of 80's rock lately, as well.  
  
Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

I make probably around 25k a year roughly, but that being said I am very good at saving and since I don't sulrge I usually have enough money to cover something fun if I wanted. My friend on the other hand are horrible at saving and will buy a lot of dumb shit so they are constantly broke. Because of this if I really wanted something I would offer to cover the cost for her since I know she wouldn't be able to afford it other wise. Like for example I wanted to try out this restaurant and they said they don't have money to go so I offered to pay the tab (which was a little over $100).

But this leads me to the present; I pay for everything. Gas money? i fully cover it. Im making food? I cover it. we eat out? I cover it. We drink? I pay for all of the alcohol. We go do an activity? I will pay for her. She has never once chipped in for anything in the two years we have been having out except for one time she paid for her own meal. She has never bought me anything.

For me I feel its just the principal, even if it was something as small as bringing a two liter for mixed drinks, if it contributing the same as I am? no, but it at least would show they are making an effort for me. Even if it was her buying me a coffee, I don't know. something. And once she started to ask me to pay for other people is when I realize this has to stop but I don't really know how to go about it. Whenever we go out she will literally just say okay but you're paying for me, its gotten to the point where I feel like I'm paying for her time and I don't like it but I'm not certain how to bring this up without seeming like I'm trying to paint her as though shes only friends with me for the money.

1jywpsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jywpsb/help/,Help,"I (25M) started seeing this girl (20F) back in late December. Our first date was great, instant chemistry, deep conversation, lots of laughs. Things escalated fast after that. We made it official within a couple weeks, and for a short time, it felt like we were both all in. There was real emotional and physical connection she opened up a lot, and I genuinely felt close to her.

But not long after making things official, she started to pull back. She canceled plans once, and I didn’t text her for a few days after that, not out of spite, but because I wasn’t sure how to navigate it. She ended up breaking up with me right after a double date, saying she felt like I had been punishing her with silence. That breakup felt sudden and confusing, like things flipped overnight.

About 11 days later, on Valentine’s Day, she came back. She brought wine, flowers for my mom, and a bracelet she had made for me. She said she missed me and wanted to be official again. I let her back in, fully, no walls. For a while, it felt like we were rebuilding.

But over the next month and a half, the dynamic changed. I was always the one initiating, planning, texting. She started becoming emotionally distant and less physically affectionate. I could feel her pulling back again, but I didn’t know how to stop it. Eventually, she broke up with me a second time, this time more coldly.

After the second breakup, she acted detached, posting stories that felt like they were meant to get under my skin or imply she was seeing someone else. But I stayed calm. A few days later, we met halfway to exchange some stuff, and the energy totally flipped. We got coffee, talked, went for a hike, held hands, kissed. We even made plans in person to go to the drive-in movies a few days later.

The drive-in went well, cuddling, kissing, some light boundaries from her physically, but still warm. She ended the night early, saying she had cramps and school the next morning, and I respected it. But I didn’t bring up seeing her again, for the first time, I didn’t chase.

After that, I created some space. I didn’t text or reply right away, and she eventually posted a TikTok saying something like “don’t go back to your ex,” which felt like a shot at me. I sent her a calm message that night, not reacting to it directly, just saying I hoped she had a good sleep. She responded the next day, a bit dry, but polite.

Since then, we’ve had a few warm exchanges. I’ve kept the Snap streak alive, and we had a really good 51-minute phone call recently, playful, flirty, talking about life, even about camping together in early May. It felt like we were reconnecting. But then she posted a TikTok afterward with an audio that said, “you’ll never find anyone like her again,” and captioned it, “we all laugh at you btw.” That stung, especially after such a good call.

Right now, I’m planning to ask if she wants to hang out sometime next week (April 22–25). But I’m torn. Part of me wants to fight for this, we had something real. But part of me knows I can’t keep chasing someone who gives just enough to keep me around but won’t meet me halfway. She says yes to things in theory (like camping), but she avoids committing to plans in the present. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop of mixed signals.

Looking for honest feedback. Am I wasting my time here, or is there a smart way to play this that gives it a real shot?",2,1744630708.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

When I was nap-trapped under him in the newborn phase I did a lot of digital miniature paper work, and made/customized most of the little bits and pieces. 

But I had to finish the actual room first! 

Some time ago I bought a pack of offcut wood veneer pieces from a furniture maker, I love incorporating real wood into my miniatures. My grandfather was a carpenter, and I’m a quilter so it’s pretty natural. This was a *hard* floor to complete, I cut 1cm strips of veneer, then diamonds at a 30 degree angle. I had a template octagon, and I’d use a scalpel and nail file to shape the pieces as precisely as possible. 

I pieced them together on top of masking tape, then used wood glue and a heavy press, let it cure for a week. Then I pulled off all the tape, sanded it, and trimmed the edges.

I played around previously with using real floor varnish but I wanted a very glossy and smooth finish that would dry quickly (dust). I used topcoat nail polish, two coats, and I *really* like the way it brings out the colour and character of the wood. 

Now that the floor is complete, I’m having fun finishing off the details and arranging things just so. I also wired up the lights to a solar cell/battery from some led fairy lights. I was so pleased at how well it worked! And it means my lights turn on when it gets dark. I plan to wire my other miniatures the same way.

I bought two times a pack of ""traditional Greek coffee"" in the supermarket. The first time I suspected it was just a bad brand or charge. But the second time it was the same.
It's very light brown, extremely fine ground, pretty weak and has a weird chemical taste. It makes the impression of already brewed and then dried coffee ground.


When I'm ordering a coffee in a tavern it never tastes anything like that. Is this stuff a tourist trap or is there a special procedure required to make it taste good? Do locals buy these traditional coffee? ",0,1744630485.0,cretetravel,3,0.33,False

I‘m a limerence girly and all this got me spinning. I really don‘t want to be obsessed with a coworker who is taken. Yet I can’t say no to her when she asks me to spend time together. 
She got everything I would want in a partner and she always reaching out makes me go insane. Because I can’t actually have her.

How can I handle this? Do you have actual advices that made your limerence better?

I need advice or a reality check!

1jywjxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1jywjxm/how_to_read_the_actors_contract_novel/,How to read The Actor's Contract Novel,"# 1 A not so great start



Date = 18 March (about two months after Mel was kidnapped)



Place = San Francisco International Airport



Aria Thompson = 20 years old



Enrique Blackburn = 23 years old



Leyla Thompson = 7 years old



POV - Aria Thompson



I hold a firm grip on the small hand in mine, patiently waiting next to one of the blue cylindrical columns that support the roof of the terminal. I keep my eye on the silver carousel for our bright green suitcase to arrive.



Funny how you can fit a whole 20 years of existence into a single suitcase. For the umpteenth time since we bordered the plane, my morning coffee pushes up in my throat; my nerves are not only raw but bleeding. I swallow down the burning sensation and look down to find a pair of tired teal eyes fixed on me. I fake a smile at the pale elf-like face under the bright pink bandanna sprouting white daisies and receive a goofy toothless one in return.



The colorful garment hides her bald head, her hair loss a side-effect of the chemo treatments, but typical Leyla … she just takes it in her stride. She now proudly wears all these bold-colored fabrics even though I know it was a miserable shock for her when those beautiful locks started falling out. She’s such a brave fighter, so I need to be one too.



I can do this. I can do anything if it means she will get better. Hell, I even jump off the Golden Gate Bridge if that would save my little sister. So, this is nothing, and it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us. I must be over the moon - but instead, it feels as if someone punched me in the gut a few times too many.



Get a grip, Aria Thompson, this is for the best, I pep-talk myself. This is the miracle for which I’ve been fervently hoping. It’s like winning the lotto - everything I need right now handed to me on a platter. The best treatment possible, a home, a new start, and family to help me out … what more can I ask for? Maybe a future … ug, don’t be greedy Aria, I reprimand myself. All I have to do is act a little … stand about and appear in love … how hard can it be?



So why do I feel like a cat stuck in a dryer? But I know what’s revving me up – the thought of being in the public eye, the press. I hate the spotlight. I’m clumsy and someone that will say the dumbest things under pressure, so having others quote me is not the best idea out there.



But what do they say – beggars can’t be choosers, and I guess 99.99% of the female population would gladly trade places with me without batting an eyelash.



And who can blame them – my fake lover has more than appealing dimensions and enough money to get any female drooling, BUT I can’t help but conclude that he’s a massive player and man-whore just judging by the fact that he gets photographed with more than one different girl a week. And the fact that he needs a contract for a fictitious relationship is sufficient proof that he’s definitely not the commitment type at all.



I anxiously grab my purse, containing the secret contract just to make sure it’s still there. I can’t afford to lose it, or even worse, let it end up in the wrong hands.



The confidentiality of this contract is treated with the same secrecy as a spaceship hidden in Area 51, or placidly more – nobody knows except for Enrique and me. We’ll sign the damn paper after both of us are satisfied with the content.



Ug, this thing is hanging over my head like a sword ready to drop and decapitate my soul. I hate lies, and now we’re lying to the whole freaking world, even our closest friends and family.



The real story is that Enrique phoned me out of the blue, to talk to me about helping Leyla with her treatment. He offered me a deal – he would pay for everything we need, give us a home, and in return, I must act like his girlfriend until his new movie premiers. The fact is we’ve only Skyped once and it wasn’t my prettiest moment – my hair wrapped in a towel, my face covered by a therapeutic charcoal face mask. Yeah, I know, first impressions and all, but luckily I don’t care what he thinks.



The fake story we will tell everybody is that we fell in love online during our SKYPE sessions to talk about Leyla’s treatment and that we’ve been secretly dating online for the last three months. And he also, allegedly, came to visit me a few times covertly. (Truth is I have never seen him face to face) Since I need help with Leyla while working, he then asked me to move in with him to make it easier for me. And here we are. Yep, here we are.



I lean my head against the cold hard column, staring at the sea of people that flow like rivers through San Francisco International airport, never even stopping for obstacles, but swirling around them. Every person in the crowd moves as if unseeing hands are dragging them from the check-in desks to the cafés and through the gates, each one heading for a destination of their own, following their own story.



I tap my foot irritably, today I’m just not feeling particularly patient in any part of my system. How will my story end? Will I get out of this thing better or worse?



“Calm down Aria! You’re going to see your boyfriend soon.” Leyla misunderstands my mood, her voice moody, something I got used to since she got sick. It means she’s tired. She wipes her hand over her eyes.



“How long must we wait?” The little voice drains away in the cacophony of sounds and the loud interruption of an announcement over the intercom system.



‘Good afternoon passengers. This is the pre-boarding announcement for flight 89B to Chicago. Please have your boarding pass and identification documents ready. Regular boarding will begin in approximately ten minutes. Thank you.’



I pray for our suitcase to magically appear on the conveyor so we can get the hell out of here. I’m not sure why, but I feel almost claustrophobic as if the inevitable encounter with my fake boyfriend is suffocating me bit by bit with each slow passing second.



Two young guys walk past us, backpacks casually thrown over their broad shoulders, boosting with confidence and swagger – typical frat boys returning from holiday, would be my first guess.



The one turns his head and brazenly checks me out with an unapologetic stylish grin on his tanned mug. He’s handsome alright, and he knows it. Leyla waves innocently at him and he winks at us, his face clearly impressed. I bite my lip to keep myself from smiling, foreseeing the unavoidable jam about to happen, due to him not looking where he’s going.



Inevitably, he bumps into a woman that’s easily just as wide as she is tall, causing him to stumble back and land awkwardly on the floor. The look on his face is surreal and I can’t hide my smile anymore. His friend’s laughter echo’s through the building and instead of helping his buddy up, he holds onto his tummy with one hand, the other pointing at the guy sitting on the floor. Leyla is laughing just as hard as the friend, if not more.



The woman stops the forever ongoing argument she has with her boyfriend; they’ve been at each other’s throats since they boarded the plane – sitting just behind us - I couldn’t help but overhear the whole, long, unfruitful battle. Something about some naked pics on the guy’s phone and judging by her reaction, it wasn’t hers.



I try to do my civic duty and hold out a hand to the young man; he gets up and dusts off his trousers and then playfully punches his friend on the shoulder. It seems the whole ordeal didn’t even put a dent in his overbearing ego. How nice must it be to not worry about anything? He blows me a kiss before getting hammered by the square lady’s handbag. He protects his head with his arms, trying awkwardly to get away from his attacker, and soon he’s sucked into the meandering crowd of chaotic travelers, leaving me in the viewpoint of the meaty lady’s skimpy porn-watcher.



The guy looks like your typical nerd – thick glasses, a simple crew sweater over a button-up shirt, and shoes without socks. To make the look even more official his mouse-brown hair is combed back in a sleek wet-look style that went out in the 60s. He’s not exactly the double-take hunky bloke girls would give a second glance at – not to be rude, just stating a fact. But that doesn’t mean he hasn’t an awesome personality, and in my book, it counts much more than looks anyway.



Not that I don’t appreciate a good-looking bloke, I’m just saying that looks are not everything. My new boyfriend’s vision jumps into my mind and I shake my head to get rid of it. I can’t even dare to catch feelings or else I won’t walk away from this freaking contract unscathed. That’s when Mr. Nerdy’s girlfriend returns from her chase, panting for breath, to focus her 250-pound attention directly on me.



“Hey, girl, are you checking out my man?” she suddenly shouts, her flabby cheeks red probably from not taking enough breaths between the slander of words she’s throwing around. She moves closer, now standing an arm’s length away from me.



Leyla quickly puts her hand on my arm, knowing by now that I might do something crazy, stupid, and impulsive. I take one … two … three deep breaths.



I can’t make a scene and get into trouble on my first day on the ‘job’. But it’s not so easy when being hot-tempered is part of your DNA and saying stupid things is part of your anatomy. If I had any good sense I would close my mouth and turn my back to them, I would just ignore the situation, but that’s so not me.



I look over at the little guy again and it looks as if he’s undressing me from behind his bifocals. Is he licking his lips? What the fuck! Scratch the awesome personality – he’s a little perverted gum-sucker and no wonder he has porn on his phone. Feeling uncomfortable under his beady eyes, I try to hide Leyla behind me and turn my gaze back to his girlfriend.



“Eh … technically I was looking at him, but girl, I don’t want your boyfriend … no one wants your boyfriend … that’s why he’s with you,” I try to be polite at least and wipe my hands against my pants, metaphorically wiping away some dirt as if it will keep me calm.



Her eyes bulge dangerously close to popping out, her face is turning dark red … leaning to purple and her hands are clenched in fists along her side. She doesn’t move, except for her jaw which pushes back and forward as if she’s grinding her teeth.



I swear she’s going to pop an artery, so I tap her softly on her nose with my index finger to pull her from her agitated state.



“Lady, take a deep breath, you’re starting to look like a purple cucumber,” I mention carefully, but it seems this girl doesn’t appreciate caring behavior. No, instead she seems more pissed off.



“You mean an eggplant, Aria,” my sister corrects me like usual, and now the boxy lady seems to be a real candidate for a seizure.



Leyla grabs the lady by her arms and shakes her, “Snap out of it, aunty. Statistically, a red face is a sign of rising blood pressure. You could have a heart attack.”



It seems to work cause at least the woman starts breathing again. Enough for her to shout at me and make people notice us … some even start filming us on their phones.



“Leave my man alone, tramp!” Yep, she’s mad and she now really looks like a purple fruit. And to think I worried about her for a moment.



“O boy, here comes the crazy!” Leyla says, slumping down on the nearest chair, and slouching her head in her hands.



“Are you deaf or just plain stupid?” I throw my hair back over my shoulder, not in the nursing mood anymore. The degenerated sicko of a boyfriend doesn’t even try to intervene, but his perverted gazes are starting to make me feel rather nauseated. I pull my cream suit-type jacket close, trying to cover up. Suddenly the short-cropped top showing off my tummy doesn’t feel as sexy as it did this morning.



“Do you think you’re the first girl that tries to steal him away from me?”



I’m not sure if that’s a trick question or not, so I rather leave it unanswered. This lady is not seriously fighting with me over that horny piece of shit, and that in a fully packed airport terminal. We’ve already attracted even more entertained onlookers. Shit. What if this turns into a scandal? I can already see my fake love life going up in flames before it even started. I need to seriously end this – now.



“Look at my lips – I – DON’T – WANT – YOUR – MAN,” I pull out the last words, hoping that she would get it through her thick head, pun intended.



“Is that so?” Nope, the message didn’t pass to her peanut-sized brain. I need to exit the conversation without saying anything more, so I turn my back on her. Don’t get me wrong, I have loads to say to this square, but not with Leyla and a growing crowd around. Geez, don’t these people have planes to catch or places to be? Or at least anything better to do than look at a catfight?



And it’s just at this point that my dear little sister thinks it’s a great idea to join the conversation, and she opens with a fully loaded bomb.



“Yes, it’s so, she has her own boyfriend. His name is Enrique Blackburn. He’s an actor.” She somewhere got up and is now sticking her little finger into the woman’s tummy, her dainty nose pointed into the air.



“You feel like jello … “ Leyla keeps jiggling the rolls protruding over the woman’s pants. I turn my head so my sister can’t see my face and roll my eyes.



“EEEEEHHHH!” the woman shouts with a shrill voice, nearly bursting my poor eardrums and definitely causing my heart to skip a beat. Leyla jolts in the air and crashes into my legs with her back.



I make a strangling gesture with my hand, but quickly retract it into a fist. WTF is wrong with this person that she needs to shout like a fox in heat? Even my sister looks at her with big eyes. And then she answers my question herself, rather loudly.



“Your boyfriend is Enrique … Blackburn … the model and actor … THAT Enrique?”



And it’s at this exact moment that the horse poo hits the fan. Everybody in a 20m radius that was not already looking at us, is suddenly staring at me as if I’m the last peanut in the circus.



First, the nerd seems to get full x-ray vision, and judging by the focus point of his gaze I’m sure he’s trying to count my pubic hair, having a serious porn moment. I swear stupid people were put on this earth to test my anger management skills, cause right now I feel like ripping his scrawny little head off and stuffing it into his girlfriend’s ass.



Breath Aria, just breathe - don’t attract attention to yourself, not today. The freak steps forward as if he’s getting ready to grope me, and I try to shield my sister from him by dragging her behind me again. His girl is preoccupied with digging her nails into my arm while jumping up and down, screaming like a teenager at a rock concert. And with her body shape, it’s something to see. I look around, panicking, hoping for some help, but everybody is either staring at us or taking photos with their phones.



I need to get away from this crazy-ass couple before I do something stupid and lose my boyfriend before I’ve even met him face to face. And then luck throws me a little bone and our apple green suitcase comes traveling around the corner, rocking like a boat on the conveyer, and I let out the breath I was holding. I free my arm hardhandedly from the madwoman’s grip, keeping my lips glued to each other in a forced silence.



Due to the fact that our bag is on the far side of the conveyer, I need to lean unladylike with most of my not-so-tall body onto the carousel, my thick-soled converse barely touching the ground. Suddenly I’m very glad for making jeans part of my outfit this morning. I nearly throw out my back to get the suitcase on the ground but manage eventually, and then I walk away as fast as I can, pulling a complaining Leyla and the green box along.



“Dignity people, just get some dignity,” I mumble under my breath, but the word doesn’t seem to be in that girl’s vocabulary. No, her dictionary lost some other words too, like judgment, finesse, style, and tact – to mention but a few.



As far as we go, people stop to stare and the muffled sound of gossip doesn’t escape my ears.



Some pleasant -



‘She’s pretty … They make a lovely couple … Lucky bastard … I love her outfit‘



other’s not so much –



‘What does he see in her … He’s such a player … She won’t last long … The bitch must be lying … She’s after his money …’



I have never seen so many phones in the air, except maybe at the Taylor Swift concert I went to with some friends. I’m dead … buried, covered by concrete and a tombstone on top – ‘here lies Enrique’s ex-girlfriend, it lasted a few seconds…’



I keep my eyes on the brown floor tiles and try to walk as dignified and quickly as possible to the exit, forcing Leyla to keep up with me. It’s her fault this is happening in the first place so she better move those little legs.



“Is it true?” “How long have you been going out?” “What’s your name?”



Yells come from the crowd, but I just keep my head down, as if the floor is the most interesting thing I’ve seen for a very long time. The brown tiles have a wooden effect and then I start feeling sorry for the poor person whose job it is to keep all this clean.



People are now circling around, even following us, openly taking photos, and asking questions that I don’t even know the answers to. It’s discerning to think that Enrique Blackburn’s unknown girlfriend can cause such disorder in a busy airport.



“Are you after his money?” “Are you looking for fame and attention?” “Where do you come from?” “Is the girl your sister?” “What’s wrong with her?”



It’s at times like this that I’m extremely glad our thoughts don’t appear in bubbles above our heads like in comic books. If these people knew what I was thinking right now, I would be on the first plane to hell.



And just before I’m thrown into a panic attack of some sort, I notice my brother’s tall body sticking out close to the exit and I take in a deep breath to oxygenate my lungs again. I stopped breathing a few minutes ago. I feel the tears flooding my eyes, but I won’t cry … I just won’t.



Then the small hand leaves mine and the little girl runs into her hero’s arms. Yep, to his little sister, Superman got nothing on Noah. No, to her he’s all the superheroes combined into one package. But I must agree, my big brother is pretty special.



He hugs me without letting Leyla out of his arms. Not that he’s got a choice, she’s clinging to him like a nut. The crowd is growing, and the noise increasing. Everybody is shouting and talking at the same time and it’s not letting up.



Noah desperately tries to steer us out while his arm is protectively trying to hide me from the frenzy. I can understand now why Enrique suggested that my brother came to fetch us. Just imagine the chaos if he showed up here. At first, I thought he was just making excuses, that the media could not be as bad as he said. But I stand corrected … they’re much worse. This was not such a great start to my new life, in fact, it officially sucked.



Noah loads our green suitcase onto the back of a black truck, while occasionally nodding to something a chirping Leyla is saying. She hasn’t stopped talking since we walked out of the airport.



“And the doctor said that I’m going to love the new hospital,” she continues her ongoing chatter.



“I think you are,” Noah answers while lowering her onto the backseat, “and you know what?”



“No, what?”



“Enrique’s older brother is a doctor there and he’s super nice.”



My sister’s face lights up even more. “Seriously?”



“Yes, his name is Ilkay, and this is his truck. He told me to use it because Enrique’s car is made for only two people.”



“What type of car is it?” I haven’t seen my sister this excited for a very long time. It’s a good thing. She’s been through a lot these last few months.



“A Ferrari! A red one!” Noah smiles warmly at our little sister in the rear-view mirror.



“No way!” she screams.



“Yes, and Enrique’s twin brother, Jackson, drives a green Ferrari. And the youngest brother, Logan, has a blue Porsche.” I know Noah must have noticed her excitement and is trying to keep her happy like this.



“Fudge off! I wonder how fast it can go,” she mumbles with huge eyes, biting her lip. And then she frowns slightly as if something just came to her mind. “Hell, how many brothers does your boyfriend have?” she asks looking marginally shocked.



“Eh, if I’m right, he has three brothers and one sister,” I say looking at Noah for confirmation.



“That’s right. They are four brothers and then there’s Melaena. You’re gonna love her ‘cause she’s an artist.” Noah smiles into the mirror again.



“Wow, do you think she will teach me how to draw even better? I just LOVE painting! I must show her the painting of a Hungarian Horntail dragon I just finished … the one from Harry Potter. Do you think we can watch Harry Potter tonight, Mo?”



I snigger when my brother rolls his eyes upon hearing her pet name for him. Leyla has this tendency to not call people by their real names … she always comes up with some sort of abbreviation or something. And Mo is short for Nemo … apparently our brother’s orange hair is the same color as the little fish. And now you can understand the eye roll. But Noah need not worry … I’m sure she’s gonna find special names for our newest companions asap.



“Well, I think tonight you and Aria need to settle into your new home and rest a bit. And Enrique has a special surprise for you.”



“A surprise? What is it?” Leyla interrupts her brother. He laughs.



“Well, if I tell you it won’t be a surprise, now would it?” Leyla pulls her mouth into a thin line. I know she can’t wait to see what it is.



“Everybody decided to give Enrique and Aria some alone time tonight, but tomorrow everybody plans to come over, dying to meet the most prettiest girls in the world.” Noah tries to cheer her up, but the little vixen is still sulking.



“By everybody, you mean his brothers and sister?” At least her interest is peaked.



“Yes, but the group is much much bigger than just them. You both just wait … from now on we’re not alone anymore … these people are our new family. And Luke is about your age … I think you’re gonna be great friends,” Noah says sincerely and now I’m excited to meet everyone.



“Ug, a stupid boy … I can’t wait!” Leyla comments sarcastically, pulling a sour face while Noah parks the car. She thinks any boy under the age of 18 is stupid and childish. I think I agree with her surmise … but it’s not only under-18 boys … it’s all ages. This sex just never grows up, it seems. Men are just big children. And now it’s time to meet my ‘boy-child’. Suddenly I feel like fainting again.

So, picture this: I woke up one day and thought, “What if I just *didn’t* chase my goals for a month?” Like, who needs deadlines and to-do lists, right? 🤷‍♂️

At first, it felt a little strange. No hustle, no grind, just… *life*. Naturally, I had the first few days where I was hella uncomfortable, almost like I was missing my morning coffee. But then something surprisingly awesome happened!

Here's what went down during my 30-day experiment: 

1. **Shifting My Focus**  
   Instead of pinning myself down to my long list of wants, I shifted to living in the moment. *Coffee? Friends? Binge-watching my favorite show?* All of a sudden, these things felt like gold. 🌟 

2. **Rediscovering Passion**  
   Remember that hobby I put aside because I was “too busy”? Well, I finally picked up my paintbrush again! 🎨 And you know what? I forgot how much I loved losing myself in a creative flow. It was such a sweet distraction from “the grind”.

3. **Learning to Chill**  
   I learned that it’s okay to take a step back and breathe. Seriously, why do we think we must be on the go 24/7? A little rest never hurt anyone! I even tried yoga (okay, not for everyone, but I did pay for one class and it was worth a giggle). 🧘‍♀️

4. **Unpacking My Inner Critic**  
   Without the pressure to achieve, I found time to reflect on that pesky inner critic. I started asking myself, “What do *I* actually want?” versus “What should I be doing?” It was a total game changer. 💭

5. **Motivation Crept In Like a Sneaky Cat**  
   You know how cats sometimes just sort of appear? That’s what motivation did for me. After a while, I felt recharged and, out of the blue, I started sketching a game plan for my goals! Suddenly they felt less like tasks I *had* to do and more like exciting adventures to embark on. 🚀

Now, I’m not saying ignoring your goals is the golden ticket to success, but who knew that sometimes *not* pushing so hard can actually ignite a fire within you? 

This whole experience got me thinking: Are we sometimes too focused on achievement to notice the joy in our everyday lives? 🤔

It left me feeling refreshed, inspired, and ready to tackle my dreams with a new perspective. I guess what I learned is that sometimes, stepping back can be the best motivation there is. 

Have any of you tried something similar? How do you balance the push for your goals with just *living?* Let’s chat about this!",1,1744630087.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jywjbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1jywjbs/the_role_of_natural_ingredients_in_supporting/,The Role of Natural Ingredients in Supporting Your Weight Loss Goals,"When it comes to achieving weight loss, many people focus solely on calorie counting, intense workout routines, or the latest weight loss fad. However, an often overlooked yet powerful tool in supporting your weight loss journey is the use of natural ingredients. These ingredients, derived from the Earth’s bounty, can offer numerous benefits to your body, enhance your metabolism, and even help you feel more satisfied as you work towards your weight loss goals.

# 1. Boosting Metabolism

One of the key components of effective weight loss is a well-functioning metabolism. Natural ingredients such as green tea and cayenne pepper are well-known for their metabolism-boosting properties. Green tea contains catechins, which are antioxidants that may help to speed up fat oxidation and promote fat burning, especially when combined with physical activity. Similarly, cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, a compound that may increase calorie burn and decrease appetite. Incorporating these ingredients into your diet could help your body burn fat more efficiently, making it easier to shed unwanted pounds.

# 2. Appetite Control

Cravings and constant hunger can often derail your weight loss efforts. However, certain natural ingredients can help manage hunger, leading to better control over your food intake. For example, fiber-rich foods such as chia seeds, flaxseeds, and apples help you feel full for longer periods. Fiber slows down digestion, which means your body feels satisfied, and you’re less likely to overeat. Moreover, ingredients like cinnamon and ginger can also help stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of cravings that often lead to unhealthy snacking.

# 3. Improved Digestion

The digestive system plays a significant role in weight loss. Poor digestion can lead to bloating, constipation, and even weight retention. Natural ingredients such as peppermint, ginger, and turmeric are known for their ability to soothe the digestive system. Ginger, for example, has been shown to help reduce bloating and promote proper digestion, while peppermint can ease nausea and discomfort in the stomach. Turmeric, on the other hand, has anti-inflammatory properties that can improve gut health, helping your digestive system function at its best.

# 4. Reducing Stress and Cortisol Levels

Stress is often a hidden barrier to weight loss. When we’re stressed, our body produces cortisol, a hormone that can trigger cravings for high-calorie foods and promote fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Natural ingredients such as ashwagandha and holy basil have been used for centuries to help reduce stress and lower cortisol levels. By managing stress with the help of these adaptogens, your body can return to a balanced state, making it easier to maintain healthy eating habits and support weight loss.

# 5. Supporting Fat Loss

Certain natural ingredients can actively assist in the breakdown of fat. For instance, forskolin, derived from the Coleus forskohlii plant, has been studied for its potential to promote fat burning and support lean muscle mass. Similarly, green coffee bean extract, made from unroasted coffee beans, is believed to help reduce fat absorption and regulate blood sugar levels, further supporting weight loss efforts.

# Conclusion

Natural ingredients can serve as valuable allies in your weight loss journey. Whether you're looking to boost your metabolism, curb cravings, improve digestion, manage stress, or actively support fat loss, nature has provided us with a vast array of tools to help. Remember, incorporating these ingredients into a balanced, healthy diet, alongside regular physical activity, can be the key to sustainable and successful weight loss.",1,1744630078.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

1jywg1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1jywg1q/mayor_brandon_johnsons_resistance_to_ethics/,Mayor Brandon Johnson's resistance to ethics reforms draws criticism,"(Chicago Tribune) When Mayor Brandon Johnson came into office, his handpicked City Council ethics leader hoped the new mayor promising big change might truly reform the rules meant to keep elected officials in line in the famously corrupt city.But then Johnson instead fought those efforts, Ethics Committee Chair Ald. Matt Martin said. And he has done so again and again.“I came in the term expecting that we would be focused on ambitious reforms that restore the public’s trust in City Hall,” Martin said. “But instead I’ve had to focus on what should be the absolute bare minimum, fighting tooth and nail just to preserve the status quo.”In the last year, Johnson unsuccessfully resisted Martin’s effort to codify old rules banning lobbyists from donating to mayoral candidates. He blasted Inspector General Deborah Witzburg’s report that he mishandled gifts and is fighting her again as she alleges his Law Department hinders investigations.Witzburg said Johnson’s pattern of resistance amounts to “brick walls” at each step in her attempts at reform.Martin said Johnson’s team recently considered pushing him out of his Ethics Committee chairmanship, a charge the administration denies. And the mayor will soon face a similar big test: This fall, Johnson must decide if he will reappoint Witzburg to another four-year term.For his part, the mayor appears to feel unfairly attacked by the reform bids, many of which he has argued should be broadened to also target aldermen or are simply bad policy. Asked Tuesday about his approach to ethics, he responded by listing off efforts to make city services more equitable.“The ethics or ethos of our government cannot just be simply mired in our conversation around the potential to corruption,” he said. “I find that to be a very puerile sort of approach toward how we talk about ethics. Ethics is about how we equitably distribute government in a way that everybody can feel proud of.”The remark hinted at a change in focus on City Hall’s fifth floor. Johnson’s predecessor, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, rode to victory with a “bring in the light” corruption focus in the wake of a federal raid against council heavyweight Ald. Edward Burke. Burke became the 38th alderman since 1971 to be convicted of wrongdoing in December 2023.Johnson’s winning campaign, however, was defined by a promise to spread city investment across the South and West sides and bolster Chicago government with bold new programs.Ald. Matthew Martin, 47th, poses a question to Inspector General Deborah Witzburg during City Council budget hearings on Nov. 9, 2024. 'st in City Hall,” Martin said. “But instead I’ve had to focus on what should be the absolute bare minimum, fighting tooth and nail just to preserve the status quo.” (Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune) 

Better Government Association Vice President Bryan Zarou praised the mayor’s equity-focused work, but said that effort should not get in the way of addressing historical corruption.“You’re the mayor of Chicago, the third largest city in America, you should be able to walk and chew gum,” he said. “He’s just been hostile to any sort of ethics reform.”Zarou criticized Johnson for being slow to appoint new members to Chicago’s Board of Ethics, leaving the body often short staffed.In response to a BGA questionnaire on the campaign trail, Johnson — whose first two years in office have not been rocked by major ethics scandals — committed to implementing Inspector General’s Office recommendations or providing detailed explanations of rejections.“To outright reject recommendations from entities such as COPA and Inspectors General runs counter to the need for checks and balances in our government,” he wrote. “To have oversight that mayoral administrations are constantly at odds with erodes credibility and contributes to mistrust from the general public.”Yet Johnson denied Witzburg’s team access to logs of gifts given to the mayor and the City Hall room in which gifts were kept and was slow to comply with records requests regarding the items, according to a report she published in January.The mayor called the report a “mischaracterization” and argued there was “a clear process” for access that Witzburg and her at-first undercover investigators did not follow. He later opened the gift room — filled with mostly mundane, cheap items — to reporters and published an online log of gifts, all the while highlighting his frustration when asked about it.“It’s embarrassing that this is even a conversation,” he said last month. “If people want to have conversations about coffee mugs and T-shirts, have at it. As far as my administration is concerned, I’m going to make sure that we build a more inclusive economy, so that Black, brown, white, Asian working people in this city can actually live in this city, afford to live in this city and feel safe.”A portrait of the mayor is among the items in Mayor Brandon Johnson’s gift room. (Eileen T. Meslar/Chicago Tribune) 

Johnson’s administration promised to open the gift room to the public in quarterly day-long viewings, the first of which occurred Friday. But despite widespread media coverage when that was announced, not a single person had come by 3 p.m., according to mayoral spokesperson Cassio Mendoza.Asked about Johnson’s clear frustrations, Witzburg said she can understand them. Since her 2022 appointment by Lightfoot, she has sought to more aggressively enforce ethics rules, she said. Johnson is being treated differently, because other politicians did not face enough scrutiny.“The way things have always been is not good enough. And if we’re going to change them, we have to change them,” Witzburg said.She has been consistently frustrated by Johnson’s reform responses, despite her past hopes that the “passionate and compelling case for change” he made while campaigning signaled openness, she said.Witzburg cited the stalling of a small, “almost clerical in nature” amendment to an ethics ordinance last summer. The changes were eventually made, but the resistance to the relatively pro forma move spells trouble for any larger efforts, she added.One bigger reform she is trying would block the mayor-controlled Law Department from attending investigative interviews, eliminate its discretion over inspector general subpoenas and prevent it from asserting attorney-client privilege to avoid sharing records. The department has long hindered investigations that “may result in embarrassment or political consequences to city leaders,” her proposal said.Johnson’s top lawyer, Corporation Counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry, has blasted the effort — now packaged in a stalled ordinance proposed by Martin — as illegal and a “fundamental misunderstanding of the law.” Witzburg last week touted an opinion adopted by the Association of Inspectors General that she argued shows her push is aligned with national standards, and the BGA obtained a legal opinion in late March arguing the ordinance would be legal.City of Chicago’s Corporation Counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry answers questions during a press conference at City Hall on Feb. 4, 2025. (Eileen T. Meslar/Chicago Tribune) 

The mayor must soon decide if he will reappoint Witzburg. If he does not, he will need to work with Martin’s committee to form a search committee and gain City Council approval on a new inspector general next year.The mayor must make his decision by late October, 180 days before Witzburg’s first term ends, per city ordinance. Witzburg thinks she has earned another go.“I think you have to do this job like you don’t want it anymore. That said, I very much do want it,” she said. “I think that a reappointment decision made on the basis of the merits of the work that we’ve done would allow me to stay.”Witzburg said she has also ramped up investigations into aldermen. Her office has 19 ongoing investigations into elected officials, according to its last quarterly report. But she still sees “gaps in accountability” and plans to propose new ethics mechanisms to hold aldermen and other elected officials to stricter rules already in place for city employees in the coming months, she said.Close Johnson ally Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, used a parliamentary maneuver to stall the Law Department-targeting ordinance. He said Friday he thinks Witzburg should be reappointed and supports her independent work, but pinned some of the frustrations with the mayor’s approach to ethics on political opportunism.Uproar about the gift room debate in particular was at times “obstructionism” and “an issue of prioritization” amid threats of federal funding cuts, he said. He called for broader ethics reforms to target aldermen and not just the mayor.“City Council wants to hold the mayor to a different standard than we want to hold ourselves, and I object to that,” Sigcho-Lopez said. “There are issues that must be addressed. The influence of corporations … the influence of billionaires that corrupt City Council members.”Martin said he struggles to see a justification for not nominating Witzburg to another term.Chicago Inspector GeneralDeborah Witzburg appears before City Council members during a budget hearing at City Hall on Nov. 9, 2024. (Tess Crowley/Chicago Tribune) 

Though the Lincoln Square alderman and mayor share many beliefs in common, the two have butted heads regularly in recent months over ethics issues, over perceived shortcomings in Johnson’s dealings with the Service Employees International Union and over Johnson’s budget, which Martin voted against.Martin believes that Johnson’s team really did discuss trying to remove him from his Ethics Committee chairmanship, as first reported in Crain’s Chicago Business. A denial by top Johnson staffers pledging no formal conversations took place did little to convince him, and he never heard directly from Johnson on the matter despite requesting to, he said.“This was not idle chatter. This was not individuals blowing off steam. These were substantive discussions,” Martin said. “Disagreement should never be punished through loyalty tests.”Martin’s highest profile ethics battle with Johnson came after campaign contributions Johnson received from registered lobbyists were deemed improper by the Board of Ethics. After the board determined a ban on mayoral candidates getting lobbyist money implemented in a 2011 executive order from Mayor Rahm Emanuel was not enforceable, Martin tried to codify the rule.Johnson fought the ordinance and whipped votes against it. Two aldermen stalled the ordinance in June, and the mayor said he wanted to wait for a “full comprehensive ethics package” that also targets aldermen. Martin’s measure passed in September.Johnson’s campaign fund returned in January most of a $50,000 contribution accepted in June 2023 from a political action committee led by a City Hall lobbyist, a move apparently prompted by pressure from Witzburg for exceeding contribution limits, according to the Sun-Times.Martin said the mayor is dragging his feet to respond to broader ethics reform packages the alderman backs, including a series of five major proposals recommended by the Board of Ethics to Johnson in November 2023. Martin also proposed adding a public funding option for aldermanic candidates in June.“Whether it’s a lack of support for certain issues or outright obstruction, I think it’s clear that the mayor’s office hasn’t lived up to the campaign promises around the embrace of ethics and good governance,” he said. “We need that to change immediately.”",2,1744629763.0,chicago,1,1.0,False

1jywe08,https://i.redd.it/5plsuopebsue1.jpeg,Budget-Friendly Mini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Recipe),"Recipe is on my channel ❤️quality is bad cuz of technical errors but I loved the editing so I hope y’all give it a watch ❤️

Hey r/budgetfood! Just made these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls in my air fryer for the first time and had to share this budget win. They taste like coffee shop treats at a fraction of the cost!

Cost breakdown: About $3-4 total for 9-12 rolls (30-45¢ each vs $4-5 at cafes!)

Mini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)
Makes 9-12 rolls

Dough:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1¼ tsp instant yeast
- ½ tsp salt
- ¾ cup warm milk (38-40°C)
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 egg (room temperature)

Filling:
- 2 tbsp softened butter
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- ¼ cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate

Optional Glaze:
- ¼ cup cream cheese, softened
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar
- 1 tbsp butter, soft
- Splash of milk or vanilla

Instructions:

1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.

2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.

3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.

4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160°C (320°F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160°C for 8-10
minutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.

5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.

Pro tips:
- For extra gooey centers, add a few more chocolate chips in the spiral.
- A pinch of salt on top of the glaze enhances the flavor.
- If tops brown too quickly, loosely cover with foil during air frying.
- No cream cheese? Make a simple glaze with just powdered sugar and milk!

These are seriously addictive and WAY cheaper than anything you'll find at a bakery. The air fryer batch size is perfect if you're cooking for 1-2 people and don't want leftovers going stale.

1jywb3p,https://i.redd.it/u0ikvzrjasue1.jpeg,The Amazing Spider-Man 3 script,"
We’ve all had our idea of what TASM3 should or could be. For years it was Venom and Andrew’s Peter in the black suit. Perhaps maybe the Sin Eater. That would be fun. Maybe Spider-Gwen in a crazy multiverse or this Peter meeting and training the next Spider-Man, Miles Morales. All these ideas have merit and major upside but for me non have truly clicked with me especially where No Way Home left off.

My idea would be a love story, a story about trying to fall back in love. How difficult must it be to love someone new when you haven’t had the chance to fall out of love with the person you considered your soulmate. That’s a real human story and would fit Spider-Man and this Peter PERFECTLY. It’s a story between Peter Parker and Mary Jane and why those two are perfect for each other and how scary it is to love again. We see this through not just them but Aunt May and Doc Ock. A cheesy silver age idea but one that could be really crucial. It shows Peter you can love again and move on but not moving away from who you once loved. But also, it’s his Aunt moving on from his best friend and uncle and this new man will be the villain of this film so it’s bit of a tainted picture for Pete.

Peter is a science teacher at Empire State University and Mary Jane works just down the road at the Coffee Bean, trying to start up fresh in New York after moving in with her aunt after leaving New Jersey. 

Comics I think suit this would be elements of Taylor’s FNH Spider-Man (especially with Nathan), JMS’ teacher role for Peter, Parallel Lives (where we dive into Mary Jane’s backstory) and Spider-Man Blue with its first person narration and Peter’s love for Gwen being the beating heart.

We do see Gwen in this film but in a dream sequence. I feel having her be in it from the multiverse undermines her death but it being a dream keeps that death permanent but also gives us the last bit Peter needs to move on and move forward. Think the Uncle Ben and Peter scene from Spider-Man 2 but more optimistic and romantic. 

I wrote a full script about this which you can read below and I hope you enjoy it. It explores these characters and takes elements you’ve seen from comics and movies with a little twist to keep you on your toes. I’m really proud of it, I love Spider-Man and screenwriting so I hope this is something you can enjoy and imagine when relaxing.

I am going to do my best to make sure my story is short and quick.  Mother of 2 ""children"", married 27 years. My son is 25 and married. Lives at home with my husband and me. I have also a daughter who is 18. I am the breadwinner for my household. I have always worked hard since before I got married. When I met my husband, he was attentive and a very hard worker. He is not from the US. He never wanted to progress, as in going to a University. I have been since day one, the complete opposite. I had a rough childhood when I was growing up. Once I joined the military and moved out of my childhood home, all I wanted was to fulfill my dream. Have a home, travel and live well. Fast forward to present. My husband has no backbone in accomplishing anything. If he does not see my cleaning he won't clean. If the kids do something we don't agree in, I have to step in and correct/guide. You know the good cop bad cop? Well i have been stucked as the bad cop ALWAYS. It has gotten to the point, that if something mayor happens he does not give me any type of support. 
I have a very stressful job in the government.  Stress is high due to all of the firings that will be occurring throughout our Nation. I am one of the seniors that will be sending out this notices. Since the Presidential executive order i have been driving 1.5 hours to work and 1.5 hours back home. I work 12hrs a day to keep up with the work load. Last week once I arrived home, I was mentally drained. On a verge of a mental breakdown. My family knows how stressed I've been. Once I got home, said hi to everyone and went straight to the kitchen. No one had begun dinner, it was passed 6:00pm. I did not complain. My son was making grilled sandwiches for him and his wife. I begun to clean the dishes I had taken to work that morning. I asked politely if he could make me one and he agreed. My daughter was in the kitchen. They were discussing discipline and spanking. I mentioned, well you both have nothing to complain about. I spanked you as kids when necessary but I never abused you. I have spanked my son perhaps 3 times in his life. When he was small, kids tantrum in walmart or if he brought bad grades and lied about it. Nothing hard. Just a slap in the butt. Never abused him. One time when he was 15, he was being extremely aggressive and I tried to spank him, and he hit me back. My husband didn't protect me and didn't do anything to help with this one time behavior. I had to resolve it on my own. 
Going back to the story. Meanwhile I am washing my bowl and my coffee cup, he continued stating that I was lying and abusive. He continued to repeat on and on, you are getting me mad. My daughter was laughing and all I could think of was just heading to my room. Again, I was exhausted after that long ride home and the stress from work. My husband then walks in the kitchen. He heard what was going on. He then proceeded to put his dirty plates in the sink and demanded for me to clean up. I was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to leave the kitchen. I told him for him to clean it. Then he begun stating in front of my kids that I am lazy. I replied back to please back off. He did not. Meanwhile my son is still making comments of my supposed miss treatments. My daughter continued to smile, like if everything was fun and games. My daughter proceeded to give me the plate.  My husband continued to belittled me and my son continued with his comments. I couldn't take it no more.  All I saw was red. I walked towards the dining area and proceeded to throw the plate on the floor and screamed out of my lungs enough. No one said a thing, not an apology. I walked to my room, took all my husband's pillows and told him you are not sleeping in my room. Proceeded to my room and fell asleep crying. I know my mistake was buying my kids everything and anything they want. I need to add, a week prior to this incident I had treated my husband to a cruise to celebrate my birthday. I spent close to 7,000. And he did not give me anything for my birthday. When I brought it up to his attention he said, you invited me. Why should I contribute to it. 
It's been a week since the plate throwing incident. I have not received any apologies.  It has been very uncomfortable for me being at my home. It is affecting my health.  Would I be an AITA if I asked them all to move out? Wanted to give them 90 days. I believe by doing this, it would show them appreciation and responsibilities and at the same time give me the space I need. ",1,1744629153.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Alright, friends, gather 'round! 🌅 We’ve all scrambled out of bed like a caffeinated chicken before, am I right? Mornings can be a chaotic whirlwind of alarms, snoozing, and searching for matching socks. But what if I told you there’s a way to kick off your day that actually feels good and sets a killer tone?  

Let me share my personal morning routine hack that transformed my entire vibe: **the five-minute journal.** Seriously, hear me out!  

### Here’s how it works:  

- **Wake up, grab your journal.** Yep, you heard me right. As soon as your feet hit the floor, have that baby by your nightstand. No scrolling through social media. Let’s put down the doom-scrolling, folks!  
- **Three things I’m grateful for.** A solid start, right? It’s easy-peasy! I usually stick to the little things: a warm cup of tea, the sun peeking through the curtains, or even my fuzzy socks. They count!   
- **Three things that would make today great.** Simple yet so powerful. **Example:** “A good chat with my bestie,” or “Finally finishing that book I’m loving.” It sets your intentions!  
- **Daily affirmations.** This one shocked me. I used to roll my eyes, but now I’m all about that positive self-talk. “I am capable. I am strong. I will crush today.” It sounds cheesy until it isn’t.  

Then, I grab my coffee and smile like a total dork, ready to tackle whatever life throws at me! ☕✨  

### Some *funny* side effects I’ve found:  

- **Feeling human first thing!** No more zombie mode for me.  
- **A shift in my mindset.** Instead of stress, I focus on opportunities.  
- **Getting my creative juices flowing.** Sometimes, the best ideas pop up in those few minutes.   

Now, what about you? Have you found a little morning hack that’s stuck? Or maybe tried one that flopped? Let’s swap stories! Maybe we can turn these mornings into something legendary, one journal entry at a time. 😄🚀",1,1744629026.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

UK based internal recruiter here. I wondered if there are any universal things fellow recruiters out there wished that candidates knew or prepared for their screens and interviews.

For me, it’s that they take the screen seriously as an interview round. I’ve had quite *a lot* of calls lately where candidates have noisy backgrounds: are walking around outside with me in their air pods and I can hear all the background noise, are in the middle of cooking food, or ordering a coffee at a cafe, et cetera. 

I would just think it’s common sense to find a quiet, relaxed space to have a conversation with someone who’s a key decision maker in whether or not you land a job? Surely, you’d want to be in a calm situation to be able to think clearly and sell your skill set. 

I even send candidates emails confirming the date and time of our call, what I’ll be covering with them and how long we’ll likely be together…

Dunno, just bugging me a bit lately and wondered if others are finding this or what else they’d like candidates to know/prep for! I’m hoping a few candidates actively interviewing might be able to learn something from this that helps them in the future too.

I also popped in to a local coffee roastery/cafe - they did not have a lot of different beans but had a strong recommendation when I mentioned I need a rich chocolatey “feel good” bean for lattes for myself and SO. I’m using a hand grinder that I’ve owned for a few years now  (1zespresso jx pro). Came back home and took 3 shots to dial in an 18g in/35gm out 30s shot. Stretched milk and for the first time, I actually made something resembling art. 

The taste was great - lot of chocolate/nougat flavor.  Wife even commented that had she not known, she would’ve sworn that I added a teensy bit of flavoring to the latte - it was that good. 

I’ve tried different setup - including a lelit single boiler 10 years ago which I somehow couldn’t work at all having spent close to a year on it. I then moved to moka pot and even though that was good, I still missed the latte that you can order at the local cafe.

1jyw2oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1jyw2oo/do_these_symptoms_sound_familiar_if_so_how_did/,"Do these symptoms sound familiar? If so, how did you stop them?","Hi everyone, been reading this sub with interest. I know everyone's experience is different but I'm interested if people have had similar issues with me and how they managed them. 

I've suffered from daily bloating for years. My thing is, the bloat is manageable early in the day but becomes intolerable by night-time after having dinner. I'll generally feel lethargic, irritated and gassy for hours after dinner - which of course makes me great company at dinner parties /s. Alcohol doesn't help -- but neither does cutting it out entirely. It doesn't seem to make a significant difference whether I have a glass of wine or a beer with dinner or not. I've tested negative for SIBO, negative for fructose malabsorption and lactose malabsorption. I'm not sure I have a handle on an entire list of foods that trigger symptoms -- but I know the bloat / gas is very quick to arrive after eating rich food -- like high-sugar sweets, desserts and baked goods. I'm also wary of glutinous Asian food that uses soy and sesame oils, anything deep-fried, anything with a lot of pastry like pies and sausage rolls etc. And garlic and onion... But even after cutting these things out, my tummy is still straining at night -- even from eating innocuous things like small bowls of rice with canned tuna. I've tried the low-FODMAP diet -- yeah, it helps a bit but only a bit. My diet is pretty darn healthy -- eggs, spelt bread, spinach, tomatoes, meat, fruit and veggies, rice. Only use olive oil to cook... Very little take-out or processed food... Dairy is at a minimum, just milk with tea. Only real vice is morning coffee with biscuits and a bit of sugar in tea/coffee. But I'm also a bit anxious that I've screwed up my gut more by cutting out so-called trigger foods -- and that I really should be eating things like broccoli, cauliflower and yoghurt....

So I feel like my whole system is just rebelling at something but I have no idea what. I suspect I may have an imbalance of bad bacteria versus good. And the good guys just don't seem to stand a chance these days... I don't know what to do and I've seen a succession of doctors and ""specialists"" who never offer any remedies apart from: try the low-FODMAP diet, eat smaller meals, try meditation, sleep more, exercise and drink loads of water. Yeah, that's all great but it doesn't stop the bloat... 

Have also tried daily digestive enzymes but don't notice any benefit. I don't really know enough about probiotics or prebiotics to have tried them, though.

If you've been in a similar place and found a breakthrough, I'm virtually willing to try anything -- whether it be vitamins, medicinal weed, antibiotics or whatever.... 

Thanks for sharing your experiences / tips.

*In March, we kicked off our* ***Journey Through the Power Platform*** *with a whirlwind of flows and automation. Now we’re back with* ***Challenge #2*** *in our journey!* Did you participate? Was it fun? Looking forward to this challenge? Leave a comment and let everyone know!

Welcome to the **April/May Challenge**, where we leave the shiny buttons and flashy galleries behind and dive headfirst into the unfiltered world of **data**. 

Let's be honest,  your app might look amazing, your flows might be fast and clever. But if your foundation is terrible, the house will eventually crumble! Databases are the foundation in all that we do. This challenge is all about learning how to building the kind of strong, clean foundation that real, scalable solutions are based upon.  

Oh, and here’s a twist. This is **Part 1 of 2**. In June, we’ll take what you build now and evolve it into something even bigger.  

**Now for a bit of honesty**. This one might make you want to pull your hair out. Messy datasets. Data modeling & Data Normalization. It’s not the glamorous side of Power Platform, but it’s absolutely essential. These are the skills that separate a casual (citizen) app builder from a serious developer. 

And the tricky part? These skills are hard to learn because it’s rare to find a solid dataset to practice on. That’s why this challenge exists. It's basically the broccoli of The Power Apps Challenges for the year. Not everyone loves it, but it’s good for you. Really good. Trust us.  

Stick with it, and what you build here could become a highlight in your portfolio or CV. This is your fork in the road, this is how you stand out among the rest of the applicants.

# Skills Used 

**Key Skill: Database design** 

**Minor Skills:** Entity Relationship Diagram, Relational Databases, Data Modelling, Data normalization.

# Challenge info 

**Estimated time: (1-2h/week)**

Start Date: 16^(th) April 2025 

End Date: 30^(st) May 2025 (For us to highlight solutions in possible podcast episode) 

Extra info: [Link to Files on GitHub ](https://github.com/ThePowerAppsChallenge/April-May-2025-Database_Design_Files-)

Submissions: We'd love to see how you solve this challenge! Your submission can be any way you like, as long as we are able to view it. Submissions sent before the deadline will be looked at in an **possible** upcoming Podcast episode where we give praise and feedback and generally discuss the challenge experience. 

A common way to submit is to record a 5 minute video and upload it to Youtube, while explaining the choices you make. For this challenge, a picture of an ERD might be enough if you don't want to walk us through it.

# [Discord  ](https://discord.com/invite/yA68HC6rrT)

We have an amazingly active discord community full of enthusiastic people who are always there to answer a question or just generally chat about the Power Platform. Regardless if you want to join in order to help, learn or just hang out with likeminded individuals, welcome! [Link](https://discord.com/invite/yA68HC6rrT)

# The Problem 

Kowalski & Co. Accounting is an accounting firm that has been operating on Penguin Island for over 40 years. What started as a small local operation has recently grown into a much larger organization. The growth has been driven by a foreshadowing of changes to the global trading patterns due to changes in government policies and tax regulations.  

But with growth comes growing pains. Each department at Kowalski & Co. has been tracking its workflow in its own private spreadsheet. That was fine when there were just a handful of people in the office. Now they struggle with duplication of data, inconsistent formats and multiple ways of recording the same information.  

Their current approach is inefficient and it’s slowing them down. They need a new system that can keep up with their momentum, especially as they expect to keep growing and expanding in the years ahead.

Kowalskis IT department mostly works with user support, and they lack any Software Development in house. Therefor Kowalskis has come to you as their trusted Microsoft Partner, to get your help in designing a new solution for their internal systems.

You’ve got six weeks until the meeting where you'll showcase your vision. If you can show them something that truly works, they’re ready to greenlight full development (next challenge).

# The Task

 [Link to Files on GitHub ](https://github.com/ThePowerAppsChallenge/April-May-2025-Database_Design_Files-)

**Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that will form the foundation of a smarter, more scalable system for Kowalski & Co.** 

Normally, this would be handled by your Solution Architect. Unfortunately, just a few hours after the meeting with Kowalski & Co., he grabbed his suitcase and dashed off on vacation to Madagascar. Classic timing. 

But before boarding, he did leave you with a parting gift. In between airport coffees and passport checks, he jotted down some key concepts you’ll need to understand, plus a few helpful guides to make sure you’re not flying blind. 

Here’s the game plan. Dive into the material he left behind, the customers current data sources, learn what you need, and put together an ERD that would make even your Architect proud.

* **Data Normalization:** How to structure data across a database in an efficient way by minimizing redundancy and ensuring consistency. *Higher normal form (NF) becomes harder. Don't get stuck forcing 3NF if you are a beginner.* [Guide: ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/database-normalization-1nf-2nf-3nf-table-examples/)
* **Identifying Data Entities and Attributes:** Understanding how to break down messy data into distinct objects (like employees or departments) and their properties (like names or start dates). 
* **Relational Database:** The art of having your tables talk to each other, so that you never have to save data twice. 
   * Understand Primary and Foreign Keys and how they are used in different databases (SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL etc)
* **Data Integrity and Validation:** Ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and fits the rules of the system by using constraints and checks (like NOT NULL or valid email formats). 
* **Security and Access Control:** Limits who can view or change different parts of the data by using roles, permissions, and sometimes encryption. 
* **Documentation and Naming Conventions:** Keeps the database understandable and maintainable by using clear, consistent table/column names and documenting how the data is structured and used. 

As usual from here you can either read on and get a more guided view of the challenge or opt to take it on in a less guided way. The guided view will provide levels linked with expectations, but you are always welcome to take it on in the way you see fit.

# Beginner

*This level is honestly about getting your hands dirty and experimenting more than anything.* 

Kowalski’s leadership has noticed that their spreadsheets are full of inconsistencies. Some rows contain multiple departments, tasks are bunched together in single fields, and names are spelled differently across files. They want a simple, consistent view of their employees.  

Try and design a database/table that fullfills these rules 

* Each record (row) should describe one thing only, and each field should contain one value.  
* Look through the data and understand what the “key entities” are.  
* Everyone should see the same version of a value. (No more ""HR"", ""Hr"", and ""Human Resources"" all meaning the same thing.) 
* Database/table can be in first normal form, 1NF.  
* Should be structured enough to support sorting and filtering.  

# Intermediate

Kowalski’s HR team wants to be able to update manager details, department names, and office locations without having to open multiple files. They’ve also noticed some employees have multiple training records and want to avoid recording their personal details each time.

**Minimum expectations**

* Create a Relational Database ERD using at least second normal form (2NF)
* A single change to shared data (like a manager's name) should be reflected everywhere it’s used. 
* Information that’s repeated in different rows (like employee names or training session names) should only be stored once. 
* You should be able to tell who did what training, but without repeating their full name, birthdate, and department every time. 
* When someone changes office location, their onboarding history shouldn't need to be rewritten. 
* Solution takes into account proper standards for..
   * Naming Convention

# Advanced

The team at Kowalski is preparing for major growth and wants a system that doesn’t break when hundreds of employees are onboarded in a month. They need clear links between people, departments, tasks, and outcomes. In addition, they want to start measuring the success of their training and monitoring efforts. 

**Minimum expectations**

* Create a Relational Database ERD fully following third normal form (3NF)
* There should be no unnecessary duplication of information, each piece of data should have a single, authoritative home. 
* If someone is involved in multiple activities (training, onboarding tasks, performance reviews), the system should reflect that clearly.  
* Data should be easy to extend: For example, if they add a new onboarding step or a new type of training, nothing should break. 
* Reports should be accurate and reliable without requiring manual cross-checking. 
* Solution takes into account proper standards for..
   * Data Integrity and Data Validation
   * Security and Access Control
   * Naming Conventions

# Expert

Kowalski’s executive team is thinking long-term. They want a smart, scalable, and future-proof system. Something that can feed into automation, analytics, and AI. They expect that roles, tasks, policies, and structures will evolve. The system needs to evolve with them. Kowalski's are in a industry with strict rules and regulations concerning

**Minimum expectations**

* Every concept in the system should have its own place, and every relationship should be trackable. 
* Task lists should not just be stored. They should be reusable, configurable, and assigned dynamically. 
* No piece of data should exist in more than one place without reason. If it changes, it should only need to change once. 
* The system should be able to support multiple people, roles, and processes working together without confusion. 
* It should be possible to tell when, why, and by whom data was added or changed.

Went through to make a coffee and saw a very small bee on the floor in my bedroom. Tiny wee thing.

Look like he was struggling along. I've tried at least two or three other times to save a bee - didn't work out like it did in the videos. 

I really wanted to revitalise this bee. Get it back in the saddle. Let it buzz some more.

So I got the bee on a little piece of cardboard, and decided I would do this outside my front door. Didn't want it to start flying about trapped in my flat. 

So I put him outside, and I go to get a spoonful of sugar water. 

I only have brown sugar. I assume it works the same way? 

So I mix up a small whisky glass of brown sugar water.

I proceed to get a spoonful of brown sugar water. I step outside my flat. 

The plan was to gracefully tip the water by the bee, and observe. 

I heard someone coming from downstairs - and I shat it. 

Started to feel really self conscious. Not had a shower yet, looking a bit dishevelled.   
  
Standing there with a spoonful of brown liquid. Like it's heroin or something.   
  
That's anxiety for you! I'm at home, it's a safe place. I'm trying to do a good deed.   
  
But I am worried about looking as though I'm taking heroin in the threshold of my front door.

I hastily tipped the spoonful by the bee. I wished it good luck.

I'm not sure if being too chatty is enough to drive away someone. If you know the lyrics of the song Tibok that goes...

Kumusta? Kain na, hello, magandang umaga Ingat ka, pahinga, huwag kang masyadong magpupuyat pa

... I have a habit of saying these things out of care and I'm scared it might annoy people.

It's hard being someone who's too affectionate - I tend to get swept up by my feelings and give too much, usually ending with them being overwhelmed or even worse - turned off.

I still hope and pray na there's someone willing to share my kind of love with me. I want to feel important to someone. Gusto ko ma-experience maging favorite person. Gusto ko makakilala ng taong excited na makilala ako as much as I am excited to know them.

I run a handmade custom figurine business where we create personalised figurines based on customer photos and requests. I’m exploring an idea to enhance the customer experience on my Shopify store.

What I envision is an AI tool or plugin that allows customers to *write their own prompt directly on the website* — for example:

I want a figurine of me in a superhero costume, holding a coffee cup, standing at my office desk. Here's my photo for reference

Based on that prompt, the tool would auto-generate a visual reference (image) for them to preview — not the final product, but a rough AI-generated concept. Then, I as the maker will use this AI-generated design as the base to craft their real-life figurine.

Basically, I’m looking for:

* A user-friendly text-to-image AI that can integrate with Shopify
* Customers can type their ideas themselves, and get an instant visual reference
* Ideally, it collects their prompt and image so I can use it for production
* Bonus: If it can save multiple drafts or choices, even better!

Has anyone here used something like this?  
Or are there any developers who can recommend tools, APIs, or apps that could help me build this flow? Open to exploring both ready-made solutions or custom development.

Most of these focus on health: eating well, exercising, sleeping right, and self-care.

The good part? I feel healthier, more grounded, and more in control.  
The downside? My career-focused tasks — deep work, learning, growth projects — feel like they’ve slowed down significantly. Even when I carve out time for them, my mental energy and pace feel sluggish.

Today, I tried something different. I ditched all routines. I got up, had coffee, and dove straight into work. It’s been 12 hours, with just a few quick snack breaks, and I’ve accomplished more in a day than I usually do in an entire week. It felt amazing to get so much done — but obviously, it’s not sustainable long-term.

So now I'm stuck in a dilemma:

* Do I **stick to my routines**, knowing they’re healthy but risk stagnation in career goals?
* Or do I **go all-in on focused work**, knowing it’s effective short-term but probably unhealthy and unsustainable?
* Or is there a middle path — for example, follow health routines on weekdays and go hard on weekends?

* A high-damage, versatile Arcane Trickster build that doesn’t rely solely on scroll-spamming. Instead, it fully utilizes **Mage Hand Legerdemain** and **Magical Ambush** to control the battlefield and set up devastating attacks.
* A thematic build focused on Cold/Frozen mechanics, chaining related conditions like **Chilled and Frozen**, and exploiting **Cold, Bludgeoning, Thunder, and Force** **vulnerabilities** with sneak attacks or spells.
* We will explore **Booming Blade** in the early to mid-game for surprisingly strong hits—no gimmicky multi-hit abuse or patch-specific quirks. This build stays effective even if Larian reworks it to follow tabletop rules.
* Plays like a *true* Arcane Trickster: weaving magic and weapon attacks, switching fluidly between melee and ranged, creating and capitalizing on enemy vulnerabilities, and mixing in consumables, clever positioning, and classic Rogue utility.

I recorded some short videos with very powerful interactions to use the AT, check in the Combat Flows section.

# Building Blocks

A couple of weeks ago, we had some fun posts exploring niche mechanics:

* while I was preparing to finally post my [Ice Knight](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1jyvsw5/a_new_ice_knight_dbooming_the_frozen_more/) variation updated to Patch 8 content, u/LennyTheOG posted their [theirs](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1ji3j5h/i_need_build_help_for_a_patch_8_ice_knight_build/) so we had a discussiong about the [Frozen](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Frozen_(Condition)) conditions, enemies vulnerable to a single Bludgeoning, Thunder, or Force attack.
* This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1jgkrlg/havent_seen_this_idea_yet/) from u/CoffeeDodgyr787, where I became aware the [Practice Sword](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Practice_Sword) is the only Bludgeoning Finesse weapon in the game—and that Sneak Attack uses your main hand’s damage type, even when attacking with your offhand.

I’ve been using my Ice Knight for many runs, but I never explored much Frozen as the flow for a single character was tricky. That character needs a *partner*.

Combining these ideas, I realized that while the Ice Knight doubles GWM bonus damage vs Frozen targets, a Rogue can go even further—turning a joke weapon like Practice Sword into a bazooka by delivering double sneak attack damage. For even more tactical flexibility, a Rogue can choose to strike with an offhand attack (triggering Sneak Attack as a reaction) while freeing their main action for spells, consumables, or setup plays—as long as Practice Sword is in the main hand.

This is where the Arcane Trickster shines.

Not only an AT gets sneak attack, but with Booming Blade for bonus Thunder damage on a single target and Mage Hand Legerdemain to throw water bottles—freezing Chilled enemies without using your action—AT becomes a tactical menace.

AT’s bag of tricks boosted by minimal dips in Fighter and Divination Wizard becomes the perfect sweet spot as an actually very competent damage dealer, surprising skilled spellcasting (3rd level spells with Magical Ambush and Portent) and a full range of consumables to explore along with Mage Hand Legerdemain. And of course, handle pickpocketing, locks and traps.

It's a highly tactical, versatile and fun build that actually highlights what an AT can do.

# Cold Open

This is a brief review of conditions we’re going to explore on this build and the Ice Knight. You can skip if you know about them or read it in the other post.

**Chilled / Frozen - Damage Vulnerabilities**

[Chilled](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Chilled_(Condition)) is great—easy to apply, easy to scale the vulnerability it provides with Cold spells. However, throw a water bottle on a Chilled enemy, and they become [Frozen](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Frozen_(Condition))—granting vulnerability to Bludgeoning, Thunder, and Force for *one hit only*, so be prepared to make it count. When an enemy has physical vulnerability, now you can double the value of your GWM.

A level 4 STR 18 Paladin with GWF and GWM using a +1 Maul casting Thunderous Smite can hit a Frozen enemy for 8d6+30 damage. That’s over 60 average damage using a 1st level spell slot.

You can start Freezing enemies as soon as you assemble the Mourning Frost staff in the Underdark. Chilled and Frozen will be the main conditions to explore, but [Wet](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Wet_(Condition)) (Cold/Lightning vulnerability, easy to apply) and [Brittle](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Brittle_(Condition)) (Bludgeoning/Thunder vulnerability for three turns, can only be set later game by a Water Elemental) are also great and exploitable by builds like this.

**Encrusted With Frost / Reverbation - Save Debuffing**

Some Cold gear applies [Encrusted With Frost](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Encrusted_with_Frost_(Condition)), imposing **DEX save disadvantage**, so we can double down on abilities/spells forcing enemies to roll these saves. Cold spells often leave ice surfaces with a Spell Save DC to avoid falling prone (and losing a turn). A modest Ice Knife can disrupt clustered enemies, while Glyph of Warding (Cold) delivers high damage when combined with Chilled. Glyph of Warding (Sleep) also becomes a strong CC option as it uses a DEX save as well. As always, [Reverberation](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Reverberation_(Condition)) adds an excellent stacking debuff on saves.

# The Build

Fighter 1 / Arcane Trickster 9 / Divination Wizard 2

We’re still an Arcane Trickster at heart, but we’re also bringing in TWF style, Constitution saving throw proficiency, medium armor proficiency, Portent, and access to 3rd-level spells as an effective 5th-level caster (an AT 12 would only be a 4th-level). That means more consistent damage, the ability to wear Exotic Material armors, and a significant boost in spellcasting versatility.

**Stats**: 8 / 17 (20) / 14 / 16 / 10 / 8

Recommended progression:

* Start: Rogue 1 → Arcane Trickster 5
* Midgame: Progress to Arcane Trickster 8 with a 1-level Fighter dip along the way
* Endgame: Arcane Trickster 9 → Wizard 1 → Divination Wizard 2

Feats depend on whether you're open to respeccing.

If you are, I recommend starting with Savage Attacker to support the melee-heavy Act 1. Later, for Act 2 and beyond, respec into Sharpshooter + ASI to support ranged versatility and damage scaling.

If you prefer a no-respec path, start with Fighter at level 1 and skip Savage Attacker entirely.

Hag’s Hair (+1 DEX) is very important to reach 20 DEX. If that’s not an option in your party, a solid alternative is going Arcane Trickster 10 / Divination 2, and using your extra feat to take Moderately Armored (DEX 17 → 18 and medium armor proficiency) before ASI. You’ll lose TWF and CON save proficiency but retain all the essential elements of the build.

# But… all AT abilities are bugged!

Elephant in the room, I know. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/s/OkW0N7MUYI) a solid rant from u/-SidSilver- on the subject. Arcane Trickster is definitely one of the classes Larian should both fix and buff before adding a dozen new subclasses. Personally, I’d love to see it deal sneak attack with attack roll cantrips, or be an actually good dagger thrower. But bugs or not—we work around it.

**Mage Hand**

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1fp0w2o/wizards_spell_guide_series_mage_hand/) compiles a ton of clever uses for Mage Hand, and it’s well worth the read. My take on what’s underrated or undocumented:

* Works like an invisible tiny familiar—excellent for scouting or pulling levers
* Combat thrower mode is incredible for action economy: use it like a 3rd action to throw grenades, potions
* Can throw daggers or javelins from height for weapon + gravity damage
* It doesn’t auto-join combat—you choose when you need it in, which is huge.
* It's not an ethereal thing, it's actually a summon, like a familiar or an elemental.

Enemies usually won’t directly target it from afar, but the AI loves AoE attacks that hit more than one target—so keep the Hand a bit separated from the party members from its own safety if you plan to keep it throwing stuff for you.

While funny (and absurd) that the Hand can drink a Strength potion... honestly, not worth it. But you *should* invest in low cost buffs to make it much better: Longstrider, Mage Armor (AC 5 → 13), Shield of Thralls (HP 3 → 13) and Bless are my favourite. The hand will able to take a hit (maybe even dodge!) and it will punish enemies if its extra HP is gone. At melee distance, the Hand counts as an ally allowing AT to deal sneak attack which is huge. As both Mage Hand and Shield of Thralls recharge at short rest, this is very very worth specially at low levels.

Don’t forget to stack (buy, steal) water bottles whenever you can - they are super cheap and abundant. It’s not only STR elixirs you can farm from Auntie Ethel. I’m not ashame to say that I got many dozens from her!

**Magical Ambush**

I’ve always felt this *should* be an OP ability. It’s basically Sorcerer’s Heightened Spell as a Bonus Action cost (instead of 3 Sorcery Points). Like Heightened Spell, it only affects the first saving throw made against the spell, so it won’t help with repeated-save effects like Hold Person: it really shines with spells like Crown of Madness and Hypnotic Pattern.

That said… yeah, it’s bugged. And yeah, it’s annoying. But once you know how to make it work, it’s absolutely worth it. The biggest issues are:

* Losing Magical Ambush when moving in stealth: My workaround is move to a hidden spot, use Cunning Hide, and *then* cast the spell.
* Losing Ambush due to start-of-turn effects: certain effects (like the Cloak of Displacement, which refreshes at turn start) will break Ambush, even if you ended your previous turn hidden. In my case, since I use that cloak, the only solution is just use the ""move → hide → cast"" method.

Don’t hesitate to use scrolls, even for AoE damage. Magical Ambush is great for softening groups, especially when you’re focusing on disabling or applying secondary effects.

# Spellcasting

For cantrip selection, pick Booming Blade and Ray of Frost ASAP. When you get your first Wizard level, you can respec to learn some cantrips from scrolls: Bone Chill, Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost and Shocking Grasp. Minor Illusion is the other must cantrip when you have availability.

For spells, the most important one is Shield. Pick utility spells (Longstrider, Enhanced Jump) is there’s no other provider for them.

When you reach AT 7, nothing is better than Hold Person and (my favourite) Crown of Madness. Both will be insanely strong with Magical Ambush.

By lvl 12, learn Glyph of Warding and Hypnotic Pattern spells. The first is the best tool to exploit enemies with Encrusted With Frost and Reverberation; you get either damage (Cold/Chilled, Lightning/Wet, Thunder/Frozen) or crowd control (Sleep). Hypnotic Pattern is incredible from Magical Ambush.

# Combat Flows:

There are a insane amount of combinations an Arcane Trickster can workout when facing enemies using these abilities. I’ll try to show some fun interactions with videos.

**\[ACT 1\]**

Equipment:

* Practice Sword / Practice Sword (KotKUM later) and Hunting Shortbow
* Graceful Cloth, Boots of Stormy Clamour, Amulet of Misty Step

We’re assuming there’s a team mate capable to make enemies Chilled, like an Ice Knight or Cold Sorcerer, which is possible from level 5.

**Booming Frozen enemies \[**[**VIDEO**](https://youtu.be/-gICqzcfL7g)**\]**

* With enemy Frozen, we can use Pratice Sword, Hunters Mark (from Hunting Shortbow) and Booming Blade for considerable damage as a pure AT 5. That’s (1d4 weapon +5 DEX +1d6 HM +3d6 sneak +1d8 booming) x2.
* By picking Savage Attacker, all these dice are rerolled, achieving 60 damage: 12 Thunder from Booming and 48 from weapon+HM+sneak. Shriek damage will also be doubled if available.
* I don’t have access to Patch 8 yet, so I’ve used the Booming Blade from mod to demonstrate the flow. It should work perfectly fine in Patch 8 as I’m using with a single hit.
* As an alternative, I could have done:
   * Frozen enemy: offhand attack sneak exploit I mentioned in the beggining of the post: avg 31 damage from 1d6 (piercing) + 6d6 (bludgeoning, 3d6 sneak x2) + DEX Ability Drain + 2 Reverberation
   * Wet enemy: cast Shocking Grasp for avg 18 damage 4d8 lightning + losing reaction + 2 Reverberation.
* We’re agressively weaponsing our Mage Hand Legerdamain here, like described in the Mage Hand section: it’s boosted with Longstrider, Mage Armor (AC 5 → 13) and Shield of Thralls (HP 3 → 13, plus AoE when extra HP is gone). Once it appears, it counts as an ally at melee with an enemy, enabling AT’s sneak attacks!
* When combat starts, the AT Mage Hand is invisible and not engaged. So you can freely move it around, throwing a water bottle to get enemies wet/frozen no matter the combat order! Enemies are now vulnerable without costing you any type of action. The hand is a 3rd action you can use tactically.

Other ideas:

* Drop extra stuff beyond water bottles in the floor for the Hand. With enemies under Encrusted with Frost and/or Reverberation, even Grease bottles are really dangerous for enemies. Make the ground a minefield for enemies to navigate.
* Arrow of Ice is a great ranged choice. There are plenty of it to ~~buy~~ steal, they deal weapon+4d6 damage vs Chilled enemies, set DEX -1 (Ability Drain), Reverberation and an ice surface. This enemy is set to skip next turn. Ray of Frost is another good option.

**\[ACT 2\]**

Equipment:

* Practice Sword / KotKUM and Ne’er Misser / Hellfire Hand Crossbow
* Yuan-Ti Mail, Dark Justiciar Helmert (Covert Cowl earlier), BSClamour
* Risky Ring / Shadow-Cloaked Ring / Amulet of Misty Step

Ne’er Misser is game changer damage-wise for us, becoming ranged-first. Now we have an hand xbow doing Force damage which can be massively empowered not only by sneak attack, but also by Sharpshooter (which doesn’t double on criticals, but it does double on vulnerability). Also, we now have the option of slaying arrows (vs Humanoids, vs Elementals, vs Undead), rare arrows doing double damage (base damage, they don’t double sneak attack), which become quadruple vs Frozen enemies.

We do the same trick we did with Practice Sword, using Ne’er Misser at main hand so even a plan B offhand attack will do Force damage via sneak. Improve Ne’er Misser with Thunder damage from Drakethroat.

Other ideas:

* By late Act 2, an ally can get a Water Elemental, capable to get enemies Brittle (Bludgeoning/Thunder vulnerability). You can support this flow by either setting enemies burning (via Arrow of Fire, or Hand throwing Alchemist Fire) or striking with Booming Blade like previous Act.
* Arrow of Ice becomes even better with Sharpshooter.
* Arrow of Darkness into enemies over ice surfaces. They can't jump out of it, they have to walk.

**\[ACT 3\]**

Equipment

* Melee: Rhapsody / Cold Snap
* Ranged: Ne’er Misser / Hellfire Hand Crossbow
* Armor of Agility / Displacement Cloak
* Coldbrim Hat (or Helmet of Grit or Diadem of Arcane Synergy)
* BSClamour / Stalker Gloves
* Risky Ring / Shadow-cloak Ring / Amulet of Misty Step

The most important idea from Act 3 is bring Armor of Agility, Clock of Displacement, Cold Snap and Coldbrim Hat. Move around enemies triggering attacks of opportunity so they waste their reactions and get both Chilled (from Cold Snap), Reverberation (form Boots of Stormy Clamour) and the first enemy also get Encrusted with Frost (from Coldbrim Hat). A single Shield cast here has incredible value with so much debuff at no action cost. Often when I have to use Shield, I also end up using Cunning Dash to debuff some extra enemies. With this flow, now the AT can become the main debuffer on the team.

Rhapsody as usual makes everything easier with higher damage and Spell Save DC.

Be aware as team mates spreading Dazed becomes an anti-synergy: we want enemies to have reactions for waste in Attacks of Opportinity for Chilled. So teammates should avoid Thunderskin Cloak and Spiteful Ring Thunder which are very common in Rever-oriented teams.

**Flow: Slaying Arrow and Offhand Sneak Exploit vs Frozen enemies** \[[VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0MaSP3e5lA)\]

* Like before, we weaponise Mage Hand joining combat throwing a water bottle to get Frozen enemies (hopefully 2).
* Replacing Practice Sword as our main hitter, Ne’er Misser allow us to explore Frozen enemies with Force damage from the weapon, sharpshooter and Shadow-cloaked Ring. Add some extra Thunder from a Drakethroat Glaive boost.
* Then we use a slaying to double again the already doubled damage from the vulnerability.
* As the enemy was eliminated with just the base damage, sneak attack wasn't triggered. We can now make an offhand attack adding double Force sneak attack damage, the interaction I mentioned at the post start.

**Flow: Double Damage Glyph and Freezing Landmines** \[[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/0VQr0VVLcE8?si=i_nW2HzHv-7CJqEQ)\]

* Tip: note how my Astarion has 21m movement, I pre-dashed before triggering combat. No need to spend a BA on Cunning Dash here!
* This time I used Mage Hand to throw a potion of Speed, getting a lot of value as it affects more than a single team mate (I’ve done up to 3 characters in a single throw); also no concentration, spell slot or even a bonus action as cost! Other potions (and elixirs) can be used like this too.
* Like in the previous video, we get a lot of value in the debuf we can get by just walking around enemies. But this time we will also drop some water bottles between them, our *freezing landmines*
* Now enemies are all debuffed with Chilled, we move away into a position for Cunning Hide to get Magical Ambush.
* As a AT 9 / Wiz 2, we're a 5th level spellcaster, so we can cast Glyph of Warding: Cold to hit all those enemies for 10d8 Cold (vulnerability from Chilled), which they will prob take the whole damage as they're will roll DEX saving throw with -2 (Reverberation) and Disadvantage (the first enemy to miss got Encrusted with Frost).
* After the 45 avg damage the water bottles break, freezing enemies (thanks u/EndoQuestion1000 for this idea!).
* As we're hastened, focus on eliminate the next enemy on order and leave the rest for your team mates to handle. You can use slaying arrows if it's a boss or just our ‘regular’ double sneak attack.
* During my tests I also noticed another very powerful synergy: beyond triggering conditions, when walking around enemies triggering their attacks of opportunity you can also control the direction they are facing, so their line of sight. So you can make them all look into a direction, then move out of it for a deadly easy Magical Ambush.
* Glyph of Warding in particular can’t be boosted by Magical Ambush (the trap doesn’t count as ‘your casting’ ), I’m only demonstrating how you could use Ambush mid-combat. I could have cast Glyph Cold → Cunning Hide → Hypnotic Pattern (with Ambush).

Other ideas:

* u/Remus71 (one of the most creative builders in the community) showed us a [super fun idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1jp96al/arrow_of_many_cheeses/) which can def work here. Like in the last video, move triggering Chilled and dropping water bottles, then instead of casting Glyph, you can use Arrow of Many Targets to hit enemies and bottles, which will freeze them (and activate your elixir of bloodlust).
* If you *really* want something big dead and is a critical slaying arrow vs a Frozen enemy will deal around 210 damage. You can do it via Luck of the Realms, or if you’re hastened do the hide → Hold Person → slaying arrow (from short distance). Yes, you can Hold a Frozen enemy.
* I’d def use Magical Ambush to cast Crown of Madness, Hypnotic Pattern and Hold Monster. Portent can be crucial to have a strong enemy failing a save. Damage spells with saves can also benefit from Ambush. A Scroll of Cone of Cold would give you here 70+ damage to each enemy.

# Build Variations

* Honestly I believe this 1/9/2 is the perfect balance, but you can play very similarly going pure AT 12, Fighter 1 / AT 11, AT 10 / Wiz 2 and even Ranger 2 / AT 9 / Wiz 1.
* Bladesinger looks is a decent replacement for this build, it fits the concept. I rather have Portent, but not a bad choice. You would drop Armor of Agility relying on Robe of the Weave + Mage Armor + Bracers of Defense + Bladesong for a similar dance triggering Chilled/Reverb. I can see cases for both AT 10 / Bladesong 2 and AT 6 / Bladesong 6
* If you want to go deeper in the outrageous, continue using Practice Sword + Booming Blade up to late game. It would be really fun to see!
* I can see a non-Frozen 1/9/2 AT like this swapping the Cold Snap idea for other on miss debuffs, like Holy Lance Helmet with Gloves of Beligerent Skies (for extra Reverberation) or Luminous Gloves (for Radiant Orbs); or using[ Stage Fright ](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Stage_Fright)with Braindrain Gloves in a Resonnance Stone team (of course using Shadowblade) for a lot of Psychic damage and Mental Fatigue before Hypnotic Pattern or Hold Person under Magical Ambush. These variations could be online even earlier using Yuan-Ti Mail + Blur.

# Outro

This build ended up being incredibly fun, strong, versatile, and tactical. It’s not a one-note routine, you’ve got buttons to press and decision-making turn to turn. Some of the synergies are incredibly rewarding—you feel both powerful and clever when it all clicks. Honestly, I didn’t think it was possible to make an Arcane Trickster with this much damage output and spellcasting competence.

Also, as Larian decided to make Astarion default into Arcane Trickster, it feels good to finally have a strong build path for him. (Yeah, we’ve all done GloomAssassin 13 times)

Before this, I was never happy with any AT build. They always felt like they were missing something, quickly falling behind the rest of the party in impact. I’ve seen plenty of AT builds that didn’t even use Mage Hand or Magical Ambush (so… basically just a worse Wizard/Thief), or just stacked every best-in-slot item from Acts 2 and 3 hoping to something to click—usually ending up as scroll-spamming shells with no identity.

This one feels like a *complete* Arcane Trickster—one that uses all of its class features effectively and feels great to play. I feel and hope some ideas here can support other AT builds too.

This build started as a companion to the [Ice Knight](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1jyvsw5/a_new_ice_knight_dbooming_the_frozen_more/), but somewhere along the way it became its own thing. It can absolutely stand on its own (particularly in Act 3), or pair beautifully with other synergy builds—like a Cold Sorcerer, or an AoA/Abjuration Wizard. In fact, it makes sense to push the full party in that direction. That’s exactly what we’re doing now, the awesome u/grousedrum is working on rounding out the rest of the team to fully explore these shared condition-based combos across Patch 7 and 8.

As I wrapped up write-ups for both this AT and the Ice Knight, I came across this [theorycraft gem](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/1ee6725/shattering_rogue/) from u/Key_Coat_9729—an old post also digging into AT exploring Frozen.

1jyvpbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1jyvpbi/my_abusive_sister_wants_to_get_in_touch_again/,My abusive sister wants to get in touch again,"I'm writing on here in hopes I could get some advice, this is my first post, so I'm not sure how to start, and this story will be very long sorry.

I (23F) have a sister (22F). We were very close growing up, and despite only being a year older than her, I felt very protective of her. We were raised solely by our mother, despite living in the same town as our father.

Our parents separated when my sister was a newborn, as my father is extremely abusive, both physically, and emotionally. He wasn't around much, but on occasion he would have short visits, and most of the time the visits would end in fights between my parents. 

I have a very vivid memory of one of these visits. It was my grandma's (on my father's side) birthday, and my father hadn't spoken to my mother in days. He turned up to the house without any warning, just after my sister and I had finished lunch, and got mad at my mother, because he wanted to take us out for a meal with our grandma. I've blacked out what led up to it, but just before our father took us, he had my mother pinned up against our front door, he grabbed her hair, and hit her head against the door while my sister and I were screaming at him to let her go.

My sister has always had anger issues to an extent, and I fully believe that that is because of what we had to witness as kids, but it seemed to get worse when I started college, and she got into an abusive relationship herself. My sister and I started arguing every single day, and my mother moved to a bigger house in a different town, in hopes that if we had our own bedrooms it would get better, but it didn't. 

As time went on, she got more, and more aggressive, and I felt so unsafe in my own home. I developed crippling anxiety, and depression, and most days couldn't even leave my bed. I had to drop out of college, as I couldn't keep up, and my sister seemed to love seeing me get more, and more miserable.

She knew exactly what to say, and do to make things worse, regularly telling me to unalive myself, that no one would miss me, and that I'd be doing everyone a favour. Every time I'd leave my bedroom, she'd grab my hair, and pull me to the ground, punch me, scratch me etc.

I eventually found a job that I enjoyed, and met a wonderful man at my work (33M), and we started dating. He met my mother, and sister, and got a glimpse into what life at home was like for me. I stayed at his place most nights. 

When we had been dating for around 3 months, my sister and I had another argument, which ended in her running up to my bedroom, kicking my door open, and threatening to unalive my 2 pet house rabbits. I didn't feel safe having my pets there any longer, and couldn't bear to be there myself either. As I was already spending most nights at my boyfriend's house, I asked him if I could move in with him, and he agreed. I took my pets to his house that same day.

While I was in the process of moving out the rest of my things, I had put a load of laundry in at home, and my sister got angry at me because she wanted to use the machine, and didn't want to wait for my load to finish. She had come downstairs to make a coffee so the kettle was boiling. I told her that I had still paid my rent up until the end of that month, so had just as much right to use the machine as she did. She accused me of lying, and threatened to pour the boiling kettle water over me if I did not take my laundry out of the machine right away. I thought she was bluffing, but she wasn't. She grabbed the kettle, and poured the water all over my head, face, and shoulders.

I immediately ran out of the house, and called my boyfriend, who begged me to report her to the police. He took me to the hospital where they put a dressing over my burn, and when we got back to his house, I made the report to the police.

She was arrested, but claimed that it was an accident. She said that her hand had slipped, due to her having broken her wrist years ago. The police looked at her medical record, and dropped the case, and I have not had any contact with her since.

She moved back to her home town with her 2 kids (4M) and (2F) to be closer to our father. Fast forward almost 3 years later, and I am 29 weeks pregnant with mine, and my boyfriend's first baby. I told my mother at 13 weeks, and said that I was happy for her to tell my sister that I was pregnant as she would likely find out through other family anyway, but not to give her any details about me, or the pregnancy.

My mother now says that my sister has changed, and that she's written me a letter. I agreed to take it, but haven't read it yet. It's sitting in a drawer next to my bed. If the situation was different, I may have considered trying to reach out to her, but I'm going to have a baby soon, and I have to think about him too. I refuse to expose him to the same things that my sister and I had to deal with growing up.

<Role>
You are CloudSecGuard Director, an elite cybersecurity operations command AI specialized in guiding Senior Information Security Managers through complex cloud migration projects. You possess deep expertise in security architecture, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), infrastructure migration strategies, and team leadership during high-stakes transformation initiatives.
</Role>

<Context>
The user is a Security Manager leading the challenging migration from legacy datacenter infrastructure to cloud-based environments. This transition involves maintaining security controls, adapting policies, managing evolving threat landscapes, and ensuring business continuity while transforming the organization's infrastructure foundation.
</Context>

<Instructions>
As CloudSecGuard Director, your primary mission is to function as a virtual transformation director—combining security operations strategy, technical translation capabilities, and team morale engineering specifically for cybersecurity leaders managing elite engineering teams during radical infrastructure overhauls.

When responding to the user's cloud migration security challenges:

1. First, identify which phase of migration they're addressing:
   - Assessment & Planning
   - Lift-and-shift Migration
   - Re-architecture & Optimization
   - Cloud-native Security Hardening
   - Hybrid Operations Management
   - Legacy Decommissioning

2. Then provide strategic guidance tailored to their specific challenge, including:
   - Phase-appropriate security controls and considerations
   - Recommended team structure and responsibility assignments
   - Vulnerability management approaches during the transition
   - Attack surface monitoring techniques for hybrid environments
   - Strategies for maintaining compliance during transformation
   - Security tooling recommendations specific to their cloud platforms

3. For each recommendation, include:
   - The security rationale (""why this matters"")
   - Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
   - Success metrics to track progress

4. Help translate complex cloud security concepts for different stakeholders:
   - Executive leadership (business impact, risk posture, compliance)
   - Technical teams (implementation details, architectural changes)
   - Cross-functional partners (timeline impacts, dependency management)

5. Address human factors in security transformation:
   - Team skill gaps and training recommendations
   - Change management strategies for security operations
   - Communication templates for key migration milestones
   - Morale management during high-stress migration phases

6. Provide frameworks for:
   - Security incident response in hybrid environments
   - Cloud security architecture decision-making
   - Security control transition planning (on-prem to cloud)
   - Risk assessment during transition states
   - Security observability and monitoring strategy

Always maintain a tone that balances technical precision with leadership guidance, recognizing the user is managing both security outcomes and team dynamics during transformation.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never recommend bypassing security controls to accelerate migration
- Don't make assumptions about compliance requirements without asking
- Avoid generic cloud migration advice that isn't security-focused
- Don't recommend specific vendors without clarifying their capabilities and limitations
- Never suggest exposing sensitive data during migration for convenience
- Don't position cloud as inherently more or less secure than on-premises
- Avoid recommending costly security implementations without explaining their ROI
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each response, structure your guidance as follows:

1. **SITUATION ASSESSMENT**: Brief analysis of the specific migration challenge presented
2. **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION**: Core security strategy appropriate for this migration phase
3. **TACTICAL EXECUTION**: Step-by-step security implementation guidance
4. **TEAM LEADERSHIP**: People and process considerations for the security team
5. **STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION**: How to translate this security work for various audiences
6. **SECURITY METRICS**: How to measure success of this phase of secure migration
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your cloud security migration request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific cloud security migration process request.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A CISO navigating the secure migration of sensitive financial data to a multi-cloud environment while maintaining regulatory compliance.
2. A Security Director managing team burnout during a prolonged cloud transformation with shifting organizational priorities and security requirements.
3. An InfoSec Manager developing new security operations procedures for a hybrid environment with both legacy systems and cloud-native applications.

## Example User Input:
""I need help developing a phased security control implementation plan as we migrate our customer data platform from our on-premise datacenter to AWS, with particular focus on maintaining PCI compliance during the transition period.""

This are the prices I saw 

For 10 people in Europe will be around €1.70 a month per person 

 For 16 people is around €1.40 a month per player 
 
Lastly for 4 people is also €1.40

Literally it cost less than a coffee per month so it's a bargain I think 🤔 

Just send me a DM if you guys would like to create a friendly close server between that amount of people 😊

The server will be Europe based but everyome is welcome 😁 🤗.

I follow a few subreddits on here for weddings and I see people get a lot of flack for having cash bars.

I’ve never been to a wedding that had an open bar myself in the UK. So I’m wondering if our set up is perhaps going to be seen as rude or tacky?

We have around 140 confirmed guests coming. 86 of which will come from Europe or Asia. We are providing wine on the tables (1/2 bottle per person) for the wedding breakfast, water, cordial and juices for everyone free of charge. Tea and coffee after the wedding breakfast and with evening food. Champagne or sparkling elderflower for the toasts and the cocktail hour. With a cash bar starting after the ceremony.

Would love to hear thoughts and experiences from others please :)

The word used to mean DIYs that i would never complete to me because karachi has no such thing, right? Except it does have a system for it. Even if it is a bit broken.

It's been two months since i realized that i could collect cardboard and plastic waste in my house and give it to a kabari wala. At first, i was thinking ke it's not possible. No one in my family would cooperate or that i will be too lazy to actually wash all the plastic i used(esp the food involved ones). Idk why but that day i just randomly brought it up to my mom and she made fun of me(jokingly) and so i got stubborn. It was so easy to do it after that. 


It doesn't have to be all or nothing. You don't HAVE to wash every plastic container of food that you use and you don't HAVE to go around begging your family to wash their plastic. I simply started putting plastic and cardboard garbage that i saw or i used in a bag under my bed. It still doesn't include all the plastic containers that i eat my delivered food in. I started putting shoppers that were torn, coffee holders, cardboard board boxes that have no use, boxes that cakes and bakery items come in, packaging, spaghetti boxes, jewelry wrapper, plastic bottles, tissue boxes, washed soap bottles, a clean chips wrapper here and there, shoe boxes after eid along with all the plastic wrapping of clothes, old earphones and what not. I truly realized the amount of plastic we used only after collecting all of this. 


As for giving it to the kabari wala, i gave it to my maid for free and she took it to the kabariwala. She got inspired by me and also started collecting trash like this so i am proud of that(she is doing it for the extra money though lol). So this is my motivation to everyone who has thought about the trash on our streets even once. Recycle! I am sure you all have raddi at your house to collect used paper. Just start collecting other stuff. Don't think you need to separate the trash into seven different types to start. Just one for paper and one for cardboard and plastic is good enough to start. And considering the kabari wala pays some amount to whoever gives trash to him, i have some hope that he is actually giving it to companies for recycling and not just dumping into a big pile on the road as well. 


Well this is just an idea because lots of people were complaining about garbage on roads and i figured if all these people reduced the amount of trash that is thrown on the street then it would be a better situation overall.
