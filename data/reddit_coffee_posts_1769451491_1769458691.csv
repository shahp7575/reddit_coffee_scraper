Do they work, are they worth it?","I’m looking to get some form of hormone balancer and/or weight loss support supplements that aren’t inositol. I’ve tried several versions of it and every single time it would make me very sick even after a month or longer of taking it regularly. 

I’ve heard a lot of good things about Ryze, the mushroom powder coffee supplement thing that supposedly boosts metabolism, digestion, and boosts energy(?), and Primal Queen, a beef organ based supplement that’s scientifically backed to help balance hormones and weight loss for women. Weight loss is my big thing because I’ve been working out and dieting for almost a year and have lost 45lbs but need to lose more before my wedding in June. It fluctuates so much and my stomach has become so weirdly painful recently in my upper abdomen and everyone just keeps telling me it’s PCOS related and to find supplements that help. But how well do these really work? Can they work for people with PCOS? I’ve seen a fair number of endometriosis success stories with PQ but hadn’t seen much on Ryze successes or just reviews on Ryze for metabolism/energy/etc in general.

1qnrbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1qnrbie/burnout_and_apathy_what_do_i_do/,Burnout and apathy - what do I do?,"I've always felt exhausted daily even after a full night's sleep. It affects my mood, my focus, and my ability to do anything except the bare minimum at work. 

I recently was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea, and have now had a CPAP machine for the past week. I can barely sleep with my current mask on, and I'm working on troubleshooting (getting an SD card for more data, trying different masks, pressures, humidity, ramp feature, etc.).

My question is this - how do I function in work/life in the short-term while I'm figuring this out?

I have spent so long forcing myself to work despite the brain fog, lack of energy, crushing fatigue. Now that I'm extra-tired from adjusting to the CPAP, and I feel no motivation at all. I used to be excited to do my job, but months (and really years) of fatigue have taken their toll. I look at my list of work tasks and feel nothing except a growing dread and anxiety that someone will soon notice how much isn't being done. 

My friend suggested I ""push through"" and I wanted to laugh. 

PUSH THROUGH??! PUSH THROUGH?!?!?! Gee f--kin whiz, I never thought of THAT before!!! I'll just drink another coffee and be fine!!!!! I must be an IDIOT for not thinking of THAT!!!!!

My guy, my dear sweet summer child, I've been like this so long I have forgotten what's even normal. Sometimes at work I lock myself in the single-occupancy locker room, and just lie motionless on the tile floor with the florescent light burning through my eyelids and wonder if I'll ever feel okay again. Until I think it's been too long and someone will notice I'm not at my desk. Then I drag myself off the floor and carry on another day. Coffee is nothing but a fleeting band-aid for my soul.

Now with the adjustment to the CPAP, I'm (hopefully temporarily) sleeping less than ever and I really feel like I'm at a breaking point. I can't summon the will to perform my job and I wish that there were some way of explaining this.

Anyway, any tips or ideas would be appreciated. Or at the least the knowledge that other people have felt like this. Thanks!",1,1769458100.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

I was handed down a vertuo plus machine about a year ago. It had been purchased at least 3-4 years prior to me receiving it but had not been used at all during that time.

Unfortunately, it isn't an issue I can fix with cleaning/descaling, and I was offered to either get 35% off of a new machine or send my vertuo plus in for repairs for $65. 

Is it worth it to get my machine repaired considering it is relatively old? I know the newer vertuo models have issues of their own, so I am a little hesitant to buy a new one.

1qnr87b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fayettenam/comments/1qnr87b/inherited_aunts_house_in_fayetteville_considering/,Inherited aunt's house in Fayetteville - considering moving there from Boston. What's life actually like?,"Fayetteville people, I need some real talk from locals because I'm considering a big life change. My aunt is moving to Florida to be closer to her grandkids, and she offered to transfer her house in Fayetteville to me for way below market value - $195k (it's worth around $235k based on recent sales in the area). It's a 3-bed/2-bath built in 2010, decent shape, needs minor cosmetic updates but nothing major.

I'm 31, work in digital marketing (fully remote), currently paying $2,100/month for a tiny studio in Boston. I love Boston - the history, the seasons, walkability - but I'm burned out. Winters are brutal, cost of living is insane, and my remote salary would go so much further somewhere else.

Here's what I'm trying to figure out about Fayetteville:

Pros I'm seeing. Way cheaper cost of living. Actual space and a yard. Milder winters (I'm so tired of shoveling snow). North Carolina seems beautiful. Home ownership vs throwing money at rent.

My concerns: What's the weather actually like year-round? Is summer unbearably hot and humid? What's there to do for someone in their early 30s - restaurants, coffee shops, any kind of social scene?

Big one for me: I love long walks and hiking. Are there good trails, parks, nature areas around Fayetteville? I'm used to being able to walk everywhere in Boston - is Fayetteville more car-dependent?

Would I be completely bored coming from a major East Coast city? My aunt keeps saying ""it's quiet but there's plenty to do, and Raleigh is close if you need more,"" but she's 68, so her idea of ""plenty to do"" might be different than mine.

For people who moved to Fayetteville from bigger cities - did you adjust? Any regrets? What do you actually do for fun?

And locals - honestly, is there a good outdoors/nature scene? Quality of life for a single person in their 30s?

My aunt mentioned if I hate it, there are local cash buyers that could buy it quickly, but I don't want to make a decision with an ""escape plan"" already in mind.

1qnr7k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qnr7k2/why_motivation_dies_and_discipline_is_the_only/,Why Motivation Dies and Discipline Is the Only Way Out: The Psychology That Actually Works,"We’ve all felt it. That burst of motivation where you swear this is the month you change everything. You buy the shoes. Download the app. Promise yourself you’re finally locked in.

And then three days later, you’re scrolling TikTok at 2am wondering where that fire went.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: motivation is unreliable. Not useless, but flaky. I spent years reading research from behavioral psychology, habit science, and people like BJ Fogg and James Clear trying to understand why motivation keeps failing us.The conclusion is simple. Motivation shows up when it feels like it. Discipline shows up no matter what.

And biologically, your brain is wired to resist effort and chase comfort. Add social media, instant gratification, and constant dopamine hits, and you’ve got a system designed to kill consistency.

The good news is, once you understand this, you can actually beat it.Motivation is a visitor, discipline is a residentMotivation feels great, but it’s emotional. It depends on sleep, mood, stress, environment, and energy. That means it can disappear overnight.

Most people fail because they wait to feel ready. Disciplined people don’t. They act even when they feel tired, unmotivated, bored, or unconfident.Motivation is weather. Discipline is showing up whether it’s sunny or storming.

Build systems instead of chasing goalsGoals sound inspiring, but systems get results.

Want to write a book? The system is writing a little every day.  
Want to get fit? The system is moving daily, not waiting for motivation.

When something becomes automatic, it stops relying on willpower. The same way you brush your teeth without thinking, your important habits should become default behavior.

Your environment is shaping your behavior more than your willpowerIf bad habits are easy and good habits are hard, discipline will feel impossible.Make good habits easy. Put books where you’ll see them. Lay out workout clothes. Remove apps that waste your time. Reduce friction wherever you can.

You don’t need more motivation. You need fewer obstacles.

Stack habits onto things you already do

Add new habits onto existing routines.  
After coffee, take a few deep breaths.  
After brushing your teeth, do a few pushups.  
After lunch, go for a short walk.

Your brain already recognizes the trigger. You’re just extending the pattern.

Tools like Finch help make this easier by turning habits into small, trackable actions that feel rewarding instead of punishing.If you want structured guidance, BeFreed can build personalized learning plans around discipline, focus, and habit-building using psychology research and expert insights. You can tailor it to things like ADHD, burnout, or consistency struggles and choose how deep you want the learning to go.

Start so small it feels almost sillyPeople quit because they start too aggressively.They try to work out for 90 minutes. Meditate for an hour. Change everything at once.Instead, start tiny. Two minutes. Five pushups. Fifty words. The goal isn’t intensity. It’s consistency.

Showing up matters more than doing a lot.Track your progress, even on bad daysTracking builds awareness. It also builds accountability.Some people mark calendars. Others use habit trackers. Whatever you choose, recording effort makes patterns visible and keeps momentum alive.

You don’t need perfection. You need consistency.

Accept that discipline won’t always feel good

Some days will feel boring. Heavy. Annoying. Uninspiring.Those are the days that actually build discipline.Every time you do the thing even when you don’t feel like it, you teach your brain that emotions don’t control your actions.That’s where real strength comes from.

Recover properly so you don’t burn out

Discipline without rest turns into exhaustion. You need downtime. You need sleep. You need recovery. Sustainable effort beats short bursts of intensity.

The goal is long-term consistency, not self-punishment.Know exactly why you’re doing thisIf your reason is weak, your discipline will be weak.

Don’t say “I want to improve.”  
Say “I want energy to play with my kids.”  
Say “I want to prove I can finish what I start.”

Make your reason personal. Make it emotional. Make it real.Stop waiting for the perfect timeThere is no perfect Monday. No perfect mood. No perfect setup.Start today. Start messy. Start small. Just start.Motivation will fade. Discipline is what stays.

Good but overwhelming,"Today I went on a first date (my first ever date really) with a guy from my college class who asked me out a few days ago. I suggested we see a certain movie because we have a lecture about it, and I think it was a good choice. We had about 40 minutes to just talk before the movie. The conversation actually went quite well, we actually talked a little too much and got to the theatre literally a few seconds before the movie started, so I think it went well.

During the movie we laughed, and made small comments to each other. He asked to hold my hand during the movie but I told him my hands are sweaty(which was true), and he let it go. But I don’t think it made things awkward, we kept talking even after that.

After the movie was over, we got coffee and talked for about an hour and a half. I definitely did not plan for a 90 minute conversation, but things flowed pretty well and we just spoke and shared a lot of things. We discovered we have a few things in common in our taste in media, interests, food, and even similar goals for after school. There were a few moments of awkward silence, but I noticed he quickly took over and led the conversation somewhere else.

He was very obviously interested, made lots of eye contact, gave me a lot of compliments, which felt nice but also a little weird because I’m not used to that kind of affection, especially from a man. I’m kind of shy with eye contact and touching, so I kept looking away or downwards.

Afterward he texted saying he had a great time and suggested we do this another time, that I'm an awesome person, and even saying that he’ll miss me until he sees me again. He uses a lot of emojis and exclamation marks, which isn’t really my style and it feels a bit forward, so I'm not too sure how to feel about that. I mean I don’t hate it, I just don’t text that way. We agreed to see each other again, probably for a walk next time.

So it was definitely a first, but a nice first. He seems really sweet and pretty similar to me in some ways. It’s funny because I thought he was shy when I first met him, and I thought I was going to have to ‘lead’ the date (which was okay), but he ended up being very forward and complimenting me a lot. I’m not really good at taking compliments so I just chuckled or smiled when he did it. Overall, I enjoyed the whole thing and I would like to see him again.

Is it too forward to tell me that he'll miss me already? Sending heart emojis and stuff? I mean, we don't really know each other and I don't want to seem like I'm leading him on or something...",2,1769457492.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

\- made the simplest kcal counter web app, where AI helps to organize food + adds missing details

\- no mobile yet

\- [2kkcal.com](http://2kkcal.com) 





Hello!

I have created an MVP for a kcal counter app. There are many of them of course, but none of them was comfortable and I decided to make the one I can really use.

So the problem I noticed in every single app is that they are overbloated. It's like you're paying idk, $10 per month and use like 1% of the functions. But to be honest it's not even a matter of money, it's just idk, for me it feels weird, maybe OCD, maybe something else, not really important. Another thing is that it was either web app or mobile app. Myself I prefer to organize things by the laptop/pc but I'd like to have an option to add stuff or at least save it while i'm in the kitchen

  
App which I made is as simple as possible (for now, but still will remain simple). 

\- data taken: nickname, email, height, year of birth, weight - used to calculate kcal intake (can be changed manually as well). Email is not used yet, if more ppl will use it I will deff include some kind of mailing system for password reset or something like that. 

\- Daily log - type a list to a prompter which will set it up in the table below or add manually. There is no list of meals, just a list of what was eaten (product like) + a timestamp

And... that's it. Subpage with a fancy githublike chart because I like it

Kcal + macros are editable, but one way only. I put a simple description on the top of the dashboard.  Pretty easy I think.

Also there are like 2 weight logger - one is in the profile during onboarding, for calculations of the kcal intake and another one, on dashboard with a date, to log current weight if anybody is interested. Why like this?

Weight is fluctuating for a lot of reasons. You will eat like salty fries, your body will keep more water, weight will go up, kcal intake will go up etc so in the end a person will start gaining weight instead of loosing :D

For now App has a free access, I just put a buy me a coffee link underneath if anybody want to use it. I did it for myself so I was not planning any subscriptions or anything but will see how it goes. 

And obviously the more details you add, the better. 

Now, about the development - I got a feedback from my friends that:

\- you can Add X Y Z - yes but it will go against the simplicity - I figured a way how to bypass it but not to break the aesthetics

\- why no feature with photo-kcal-counting - AI is not yet able to tell the exact kcal, results vary like 15-20% which is like 400kcal for 2000kcal base so... I am not planning to add it. Not reliable at all IMO

Also:

\- trying to implement a feature where you can send a photo of a nutrition table

\- same with adding speech - to - text 

\- and building some APIs to actually add stuff on mobiles

\- and add more charts with editable options which measurement compared to which (if somebody would like to measure like idk, fat intake vs weight log vs timestamp)

\- unfortunately mobile-web app is not really displaying well

As I said it's a 100% side project which I build for myself. But I am interested in feedback

1qnqv6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shadowthehedgehog/comments/1qnqv6l/thoughts_about_shadowss_segamandated_attitude/,Thoughts about Shadows’s Sega-Mandated attitude,"So, like many others, I dislike Shadow’s sega-mandated attitude. He’s mean, rude, cocky, arrogant and stuffy. I haven’t played Generations so idk what changes will follow.

His life is different after life on the Ark. He has freedom. He has friends regardless of whether or not he wants them. He has a job (working for GUN??), drives cars in races and gets to be alive and enjoy life. He gets coffee. He has a cute chao. He has more than he had before. Maybe Maria is gone but she’s not forgotten. Shadow has the life she wanted for him.

His attitude as a mean, arrogant jerk is frustrating because realistically, he should be the happiest little dude in the world. Just because he looks edgy doesn’t mean he has to be that way, but that again is just Sega and their mandates. He should be mostly smiles and grateful for his new life and freedom. He should be in therapy, and taking steps to stay happy. He should be allowed to cry and feel emotional things that are uncomfortable because that means he’s alive.

His dislike for Sonic shouldn’t exist. Sonic would be his biggest fan. Sonic would protect Shadow from a lot of things because he knows Shadow has suffered through many traumatic events. He would probably escort Shadow to therapy each week and wait patiently in the waiting room. Shadow and Sonic should be best friends.

If we were to look at Shadow realistically, I believe that if he was very successfully recaptured by Ark scientists and used as a test subject again, he’d be a terrified, scared baby. I imagine he would sob, beg, and pray for rescue. The loner thing would fall away so fast. He would be reminded that he isn’t free and that he doesn’t even belong to himself, and it would be agony for him. He would appreciate his current life a lot more.

Idk, I just think sega sucks at writing their characters. The mandates are a pain. I read the Archie comics through my childhood, since it started when I was like 8. I know there are reasons why sega is the way it is. But it’s just weird.",0,1769457180.0,shadowthehedgehog,0,0.5,False

Fast forward a few months later, i land a job as a bartender in my city and i become good friends with this girl i work with. We’ve grown quite close outside of work and she decided to invite me out one weekend for some casual drinks and to meet her friends. That’s when i meet (let’s call her aimee) my ex boyfriends best friend. Id of-course met her before whilst me and my ex were still together, but not properly. 

We got talking and i got to know her more throughout the evening, I thought she was really cool and when the night ended we exchanged socials (at this point I didn’t see her as anything beyond a friend) 

Over the next few weeks we spoke none stop, met up over coffee here and there, I mean the thought of coming home after a long shift at work to talk to her was honestly the only thing getting me through my day. That’s when i slowly started to realise I have feelings for her, like genuine feelings. 

I’ve also never had feelings like this for a girl before, like I know I’ve always been physically attracted to certain girls, like I’ve seen a girl and thought “yeah she’s hot” But I really like aimee, you know I wanna take her out, hold her hand, cuddle her, kiss her, I wanna be with her. 

I know that she’s bi herself, as I recall my ex telling me, however that obviously doesn’t mean that she’s necessarily gonna feel the same way. I feel like I’m getting mixed signals too, but I don’t wanna misinterpret her just being friendly as her flirting. 

Ofcourse it’s not just the matter of her possibly not liking me back, but also the fact that she’s best friend with my ex. I don’t think I owe anything to him, he ended things with me and he’s now in a relationship with someone else, but then maybe she wouldn’t want to get with me because she’d feel like shes going behind her friends back getting with his ex? 

I don’t know, my heads all over the place lol, what do you guys think I should do? Do I be straight with her and let her know how I feel? because I don’t wanna put our friendship at risk either and make things awkward.",1,1769457111.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Caffeine pouches aren’t positioned as replacements for coffee shops or traditional energy drinks. They’re being developed as a **portable caffeine option**. No liquid, no can, no bottle, no prep. Just a measured caffeine format designed for on-the-go use.

That matters because the company is clearly leaning into:

* convenience-focused consumption
* caffeine as a familiar, widely used stimulant
* formats that don’t rely on drinks

**Doseology Sciences’ non-nicotine approach** also matters here. These are caffeine-based energy pouches, not nicotine products, which places them in a different category and opens the format to a broader consumer base.

The recent move into **pilot production** is important in this context. This stage is about testing whether the product can be produced consistently, packaged properly, and repeated at a small scale. It’s not a commercial launch.. it’s a validation step.

If pilot production goes well, the conversation naturally shifts from *“does this product work?”* to *“what does the next phase look like?”*

That’s why 2026 stands out as the window to watch. Product adoption doesn’t happen instantly, but once a format proves repeatable, the focus moves to execution rather than ideas.

1qnqkt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1qnqkt2/ss16_is_autistic_has_gf_also_autistic/,SS16 is autistic & has gf also autistic&..,"So my ss16 has been dating this girl since middle of last year. The beginning of their relationship it was mostly just texting each other. So me and my DH thought it was harmless considering they don’t really go out on dates. Then the girls mom started asking to take SS out to visit at her place and take them out to do activities around town. 

August came along and invited SS(15 at the time) to go camping with them for a few days. We thought that would be nice and allowed him to go. A week after their camping trip the girls mom calls DH and tells him SS and gf had sex twice. SS tried to deny they had sex until the gf mom kept saying her daughter wouldn’t lie about it. After reading the texts between this girls mom and my SS, the girls mom basically left these two alone a lot during this camping trip. The mom left SS texts like, “make sure \*gf name\* eats breakfast and drinks water. And stuff like “make sure you guys come here in 15 minutes” and “I’ll be back at 8:30” sent at 3:30. Knowing that her daughter has disabilities(autistic and epilepsy)why would she think it was good idea to leave them unsupervised. 

The gf parents are divorced so when DH asked the gf mom if she told gf dad what happened at the camping trip gf mom said yes she told him. Just to find out this month the gf dad never knew about until recently, he said he figured out on his own. 

So from Sept-Dec they had limited visits but were texting daily. In dec the gf mom took SS/gf out for coffee and ended up bringing them to her friends house. They were there for awhile “dropping off gifts”.  I just don’t get why she had to go see her friend when she accompanying her daughter and SS. We made it clear that SS is not allowed the her apartment and they should be supervised when they visit each other. If the gf mom wants to take SS it has to be in a public place. 

This year the mom is constantly texting DH to ask for SS to have visit with her daughter and we just can’t trust the mom after the camping trip, taking SS to someone’s apartment we don’t know and not informing gf dad about SS and gf having had sex. 

The other problem is the gf is constantly texting SS that she “feels alone”, “no one understands me”, “that she always saying she can’t stop crying”. She’ll even say to SS “I’m sorry if I’m such a problem”. It just seems like she’s not emotionally ready for a relationship. We tried to suggest to SS to mention to his gf she should talk to her parents or school councillors about her feelings but she refuses. Right now me and DH want to put an end to this relationship because how pushy gf mom wants them to visit all the time and the gf negative texts she always send to SS. The gf also doesn’t seem to like SS sister (my sd13) calling her annoying and loud, we seen in a text. Even though sd believes they are friends.

Would we be wrong to stop this relationship or are there any other ideas how to go about this whole situation. ",1,1769456582.0,stepparents,3,1.0,False

I bough a pack of marshmallows made in uae recently, its ingredients don’t include egg, otherwise syrup, fish gelatin, and other stuff. It just tastes like sugar , nothing else. A hint of strawberry.  Is that what it’s supposed to taste like? Vanilla ones just taste like sugar fluffed up.

I microwaved it and it did expand but then hardened and turned rubbery in 2 seconds.? Is that how it’s supposed to be?

I toasted it on stove top and it did brown, but cooled down in like 30 seconds?

The one i microwaved has literally turned into hard candy like 4 minutes later.

I’ve seen people microwave and cook marshmallows and they make marshmallow fluff online but is something missing in mine?  Is the lack of egg?

I saw haribo imported marshmallows but they don’t have egg either? Just pork gelatin… is it the type of gelatin?

I was so excited to try marshmallows but I’m so disappointed 😩

I also added it on top of my coffee and other than dissolving like a syrup i didn’t notice anything else.  Are people in USA and Europe eating something else?",3,1769456443.0,foodquestions,5,1.0,False

Caffeine pouches aren’t positioned as replacements for coffee shops or traditional energy drinks. They’re being developed as a **portable caffeine option**. No liquid, no can, no bottle, no prep. Just a measured caffeine format designed for on-the-go use.

That matters because the company is clearly leaning into:

* convenience-focused consumption
* caffeine as a familiar, widely used stimulant
* formats that don’t rely on drinks

**Doseology Sciences’ non-nicotine approach** also matters here. These are caffeine-based energy pouches, not nicotine products, which places them in a different category and opens the format to a broader consumer base.

The recent move into **pilot production** is important in this context. This stage is about testing whether the product can be produced consistently, packaged properly, and repeated at a small scale. It’s not a commercial launch.. it’s a validation step.

If pilot production goes well, the conversation naturally shifts from *“does this product work?”* to *“what does the next phase look like?”*

That’s why 2026 stands out as the window to watch. Product adoption doesn’t happen instantly, but once a format proves repeatable, the focus moves to execution rather than ideas.

1qnqfx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheraSeven/comments/1qnqfx4/following_sheras_main_teachings_changed_my_life/,"Following Shera’s main teachings changed my life, and anyone can do it.","I want to start off with I am not with a rich man. I am with a man with a provider mindset. 

In 2019 I started watching shera’s videos, I can’t remember how i stumbled across her but it may have been through her witchcraft page. I was a teenager at the time getting out of a relationship with a dusty who was in his 30s. Super traumatized and ready to NEVER make the same mistake again. 

After that, I vowed I’d only be with someone who likes me 10x more. Who is consistent. who has a provider mindset. Those were my main priorities.

a few years later i met my now-fiance. utterly obsessed with me, to the point where his consistency basically freaked me out. I was so used to hot/cold dust behavior that a healthy dynamic was uncomfortable. but i powered through because i was hyper self aware, and knew that my attraction to dust was due to childhood trauma. 

My dad died within a year to our relationship. I was a shell of a human. basically bed ridden. He put my clothes on, brushed my teeth for me. fed me, would drive me 20 mins there and 20 mins back to my favorite coffee shop EVERY DAY bc it was the only thing that perked me up. 

I know Shera says to never show your weakness, but this wasn’t really something I was banking on experiencing so young, grief is a whole other thing. But the way he stepped up really showed how obsessed with me he was. 

We went through many other trials together. moved across the country twice (he paid for the move both times). But his main priorities have always been to take care of me and make me happy. 
I never mommied him, i wasn’t a barbara the builder, I focused on ME. 

Now, he makes 6 figures and fully provides. I haven’t seen a bill in years. Before we were even engaged he had an affidavit signed so that we were “domestic partners” and I could be put on his work-issued health insurance. I have his credit card in my wallet. And he is so obsessed with me it almost gives me the ick sometimes bc i’m like damn 😂😂😂 - but i’d rather have that than have my nervous system freaking out over some inconsistent dusty ass mf. 

Could I have a millionaire bf right now? 1000000% yes. But honestly that isn’t really my priority at the moment, and that’s fine. And the man i chose definitely has the skill and drive to become a millionaire, and I believe he will, but it won’t be with my help. If anything I’m a huge financial and time drain, but his biggest motivator too. he would NOT have the job he has now without my energy. We have a really symbiotic relationship. I motivate him to be better, but I don’t hold his hand and tell him what to do. 

I honestly think the only reason it works is because he knows I’m high value and could leave him for pretty much anyone without even blinking. 

So to all of the people who are new to shera and say “not everyone can marry a millionaire!”, please realize her teachings are much deeper than that. It’s about finding a man who isn’t a total POS and training him to serve you. It’s about self love. ",4,1769456299.0,SheraSeven,2,1.0,False
1qnqdiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1qnqdiy/how_do_you_actually_have_a_fun_wedding_while/,How do you actually have a FUN wedding while wearing a Christian wedding dress?,"Okay, real talk. My fiancé and I are planning our wedding, and while faith is a huge part of it, we also want this day to be genuinely fun, like people-still-talking-about-it-years-later fun. Not just a quiet ceremony followed by polite small talk. We want joy, laughter, dancing, and as little stress as possible. Something I didn’t expect was how much my Christian wedding dress would affect the entire experience. I want something modest and meaningful, absolutely, but I also want to sit comfortably, dance, hug people, and sneak off for late-night snacks without feeling stiff or restricted. If I’m uncomfortable, I know it’ll show, and the energy of the day shifts fast. I’ve been asking married friends what actually made their weddings unforgettable, and none of them said “expensive florals.” They mentioned things like signature mocktails, coffee stations for non-drinkers, comfy shoes on the dance floor, and music that actually got people moving. It made me realize that when you feel good in your Christian wedding dress, you’re way more present instead of counting down until you can change. We’re also trying to be smart budget-wise. I’ve seen couples source veils, accessories, or even second-look outfits through Alibaba so they could spend more on experiences guests remember. So I’m curious, how did you balance faith, comfort, and still throwing an amazing party? Did your dress help or hurt the vibe? And what small details made your wedding genuinely fun rather than just “nice”?

1qnqd2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qnqd2s/5_signs_a_woman_likes_you_but_is_trying_not_to/,5 Signs a Woman Likes You But Is Trying NOT to Show It (Science-Based),"So I've been studying attraction dynamics for the past few years through psychology research, evolutionary biology papers, and honestly way too many hours listening to experts like Matthew Hussey and Esther Perel break down human behavior. And there's this fascinating pattern I kept noticing: women often hide their interest even when they're genuinely attracted. Not because they're playing games, but because of legitimate psychological and social factors we rarely talk about.

**Here's the thing most guys miss.** Society has conditioned women to be the ""choosers"" not the ""pursuers."" There's real research backing this up from evolutionary psychology, showing women face way more social judgment for being too forward. Add in fear of rejection, past experiences, and the biological wiring that makes them assess compatibility more carefully, you get someone who's interested but cautiously testing the waters. The good news? Once you understand these signals, you can actually do something about it.

**1. She's weirdly awkward around you specifically**

If she's normally confident and articulate but suddenly becomes a different person when you're nearby, that's not random. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett's work on emotional regulation explains this perfectly. When we're attracted to someone, our nervous system literally goes haywire. She might:

- Avoid eye contact then steal glances when she thinks you're not looking
- Laugh too hard at your mediocre jokes
- Fumble with objects or stumble over words
- Act slightly cold or dismissive as a defense mechanism

I remember reading ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI behavioral analyst who literally wrote the book on reading people). He breaks down how humans unconsciously mirror defensive behaviors when we feel vulnerable. If she likes you but doesn't want to reveal it, awkwardness becomes her shield.

**2. She remembers weirdly specific details about you**

This one's subtle but powerful. She casually mentions something you said three weeks ago that you barely remember telling her. She asks about that project you mentioned once. She knows your coffee order without asking.

Matthew Hussey talks about this in his podcast ""Love Life"" constantly. When someone's interested, their brain literally prioritizes information about you. It's not neuroscience. The reticular activating system in our brain filters information, and guess what gets priority? Details about people we're attracted to.

If she's trying not to show interest, she might drop these references super casually like ""oh yeah I think you mentioned that before"" while internally she's catalogued everything you've ever said.

**3. She finds reasons to be in your orbit without making it obvious**

Pay attention to patterns. Does she suddenly need coffee at the exact time you take your break? Shows up at the same gym, same classes, same friend gatherings? 

This isn't coincidence. Robert Cialdini's research on proximity and attraction (documented in ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"") shows we develop feelings for people we're frequently around. She knows this instinctively.

The giveaway: she acts slightly surprised to see you every time, even though the pattern is consistent. That's her maintaining plausible deniability while maximizing contact.

**4. Her friends act weird around you**

Women tell their friends everything. If her crew suddenly seems overly interested in you, giggles when you approach, or makes excuses to leave you two alone, they're probably in on it.

There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls insights from research papers, expert interviews, and relationship psychology books to create personalized audio content. Built by a team from Columbia University and Google, it lets you customize depth and length based on what you need, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your goals, whether that's improving social skills or understanding attachment theory better. You can even ask its virtual coach specific questions about situations you're navigating in real time.

Another tell: her friends might test you with subtle questions or create scenarios where you interact more. They're her reconnaissance team.

**5. She's hot and cold, but leans slightly warm**

One day she's chatty and engaged, the next she's distant. But overall, there's a slight warmth underneath. This push pull dynamic isn't manipulation, it's internal conflict.

Esther Perel discusses this beautifully in ""Mating in Captivity."" When someone's attracted but uncertain (about timing, compatibility, their own readiness), they oscillate between moving closer and pulling back. It's like emotional risk management.

The difference between genuine disinterest and hidden interest? Consistency of the coldness. If she's truly not into you, she'll be consistently neutral or distant. If she likes you but won't show it, you'll see warmth peek through regularly even during ""cold"" phases.

**The book that changed how I see all this: ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.** These psychiatrists break down attachment theory in relationships and honestly it's insanely good. Helped me understand why people who are interested sometimes act unavailable (spoiler: it's often their attachment style, not their actual feelings). The research is solid, the writing is accessible, and it'll make you question everything you thought you knew about attraction signals.

**What actually matters here:** these signs mean there's potential, but they're not a green light to just wait around hoping. If you're picking up on multiple signals, the move is to create safe opportunities for her to be more open. Lower stakes hangouts, genuine conversations, showing you're emotionally intelligent enough to handle whatever she's feeling.

The reality is that modern dating involves a lot of uncertainty for everyone. Biology, society, past experiences, and individual psychology all create this complicated dance. But once you understand the actual reasons behind these behaviors instead of just taking them at surface value, you can navigate it way better.

And look, sometimes you'll misread signals. That's fine. Part of being human is taking calculated risks and learning from them. What matters is approaching it with genuine interest in her as a person, not just decoding signals like you're cracking a safe.",1,1769456136.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

1qnqaku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qnqaku/the_framework_that_helped_me_go_from_chronic/,The framework that helped me go from chronic procrastinator to MACHINE (no “discipline” needed),"We love to joke about being “chronically online” or stuck in our “flop era,” but honestly? Most of us are just *chronically distracted*. Our phones buzz, dopamine hits fly at us nonstop, and that inbox never actually gets to zero. Everyone tells you, “Just do the work!” but what are you supposed to do when your brain feels like a TV stuck between channels?

So here’s my best attempt at a cheat code: a framework built on actual psychology, neuroscience, and productivity research. No “wake up at 5am” nonsensewake up at 5am” nonsense. No “just try harder.” These are real ideas from books, experts, and things I actually tried that worked.

Here’s what changed everything for me:

**1. Make friction your ally.**

James Clear (the guy behind *Atomic Habits*) says tiny bits of friction can completely change your habits. Want to stop doomscrolling? Make it a pain: grayscale your phone, delete the apps, or use something like 1Password so logging in takes effort. Want to write more? Make it stupid easy. Set up your laptop so the work tab is open, ready to go. Willpower is flimsy. Friction is sneaky but powerful.

**2. Forget goals. Build systems.**

Scott Adams (yep, the *Dilbert* creator) once said, “Losers have goals. Winners have systems.” Brutal, but true. Goals are just endpoints. Systems are the stuff you do every day. So instead of “write a book,” it’s “write for 30 minutes every morning after coffee.” Build the routine—don’t just chase an outcome.

**3. Ditch to-do lists. Block your time.**

To-do lists feel satisfying for about five minutes, then they just keep growing. Research from Professor Kevin Madigan at Harvard shows they actually backfire more often than not. Instead, use time-blocking. Cal Newport (*Deep Work*) swears by it: give each task a specific time on your calendar. Now you have to prioritize, and you don’t waste mental energy deciding what’s next.

**4. Use the Zeigarnik effect. Leave things unfinished on purpose.**

The Zeigarnik effect is wild your brain hates unfinished stuff and nags you to go back. So start a task, then *stop halfway through on purpose*. Your brain will itch to finish it. Hemingway used this trick for writing: leave a sentence hanging, come back the next day ready to go.

**5. Track dopamine, not productivity.**

Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist) says dopamine isn’t about pleasure—it’s about motivation to keep going. So instead of just tracking what you finished, notice what actually gives you a sense of progress. Getting feedback, feeling momentum, being recognized—those things keep your dopamine (and your drive) up. Productivity follows when you chase the right feeling.

**6. Schedule boredom.**

This one hit me: Johann Hari in *Stolen Focus* says, “The ability to focus is the ability to be bored.” So yeah, block out time to be bored on purpose. No music, no podcasts, just sit with your thoughts. That’s how you train your brain to stop needing constant stimulation.

**7. Make it about who you are, not just what you do.**

The final boss? Identity. If you think of yourself as someone who always procrastinates, no system can save you. Identity-based habits (another James Clear gem) flip that script. Say, “I’m the kind of person who shows up,” not “I have to show up.” When you believe it, you act on it.

None of this is magic, but it honestly rewired how I work, think, and get things done. No fake hustle needed.",1,1769455991.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
1qnq9wb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qnq9wb,LJR vs Renowned Batch Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1  Low Medium Olive,"**Having worked with LJR shoes for so many years**

* I'd like to share some personal insights on the subtle differences between them. Please note that this is solely my personal perspective based on the samples I have on hand. 
* The Focal Point: Suede Color Accuracy
* **The most striking difference between these two batches lies in the hue of the nubuck/suede panels.**
* **Famous Batch**: This version leans slightly darker and heavier on the brown tones. While the material quality is high, the color feels a bit ""over-saturated"" compared to the retail reference, especially under indoor lighting.
* **LJR Batch**: In my honest opinion, LJR has done an excellent job capturing the correct ""Mocha"" tone. It features that specific **ashy, matte coffee tint** that is characteristic of this silhouette. It isn't too dark or too warm; it hits that ""sweet spot"" of neutrality that collectors look for.

**Key Details**

* **Suede Texture**: The ""dead"" look is non-existent here. The LJR suede is quite active; you can see the color shift clearly when moving the fibers. This movement, combined with the correct base color, gives it a very premium shelf appeal.
* **Midsole Tone**: The pre-aged yellowing on the LJR midsole is subtle and blends seamlessly with the upper, avoiding the overly bright or ""piss-yellow"" tint sometimes seen on lower-tier batches.

**Final Thoughts**

At this level of replica craftsmanship, most top-tier batches are nearly identical in terms of shape and stitching. However, when it comes to the **accuracy of the color palette**, LJR continues to show why it’s a community favorite. It feels like a very refined, ""safe"" choice for those who prioritize color fidelity above all else.

Both batches are impressive in their own right

Met my neighbour shortly after. She's a very attractive woman, considerebly older.

She never told me how old she is. We started hanging out at night. Just chats and coffee at first. Started hooking up later. 

We got very close, caught feels. But we both knew we'd never be in a relationship because she is much older than I am.

On December we both went away for christmas. She hooked up with someone as a rebound from me (she told me, this is confirmed).

Then she let me know this guy is going to come stay with her because he works in america and we're in South Africa, so he's gonna come stay with her so they could spend more time together until he leaves for America.

I was bumbed out. Anyway.

When we both got back to our apartments and this guy was living with her, she came over and we talked. We both admitted to clearly missing eachother, we embraced very intimately, not kissing, but we held eachother very intimately. She even admitted that she hates the idea of me talking to other girls.

  

Throughout the following week while this guy stays with her, and sleep in her bed, she regularly came over to say hi, telling me she misses me, we hug very passionately, when we're alone ofc.

I asked why he's here, she basically said he's a good match and tick many of her boxes, didn't mention anything about feels or love etc.

  

On New Years I was heading to a friend a few towns over, but before I drove I went to her flat to say bye, I said hi to the guy, then I lead her to my flat. When we both were alone I kissed her and we quickly hooked up, she passionately kissed me back, while this guy is in her flat.

  

Now a few weeks have passed and she's is pursuing a relationship with this dude.  They are together, she has not told him anything about what happened between me and her and she's distant with me. 

I know she had feelings for me at one point. She even told me how much she wanted to invite me on a friend's boat cruise last weekend.

I have no idea what she feels for me,

  

I feel pissed off.  And I'm constantly finding myself wondering if I should tell this guy the truth. Obviously it's out of spite, cause it feels like she just threw me to the curve for this guy she doesn't even love. But I have no idea, obviously if I tell him he'd want to knock my teeth out. And obviously I we wish I could have her like I did at the start.

For greater context, she has invited me to come drink coffee with her and him and I have chatted with the guy multiple times. He does indeed suspect something between me and her and he doesn't want her to hang out with me so much anymore.

I'm wondering if I should tell him, do nothing, wait for him to leave... no idea.

He's even gonna leave his car here through the year until he comes back from america, wtf...

For context: I (f22) grew up in a legalistic Christian circle, and alcohol is definitely a big no no. I don’t know where I stand on that debate because I have heard good points from both sides, but I personally am not interested in drinking. 

I lost my last job as a bakery/coffee shop manger because my former employer was illegally withholding card tips from me and my baristas, and it turned out he was also an active pedophile, and illegally practicing certain medical treatments at his other chiropractic business. My point being, it was no fault of my own that I lost that job, and every single other employee there lost their jobs too because of the whole mess. 

I’ve been trying to find a job for about six months. I’ve tried everything! Online applications, emails, phone calls, and EVERY SINGLE business I’ve applied to I’ve gone to in person. Most of them I’ve gone in person MULTIPLE times. 

I live in a very rural town with hardly any jobs so it’s really hard to find a job in general. 

Two hours ago a diner posted on Facebook for a server position, but it expressed the desire for some bartending experience. So the majority of the job would be serving food, but it would likely be an often occurrence to also bartend. I have nine months experience in food service/barista service, and six months in management of a bakery. So I think I have a high chance of getting this job. 

The problem is that I live with my parents still and I go to the same church. Everyone around me would say it’s sinful to apply for this job and to work there. But I really really need this job. 

I need other Christians to weigh in. Should I apply for this job? Or would that be sinful/unwise?",1,1769455898.0,TrueChristian,4,1.0,False

He graduated from a very prestigious law school and has a stellar resume. However, I’ve noticed that he is often alone during lunches and coffee breaks, and when we have group dinners or stuff he is very quiet. I think some of it has to do with the fact that he is an international person and esl speaker so I imagine it’s harder to make friends; I’ve gathered that his entire family is in China and he’s the only one here. I also got a feeling that they are not very close. For example, when I asked him if he would fly back and see family for the break he told me he prefers staying in the US. 

But these past few days my mild worry turned into serious concern when we had a couple chats and he said he doesn’t really see the point of attending his very prestigious law school and sometimes he wishes things were different and there’s a lot of suffering in life etc. When I got concerned he told me he’s talking about other less fortunate people, but I’m pretty certain that’s bs and he’s consciously or subconsciously asking for help. You simply don’t talk like that about meaning of life and suffering to a person from work. 

Now I’ve never dealt with this situation before. But I’m very worried that this is a kid who’s drowning and reaching out for one last help and if he doesn’t receive it bad things can happen. I’m especially worried because he has afaik no support network in the US. What’s the best way to help him without pushing him further away or making it known that he’s going through something?

**(Edited) 12:36 20/01/2026 - Added Additional Price Pool Information.**

I sent the clips to Basim that got Kingsman Banned from Basims Creator Cup.

People keep arguing I didn’t mention the money involved so I'll highlight it here.

The tournament had a 40K price pool split amongst all the creators involved in the event with the winners receiving 3k each. 2nd place getting a bit less and going down from there.

*(When Zazza signed up for the event there was no price pool and all creators signed up with the expectation that there would be nothing but exposure given from attending the event.) The price pool was added later as additional incentive.*

Additionally the Tournament also had NO BANs this was to facilitate creators known for certain heroes to be able to play their heroes in this setting. 

Hello again I’m \[Matthew\] I’m Zazza’s Boyfriend and currently living with her.  I’m involved in the Marvel Rivals Community. Seeing the earthquake this has caused I am going to explain my part in the Kingsman Situation and the catalyst for him being removed from the Tournament.

I needed to take accountability for what I essentially started because the hate it has caused all involved is eating me away.

In Australia it's the night before the Tournament that’s at 7:30am for us. Zazza’s Comments are full of Hate and Threats and this has blown up massively for something she had nothing to do with. 

After seeing how this is affecting Zazza I have decided to explain to the greater community why what happened happened.

After the First Day of Scrims I spoke to Zazza about Kingsmans comments and she was hurt but didn’t want to cause any drama. She felt she did well enough in the first scrims to be given a chance. 

But during the 2nd day of scrims and hearing Kingsman go ON and ON I hit boiling point. and went behind Zazzas back to send clips of Kingsman to Basim’s Team. 

I am going to explain why I did this with as many clips I could scramble together in 6 hours its currently 1 hours before the Torney start..

**Lets start on Draft Day. Day 1 - Australian time because this is how I experienced events.**

Me and Zazza are Australian and Draft day was early morning for us. We put the Basim’s livestream on the TV and watched while making Coffee. The draft went well and me and Zazza went to Ceecee’s Stream where she was talking to Kingsman in her team chat. Immediately Kingsman was questioning the Zazza pick before even knowing who she was.

This is his first reaction when Cece mentioned Zazza From the get go Kingsman was complaining about Ceces choice to pick a 190ms Widow OTP. 

[https://youtu.be/qg7pQoqwcm8](https://youtu.be/qg7pQoqwcm8)

He then brought up the Money and what it meant to him to win the Tournament where Cece made it known that she wasn’t too focused on the money part of the Tournament. 

This should have set Kingsman's expectations on his team's mindset.

[https://youtu.be/CokG-HSdIck](https://youtu.be/CokG-HSdIck)

Kingsman then questioned Zazza’s ping and it was explained to him that she plays NA and this was Unavoidable. Cece also **WARNS** him that he better not crash out on her team. 

This is the **FIRST** time Kingsman was warned about the energy Cece expected in her team.

[https://youtu.be/x-XPtTG8HB0](https://youtu.be/x-XPtTG8HB0)

[https://youtu.be/ILoaCq6uUWg](https://youtu.be/ILoaCq6uUWg)

Kingsman then says he will fill as whatever he needs to too win.  
[https://youtu.be/SYAZxmTG3Ds](https://youtu.be/SYAZxmTG3Ds)

Cece then explains to Kingsman why she drafted Zazza and asks Lucyasa what she thinks.

Kingsman says Zazza’s ping is a “nono” even though it’s out of her control.

[https://youtu.be/KFbzpAaQcGQ](https://youtu.be/KFbzpAaQcGQ)

[https://youtu.be/EGsPKFW85ag](https://youtu.be/EGsPKFW85ag)

**Keep in mind he hasn’t seen Zazza play yet. Or interacted with her at all at this point.** 

Zazza’s ping is mentioned again with Lusyasa calling her a weak point. Kingsman explains the problem with ping despite it being out of her control. P\_Tato and Nautilifts are other OCE creators in the Torney,  
[https://youtu.be/\_zHMePQmA2o](https://youtu.be/_zHMePQmA2o)

Kingsman then states he doesn't have an issue with the Widow Pick but wants to hide it from the other team because of the ping difference.  
[https://youtu.be/8-XI4c4lpag](https://youtu.be/8-XI4c4lpag)

[https://youtu.be/zJedwt1F8uw](https://youtu.be/zJedwt1F8uw)

These comments genuinely put Zazza down and killed morale she had for the Tournament seeing half her team doubt her for things out of her control. Being right next to Zazza I opened Kingsmans Stream to lurk

This was talked about in  Cece’s chat but due to Cece’s ban i have no access to her stream Vods. At the time of writing.

After seeing this Kingsman chatters told him that Zazza was “pissed” which was just untrue Kingsman then attempted to talk to her in a VC. To clear it up.  
[https://youtu.be/waq2QfIlTYA](https://youtu.be/waq2QfIlTYA)

Zazza responds in chat as we were still downstairs on the couch.

Kingsman calls his chat. “A bunch of liars” and apologizes.

[https://youtu.be/VI4ltFeAlkI](https://youtu.be/VI4ltFeAlkI)

This was the last of the interactions for Draft Day.

Later on in this stream Kingsman takes another shot at his team to his chat stating that his draft for another Torney was way better then the Basim one. 

[https://youtu.be/SGTNol38q-I](https://youtu.be/SGTNol38q-I)

Scrim Day 1. (Lucy was getting hard frame drops)

Kingsman go’s live to stream the Scrim.

He immediately mutes and complains to hischat about his team comp. This is the first of many instances that this happens.

[https://youtu.be/ooM5YSuJktM](https://youtu.be/ooM5YSuJktM)

Match 1: Klyntar 

They lost but it was close they Comm’ed and meshed and the statline ended like this:

\[*Screenshot. Kingsman on Magik with 34/9/2, while Zazza on Widow with 28/12/7 and the MVP tag*\]

Match 2: Wakanda: They Comm mesh well and win this one even with Lucys Pc issues.

\[*Screenshot. Kingsman on Magik with 25/9/0, while Zazza on Widow with 20/6/2 and the ACE ribbon thing*\]

Match 3: Spider Islands  
This game Lucys PC was almost unplayable and it was a close overtime game here is the stat line.

\[*Similar but it was a defeat and Zazza got SVP*\]

I would like to comment on Kingsman continuing to play Magik here into Eshigos Penny. He made it work despite being countered but made it work. A luxury he does not give Zazza.

I will also note Kingsmans chat including a Mod attempts to blame zazzas widow throughout the entire scrim despite her doing well and the enemy team glazing her.

At the end of this day Kingsman was quite tilted about losing but blaming LucysPC.  
[https://youtu.be/kpsuiTM2he0](https://youtu.be/kpsuiTM2he0)

He then talks about the money about how much he needs it.

[https://youtu.be/53KLKXd9xfw](https://youtu.be/53KLKXd9xfw)

He then explains to his chat he knows what will happen if he hard comms to his team already having pushback from Lucyasa. 

[https://youtu.be/-EDcnQ7XIbE](https://youtu.be/-EDcnQ7XIbE)

This is **ANOTHER** example of Kingsman **knowing his team's reaction** to him telling them what to do. 

**Where this all fell apart was Scrims Day 2.**

Immediately on Joining the Discord Kingsman asks Cece if they are able to hard comm. 

[https://youtu.be/hv0fWbDKu5Y](https://youtu.be/hv0fWbDKu5Y)

They played a Quickmatch that went fine then Joined a scrim.

Kingsman asked for a Deadpool under the assumption there was a Deadpool Requirement. He was explained to that there wasn't one.

[https://youtu.be/LDwGy4YKkHE](https://youtu.be/LDwGy4YKkHE)

Kingsman then Mutes his Discord to ask his chat if he is going to lose without the deadpool player. He is adamant that they need the Deadpool.

[https://youtu.be/h6dmxOUp0No](https://youtu.be/h6dmxOUp0No)

 (he has stated he will play whoever he needs to to win and he has more experience on Stratpool then any of the other teammates.)

He then mutes and explains to his chat he needs to be on Dps because the only other DPS is a widow. He doen’t even give widow a chance to solo Dps he just *“KNOWS”*

[https://youtu.be/PaunQitgjB4](https://youtu.be/PaunQitgjB4)

He then tells Zazza she has to learn Deadpool in one day because they need to run triple support. 

*(Zazza has insisted to this point shes a widow player. She will play widow and other hitscan duelists. If she really needs to but otherwise she is an OTP)* 

He then mutes to tell his chat that they have lost. **(zazza has never played strategist or clamed she would..)**

[https://youtu.be/hwYFvIG1pa4](https://youtu.be/hwYFvIG1pa4)

He doubles down on this telling the Tank sub to *“Talk some sense into them”* when Zazza explains again she **DOESNT** know how to play Deadpool and she plays widow and that other creators play off-meta too.

[https://youtu.be/QFLNsrjbCA0](https://youtu.be/QFLNsrjbCA0)

This conversation ends with Cece saying she can play Support and Kingsman saying he can play tank. 

[https://youtu.be/xjFw3-xFylo](https://youtu.be/xjFw3-xFylo)

Kingsman then asks Zazza what anti-dive she can play for Snakecases team. Zazza says widow is her anti-dive. Being a 500 hours widow player there should have been a level of trust here.  
[https://youtu.be/T337b5zEwwQ](https://youtu.be/T337b5zEwwQ)

He then asks Zazza to play Bucky, Phoenix and Hela. Zazza again tells him she's best at widow and will walk out on widow. **Again Kingsman was asked to drop it.**

[https://youtu.be/ihbmzjXdSMI](https://youtu.be/ihbmzjXdSMI)

Next round after a Deadpool ult he **AGAIN** says zazza will struggle. And **AGAIN** the team captain Ceecee asks him to drop it.

[https://youtu.be/i3KoIaG4PMk](https://youtu.be/i3KoIaG4PMk)

Zazza tells kingsman the best chance she has is to play Widow

[https://youtu.be/TXPU6wLR8P4](https://youtu.be/TXPU6wLR8P4)

They then win the first scrim and this is the stat line. 

\[*Another screenshot. Interesting to note that Kingsman is scrimming under the name ""Hits can."" Not all h\*tscans but always a hitscan..*\]

Widow was playing anti dive this game and was not a part of the Deadpool rush ults. Her 2 kills were on people diving the backline. Stopping them from picking Kaycee.

Kingsman between games AGAIN tells zazza to chance this is the **5th time** his team has told him to **DROP IT**. In these clips alone.  
[https://youtu.be/Mp8T5UmgKXE](https://youtu.be/Mp8T5UmgKXE)

Kingsman then tells his team Zazza on widow is a 5v6 situation.

[https://youtu.be/HOTolhWAaz4](https://youtu.be/HOTolhWAaz4)

Kingsman tells Zazza to play Bucky even though she has insisted to this point she doesn’t play Bucky. He replies says her being Dogshit at him would have %200 more impact then widow.

[https://youtu.be/sHd6sc\_R39E](https://youtu.be/sHd6sc_R39E)

Kingsman continues to prod until Zazza tells him she is not swapping off Black Widow

[https://youtu.be/nkdfj827uSk](https://youtu.be/nkdfj827uSk)

Zazza then says if it goes bad and she needs to swap she will swap.

This entire round has played out while arguingand  Zazza goes 0 and 4 (this is the first game in the 6 scrims they have done she has a negative KD and Kingsman crashes out. 

[https://youtu.be/3SZCp9ibidU](https://youtu.be/3SZCp9ibidU)

**This is where I come in.** I was watching this. And I had been clipping on an ult since the start of Vod when the first comments came in. 

I then messaged a member of Production I know and told them to get Basim to watch Kingsmans stream. 

I went behind Zazza’s back to do this she was still in the scrim and didn’t know what I was doing from the next room. I then send multiple of the above clips to Basim. With the context of everything since draft day. 

I didn’t tell Zazza what I was doing because she hates Drama and she wouldn’t want it to blow up like it has. Since Draft day I was lurking Kingsman’s and Cece’s stream. Zazza was being targeted from the get go with no prior knowledge of her gameplay. This crashout was the last straw for me. I was unable to hold my Bias or tongue anymore. 

This is the time that Cece was pulled aside to make a final decision. I. There is more I want to cover but I'll make this part available until I finish writing the rest. And I’ll add it here.

—-------------------------------------------- Follow Up -------------------------------------------------------

This however is where my involvement ended. But for context and continuity's sake I will finish the vod. 

At the start of the next round Kingsman brings up money again and continues to bring up the topic with his team telling him to stop.

[https://youtu.be/1IlI0\_iTU6g](https://youtu.be/1IlI0_iTU6g)

Kingsman offers to play Mantis into triple Sup. Zazza says she doesn’t need one and to stay Magik.

[https://youtu.be/GXGlBkA\_C6Y](https://youtu.be/GXGlBkA_C6Y)

Cece calls Kingsman a Meta Slave for asking his team to play Meta.

[https://youtu.be/nTXEvinjtdM](https://youtu.be/nTXEvinjtdM)

The win the next match due to a C9 in overtime here is the statline.

Kingsman then asks about backline ranks and playstyles claiming he has to solo their backline.

[https://youtu.be/B9RIZD3fJCQ](https://youtu.be/B9RIZD3fJCQ)

This game goes smoothly with no complaints and this is the statline.

As this game ends the conversation goes as follows:

**Cece**: Good Job, Talk shit to Kingsman now Zazza

**Zazza:** I don’t talk shit I just tell people to shut up when they talk shit thats all.

**Kingsman**: I didn’t talk shit at all?, When did I talk shit?

**Cece:** Shush Kingsman you are not allowed to talk.

**Zazza**: Look it makes me play like Crap when people are being a bit Icky thats all.

[https://youtu.be/oE-t6VtZj0I](https://youtu.be/oE-t6VtZj0I)

**Kingsman**: Yeah im sorry guys Im a terrible person Just report me. *mutes*

**Zazza**: You’re not a Terrible person it doesn’t make you a terrible person.

**Kingsman** (to his chat): This is Fucken Ridiculous

**Zazza:** Just be nice just be chill.

**Kingsman:** \*Unmuted\* Yeah sorry I’m just so Negative.

**Zazza:** We get your Passion to win we have passion as well and I really want to win as well.

**Kingsman**: \*mutes\* Get me the Fuck outta here

**Zazza:** We just gotta keep it chill or I’m going to end up unintentionally throwing because if people are being Icky

**Kingsman** \*unmutes\* I’ve already reported you.

[https://youtu.be/k8PnG2HVtr8](https://youtu.be/k8PnG2HVtr8)

While trying to Organise another scrim with Bencers team. Kingsman mutes and talks to Entai in his chat stating if he wants something to rewatch the vod. *(Entai is a Marvel Rivals* 

*Drama Tiktokker.)*

 [https://youtu.be/GXdvk4BBr7A](https://youtu.be/GXdvk4BBr7A)

Kingsman then says he needs to recuperate the 40k. And makes Entai promise not to make a video until after the tourney because Kingsman wants to make one. (He was still in the Torney at this point.) (In his chat this is before they get in a call together)

**He claims to not want Drama but was planning on it before he was kicked out. -** This clip was the final clip I sent to Basim while they were discussing.

[https://youtu.be/uUqUPLoV02Y](https://youtu.be/uUqUPLoV02Y)

[https://youtu.be/YxotF8FUgak](https://youtu.be/YxotF8FUgak)

At this point Cece and Basim have their conversation which results in Kingsman’s removal

And he grinds rank for a bit.

After a while he sits in silence. *He later states he was talking to Basim during this time.*

After being kicked from the Creator Cup he calls Entei and talks to him for a while. Entei explains he was pushy and unprofessional and Kingsman agrees.

[https://youtu.be/6Nr-raqIKSI](https://youtu.be/6Nr-raqIKSI)

**This is the End of Vod 3. - I don’t have a say on how parties handled it after this moment. It was handled poorly but both sides.** 

Personal Note:

There are several days of responses and rumors to cover but I haven’t slept to put it together enough. 

At the end of the day. The decision to report Kingsman was my own.  
The Decision to Kick him was made by Basim Zazza didn’t know I had anything to do with it until after the scrims. 

I was of full belief Kingsman was Unprofessional in a setting he had to be. 

FULL STOP. 

I also have a downloaded copy of vod 3 which I will upload and attach so it's immortalised before twitch or anything else purges it.

1qnq1vl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qnq1vl,"Between the many sessions of shoveling yesterday, I managed to finish my 2nd build ever. The magic coffee shop.","Back in October I completed my first book nook (Owl Bookstore). I was hooked! I spend my usual 40+ hours working as a tradesman building full scale buildings. So this is a fun relaxing time I can put on some tunes and just build away on the weekends. 

I received this mini, a plethora of tools that came in a kit from Amazon I think, and another mini DIY kit. It was a great Christmas my partner gifted me! Even if she did feel like she was just giving me more work to do. 

Overall I really enjoyed doing this one. It was far more advanced than the Owl Bookstore (which I requested more difficulty). Thankfully we live alone w/o kids so the many “Earmuffs” moments weren’t too big a deal. 

My only real issues I had with this one was that the directions were difficult to follow at times and quite a few things weren’t marked out well. I assume it was because the kit was manufactured in another country. I was also short a few important beads/pieces so I had to make do and move on. That part was hard as I want to be as per the drawings as possible. 

The biggest of issues I had was I didn’t realize I had made the patio doors incorrectly until the very end of my build yesterday. Unfortunately due to where the step is located in the directions, I can’t go backwards to fix it now w/o worry of damaging the surrounding parts. Having a hard time looking past the error when viewing the completed piece. Just a tip for others. Pay extreme attention to the images just as much the callouts. I had to have referenced the parts page a few hundred times to be sure I was using the appropriate beads! 

Edit\* This kit is not Harry Potter brand, but heavily Harry Potter inspired. Also, last image is first completed nook alongside current completed mini, and my next I will be starting shortly. ",7,1769455496.0,booknooks,2,1.0,False

A bit about me: I'm active and outdoorsy, 40 yo, two dogs. I love both Portland and Seattle and have spent considerable time in both cities but am also open to more rural options and would appreciate input from folks who've lived elsewhere in the PNW and really love specific towns or regions. I have always wanted to move to the PNW and am looking to put down roots. My most hoped for opportunities are 1) to build and contribute to a strong sense of community, 2) to own a home and still feel like I can save/am not stretched or living above my means (although I'd probably rent first, confirm the location is a fit, then seek to buy) and 3) to land in a very dog-friendly place with many spots for my pups to explore offleash. I am fortunate to have a secure, fully remote job earning \~$280k/yr. I love hiking, camping, road trips, enjoy rain and moody weather, and am utterly unconcerned with nightlife. Coffee shops, book shops, farmers markets/local produce are more my speed. Thank you for sharing your thoughts! ",3,1769455378.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,1.0,False

1qnpxxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1qnpxxc/if_you_love_me_tomorrow_an_unsent_letter/,If you love me tomorrow... (an unsent letter.),"I’ve been sitting by the window, watching the way the light lingers on the glass, thinking about a world that doesn’t exist yet. It’s a quiet place... a ""what if"" that smells like salt air and old books. In this dream, we have a small house by the ocean...one with a porch that creaks under our feet and a garden where the wildflowers grow wherever they please, just like you once told me about. 

If you love me tomorrow, let’s spend our mornings in the slow tide. I want to wake up to the sound of the waves and the smell of coffee, finding you tangled in linen sheets with the sun kissing your shoulders. We’ll spend our days doing absolutely nothing of importance; walking barefoot on the sand, collecting smooth stones that look like little moons, and reading poems out loud until the words blur into the sound of the sea. I want to build a life out of these small, shimmering joys: shared umbrellas in sudden rainstorms, the warmth of your hand in my coat pocket, and the way your laugh sounds when the wind catches it.

If you love me tomorrow, let’s get lost on purpose. We’ll drive down roads that don’t have names, stopping only to watch the sunset paint the sky in colors we can’t find words for. I want to dance with you in a kitchen lit only by the hum of the refrigerator, spinning you around until we’re both breathless and dizzy with a happiness that feels almost holy. I want to press flowers into the pages of our lives, keeping the memory of every ""ordinary"" Tuesday like a treasure, because with you, nothing is ever truly ordinary.

But as the evening settles and the shadows grow long, my heart turns a little quieter, a little deeper. I know that life isn't always a house by the sea. I know that rivers sometimes run dry and the stars sometimes hide behind the clouds. I am not just asking for the sunshine and the easy laughter; I am asking for the privilege of holding your hand when the storm hits. I want to be the one who stays when the music stops, the one who conceives a life with you that is brave enough to face the silences.

I’ve built this beautiful, fragile sanctuary in my mind: a place where we are safe, where we are seen, and where we are home. I can see the garden, I can hear the ocean, and I can feel the warmth of your breath against my neck. It is the most beautiful thing I have ever imagined.

But the house remains empty, the waves hit a lonely shore, and the wildflowers wait in the dark...

...only if you love me tomorrow. I am holding the key out to you in the silence. It is yours, entirely yours. But only if you want to walk through that door. Only if you want to be the dream with me.

Until the light finds us,

The one who is already home in the thought of you.

1qnpwt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1qnpwt7/americans_arent_struggling_theyre_overspending_on/,Americans Aren’t Struggling - They’re Overspending on Junk and Calling It “Struggling”,"**TL;DR: Most “I can’t pay bills” complaints are self-inflicted. People blow money on dumb extras (eating out, subscriptions, Amazon junk, $800 phones, booze/smokes) and then act like victims despite having the easiest lives in the world. Stop spending on things you don't need and you won’t be “struggling.”**

If you live in America there is almost zero reason to struggle to pay bills. The main reason people struggle is because of a sense of entitlement and victim mentality, period.  
  
[Census.gov](http://Census.gov) shows the median household income being around $84K. Median cost of living is around $80K though this varies GREATLY based on where you live. Right off the bat you are in the green, but I agree this number is barely scraping by....however....and this is the fun part....if we look at what people are spending their money on it is INSANE.  
  
In the USA you have more spending power and disposable income THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD EVEN IF YOU ARE LOWER CLASS. Countries like Sweden, Denmark, Norway, that have high taxes but big social nets, actually have less spending power and disposable income than Americans AFTER Americans even pay for things like health insurance, childcare, etc. No matter what you have more money than anyone else in the world. So why do Americans feel like they are struggling? Let's look at our spending shall we.  
  
**The vast majority of Americans, this means lower class as well...**  
\-Own more than one Smart TV  
\-Have one phone per adult costing $800 or more  
\-Own slightly over 1 vehicle per adult  
\-Get coffee at a coffee shop 4 or more times a week costing $7 or more  
\-Eat out 4+ times a week at a cost of 180% that of eating at home  
\-Go on two vacations a year that require travel  
\-Have 3.5 video streaming services  
\-Have 4.5 paid entertainment subscriptions (this costs Americans just under $1000 a year)  
\-Roughly 90% of Americans buy primarily major premium brand clothes and accessories (Nike, Adidas, etc.)  
\-Conservatively spend $1200 a year on Amazon with most data showing $2800 spent on Amazon per household. Amazon reports that 1/3 of consumer spending is on essentials or household basics, the rest is entertainment/electronics/etc, so roughly $1900 a year on just BS  
\-If the household drinks or smokes, they spend an average of $400 a month on those habits or over $4000 a year  
\-Spend $1000 on gas for recreational driving (social driving outside of errands, work, school, church, shopping)  
\-Also spend 4.5 hours on their phone and 2.5 hours on social media a day, just a fun fact  
\-We could go on forever haha

Worth noting, close to 100% of Americans report a physical ailment after the age of 30, and 100% of Americans have suffered a form of significant trauma. When people say they have trauma, what they mean is impactful trauma that they can't manage because everyone has trauma, we mostly vary in our ability to cope (I am a PhD and have research on trauma so I know this). Finally, 1.5% of Americans have a disability/sickness that prevents them from working so they are the only ones with a real reason.  
  
According to a study Brookings circulated by AEI and the Institute for Family Studies, if you do just three things, (1) graduate high school, (2) apply to one job a month, and (3) don't have kids out of wedlock, you will live above the poverty line more than 97%-98% of the time (it is called the success sequence). Despite this, over 60% of Americans say it is difficult to pay their bills.  
  
If you work a job, cut unnecessary spending on dumb things, don't have a bad coping habit like drinking, you will be FINE for life. People just don't like this reality because they have a belief they deserve these luxuries (social media makes this way worse), and don't want to face the reality that it is their own fault, not the systems.

PS: Before anyone calls me privileged, I grew up lower class, got a major medical diagnosis at 9 years old that affects me for life, and was making $18K a year in 2020 and the 10 years before. With $18K a year I was well fed on healthy food, had a phone, gym membership, a car, high-speed internet, and was putting around $5-$8K away in savings a year. Now my household income is around $250-$300K and we put about 80-90% of it away into savings and investments because we don't buy things we don't need.",33,1769455211.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,35,0.74,False

I have a 15 and 18g basket so choose which you think is appropriate. Gear: micra and Mahlkonig e64 Ws

Here’s what it gave: 

This looks like a lovely bag of Brazilian coffee from Tanat. Since it’s a ""Torréfié espresso"" (espresso roast) with a natural process from Minas Gerais, it likely has a heavy body and low acidity.

To highlight the caramel (sweetness and clarity) over the chocolate (bitterness and body), you want to aim for a slightly higher extraction yield while avoiding the ""over-extracted"" bitter notes that come from chocolatey profiles.

Here is a recommended recipe for a standard Double Espresso:

The ""Caramel-Forward"" Espresso Recipe

| Variable | Target | Why? |

|---|---|---|

| Dose | 18g | A standard dose for clarity. |

| Yield | 40g - 42g | A slightly longer ratio (1:2.2 or 1:2.3) helps pull out more sweetness/sugars. |

| Time | 27–30 seconds | Fast enough to avoid heavy cocoa bitterness, slow enough for sweetness. |

| Temperature | 92°C (198°F) | Lower temps favor chocolate; slightly higher (but not boiling) helps extract sweetness. |

Tips to Maximize Sweetness

 \* The ""Longer Pull"": Chocolate notes often sit in the middle of the extraction, while the deepest sweetness (caramel/toffee) develops right before the shot starts to turn thin and watery. By pulling 40g-42g instead of a tight 36g, you dilute the ""heavy cocoa"" and highlight the sugary finish.

 \* Water Quality: If your water is too hard (high calcium), the coffee will taste more like dark chocolate or ash. Using filtered water (like a Brita or Third Wave Water) will allow the caramel notes to ""pop.""

 \* Pre-infusion: If your machine allows it, a 5-second pre-infusion will help saturate the grounds evenly, ensuring you get those complex sugars out without the harshness.

For this specific bag of Tanat Brazilian Natural, I highly recommend using the 18g basket.

While both can make great coffee, the 18g basket is better suited for bringing out caramel and sweetness for three main reasons:

1. The ""Puck Depth"" Advantage

In an 18g basket, the ""puck"" (the compressed coffee cake) is thicker. A thicker puck creates more natural resistance for the water. This allows you to use a slightly coarser grind while still hitting your target timing. Coarser grinds generally produce a ""cleaner"" sweetness (caramel/toffee) and reduce the ""silty"" bitterness often associated with fine grinds (dark chocolate/cocoa).

2. Higher Extraction Potential

Caramel notes are ""sugar"" notes that require a high, even extraction to fully develop.

• 15g baskets can sometimes be ""fussy."" Because the puck is thinner, water can find weak spots more easily (channeling), which leads to a mix of sour and bitter flavors that mask the caramel.

• 18g baskets are more forgiving. They provide a more stable environment for the water to dissolve those complex sugars evenly.

3. Body vs. Clarity

Since this is a Natural process coffee, it already has a lot of natural sweetness and body.

• The 15g basket often produces a very ""intense"" but shorter experience.

• The 18g basket allows for a larger total yield (e.g., 40g–42g out), which helps ""stretch"" the flavor profile, making the caramel notes taste more like a silky syrup rather than a concentrated cocoa bar.

——————————————

Result: to throw it off, I kept saying I wanted a 15g pull to see if it’ll change. It gave me good recipes, but stood its ground on the 18g basket. I tried other bags, and those bags, Gemini chose 15g. So here, I really felt it chose the most appropriate basket. 

I ran the Gemini test twice, with a bag that was chocolate hazelnut and this one, chocolate caramel. Each had its own respective recipe which were drastically different. The hazelnut forward was almost ristretto 1:1ish on a 15g and the caramel was 1-2ish on a 18g 

Taste results: I hate to admit this… but they were both dang delicious. In fact, ild go even further to say they were bang on. The hazelnut flat white was insanely nutty as I wanted. And the caramel bag was deliciously carmel forward. 

I really didn’t expect this, and yes, I do know how to drive my coffee on stick shift and adjust everything manually to taste. But this, is a game changer, a time saver, but more importantly, a fantastic help for those who are new to the game or those who just wanna drive auto. It works. And it works well. 

Now… straight up… have you let Madame Gemini dial for you ? I vouch for it. ",0,1769455027.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

I'm 41, work in cybersecurity but thankfully from home other than some rare client or office visits. 

I recently decided on ceramic upper braces (with metal lower). 

However, I love coffee and sometimes red wine. I also don't want to worry about staining and just want to carry on pretty much as normal. I've also read that they're smaller attachments and less bulky. 

Can you give your views on this either way? Did you have ceramic and liked them? Did you switch as a lot seem to do? Any personal experiences basically. 

P.s. orthodontist says treatment time is the same no matter which option I choose.

1qnplcv,https://i.redd.it/golr1z7wsqfg1.jpeg,How can we learn to see the good?,"I am often asked:
How can we avoid becoming discouraged and fixating on the negative in such challenging and unpredictable times?

My dear friends, people have lived through difficult times throughout history. However, this has not prevented many from enjoying life and thanking God for everything He sends.

🔹 Why do some see light, while others see only darkness?
It has long been noted that the purer and kinder a person is inside, the better they see the world around them. Inner light becomes a flashlight that illuminates everything around.
Without this light, everything seems gloomy and dirty.

There is a parable about a fly and a bee:
both fly, but one seeks only dirt, and the other seeks flowers and nectar. Everyone chooses for themselves where to look.

📖 ""If your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light...""
(Matthew 6:22–23)

This is about a conscious choice of focus:
to see evil and resentment — or light, kindness, compassion.
We make this choice every day.

🔹 Sometimes a person has everything going well, but they cling to the negative and end up finding it.
🔹 And sometimes the opposite happens: illness, trials — but the person thanks God and rejoices in life.

☦️ The holy fathers said:
the greatest gratitude to God is joy.
No joy — no gratitude.
No gratitude — no living faith.

📝 Practice: Gratitude Journal

To learn to see the good:
📌 Take a beautiful notebook.
📌 Write down 100 reasons to thank God (life, family, home, work, health, the opportunity to go to church, etc.).
📌 Then every day write down at least 5 things you are grateful for from the past day
📌 End each entry with the words:
""Glory to God for everything!""

Even for the little things: the weather, coffee, the bus arriving on time...

⏳ Keep a journal for at least 40 days — during this time, gratitude will become a habit.

🙏 If possible, serve a thanksgiving prayer service once a week.

☦️ Priest Anthony Rusakevich

If anyone has any suggestions for ways to improve it, I would appreciate them.

	Scott drifted into the staff room rubbing his eyes. The morning work lingering in his mind as he reached for the coffee pot. His friend and colleague, David, stepped into the room saying, “Hey man, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be home, enjoying your birthday?”

	Scott gave a sardonic chuckle and replied, “In this economy? Not a chance. I still have bills to pay.”

	“I hear that,” said David. “Hey, did you hear about Larry?”

	“What about him?”

	“He got fired.”

	“Nerdy Larry? What for?”

	David’s eyes grew wide as he glanced toward the hallway before he lowered his voice anyway and said, “Management found some photos on his computer. Well, not just photos—there were things hidden in his desk, too.”

	Scott stared at David, the question taking its time to form. “You mean like…sex stuff?”

	David poured himself a cup of coffee. “Yeah.”

	Scott, extremely unsettled, asked, “Did he hurt anyone?”

	David shrugged his shoulders, “Who knows? The company doesn’t want to be involved so they cut ties.”

	Scott, clearly concerned said, “Shouldn’t they turn it over to the police?”

	“Why? He didn’t do anything illegal. Besides, it doesn’t really matter what people do behind closed doors.”

	

	Scott finished his coffee and returned to his desk. He paused when he saw the empty chair where Larry had been.

	What else had Larry been hiding?

	Scott tried to shake the thought away almost as soon as it surfaced. That was unfair. People hid all kinds of things. Still, the space felt altered.

	Could he be hurting the people in the photos? Or holding someone against their will?

	Scott felt the thought slipping, stretching—toward something darker. He didn’t let it finish.

	When a hand touched his shoulder, he startled.

	“I’m sorry,” Shelly said. “Just dropping off the weekly report.”

	“It’s fine,” Scott said. “I was off in my own little world.”

	His mind kept drifting toward Larry’s empty desk until the clock finally struck five. As everyone gathered their belongings David stopped by his desk and asked, “Do you want to go to Happy Hour with us?”

	Scott shook his head. “I’m not really in the mood.” He swept his things into his desk and said, “I think I’ll just walk home tonight.”

	“Suit yourself,” David said as he walked off.

	Laughter and chatter buzzed all around him as people ended their shifts and got ready to leave, but it felt distant—like he was in an echo chamber. 

	His heart sped up.

	He couldn’t catch his breath.

	His vision blurred into darkness.

	The darkness felt like it was closing in on him—attacking him.

	Everything went dark.

	Then Shelly was there with a glass of water. “Are you okay?”

	“Yeah. It was a panic attack. I haven’t had one in years. Thanks for being here, I appreciate it.”

	“You really should take better care of yourself.” Scott gave her a half hearted smile.

	He rubbed his eyes, sipped the water, and tried to shake off the ominous feeling that the panic attack left lingering in its wake. After returning the glass to the staff room, nearly everyone else had gone leaving the place eerily dim and quiet.

	His eyes lingered on Larry’s desk for a while before he opened the door and began walking down the street.

	Thick clouds cast dark shadows giving the illusion that night had come early. A streak of lightning cut briefly through the gray canopy in the distance. The soft, almost muted thunder took so long to follow that it seemed disconnected.

	As a light mist filled the air, Scott pulled his jacket collar up around his ears and continued on.

	Scott scanned the street around him—it was empty. Sure, there was a car here and there, but he’d never seen the city this barren before.

	People were gone.

	Lights were off. And…

	Doors were closed.

	He looked around again. Every door was closed. David’s words crept into his mind it doesn’t really matter what people do behind closed doors. 

	The problem with that is—people are their true selves “behind closed doors”. He thought about how he felt when he no longer needed to “perform” for others. How difficult it was to “be social”.

	What other kinds of things could someone else be hiding? His mind drifted back to Larry.

	He tried to push the thought away, but the closed doors stared ominously at him.

	

	Scott noticed the curtain slightly askew in the window beside a closed door across the street. He stared at it longer than he meant to, unsettled by the gap it left. When the headlights of a car turning off of a nearby street flashed through the window, they exposed the shape of a person who quickly closed the curtain and disappeared.

	Scott’s pulse quickened. Why would they do that? What was so interesting about him that they would stare out the window at him? More importantly—why did they run off so quickly when the lights revealed what they were doing?

	Scott pulled his jacket tighter around him and picked up his pace. He was starting to think that maybe he should have taken the subway or a taxi.

	A little while later he heard raised voices in the distance. He couldn’t make out what they were saying, but he definitely heard the door slam shut. He shuddered. He could only imagine the pain behind that door. The physical brutality. The emotional desperation. His heart ached at the screams his mind created.

	As Scott attempted to purge his mind of the unsettling scene that he’d created, he noticed a little girl sitting on a bench next to the front door of a house ahead of him. She stroked the hair of a doll on her lap. Suddenly a man burst out of the door, grabbed her arm, and pulled her into the house saying, “I told you not to come out here in this weather!”

	Scott was stunned. How could anyone treat a child like that? He glanced around to see if anyone else had seen it, but the street was empty. What should he do? Call the police? CPS? David’s words rang in his head Why? He didn’t do anything illegal.

	Scott closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then walked away.

	As he continued on, Scott couldn’t help noticing all of the closed doors. Some had bright lights and activity behind them. Others were dark—mysterious. Still others bore dim lights—and shadows, lurking in the gloom.

	By now the mist had progressed into a light drizzle. The occasional flash of lightning ripped through the dark clouds followed by a low, ominous rumble of thunder. His jacket no longer protected him against the chill of the evening air. He looked at his phone and momentarily considered summoning a ride from an app, but ultimately decided that he was close enough to home that it would be a waste of money.

	A little farther down the street, Scott noticed a car idling at the curb. Its headlights were off, the interior dim, but he could make out two figures inside.

	The driver leaned toward the passenger. For a moment, Scott couldn’t tell what they were doing—talking, arguing, something else.

	The dashboard light flared briefly, and he saw a hand reach out, fingers curling around the other person’s wrist. The passenger turned away, face obscured. The windows began to fog in the cold evening air.

	Scott slowed, the darkness and fog obscuring his ability to peer through the windows.

	The hand lingered a moment—gripping the wrist—too long before letting go. The driver straightened, glanced toward the windshield—and noticed him.

	The interior light snapped off.

	Scott’s pulse quickened. He looked away first, suddenly aware of how exposed he felt standing on the sidewalk.

	He told himself it was nothing. People leaned close in cars all the time.

	Still, he picked up his pace.

	Finally, his own door. Dark. Closed. Safe. He let out a sigh of relief. With so much pain and suffering that goes on behind other doors, he was so happy to have the peace and quiet behind his own closed door. He took out his house key, inserted it into the lock, turned it, then swung the door open and…

	“SURPRISE!”

	Scott’s heart skipped a beat. His head started spinning. He barely even registered that all of his friends were there—in his home.

EPILOGUE

	Shelly poured a cup of coffee in the staff room as David walked up. “I really feel bad for Scott,” she said.

	“Yeah,” David replied. “I know he said he didn’t like parties, but I never thought it would actually kill him.”",1,1769454493.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

*Filed under: Artifacts, Symbols, and the Things That Remain.*

There comes a point when names are no longer enough.

Heroes leave. Villains fall. Even gods fade into footnotes. What persists are the objects — the tools left behind, the symbols that outlive the hands that wielded them.

I have turned my attention, at last, to the relics of Sunnydale.

A stake, worn smooth by repetition and necessity. A joke scrawled in defiance of the horrors beneath our feet. A razorback logo from a high school that sat, impossibly, atop the mouth of hell. A mug that once held coffee, sarcasm, and the unspoken understanding that knowledge is a weapon.

There are books here too — not the kind Watchers prefer, but the kind written in blood and instinct. Warnings disguised as folklore. A name for the things that hunt in the dark. A reminder that sometimes, survival depends on knowing exactly what you’re facing.

And there are words. Not prophecies. Not spells. Just a single directive, written plainly, as if repetition might finally make it unnecessary.

*Slay.*

This is the last entry I will file. Not because the work is finished — it never is — but because the record is complete enough.

Sunnydale does not need another Watcher.

It needs remembering.

Even writing this I can feel my breathing getting a bit faster and just general anxiety yet exhausted.   
I am coming to my wits end, I miss working ( lol the irony) but have been getting rejected from jobs / ghosted for 5 months straight. Even for roles I am very much qualified for. 

I lost a member of my immediate family just three weeks ago and everytime I look at pictures or videos of us together I feel like I want to throw up, usually end up bawling my eyes out uncontrollably. I am shattered exhausted even, but no matter how much I try to sleep I lay awake toss and turn go on my phone, on linkedin, cry about how I literally have £15 left to my name, that I just got rejected from a job, I miss my relative, I am really struggling. I moved back to live with parents but I really cannot rely on them anymore, esp as one of them can switch from being the kindest, loving most generous parent to berating, slamming things ( reminds me of growing up and it's like I am 12 again) , yells over little things, passive aggressive, lacks emotional regulation and communicates poorly.

 I need to have my independnce and peace again and move out for good- no coming back ( aside from to visit). Even if I have to rent I guess or shared ownership idk...just thinking ahead tryna give myself some hope or something. 

  
I keep feeling like I need to get out and move more but for the life of me I cannot. I booked a free yoga class for tomorrow - I am dreading it. I feel like I want to cry 24/7 but also numb. I miss socialising with my friends, dating, exploring. I miss my independence, I miss the two years of good health I was blessed with, I miss my friends, I miss having a routine ( even though it was hard to stick to,), I miss feeling optimistic, or even a tad motivated. I miss caring about myself - making an effort doing my hair nicely for me. For years now that has all felt like too much effort, some days I have to forece myself to do most basic things like shower. If I dont do it as soon as I wake up the likelyhood of me doing it decreases. 

 I don't even know if I rate who I am anymore or right now. I also received news I need to have an operation soon... I am tired. I am tired of being in this position, even filling out job applications is becoming a VERY BIG struggle now, if i dont fall asleep midway I get distracted by looking at other jobs or it takes me days to complete one application because I want it to be perfect ( it never is). 

  
Something needs to change, and it is not for lack of me trying. I really would love a job, but it's like does God hate me or something?'m educated with 2 degrees and 10 years of work experience with excellent references but idk.

I am in my early 20’s, selling my childhood home following my dad’s passing. I still live here, and am new to this entire selling process. 

Yesterday I came home from walking my dog to a potential buyer and their agent in my home. They entered via spare key in lockbox. I learned there was a mix up on dates between my listing agent and the one in my home. When I expressed I had not approved this showing (and my dog was going crazy on the leash), the realtor tried to then convince me to let him show the house for another 10 minutes. I am just concerned that he showed the house in the first place. My car was in the garage, my TV was left on, coffee and purse laying out on the kitchen counter, along with many other personal items left out and around my home. I feel as though it was irresponsible he see the evidence of life in the home and continue showing it in the first place. He was very passive aggressive about my asking them to leave and I’ve felt a little off about it since. 

Should a complaint be filed for the agent’s lack of concern over my home obviously not being ready for showing? I am unsure of the usual protocol when showing a home as an agent, but it feels like my listing agent should have at least been called. These people saw my bra lying around!

1qnpcos,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qnpcos/the_one_trait_that_makes_people_instantly_trust/,The one trait that makes people instantly trust you (backed by science),"Look, we've all been told ""first impressions matter,"" but nobody talks about the actual mechanism behind it. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, neuroscience podcasts, and even some wild evolutionary biology books, I found something that blew my mind. There's literally ONE trait that acts like a master key for how people perceive you in the first 30 seconds. And no, it's not ""confidence"" or ""eye contact"" or whatever generic advice you've heard a million times.

The trait? **Warmth.**

Yeah, I know. Sounds soft and fluffy. But hold up, because the science behind this is hardcore, and when you actually understand how to weaponize it (in a good way), it changes everything about how people respond to you.

## Step 1: Understand the Warmth vs Competence Matrix

Here's what researchers at Princeton found: When people meet you, their brain instantly asks two questions in this exact order:

1. **""Can I trust this person?""** (warmth evaluation)
2. **""Should I respect this person?""** (competence evaluation)

And here's the kicker, warmth gets evaluated FIRST. Your brain is literally hardwired from caveman days to figure out if someone's a friend or threat before deciding if they're useful. You can be the smartest, most accomplished person in the room, but if you fail the warmth test in the first few seconds, people's brains will put up walls. They might respect you, but they won't trust you. And without trust, you're starting every interaction on hard mode.

This isn't my opinion. Dr. Amy Cuddy breaks this down in her book ""Presence"" (she's the Harvard psychologist who went viral with the power pose research). The book is an insanely good read that'll make you question everything about how you show up in social situations. She's got decades of research proving that warmth beats competence every single time for first impressions.

## Step 2: Stop Leading with Your Resume

Here's where most people screw up. They walk into a room, meet someone new, and immediately try to prove their competence. They talk about their job, their accomplishments, flex their knowledge. They think this is how you gain respect.

Wrong.

When you lead with competence before establishing warmth, people's brains label you as potentially threatening or arrogant. You're triggering their defense mechanisms. Even if everything you're saying is impressive, they're not really hearing it because their brain is still stuck on question one: ""Can I trust this person?""

The play is simple: **Establish warmth first, demonstrate competence second.**

Show genuine interest in the other person before you talk about yourself. Ask real questions. Listen like you actually give a damn. Smile with your whole face, not just your mouth. This signals safety, and once someone feels safe with you, THEN they're ready to be impressed by you.

## Step 3: Master the Warmth Signals Your Body Sends

Your words matter, but your body is doing most of the talking. According to research by Dr. Paul Ekman (the guy who basically invented the science of reading facial expressions), people pick up on micro-expressions in milliseconds. You can't fake this stuff with your conscious mind, which is why you need to actually FEEL warm toward people, not just pretend.

**Here's what warmth looks like physically:**

* Open body language (uncross those arms, face people directly)
* Genuine smiles that reach your eyes (the Duchenne smile, it involves your cheek muscles)
* Slight head tilts when listening (signals engagement and vulnerability)
* Slower, calmer movements (rushed, jerky movements signal stress or aggression)
* Appropriate touch when culturally acceptable (handshakes, shoulder touches)

There's this app called Ash that's weirdly good for practicing emotional intelligence and reading social cues. It's marketed as a relationship coach, but honestly, the modules on body language and emotional expression are gold for anyone trying to level up their social game.

## Step 4: Use the ""Presumed Warmth"" Hack

This one's sneaky but backed by solid psychology. When you treat someone as if they're already your friend, their brain gets confused in the best way possible. It's called the Ben Franklin Effect in reverse.

Instead of waiting to feel warm toward someone, ACT warm immediately, and the feelings will follow. Your brain literally can't maintain the cognitive dissonance of acting friendly while feeling hostile. The feelings shift to match the behavior.

Practically, this means:

* Use their name early and often in conversation
* Remember small details they mention and bring them up later
* Assume the best intentions (people mirror the energy you give them)
* Give compliments that are specific and genuine, not generic
* Share something mildly vulnerable about yourself early (it signals trust)

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability is clutch here. Her book ""Daring Greatly"" isn't directly about first impressions, but the vulnerability framework she lays out is a masterclass in building instant connection. Fair warning though, this book will make you uncomfortable because it challenges that armor we all wear. But that's exactly why it works.

If you want a more structured way to actually internalize all these concepts instead of just reading about them, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been useful. It pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews on social skills and emotional intelligence, then turns them into personalized audio lessons. You can set specific goals like ""build trust quickly in professional settings"" or ""become more approachable as an introvert,"" and it'll create an adaptive learning plan based on your unique situation and personality type.

The depth customization is clutch, you can do a quick 10-minute overview when you're short on time, or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and psychological frameworks when you want to go deeper. Plus you can choose different voice styles, I've been using the smoky, conversational one during commutes. Makes it way easier to stay consistent with learning this stuff instead of letting books collect dust.

## Step 5: Ditch the Poker Face

Here's something from behavioral economics that'll mess with your head: Unpredictability makes people anxious. When your face is a blank slate, people's brains go into threat assessment mode because they can't read your intentions.

You don't need to be a dancing clown, but you DO need to be emotionally transparent. Let your face react to what people say. Show surprise, amusement, concern, interest. This is called ""emotional contagion,"" and it's one of the fastest ways to build rapport.

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this extensively in her book ""Captivate"" and on her YouTube channel Science of People. She's analyzed thousands of hours of social interactions and found that people with more expressive faces are consistently rated as more likeable and trustworthy. The book includes actual facial expression exercises that feel dorky but actually work. She breaks down the exact facial muscles involved in genuine vs fake expressions, which is wild.

## Step 6: The First Five Words Matter Most

Neuroscience shows that people form impressions in 50 milliseconds. By the time you finish your first sentence, their opinion is basically set. So what you say FIRST carries disproportionate weight.

**Bad opening:** ""Hi, I'm a software engineer at Google.""  
**Good opening:** ""Hey, I love your jacket. Where'd you get it?""

See the difference? The first one leads with status (competence). The second leads with genuine interest and a compliment (warmth). You can mention your job later, after you've established that you're a human being who notices and appreciates other people.

This isn't manipulation. It's understanding how human brains actually work and using that knowledge to start interactions on the right foot.

## Step 7: Strategic Vulnerability Builds Trust Fast

This sounds counterintuitive, but admitting small imperfections early actually makes people trust you MORE. It's called the Pratfall Effect. When someone seems too perfect, our brains get suspicious. But when someone's mostly impressive but admits to being human, we relate to them.

Share something small that shows you're not trying to be perfect:

* ""I'm terrible with names, so please remind me if I forget""
* ""I almost got lost trying to find this place""
* ""I have no idea how to work this coffee machine""

These tiny admissions signal that you're not a threat, you're not trying to compete, and you're comfortable enough with yourself to be real. That's warmth in action.

The podcast ""Hidden Brain"" did an incredible episode on this called ""Why We Trust"" that dives into the neuroscience of trust formation. Host Shankar Vedantam interviews researchers who've studied how vulnerability triggers oxytocin release in others, which is literally the bonding hormone. Worth a listen if you want to geek out on the science.

## Step 8: Mirror Without Being Creepy

Subtle mimicry is one of the most powerful warmth signals. When you slightly mirror someone's body language, speaking pace, or even word choice, their subconscious brain reads it as ""this person is like me,"" which triggers trust.

Key word: SUBTLE. Don't copy their every move like a mime. Just match their general energy. If they're speaking softly and slowly, dial down your volume and pace. If they're animated and gesturing, bring more energy to your movements.

This works because of mirror neurons in the brain. When we see someone do something, the same neurons fire as if we were doing it ourselves. This creates a sense of connection and familiarity.

**Warmth isn't weakness. It's strategic intelligence.** The most successful people, from negotiators to CEOs to that friend who everyone loves, all understand this. They make people feel safe first, impressive second. Master that order, and you'll control every first impression you make.",1,1769454093.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

1. Day 1 (1/23): woke up with a sore throat at 2am, little runny nose. Covid test was negative, assumed it was a cold

2. Day 2: Same early morning sore throat, runny nose, dry cough

3. Day 3: Early morning sore throat, runny nose, ear involvement, back/kidney pain, mild diarrhea. Covid test positive. Temperature at highest was 100.2°F

4. Day 4 (today): Early morning sore throat, hoarse voice, runny nose, mostly dry cough with some phlegm, very mild loose stool 2x, Temperature 99.2°F

- Hot coffee

- Listerine gargle several times a day

- Chapstick

- Liquid IV

- 120 Oz of water daily

The next Immersive Story Club gathering is this Saturday at Spruce Coffee! This is starting to feel like a little gem, I'm gently sharing the word bit by bit, but it's mostly word of mouth because this effort is more grassroots that anything else. So come along or DM if you are curious and want to be on the invite list.  
  
P.S. This project is less about love for tech and more about being in person with others, making space, and sharing something that sometimes took years to make. VR film production fascinates me, the history of this medium is complex and honestly rooted in ideals I don't admire (sorry not sorry - can't stand the way Palmer Lucky looks at the world). But then these artists and storytellers making work int he medium -- well those are the people I admire. Going deep, trying something new, using every tool possible to try to make a difference. I love that. And of course, that's not the whole industry of VR indie filmmaking. But it's a big chunk of the people I work with, so it's a real pleasure to create examples of sharing in person outside of festivals and museums and to provide some materials to reflect and connect. Next film is going to be about resilience, censorship, and power. Timely in the current state of affairs.

1qnp9uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1qnp9uq/parking_fine_cpm_europcar_cant_appeal/,"Parking Fine, CPM, EuropCar - Can't Appeal","Right will try and get as much detail as possible. 

(UK England ​Based)

We are currently in a hire car after issues with our motorbility car. 

  
We received a letter today from EuropCar stating we had a parking fine from CPM (Car Park Management) for parking at our local shops for over nine hours. 

  
We can confirm that my partner did pop there on the way home from work around 7am to grab coffee before coming home to get our daughter and drive her to school on the other side of the city. Before returning home until pick up later that day. Therefore between 9am and 3pm the ​car was parked in our drive.

  
She then drove to get our daughter from school and returned home around 4pm with no stops. 

  
Later that night my son took us out to dinner for the evening. 

  
The letter we received says we were in the car park from 07:14 to 17:05 which simply isn't the case. 

  
Also the image we have isn't clear that it our number plate in the second image as the last letter of our one is K and this could be X. 

  
So we decided to appeal, only to find out has been paid already. So tried to call the number (automated line for payments only) and that says the reference doesn't exist. 

  
So we have no official way to appeal.

  
This is important as EuropCar has charged us £96 for an admin fee and a charge. 

  
Called EuropCar who claim they paid the fine and we now owe them, with no right to appeal. 

  
This surely cannot be right. Especially as last year we did have a parking charge we did take responsibility for (and overstay at a local football stadium) and EuropCar hadn't paid, so we had to pay the admin to them and then the fine to the parking company. So why the change now? 

  
Where do we stand with this? Their customer service is awful and especially say ""tough luck""

“Are you from here?” No. But I’m from southern WI! And this gets me a lot closer to home. 

“Isn’t that kind of far?” Well, it’s 5 hours to home, but that’s a lot less than the 13 it used to be, so it feels pretty easy!

“Did you move for a job?” I hope so!

It was funny watching people react to that one. It felt so natural to just pick up my life and trust  it would all work out, I forgot that other people weren’t in on that strategy.  Honestly, having a job right off the bat would have made some things a little smoother. But I didn’t, and everything is fine.

I moved because I was desperate to get away from the east coast and a life that just didn’t click. And because deep in my heart, I knew I wanted to be closer to home and have a cold winter. Those two things were never going to happen where I was.

Duluth came about because I put this frustrated request to my ancestors and guides: “I’ve been trying to figure this out for two solid years. I have no idea what to do!! Help. Give me an idea, and I’ll act on it, I promise.”

I’ve been in touch with my ancestors for a while now, and I learned they can support me in all sorts of ways. This time it was an idea that popped into my head right after I asked that question: “what about Duluth?”

Huh. I had never been to Duluth, and it wasn’t on my radar at all. I made a quick list of what I want in a place: a few good coffee shops, lots of parks & hiking trails, small-ish city but big enough to have stuff going on every day, music studio to potentially teach at. I opened up a maps app and found all of these things in Duluth. And a folk school, bonus!

Ok! That’s that, THANK YOU for the idea (it’s perfect). The logistics fell into place with ease, and I moved a few months later. 

Now I work at both the music studio and folk school I found that day, hike the trails I identified, and frequent a few coffee shops. 

Why do we centralize our jobs so much? I know there’s a certain amount of logistics that a job can solve - I’m not living so high on the hog that I can cruise through life without an income. 

But how often do we shut down possibilities because we insist on having a clear picture of what our job / income / career needs to be?

1qnp74i,https://i.redd.it/cfwp65g7qqfg1.jpeg,[RANT #2] Is it ADHD or just trauma?,"(Image unrelated)

Ok, so, a few months back I made a rant stressing about my ongoing ADHD diagnosis and how thinking about it may be affecting my subconcious.

So now I'm here with further development! Hi, I'm a 14-and-a-half-year-old boy and I'm freaking out! I'll try to put it into words.

So, in my last therapy session I've been told I likely don't have ADHD because I hit all developmental marks quite early actually (plus, I never got grades low enough to worry, which isn't entirely true, more on that later!), which sucks for me, because up until that point the diagnosis had sort of been a driving force for me, it got me all giddy waking up in the morning and going to tell my friends about my progress but after the news I kinda got shattered, y'know? It all got sort of bleak and confusing, because the one thing giving me a great sense of direction was just heavily toned-down, I admit, that's on me for putting such an expectation on it while half-knowing I'd be bummed in case of a knock-down, but still, it felt like a journey leading to the grand conclusion, the big finale for the act and all that jazz, I'm pretty sure it felt like that because of how ""bad"" my life has been, I was born into a failling marriage, grew up into the divorce and learned to find love something not worth trying due to my mother's series of increasingly bad decisions, such as dating bad people and trying to integrate them into my life only to break up with them after 1½ years and move on way too fast, going back to her abusive ex-husband because ""he changed"" in the last 5 years, etc. First of all, I truly do believe people are never inherently bad and they can always change for the better, but I sure as hell am not obligated to let then back in after being hurt so badly! Secondly, Having ADHD would make all of that hassle part of the journey and ""worth it', y'know? It'd complete my character arc.

Ok, I'm gonna expand on that because ""wtf, mom?!"". So, my parents had the worse marriage ever; Drinking, physical/mental abuse, big fights and three growing children were a bad-bad mix, all of that plus the fact they weren't always there due to work made life just a bit harder on us, thankfully they divorced when I was around 9 and life got better, they went their separate ways and were much happier alone than together, but then multiple events started happening in the recent years, most somewhat related to my mom, them being my sister's abusive girlfriend and her bum of a boyfriend (her current one is a ray of sunshine on my life btw), my mom enrolling me in after-school junk I didn't ask for in hopes of getting me somewhere while those mess up my mental health even further, my mom inviting my sister's partners and at some point her own sister, nephew and father to live with us, not all at the same time but they were coming and going while staying for some time, which ended up creating my own personal circle of hell and screwin' up my vision on 'love' because all I ever saw of it was a complete failiure.

And to top all of that, my mom was always saying bad stuff about my dad up until the very end, which obviously drove me into having a certain image of my dad, and that image isn't unfounded, he WAS bad until the divorce happened and after it as well, which made the news that my parents were together again all the more shocking, I mean, you had all that work trying to get rid of him only to go right back into it at a moments notice?! And it wasn't gradative either, oh no, in less than a week my father broke up with his previous (cool) wife and got with my mom, who had recently broken up as well. You can see how that fricked up me pretty bad, suddenly having your parents speedrunning being back together when you were having literal nightmares about them even getting close is a stressful situation to put on the shoulders of a kid!

And as if that wasn't enough, after a little more than a week later she completely moved out of our house to live with him, leaving only me and my sister to live in our home. I got used to it after a while, having the house all to myself while my sister works was pre-tty-killer! My mother hadn't ""abbadoned"" me, but her decision to be there still left a bad taste in my mouth, still, that was her life with her problems, I only had to be involded in that weird thing relationship here and there, all fine and dandy. Then she began talking about us all moving together and how she couldn't afford to keep 2 houses, and I was like ""Well, that's YOUR Prolblem! No one is forcing you to go back to your ex-husband and move-in with him! Plus, none of your other relationships lasted more than a year-and-a-half so what makes you think it'll be SO different with your ex-husband besides this disgustingly delusional world you built for yourself?!"", of course I never said it to her face but I'm feeling it pretty darn intensively!!

Mind you, this all happened in the span of 4 months!! I'm well aware its my mother's first time living and she isn't perfect but that doesen't excuse her actions and how they affect the people around her, after all, she's an adult! She shouldn't be so reckless! She says I'll ""understand when I'm old"", I say she's delusional. So now you guys can see how most of my life has had problem after problem surrouding me and being in the background, which obviously stunted my development and world-view, which all lead up to the therapist saying how my parents and the divorce might be the reason why act like I do. She says that if ADHD could be developed then I'd likely have it, which means that I DO fit the criteria but because of the divorce, my development and my grades I'm suddenly less of a fit.

About my grades, it is true that I never had to miss breaks to re-do tests or went to close to sun but thats mostly because of 2 thing, one of them being the fact that my school has a 3rd grade besides the 2 tests each bimester, that instead of being a quiz, its an assignment like ""Do a powerpoint!"" Or ""Act in a play!"", which are obviously much easier to ace and so they end up bumping-up my grades, without those, I'd have worse grades; the other factor is that I didn't struggle with learning at a young age and that I began started struggling post-divorce, when my therapist said that I immediatly called it false because the work-load of a toddler is obviously easier than of a pre-teen, to which she replied by saying that the learing curve matches with the children's age and that the difficulty then was comparable with the difficulty now, which is total crap because excellng at a young age and falling out later is the most ADHD thing ever! But anyways, could it be true? Am I seeking shelter in a diagnosis like that because of the divorce? Could I not have ADHD becaude of I hit the developmental marks?

I don't know, I just wish I didn't have to deal with all of this at a young age, I wish it didn't hurt so bad.

When we started, we thought: 'It’s 2026, surely React Native has an easy way to record a camera overlay, right?' **Wrong.**

We spent so many nights debugging why things weren't working. Also, for the android we searched everywhere for a reliable in-app screen recorder library but came up empty-handed so we ended up with writing a native module for video image overlay. It was honestly soul-crushing and we almost shelved the project.

Instead of quitting, we decided to 'hack' our way through it with two different solutions:

* On **IOS**, we managed to get it working with Vision Camera and a native-side in-app recording bridge.
* On **Android**, since we couldn't find a recorder, we had to get creative and use Media3 to handle the overlays on top of the Vision Camera feed.

It’s built with a lot of coffee, late-night debugging on my iPhone 13, and my FZ's from classes.

I’m sharing this because I’m proud we didn't give up when the libraries failed us. If you’re a dev, you know that feeling of finally seeing your 'workaround' actually work.

I’d love for you guys to check it out and give me some honest (even brutal) feedback.

Also, for the android we searched everywhere for a reliable in-app screen recorder library but came up empty-handed so we ended up with writing a native module for video image overlay. It was honestly soul-crushing and we almost shelved the project.

Instead of quitting, we decided to 'hack' our way through it with two different solutions:

* On **IOS**, we managed to get it working with Vision Camera and a native-side in-app recording bridge.
* On **Android**, since we couldn't find a recorder, we had to get creative and use Media3 to handle the overlays on top of the Vision Camera feed.

It’s built with a lot of coffee, late-night debugging on my iPhone 13, and my FZ's from classes.

I’m sharing this because I’m proud we didn't give up when the libraries failed us. If you’re a dev, you know that feeling of finally seeing your 'workaround' actually work.

I’d love for you guys to check it out and give me some honest (even brutal) feedback.

Here is the correlation matrix regarding diet, sleep, and supplements","**TLDR**: I tracked my RLS-symptoms and variables for one year. Stress, late coffee and a lot of alcohol is bad. Electrolytes, no stress and going to bed early is good.

  
**I. Methodology**:

I tracked my restless legs symptoms for one year using the [Bearable](https://bearable.app/)\-app. I also tracked different variables ranging from lifestyle and sleep behavior to nutrition and supplements. I then used the app to look at correlations between the variables and my symptom score (avg. symptom score with / without the variable). The symptom score ranges from 0 to 4 which I defined as no symptoms at all (0) to intense symtomps immune to medicial remedies over a longer period of time (4). Variables are eather true/false or range from ""little"", ""medium/moderate"" and ""a lot"".

I did not include data in the table below which only had a very small effect for clarity (e. g. drinking ""little alcohol"" or experiencing""little stress"").

  
**II. Findings**:

|Variable|Effect on symptom score (same day)|
|:-|:-|
|Magnesium|\+29%|
|L-Tyrosin|\+21%|
|A lot of stress|\+21%|
|A lot of alcohol|\+14%|
|Vitamin B12|\+14%|
|Ginger Shot|\+14%|
|Late bedtime|\+14%|
|||
|High activity level|\-13%|
|Electrolytes|\-14%|
|No late coffee|\-20%|
|Red meat|\-20%|
|Moderate alcohol|\-20%|
|No Stress|\-25%|
|Early bedtime|\-40%|
|Traveling|\-73%|

  
**III. Interpretation**:

I think the data needs to be examined with a loooot of caution. Its just me with some very subjective tracking. However, with some theoretical perspective, I think we can draw some conclusions.

1. Stress is bad. A lot of stress has a strong positive (bad) effect on the intensity of my symptoms on the same day (see above) and on the next day (+21%). On the flip side, having no stress at all has a strong negative (good) effect. Little and medium stress didn't have a significant effect.
2. Alcohol is bad. Just looking at the table above would suggest drinking some alcohol - however, I think one shouldn't take the result with a big grain of salt as there might be confounders at work. When I drink little or moderate amounts of alcohol, I usually spend time with friends, therefore are less stressed and more happy, which is less likely to trigger symptoms. If you look at the correlation between ""medium alcohol"" and symptom intensity on the next day, there is a 36% increase. 
3. Coffee is not necessarily bad, its about the timing. Drinking a lot of coffee doesn't trigger my rls but drinking it late in the day does. Maybe because the caffein as the trigger substence looses its effect after a couple of hours so if I drink my last cup at around 2pm, it can't trigger rls in the night anymore. Moderate coffee consumption (e. g. 2 cappocinos a day) actually decreases symptoms for the next day (-20%).
4. Electrolytes are the only supplements that help. I don't think B12 and L-Tyrosin (see this [theory](https://aminotheory.com/rlsd/)) are true triggers but they certainly don't help. Magnesium might actually be bad for me, which is interesting as I don't see the causal pathway. Also, the good effect of electrolytes depends on the type/brand. One brand did nothing for me (tracked it seperately) another has had the seen effect. Iron seems to be a mixed bag. Eating red meat seems to help, although it shouldn't make a difference to my iron levels on the same day.
5. Oral iron has no effect, red meat does. BUT since iron levels usually take a lot of time to increase or decrease, eating red meat during one day shouldn't effect my levels significantely.
6. Not being (too) tired is important. Going to bed early seems to help - although I don't quite understand why. I get that being tired and going to bed late is bad but why is going to bed early good?
7. Traveling is GREAT. When I travel, I have the lowest symptom score ever. But why? Is it because I am not stress? Happier? Food? Weather? All of it?



**IV. Further Study:**

I might look into sugar as a trigger and might try some other supplements (suggestions?). I might also try differentiating between different dosages of electrolytes to see whether more is better.

Hi all,

I’m a corporate professional with a calm, well-mannered, gentlemanly approach to relationships. Recently relocated to Pune after a couple of years in the US, where I learned a lot from polycules and couples about what makes multi-partner dynamics healthy and sustainable. I value depth, clarity, kindness, and steady communication.

What I’m seeking

A polyandry or FLR-leaning dynamic with a clear hierarchy: the alpha as the primary partner with the lady, and me as the supportive beta.

I’m also open to other configurations — V, triad, kitchen-table poly, or egalitarian poly — if our values align.

The focus for me is emotional connection, mutual respect, and long-term compatibility, not casual encounters.


How I show up

Beta mindset: low-ego, compersion-forward, happy to be secondary and to uphold the primaries’ bond.

Boundaries and honesty: enthusiastic consent, regular check-ins, transparent expectations, and respect for privacy.

Logistics and stability: reliable with time, good at planning, and happy to contribute to shared logistics and costs where appropriate.

Conflict-light: I communicate clearly, de-escalate gently, and protect the relationship’s center from drama.

Community-minded: comfortable with metamours, group norms, and keeping everyone informed without over-sharing.


A bit about me

Open-minded, emotionally intelligent, and dependable. Outdoorsy, film lover, traveler, and a thoughtful listener. I prefer slow, organic pacing, meeting for coffee first, and aligning on values, boundaries, and hopes before labels. Discretion and health-conscious habits are a given.

If this resonates

DM with your city, current structure, what you’re exploring, and any non-negotiables. I’m happy to start with a simple conversation and see whether our dynamics, pace, and expectations align.

Celly opened her eyes. She had fallen asleep before... She glanced at the clock. 2:30 p.m. Half an hour ago. But she always got tired when driving. Luckily, it was Charlie who sat in the driver’s seat. Celly saw that they were slowly moving away from the East Coast. They had driven to Philadelphia and were now on Route 30 towards Pittsburgh. They would soon leave that road to drive southwest through West Virginia. Behind them lay the large northern East Coast cities, to the south was the federal capital, but Celly wasn't thinking about any of that, because on the horizon, the dark green forested hills of the Appalachians were slowly approaching. The huge expanses of foliage already showed remarkable patches of red and green, transforming the forest, which was otherwise the same color all year round, into a wonderful blaze of various colors. But the colorful glow was clearly dampened by the silvery light gray cloud cover in the sky, in which Celly could not see a single patch of blue. 

Wafts of mist hung lazily over the treetops of the forests, seemingly weightless as they floated away with the light autumn breeze. Like hundred-armed ghosts, they rose and fell, lending the scene a mysterious character. Celly loved these mountains; they were the backbone of the eastern United States. On the other hand, the forests of the Appalachians were not just any forests. Comparing them to ghosts was perhaps not too far-fetched in this part of the world. Celly glanced to the side and watched the landscape pass by. Hopefully the weather would be better next week. 

 

Where could Belly be right now? Was she already on her way? Celly remembered what Charlie had told her on Friday. He had been in the laboratory and had attended a meeting about the publication of the project results. After the business part, the conversation had meandered a bit into the personal lives of the participants, with Charlie mentioning that he was going to the Appalachians with Celly next week. He also told them about the Mothman sighting. Someone mentioned the mysterious old woman, and theories were thrown back and forth. Suddenly, Belly had interjected and said that she would also be going to Duxington. She was also interested in this matter. Besides, she had always wanted to visit the Appalachians and would probably meet an old acquaintance among Baker's audience. 

All of this was highly remarkable. It was so unlike Arabella to do anything spontaneously. She was not a big traveler, so much so that some people mocked her behind her back, saying she had probably never left Massachusetts in her life. 

Celly was also curious about her motives, but she was mainly interested in finally meeting this woman in person after all this time. 

 

Hours later, they finally saw a sign on the side of the road that read “Duxington.” It was already getting dark, which suddenly made the woods on either side of the road seem a lot more eerie. Celly thought of H. Baker and was very glad that they hadn't taken his shortcut, the old road, not just because of its poor and dangerous condition. 

Was it here? Could this strange creature, which had been haunting the edge of the American collective consciousness for decades, really be found somewhere in these woods? Could this black angel really be found here? 

“Let's hope no old women scare us,” Charlie said, mockingly, exhausted from the long drive. But he himself had said that undertaking this trip on Monday morning would have been more annoying than driving on Sunday. So he was glad. 

“And if they did, they'd probably fly over our car around here,” Celly joked back. Duxington was now right in front of them. They drove over the white bridge, on the right side of which the damage Baker had left behind was still clearly visible. Suddenly, the story came alive. Celly was excited; she couldn't wait to meet this person.

 

Two hours later, they left their bed and breakfast and headed for the larger of the two bars in the small town. The establishment, advertised as having a longstanding tradition, was called “the Carolinian” and was named after a South States soldier, a man from South Carolina who had been separated from his troops during the Civil War and had fought a bloody battle with the enemy cavalry here on the Duxington Bridge. At least, that was the story that was told. In any case, there was a life-size statue of the Confederate Horatius above the entrance, dressed in a gray uniform and wearing aviator sunglasses that were probably not entirely historical. 

The rebel hero was more of a fun mascot than a heroic figure to this small town. When Celly and Charlie entered the bar, they first passed through a short hallway decorated on the left and right with old and new photos of people who, often emboldened by alcohol, had climbed onto the small canopy at Christmas or on the Fourth of July and posed with the plastic statue in all sorts of ways. Charlie laughed and pointed to one from the seventies. A man with a very unusual hairstyle had dressed up as Abraham Lincoln and stood triumphantly with the US flag next to the already snow-covered soldier, whom he crowned with an Advent wreath.

 

They entered the bar through a white plywood swing door. The light was warm and cozy, and the small room, panelled with wood up to the ceiling, was packed with people. To the right was the bar, behind which an elder woman had her hands full, but this did not seem to bother her in the slightest, as she gave the impression of having been there since before the turn of the millennium. Behind her were the coffee machine and the cash register, above which were two storage areas built into the wall, filled with bottles of all kinds and illuminated from behind in blue. 

To the right were the tables. Tables for three, four, five, and six. People sat and stood, clinked glasses, recognized and hugged each other, the locals fraternized with the visitors. 

Opposite the entrance was the center of the action. There, at a prominent table surrounded by people, sat two men on one side and one on the other. In front of them were several glasses, three closed and two open folders, a laptop, papers, and photos. They were engrossed in a relaxed but serious discussion that was open to listeners. Every now and then, someone from outside would join in, comment on something, or one of the three men would seek support for a point he had made and turn to his audience. From time to time, laughter could be heard, drowning out the lively babble of voices for a second.

 

Charlie headed for the bar, Celly following him. He ordered beer, and the bartender fetched two half-liter bottles and placed them in front of them with a hearty “here you go.” Charlie gave her some coins, she opened the cash register and put the money away. Then she returned to her guests, who had just arrived. It was clear to her from the start that the two were not from around here. She turned to the young couple and pointed to the man sitting alone on the right side of the central table. ""That's Hudson, Hudson Baker. Opposite him is Dexter, the greatest expert on the Mothman in all of West Virginia and therefore also the director of the museum in Point Pleasant, and next to him is a certain Mr. Smith from Tennessee, who has been interested in the paranormal for a long time. A strange man, but people seem to like him. And they've been discussing for quite a while, it's never been so interesting.""

 

“Let's go over there,” said Celly. They joined the circle of spectators that had formed around the discussion. They listened to the conversation for a while, when the swing door opened again. Celly turned away from the talk about the potential sightings of the Mothman in China for a moment to see who had come in. It was a woman wrapped in a long black coat. Her hair was gray, but her face showed hardly any wrinkles, making it extremely difficult to guess her age. Celly studied the fine features, which had something aristocratic about them, and finally looked directly into her shimmering ice-blue eyes. The woman's gaze was hard and clear, but Celly did not feel threatened.  

 

That changed when the woman approached them. But she didn't address Celly. She addressed Charlie. “Charles,” she said laconically. “Good to see you.” Charlie turned around. “Professor!” he said with a slight, joyful surprise that Celly knew was feigned, and turned to Celly. “Celly, this is Arabella Romelia, my boss. Professor, this is my girlfriend.” “Call me Ara,” said the professor curtly, “that's with an A, not an E like in Era.” She shook Celly's hand, or rather, she grabbed Celly's fingers with her steel-claw-like ones and let her feel her muscles. She had an extremely unpleasant handshake, but Celly returned it. “Call me Celly,” she replied lightly, “that's Celly with a C and an E, not Sally with an S and an A. It's short for Celeste.” Arabella nodded briefly in acknowledgment. “Beautiful name. Congratulations to your parents, Celly. Well, it's nice to meet you. See you around.” With that, she walked off to the left. Charlie and Celly exchanged a furtive and meaningful glance. As they turned their attention back to the discussion, Celly noticed that Mr. Smith was watching them. He had obviously been following their brief interaction with interest. Celly's suspicions were confirmed when she followed the gaze of his shimmering ice-blue eyes and found Arabella among the crowd. What did he want with her? Well, maybe she was just imagining things. Maybe he was confusing her with someone else. For the second time, she turned her attention back to the discussion. That was the moment she got to know Daphne.

 

The discussion had become somewhat heated at the front. Mr. Smith, referred to as Ethan by his counterpart, expressed the opinion that Hudson Baker could have attempted to determine whether the Mothman was intelligent. “But Mr. Baker,” exclaimed someone to the left of Celly in a tone dripping with sarcasm, ""Mr. Smith is correct! This oversized mix between a human and a flying animal, which mercilessly attacked you and against which your bullets were powerless, why didn't you just say hello to it in a friendly manner?” Laughter. ”Or when it clung to your roof, you could have..."" The young lady didn't get any further, because Ethan Smith interrupted her with a condescending reply. Applause from some corners, but loud approval was heard for the immediate response from the woman from the other side of the audience. Dexter stood up and, with a few conciliatory words, drew attention back to the discussion at the table. Celly was interested in the challenger.  She moved a little to the right and soon saw a young woman with short brown hair who was just leaving the circle. Her eyes caught Celly's searching gaze, and Celly approached her.

 

“You know, I think you're right. People tend to overestimate what they can and cannot do in a dangerous situation. As if you could conduct behavioral experiments in the middle of the night with such a monster of unknown danger.” The young woman laughed. ""Absolutely. Men like to overestimate themselves. But you seem to be speaking from experience, as it seems to me somehow... I'm Daphne.“ ”Celly, “replied Celly. ”Yes, I was a detective until recently, but unfortunately I was fired."" Celly saw Daphne's eyes flash. Her face took on a highly interested expression, a highly interesting one at that. Celly noticed Daphne's unusual face shape even more than before. She had soft cheeks, an almost perfectly round face, and a very pointed nose. Celly found her extremely likeable. She told her about her work as a private investigator and learned that Daphne worked in IT. Later, Charlie joined them.

 

And Arabella. While Charlie was explaining to Daphne how they had gotten from Route 30 to the road to Duxington on their way here, Celly saw Ethan Smith talking to Arabella a little further back and asking her something. But she only replied very briefly and walked away. Smith was soon engaged in conversation, and Arabella joined Celly, Charlie, and Daphne, being introduced to the latter by Celly. The discussion had ended, and Baker was walking around. He had just left a group of older women standing at the bar and approached Charlie, who welcomed him with a few friendly words and introduced him to the group around him. Hands were shaken, smiles exchanged. All around, the room grew louder and livelier, the atmosphere was excellent. Then suddenly three shots through the night were heard from outside, followed by a stifled scream. The bar fell deathly silent.

1qnog4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiringpakistan/comments/1qnog4m/hiring_this_might_be_the_reason_youre_not_hearing/,[Hiring] This might be the reason you’re not hearing back,"Hi everyone 👋

I wanted to share some practical advice that I hope helps your resume stand out and at least get you interviews. 

Just to be clear upfront: **I have nothing to sell you.**

**Quick background:**

I was raised in Texas, started out as a software engineering intern (Houston → Austin → NYC), went full-time, then quit to start my own consulting firm, which I’ve been running for 5+ years. Most of my experience is U.S.-centric, but honestly, a lot of this applies almost everywhere.

Over the last decade, I’ve hired 50+ people, conducted hundreds of interviews, and reviewed thousands of resumes — including a lot from Pakistan. Here are some patterns I keep seeing.

Some of this may sound nit-picky, but here’s the uncomfortable truth: **Most hiring managers are looking for reasons to pass on your resume.** 

Not because they’re evil — because they’re overwhelmed. When you’re getting flooded with resumes, the difference between an interview and the delete button can be tiny. Fair or not, that’s the reality.

A few things that really matter:

**1. Keep your resume to ONE page (for 99% of people).**

Make it clean and scannable. A minimalist layout helps a lot. Don’t overdesign it, but also, a dense black-and-white Word doc isn’t ideal either. We’re not reading resumes. We’re scanning them.

**2. Zero typos. Zero grammar issues.**

There’s absolutely no excuse for this in a post-GPT world. I see this a lot with resumes from Pakistan, and whether it’s fair or not, it sends a bad signal. If there are errors in your most important professional document, it’s hard to trust that you’ll be detail-oriented in client emails or internal work.

**3. Please don’t put mirror selfies or coffee-shop photoshoots on your resume.**

Honestly, you don’t need a photo at all. But if you do include one, make it a professional headshot (or at least a clean photo where you’re looking at the camera). Let’s save the edited photoshoot pics for Instagram, please. 😅

**4. Add your LinkedIn profile.**

It helps a lot. It gives you an online presence and puts a face to the name.

**5. And please make sure the LinkedIn link actually works.** 😐

Keep it updated. Use a professional photo. I’m tired of clicking broken links.

**6. Don’t send your resume in an empty email.**

It comes off as a bit rude. A short, polite message goes a long way. Even if you’re sending it “cold,” just say what you’re looking for (full-time/part-time, availability, type of role, etc). And again, zero typos.

**7. Following up is fine. Overdoing it isn’t.**

We do *want* to get back to you. But we’re also running businesses, managing teams, and doing the actual work. Daily follow-ups get annoying fast. When you do follow up, be polite and reduce friction.

**8. Avoid over-explaining personal hardships or desperation.**

On a human level, I really feel for you. On a hiring level, it unfortunately makes you a riskier hire. The most attractive combo is confidence in what you bring plus humility and willingness to learn.

**9. If you get an interview:**

Show up a few minutes early. Dress nicely. Test your mic and camera beforehand. Reduce friction. Ask *meaningful* questions. Send a brief thank you note afterward (very few people do this still).

**10. This one might be unpopular, but it’s true: people hire people they like.**

You don’t need to fake being a bubbly extrovert. Just be respectful and easy to deal with. Many companies (mine included) have a strict no-as\*holes policy. Talent isn’t worth it if you make everyone else miserable.

I hope this helps. Some of it may be uncomfortable, but I promise, this is what actually works.

Happy to answer questions in the comments and good luck with the job search!",11,1769452298.0,hiringpakistan,3,0.93,False
1qnofgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qnofgr/aita_for_evicting_my_sister_after_she_accessed_my/,"AITA for evicting my sister after she accessed my computer 7 times, sent my resume to my boss saying 'she's planning to leave,' then claimed it was an accident?","My sister forwarded my resume to my boss with a note that said ""She's planning to leave, thought you should know"" and I only found out because HR accidentally cc'd me on their response thanking her.

I confronted her yesterday and she actually tried to tell me it was an accident. Said she ""slipped up at dinner"" when my boss's wife asked how I was doing. Except I never told her I was job hunting. And even if I had, you don't email someone's resume to their employer by accident.

The email from HR was supposed to go just to my boss but someone in their office messed up the reply chain. I saw everything. Her message, my boss's response asking if I'd given notice yet, HR discussing whether to start looking for my replacement. My resume attached. The one I'd updated two weeks ago and saved on my laptop at home.

She went through my computer. We share a living room office since she moved in six months ago after her divorce. I thought we were helping each other out.

I called her immediately. She answered with ""Hey what's up"" like nothing was wrong.

""Did you send my resume to my boss?""

Silence. Then, ""Oh my god, I can explain.""

""Explain what? Explain how you went through my private files and sent them to my employer?""

""I didn't mean to! I was at dinner with Mark and Jennifer,"" (my boss and his wife, who my sister met once at a company picnic), ""and Jennifer asked about you and I got nervous and said something about you looking around and then Mark asked if you'd found anything yet and I panicked.""

""That doesn't explain the email.""

""He asked me to send over your resume so he could help with references.""

""References. He asked you for references so he could help me leave the company he runs.""

""I thought he was being nice!""

I actually laughed. ""You thought my boss wanted to help me get a different job?""

""Maybe he was going to offer you more money to stay?""

The thing is, I wasn't even seriously looking. I'd updated my resume because a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn and I wanted to see what else was out there. I like my job. I'm good at it. I was just keeping my options open.

Now my boss thinks I'm desperately hunting for an exit and HR is probably already interviewing replacements.

I told her she had until the end of the week to find somewhere else to live.

She started crying. ""You're kicking me out over a mistake?""

""You went through my computer, found a private document, and sent it to my employer with a note telling them I'm leaving. That's not a mistake, that's sabotage.""

""I was trying to help! I thought if Mark knew, he could make you a better offer before you left!""

""I'm not leaving! I wasn't leaving! I was browsing!""

""Well how was I supposed to know that?""

""You weren't supposed to know anything because it wasn't your business!""

She showed up at my office this morning. Waited in the lobby until I came down for coffee. Started apologizing loudly where everyone could hear. My coworkers were staring. Security had to ask her to leave.

My boss called me in after. Asked point blank if I was unhappy. If there was anything he could do to keep me. I explained the whole situation and he actually seemed relieved, but the damage is done. HR knows. My team knows something happened. Everyone's treating me different now.

I checked my computer history. She accessed my files seven times over the past month. My resume, my personal emails, my bank statements. Everything.

My parents called tonight saying I'm overreacting. That she made a mistake and family forgives family. That she's going through a hard time with the divorce and I'm making it worse.

But she went through my private files. She contacted my employer without my knowledge. She lied about it being a slip up at dinner when she deliberately sent that email. And she only apologized when she realized I found out.

My dad said I'm being cruel kicking her out when she has nowhere to go. My mom said I'm holding a grudge over nothing.

But it's not nothing, right? She could have cost me my job. She definitely cost me my boss's trust and my privacy.

She's staying with my parents now and they're furious with me. Won't answer my calls except to tell me I need to apologize and let her move back in.

AITA for kicking out my sister after she told my boss I was job hunting?

1qnofcx,https://i.redd.it/hm2l3hmylqfg1.png,"As a CS student, building this camera app was a nightmare. Almost gave up on the Android version, but we finally made it.","I’m a CS student and for the past few months, my friend and I (we call ourselves 2Arc) have been obsessed with building a 'Ranking Filter' app. You know, those fun filters where you rank things in real-time.

When we started, we thought: 'It’s 2026, surely React Native has an easy way to record a camera overlay, right?' **Wrong.**

We spent so many nights debugging why things weren't working. Also, for the android we searched everywhere for a reliable in-app screen recorder library but came up empty-handed so we ended up with writing a native module for video image overlay. It was honestly soul-crushing and we almost shelved the project.

Instead of quitting, we decided to 'hack' our way through it with two different solutions:

* On **IOS**, we managed to get it working with Vision Camera and a native-side in-app recording bridge.
* On **Android**, since we couldn't find a recorder, we had to get creative and use Media3 to handle the overlays on top of the Vision Camera feed.

It’s built with a lot of coffee, late-night debugging on my iPhone 13, and my FZ's from classes.

I’m sharing this because I’m proud we didn't give up when the libraries failed us. If you’re a dev, you know that feeling of finally seeing your 'workaround' actually work.

I’d love for you guys to check it out and give me some honest (even brutal) feedback.

I used to work in an office environment with a lot of peers and it was awesome. I really liked going out to grab a coffee with a coworker and talking about random things, sometimes getting deeper, and forming friendships. There was something really special about having some good chats and support throughout the work day, even if I had other relationships/friendships in my life.

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that last year was quite difficult for me, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

The most important thing to me in the conversations would be honesty and consistency. It would be great to receive that, and I would be happy to do the same.

1qno97t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qno97t,Realized I have rosacea - what next?,"I’ve gone my whole life with oily skin, large pores, and major facial redness. When I was a teenager, I had acne-prone skin for those years, but in adulthood my skin “leveled out” to what you see in these photos. I don’t often have whiteheads or cystic acne unless it’s around that time of my cycle, so I honestly thought welp this is as good as it gets! 

A TikTok from the influencer Cammie Scott (known for her skincare recommendations and smooth skin) came up in my FYP recently, and she was detailing her journey of treating her rosacea. When I saw her before photos I was floored! It looked like me! I didn’t even realize anything was “wrong” other than disliking the constant redness and uneven skin texture. I didn’t know it was something you could fix. I feel so much joy at the thought that I can actually do something about this, when I thought I would be self conscious forever and never be able to go out without makeup. 

I’ve been spending a lot of time on this sub researching, and I’m wondering if anyone has experience with “mild” type 2 rosacea? 

• I don’t think I experience flushing — my skin is always like this. I don’t drink alcohol or coffee, my diet could be cleaner but it’s not packed with sugar or salt. 

• Pustule outbreaks are few, I just always chalked them up as a byproduct of oily skin. 

• I don’t have burning or patchy dry skin. 

These symptoms don’t seem to align with what I see of typical Type 2 rosacea, other than the pustules, uneven bumpy texture, and rashy-looking redness. Anything I research online shows only the extreme end of the spectrum. 

Does anyone else have similar symptoms, and if so what did you find success with?

The issue is that when you make a weapon attack, on a hit you’re prompted to add class features, abilities, and weapon features, but you can only apply one even though they are not mutually exclusive.

For example, say I’m a paladin and death cleric multi-class using the duelist prerogative. I attack using booming blade. On hit I’m promoted to expend divine smite, touch of death, divine strike, and withering cut. All of these should be usable on the same hit. But I can only select one.

I know that I can select one as the attack action and then be able to apply another using the reactions window, but that inhibits the ability to to apply these for crits only, and it leaves a lot on the table still. Including the use of booming blade. 

An easy fix would be if turning off the “ask” feature worked and these features auto applied on crits. You could micro before attacking. But that doesn’t work either.

If nothing exists, would anyone be interested in engineering something like this? I’d be willing to buys someone’s coffee.

1qno7jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qno7jl/how_to_instantly_save_any_awkward_moment_the/,How to Instantly Save ANY Awkward Moment: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works,"I've spent way too much time studying social dynamics (books, research, podcasts, you name it) because I used to freeze up during awkward moments. The silence would stretch. My brain would shut down. I'd either mumble something weird or just... stand there dying inside.

Here's what I learned: awkwardness isn't actually about the situation. It's about how you respond to it. Most people make it worse by panicking or pretending nothing happened. But there are actual techniques that work, backed by psychology and tested in real life. This is what I wish someone told me years ago.

1. Acknowledge it immediately, then move forward

The fastest way to diffuse awkwardness is to name it. Not in a dramatic way, just casually. ""Well, that was awkward"" or ""okay, weird moment"" works perfectly. Dr. Brené Brown talks about this in her research on vulnerability. When you acknowledge discomfort instead of avoiding it, you take away its power. People actually relax because you're being real.

I use this constantly now. Someone makes an off color joke that lands badly? ""Yikes, tough crowd."" You walk in on a tense conversation? ""I have great timing, don't I?"" It shows you're human, aware, and not taking yourself too seriously.

2. Use humor as a social lubricant

Self deprecating humor (not the toxic kind) is insanely effective. When you mess up, make a light joke about yourself before anyone else can. Spill coffee on someone? ""I'm basically a walking disaster, sorry about that."" Forget someone's name? ""My brain just fully logged off there.""

The book The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane (she's coached executives at Stanford and taught at Yale) breaks down how humor creates instant connection. It signals confidence and puts people at ease. This book changed how I handle social situations completely. It's packed with practical techniques for handling awkward moments, building presence, and making people comfortable around you. Honestly one of the best communication books I've read.

3. Ask a question to shift focus

When things get uncomfortable, redirect attention. Ask the other person something about themselves. People love talking about their own experiences, and it takes pressure off the awkward moment.

Examples: ""Have you always lived here?"" ""What are you working on these days?"" ""How do you know \[mutual friend\]?"" The conversation moves forward instead of sitting in that painful silence.

Social psychologist Susan Fiske's research shows that asking questions activates the reward centers in people's brains. You're literally making them feel good while saving yourself from the awkwardness. Win win.

4. Physical movement breaks tension

This one's underrated. When things feel stuck, create movement. Suggest grabbing coffee, moving to a different spot, or even just shifting your position. Physical change creates mental change.

I learned this from the podcast The Art of Charm. The host Jordan Harbinger (former lawyer turned social dynamics expert) talks about how movement resets social energy. If you're trapped in an awkward conversation at a party, say ""I'm gonna grab a drink, want anything?"" Boom, you've created an exit or a transition.

5. Practice the 3 second rule

When something awkward happens, you have about 3 seconds before it becomes REALLY awkward. That's your window. Respond quickly with acknowledgment, humor, or redirection. Don't let the silence build.

This requires practice though. BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app developed by Columbia alumni that creates personalized audio content from top books, research papers, and expert talks. You can set a goal like ""improve social confidence"" and it'll pull relevant insights from sources like The Charisma Myth or Daniel Goleman's work, then generate a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan. The length and depth are fully adjustable, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute sessions with examples. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about specific struggles. It's been genuinely helpful for internalizing these concepts instead of just reading about them once and forgetting.

6. Master the art of the graceful exit

Sometimes the best save is knowing when to leave. You don't owe anyone an extended awkward conversation. ""I should let you go"" or ""I'm gonna catch up with some other people"" works fine. No elaborate excuses needed.

The book How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes gives like 92 tricks for conversations, including how to exit smoothly. She's a communication expert who's trained Fortune 500 execs. The techniques feel a bit mechanical at first but they work. My favorite: the ""white flag"" exit where you give the other person a compliment then excuse yourself. ""I love your perspective on this. I need to make a call but let's continue this later.""

7. Remember that everyone feels awkward

This might sound obvious but it helps. That person across from you? They're probably just as uncomfortable. Maybe more. When you realize awkwardness is universal, it loses some of its power.

Research from psychologist Thomas Gilovich shows we massively overestimate how much others notice our mistakes. He calls it the spotlight effect. We think everyone's watching us mess up when really they're worried about their own stuff.

8. Prepare your go to lines

Have a few phrases ready for common awkward situations. Not scripts, just safety nets. For me: ""Let me think about that"" (when someone asks something too personal), ""I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask"" (when I don't know), ""Fair enough"" (when someone says something I disagree with but don't want to debate).

9. Use empathy as your secret weapon

When someone else creates the awkward moment, help them out. If they fumble their words, don't make it worse. Jump in with ""I know what you mean"" or finish their thought generously. People remember when you save them from embarrassment.

Dr. Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence emphasizes this. The ability to recognize and respond to others' discomfort is what separates socially skilled people from everyone else. His book Social Intelligence dives deep into how our brains are wired for connection and how to leverage that.

10. Accept that some awkwardness is fine

Not every moment needs saving. Sometimes you just sit in it, shrug internally, and move on. The more comfortable you get with temporary discomfort, the less it controls you.

Honestly, half of social confidence is just deciding that awkward moments aren't catastrophes. They're blips. Everyone has them. The people who seem super smooth? They just recover faster and don't internalize it.

The real game changer for me was realizing that awkwardness often comes from caring too much about what others think. When you shift focus from ""how am I being perceived"" to ""how can I make this person comfortable,"" everything changes. It's not about performing perfectly. It's about being present and responsive.

These aren't magic fixes that work instantly every time. But they're tools. The more you use them, the more automatic they become. And eventually you'll notice you're not having as many awkward moments because you're handling the small ones before they escalate.",1,1769451813.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

Nowdays nicotine only seems to make me tired,"I've been using nicotine on the form of snus, chewing gum and nicotine pouches for the past.. 12-14 years or so? I started using mild snus (meaning 8-12mg) when i was in my early 20s. After a couple of years i was using actively, an mostly with snus that had around 20-24mg of nicotine per serving.

After 5 years i started to quit, moving to chewing gum and dropping the amount of nicotine from 24mg -> 1mg per serving. And I did quit for a while. Only to start back up again with gum, then snus. So going back the other way.

Now I have ""quit"" several times since then. Back when I met my wife, she did not like it, so I just quit. No issues then. That was my longest period without, maybe 6 months? Since then my times that I've been without have ranged from 2 weeks to 2 months.

But the thing is.. After you have quit and started so many times. You start to notice some things about it.

1. If I give in to the craving, I rarely get any good feels from it anymore. If something, I notice my heart rate going up slowly and muscles feeling heavy. And sure, of course it does give your brain a little reward that you wanna take it again.
2. My rest and exercise heart rates are vastly better when im off. And when im in gym, i have much more energy when i am not using. I didnt notice this much when i was in my early 20s- but as i creep towards the age of 35 - i do notice it. And during exercise my maximum heart rate necessarily does not go up. Its the resting rates between.Say, when i am not using, my heart rate goes up to 130 when I am doing a set, and comes back to 80 between sets. However, if I've taken nicotine prior to the gym, the change might be from 130 only to 105 or so.
3. Nicotine, especially in the morning, makes me tired. Not necessarily like i wanna sleep. But like I have absolutely no energy and overall just feeling like depressed. Being without the mornings are much easier. But its the habit thats hardest to kick.
4. I used to think that im just a bit nervous guy and when trying to do motions that need much control - my hands might get a bit... shaky.... but that might've been just the nicotine... You know like threading a needle or similar to it. I feel like I have much more precise control over my hands and fingers if it makes sense.

So I have quit again. But with this time I've loaded myself with bupropion for the past 2 weeks before quitting. And I do think it has eased the cravings.

And for the ""lip itching"" - that feeling that you need something to put under your lip when having your midday coffee at work? I've bought some caffeine pouches to help ease with that feeling lmao.

I dunno. Felt like typing this out to explain myself why i must not give in this time. Wish me luck.",2,1769451545.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

1qno2gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qno2gk/i_had_a_secret_relationship_with_a_teacher_for/,I had a secret relationship with a teacher for almost a Year.,"Hello everyone,

Let me start by saying that English isn't my first language but I'll try my best.  
During many years, I've had my doubts about sharing this story regarding my relationship with a teacher, not because I felt ashamed or anything, but because she is still active as a teacher and may harm her career or personal life and also due to knowing deep down that society frows upon this kind of things.

Due to the reasons mentioned above, let's call my teacher Hannah and let's refer to me as Mike.

I met Hannan when I was on my 12th grade (senior year if you're American), as she was my assigned Geography teacher for the hole school year. She was a 35yo woman, brown long hair with blonde highlights near the edges, brown eyes, about 160cm(5'3ft) tall and overall, a very nice, friendly and pleasant person. She wasn't smoking hot I'll admit, but she was slightly above average.

I was on the other hand only 18yo at the time, 178cm tall (5.8ft), brown eyes, dark brown hair and the voted class representative, mostly because I was a calm, helpful, funny but mature classmate, this last one mostly because life decided to take away my father a few years prior and I had to grow as the ""man of the house"".

I had classes like most students from Monday to Friday, from 08a.m to 18p.m and had about 5H of geography every week. 2 hours every Tuesday, another 2 every Wednesday and 1 hour on Friday every single week for 9 consecutive months, mixed with other different subjects of course.

As any other 18yo student I've had a few fantasies with teachers along the years, but that's exactly what they were, only fantasies. Heck, I've always been a down to earth guy and knew that dating a student or dating a teacher was ethically, professionally wrong and very frowned upon by anybody, especially the school administration.

So, how did our relationship even start?

I guess, it started normally as you meet anybody. The first class every student presented themselves, name, age, etc... and the next weeks were normal, but around the 2nd month of classes I approached her after class and said Me - ""Hey, do you have time for a quick talk?""  
Her - ""Sure, what's happening?""  
Me - ""It was brought to me recently that John loses focus and for the past few years nobody knew about it""  
Her - ""How so? Can you elaborate?""  
Me - ""Sure. So, I talked to him a few days ago and he explained that he had been recently diagnosed by a doctor and he was diagnosed with having a learning disability. He ran some exams and the doctor said that when he feels rushed or even stressed, he freezes and doesn't assimilate anything or just takes a long time to think, unlike most of us that when we may be brainstorming and sharing multiple ideas at once can listen to many opinions and form a opinion about something, his brain is still trying to sort out who was speaking and not yet what had been spoken.""  
Her - ""ok, that's good to know and I'll make sure to pay more attention to him.""  
Me - ""I'm trying to speak with every teacher just to make them aware of this matter, but I would appreciate that this would be kept secret since I don't feel that's appropriate of me ""exposing"" something that he trusted to share might be seen as a vulnerability.""  
Her - "" I understand that and thank you for reaching out and caring for him."" as she extended her hand and slowly caressed my arm as if comforting me.

So, for the next few classes she was extra careful, explained everything in detail, very calmly and even repeated the same sentence sometimes just to make sure that the most important parts to us of any specific subjects were being assimilated.

At some point I noticed that she sometimes would stare at me while teaching but brushed saying to myself - ""You're thinking too much of it, it's probably nothing.""

Nearing the end of the first trimester of school, we had our exams and during the exams, all of us would be split apart from each other just to make sure nobody was able to cheat, copy or share ideas from any other classmate. There I was reading the questions, thinking about the answers, facing down at the exam sheet, until I got that feeling. A strange feeling of being observed, so I lifted my head, as if I had finished the exam, scanned around the room and looked at her. She was sitting on her chair, still but focused on me, not for a second or two, not a glance, a fixed eye contact for about 3 minutes we looked into each other as if we had to talk to each and I thought – “Why does she keep staring at me? Does she think I’m stuck at some question and can’t figure out the answer? No… It’s been too long that we are maintaining eye contact to be an innocent gaze.”  
In the end of the exam, while collecting mine, she asked – “Is everything ok?” and I just nodded and said – “Yes! See you Friday.”  
The exam ended around 13p.m and this meant that it was time for lunch, so I walked to a nearby café to grab something to eat. Sometimes I joined my friends and had lunch on the school canteen, others we would go to a nearby supermarket and buy premade pizzas or whatever was in stock in the takeaway section, others I just went alone to wherever I pleased and ate anything I wanted.

Around 15 minutes after she enters the same café, asked what was on the menu, ordered a soup and a tuna sandwich. As she was about to sit, she noticed me on a table nearby and said – “Hey, you’re also here! Enjoy your lunch.” And after I stopped chewing my salad I replied – “Yea, thanks. Would you like to join me for lunch?”. She stopped for a minute to think about it and said – “Sure.” - While she sat. – “What did you think of the exam? Did it go well?”.  
Me – “I was ok. I didn’t find it too complicated.”  
Her - “There’s nothing new I hadn’t explained before” – she said while chuckling – “At some point during the exam you kept looking at me. Why was that?”  
Me – “I just felt observed and when I looked at you, you were already gazing at me, so it should be me asking that question.”  
Her – “Humm… Nothing much, just thinking.” – She said with a small grin.  
And I though to myself, “Just thinking… About what exactly? About me?” I questioned myself, but brushed it off once again as not to make it awkward.

So, I changed the subject and started asking questions about her; why did she chose to become a teacher; small things but a bit more personal while also sharing a bit of my life story with her.

A normal conversation between two people but also an informal friendship from a teacher with a student, but we didn’t care, there were no labels, it was just a lunch between two people.

After lunch we said goodbye to each other and kissed on the cheek as in our culture it’s seen as good manners to greet and say goodbye like this, but just this time, just after this lunch, unconsciously.

We didn’t walk back together to school as we knew it would look weird and suspicious even without saying it to each other, we just knew, so she went first and shortly after I went to the afternoon classes not to see each other again that day.

 

Comes Friday, everyone was eager to leave for the weekend, everyone kept talking about their plans, arranging lunches with other friends, parties, normal teenagers stuff and our last class for the day was, you guessed it… Geography.

So, everyone enters, sit around as they please since there were no assigned seats in any class and just keep talking.

She closes the classroom door and says – “Alright everyone, settle down please!”. Most of the class heard her and composes themselves to hold on a few more hours of classes. Everyone but a group of 4 guys in the further end of the classroom, still talking on a lower tone of voice so she asks again - “Settle down please!” while looking at them and waiting for them to hear her and pay attention to her class.

So, I turned around from the 2^(nd) row of chairs while opening my books and said – “Hey guys!”. Not in a condescending way, nor even annoyed, just a calm and firm reminder and they acknowledged, turned facing her and without saying anything ended the conversation and allowed her the chance to start the class. She looked at me, not amazed but without saying anything, recognizing that I could impose respect.  
I wasn’t the brightest student, I admit, I was good enough to get a B+ or around a 80/100 score, but I wasn’t immature as the rest of them. I wasn’t the captain of the soccer team or even the most popular guy in school, but I was well respected by everyone and always tried to be as friendly and helpful as they also knew they had my respect. But many of the students also knew that I wasn’t one to be messed with because on many instances I showed that I could endure a fight. I was noticed by many girls but I also had my goals set and dating anyone wasn’t one of them.  
My goals were simple back then, finish school and quit my part-time odd job and get a normal full-time job so I could help my mother bringing money home and put food on the table.

At the end of the class, while leaving the classroom, she called out my name and requested to speak to me, so I turned around and stood there waiting that everyone left.

She turned to me after clearing the chalk board and said – “Why did you intervened and called them out? I could handle them.” While closing her back after packing her books and crossing her arms right after.

“I know. I just thought they were being a bit disrespectful and you didn’t deserve it, plus were also exhausted for the week and just want to enjoy the weekend.” I said while holding my backpack with one strap on my shoulder.

“Thanks!” – she exhaled.  
So I turned around and headed for the door as some classmates were waiting for me outside the school, as I usually drove some of them home on my car since most of them didn’t have driving licenses yet.

Just before leaving I turned around, and asked her - “Hey… Would you like to have lunch on Sunday?”.  
While grabbing the classroom keys and her bag she froze as she heard my question. She looked at me with a straight face, considered what I just asked for a minute and said – “Mike… we can’t.”

Me – “Can’t we?” – I questioned.

“We Shouldn’t?” – She replied.

“I didn’t ask you if we should or not. I asked you if you would like to have lunch” I said calmly while looking her in the eyes and smiling.

She pondered, looked down than looked at me, smiled back and said “ok.”  
“Give me your phone number then, and I’ll call you Sunday” I replied while reaching for my pocket and grabbing my phone and unlocking it.

She typed her number, caught me off guard and kissed me on the cheek and said goodbye as we both left.

Upon reaching the school parking lot, everyone of my classmates entered the car were talking to each other’s, still coming up with plans for the weekend. Some even asked me if I wanted to go clubbing that night with them, as I still had a night shift on my job which started at 20 p.m, so I declined. I drove everyone home but kept thinking – “What was that kiss for? To thank me? Is she starting to like me? Am I also starting to catch feelings for her?”

Sunday comes and I called her a bit after 9 a.m. – “Hey, good morning! How are you? Still up for our lunch”.  
“Yea, I’m getting ready, where should we meet and what time?” – she said.

Me - “I’ll pick you up around 12 a.m. just send me the address”.

“Ok, I still have a few things to take care off and I’ll send you after.” – she replied.

Me - “Alright, see you soon.”

Around 11:45 a.m., my phone notification buzzed with a WhatsApp address ping from her number.

I was ready and lived not too far from her address, took me around 20 minutes to drive there. When I arrived, I found a parking space near some other cars and parked my Peugeot 308 Sw 2014 version bought second hand at the time with around 80000 kms but still a decent and reliable car, so I texted her – “I just arrived and I’m waiting for you outside”.

She still took an extra 10 minutes to be ready and leaving her apartment until she met me outside.

I was leaning against my car, my phone in hands, probably just scrolling through Instagram and then I saw her exiting the building front door.

She was wearing a light purple dress that reached her knees, classy but not too fancy or formal. On her shoes, she was wearing some light brown high heel Sandals and to complement her outfit, also had a small white purse. Her hair wasn’t straightened like she usually wore it, but rather a French butterfly hairstyle.

She looked amazing! I thought while putting away my phone onto my pocket, standing up.

She greeted me as usual, kiss on the cheeks but I could see her cheeks a bit red and shy while approaching me and also mixed with a bit of fear to go out with someone that was clearly way younger than her. Not because she didn’t knew me or didn’t trust me, but because of what other neighbors might think of it.

Me - “You look amazing today!” – I said while we both kissed each other on the cheek.

Her - “Thank you! You look good as well.” – she said while blushing.

Me - “Are you ready to go?”  
Her - “Yes, I’m ready. Where are we going?”

Me - “You’ll have to wait and see. “- I said while smiling.

So, we hit the road and drove to a restaurant while speaking all the way about everything and anything, not about school, just about life.  
I didn’t get to go that often to this restaurant because it was 1 hour away but I liked it allot because it was a very chill place, had great local traditional food and an amazing outdoor area with a small lake and a few animals. A perfect place to enjoy a weekend meal far away from the city rush.

We kept talking like two long friends that hadn’t seen each other’s for some time. Talked about future plans, our past, our families, just about anything and everything it was on our minds.

At some point she even admitted – “I was fearful to accept your invitation because it’s not right to go out with students.”

So, I replied – “I want you to know that I don’t want anything to change between us.” I said with a straight and serious face expression. - “I don’t want better grades nor for you to treat me different than any other student. I’m not doing this out of interests. I just want to get to know you better. The real Hannan.”

Her expression shifted from happy to serious as she understood that I wasn’t just a normal 18yo and her suspicions were being reveled and becoming true. I was mature, caring and understanding. An example for many but with a level of maturity only a 30yo could have.  
“I can see that.” - She said – “You are someone who knows how to have a talk, that can behave, and that’s not normal in someone your age. Why is that? Why are you like this?” - She asked intrigued.

“Let’s just say that life wasn’t easy on me and forced me to grow up.” – I said while looking down at the table, still empty and waiting for our food.

Without saying anything, she placed her hand on top of mine that was resting on the table near my plate. I felt her warm hand on top of mine, and looked at her. Her expression, understanding, signaling that she understood that I didn’t want to go any deeper but cared.

And there we were, holding hands, after a few seconds I turned my hand, palm facing upwards and slowly caressed her hand while changing subjects and talking about her.

After a few minutes, our food arrived, placed in front of each other, the main course. I chose a beef steak with egg on top and a side of fries and salad and she opted for a beef stew with baked potatoes.

We both ate while still sharing our interests, our goals, even our dreams, those kinds of talks that after we both had finished our meals still felt short on time. But we knew that we both had plans that afternoon and needed to get home soon. So, I excused myself as I needed to use the bathroom, which I actually needed to wash my hands but went ahead and paid for the whole meal.

When I got back to the table, I drank what ever was left of my drink and asked her – “Shall we go?”

As she replied – “We still need ask for the check.” – chuckling as if I had forgotten.

“All taken care of.” – I said while grabbing my jacket from the chair.

“What? Mike… you didn’t have to. How much do I owe you?” – She said while she lost her composure as she didn’t expect me to pay for the whole meal.

“Don’t worry. It’s my treat.” – I replied.

So, we entered my car and both sat on our seats while still taking. I waited for her to buckle her seatbelt for about two minutes, but she was so adamant speaking that she still needed evaluate a few exams so I reached for her seatbelt to buckle her up. She must have had understood that I was leaning in for a kiss, so she stopped talking, aligned herself with me and kissed me while closing her eyes.

I released her seatbelt and slowly backed away, caught by surprise. Not that I hadn’t envisioned my kissing her, but mostly because innocently it wasn’t what I was going for. I stood still looking at her and processing what just happened and I accepted the facts that it was clear we both liked each other and so went for another kiss. This time I put my hand on the back of her neck and kissed her passionately, both accepting that what we knew was forbidden and wrong, suddenly just felt so right.

The drive home, was definitely quieter, both processing what happened before and what this meant for us. Slowly accepting that maybe we could try and be a couple.

Upon reaching her house, she didn’t leave the car right away. She was thinking and asked – “Would you like to come in? We could have coffee.”  
I had planned to grab coffee that afternoon with some friends, but now, faced with this question, I said – “I already have plans, I’ll just walk you upstairs to your apartment and we can talk later.”

“Okay.” – she said.

We took the elevator to the 5^(th) floor, she opened her apartment door and we both entered.  
I just stood by the entrance, waiting to kiss her goodbye and then she pushed me against the hall wall and kissed me even more passionately while closing the door with her other hand.

What happened after, I think you already know…

There we were completely naked, laying in bed after a “cardio session”. Suddenly it had become real.

All those years dreaming of what would it be to be with a teacher, made come true.

I didn’t feel accomplished or anything like that. I felt connected with someone who was more than a teacher, another person who was kind hearted, pretty and mature. Who had most of her life figured out but deep down still a moral dilemma.

“I should go.” – I said.

“You don’t have to. You could stay you know…” – she replied.  
“Don’t get me wrong, I like you Hannah, but I think we should think about today and decide if we really want to be together.” – I said, with a serious expression.

“Do we really need to put a label on this? Can’t we just be together?” – She said with a slightly worried expression.

“We can be together, I just want to make sure that you didn’t rush anything and really like me, because we could both face serious consequences. I could be expelled and you could be fired.” – I said while still laying next to her and looking at her.

“Okay, let’s take a few days to really think about this and we’ll talk after.” – she said while looking me deep in the eyes, also worried but not regretful.

So I collected my clothes, got dressed and kissed her goodbye.

 

Comes Tuesday, we met again in class, changed glazes and she announced to everyone – “All exams have been graded, please have a seat so I can start distributing them.

I looked at my grade, B+ (82/10). And thought to myself – “Okay, she isn’t mixing our personal lives with our professional ones, she isn’t treating me any different than other students, no-one will know about us.”- Perfect, that’s exactly what I was hoping for.

“If someone wants to talk about their grade or feels the need to retake another exam feel free to stay after class.” – She said.

So, I stayed after class. Not to retake the exam, but to talk to her. I had to wait for some other classmates to speak with her first and after all of them had spoken and left I addressed her.

“We should talk.” – I started saying.

“Yes, we should.” – she replied with a shy look.

“Have you had enough time to think about us?” – I said.

“Yes. I don’t want anything to change between us. Of course we can’t be exposed in school, but after that we are two normal people and could be together.” – She said with a worried expression, as if bracing for me to end things so I replied – “I would also like that.”

So, we became a couple. For the rest of the school year, we were exclusive with each other. Sometimes I even slept on her apartment, others in my own house.

We would never kiss or be intimate in school grounds. Each one of us drove our own car and never shared rides to school. But after that or my night shifts we would be together, get intimate, go out on dates, shopping we even went to the waterpark once.

We really liked each other but sadly our relationship like many others had to end, not because we didn’t love each other’s anymore, but because on the next school year, she was assigned to another school a few hours away so she ended up renting another apartment on that city and I had recently started on a full-time job with a position that required me to spend allot of time overseas.

 

After 4 years, she was able to move back to the same city and join the same school where later she was able to get a definitive seat at the school administration board. We still met each other once or twice throughout those years but didn’t get back together because deep down we both had suffered with the breakup. We both understoud that we were at diferent life stages back then and didn't want to compromise our careers so we said it would be for the best.

Funny enough, Hannah became one of my sister’s best friends and they get along really well, occasionally we still check up on each other, change glances and smiles but both keeping our secret to ourselves.

  
I hope you guys enjoy my personal experience even though I needed to cut short some parts of my almost 1 year relationship and hoppefully be carefull if you chose an older partner since you probably still have a fair bit to grow professionaly and thay probably have already found their areas and are ready to settle.",2,1769451527.0,confessions,4,0.57,False
