“I don’t think I follow your meaning.”

Mertle wanted to sit but couldn’t. As it too often happened, she was back to pacing the stuffy, overcrowded office, counting off the paces between the root and the chair. Her brush with the Storm Guard had shaken her more than she liked admitting to, though Captain Quistis had been as good as her word.

There had been none of the usual trails on her when she left the Agora for the Sisters. Even with the extra precautions she took now, she still hadn’t seen anyone following in the crowd.

And that made it all so much worse.

The Guard had shown they could follow her invisibly. That woman in the shadows had followed her undetected. It all made her paranoid and twitchy, and sent her head reeling. But if she waited any longer without showing up as Tianna, then the whole plan was likely to crumble.

Now she had trouble stabilising into Tianna’s form, nubs of her horns poking out on her forehead.

“You’re wearing a trench in my floor again, girl,” Aliana said impatiently. “Sit down.”

She gave the priestess an impatient glare of her own and grumble before taking a seat, flattening her pointed hat. Her foot bounced as she surveyed the room for the hundredth time, taking stock of the exits, both seen and unseen, of the strange jars, the leaves, the sprouts on the roots, the instruments that she couldn’t name.

A glass was pushed into her hand and she drank without even looking at the thing. Tasted of berries. Had a decent kick. She sniffed in annoyance and held it out for a second shot. Aliana poured her more. At this rate she was likely to develop a habit.

“What’s there to follow,” the priestess of the Dryad said drily. “I need you to join me here two nights from now. Alone. And if I’m not clear enough, that means I need you to make absolutely certain you’re not followed.”

“But… why?” It was such an odd request, come at a terrible time. “I was certain nobody had followed me before, but even so they knew I was coming and going.”

“I’m aware.”

Nothing more was forthcoming on the subject. Aliana poured herself a thimble of drink and took sips. Mertle downed her second shot and it kicked somewhat harder than the first. She liked the aftertaste and could understand why Tallah kept… borrowing from the priestess’s impressive spirits collection. This, distilled once more, would be considered quite extravagant in Beril. For the elendars.

“Why are you helping?” she asked as various parts of her settled into the human shape. Her horns no longer tried to jut out through skin. Absently, she ran two fingers along her forehead, making sure she wasn’t unravelling anymore.

“Because I can. Get out. I’ve other business to see to.”

To her mounting annoyance, Aliana seemed unaware that Mertle couldn’t disregard the dangers to herself as easily as the High Priestess of the Sisters of Healing could. Not everyone could enjoy immunity such as hers—nobody, to her knowledge, was as highly stationed aside from Ort’s priesthood. Even those had to answer to the empress.

The dismissal goaded her into sullen defiance but she stamped it down. No time for fancies. She had two missions to deal with before the enchantment ran its course. She put on her shawls, carefully made herself indistinct, and headed out through the secret exit, different from the one she’d used to come in. Now that the Guard had shown they knew of her comings and going, she and Aliana had decided to alternate the days when Tianna showed up, make it harder for anyone to draw any connection between the two.

She found her way out into the cold through narrow, twisting tunnels dug by the roots. Scents of mildew and sap accompanied her passage up until it was replaced by wisps of smoke as she emerged behind a workshop someplace near the Guild. From there it was a matter of skulking like a rat through hidden alleys and squeezing gaps between buildings, heading slowly towards the Meadow.

Passing from the upper city into the lower, she used the worst set of stairs, out of the main ways and secluded in such a way that nobody could follow outside. Her disguise switched back to Tianna’s underclothes by the time she stepped out again.

Tianna had been gone for a couple of days now, but Verti had been forewarned of this. Either Tianna kept her own council and did not wish to be disturbed under any circumstances, or she prowled Valen’s streets for days on end. That was what the Meadow knew.

Mertle had heard the rumours swirling around the Agora. Verti and her daughters had particularly strong words to share out about the wayward aelir healer eloping with Lady Tianna’s beau. It couldn’t be helped; Sil would just need to find a different disguise when she came back. She, herself, had explained that Tianna must be preserved beyond any other concern. The rest was easier to solve, but the sorceress was important to their long-term plans.

“Good morning, your Ladyship.”

Using the front door seemed to summon Verti to her side. The way she emerged out of the crowd to fall into step with her had ceased surprising Mertle, though she still flinched at the polite words. Her carefully arrayed expression was one of tired resignation.

“Good morning to you too, Verti.” She stifled a half-honest yawn. “Any word while I was gone?”

“None as of yet.”

“Any callers?”

“Just that impolite girl from the Storm Guard. She’s not been very insistent this time.” Verti passed her a letter sealed with the signet of the Guard. “This was left with me for your eyes.”

Mertle slipped it inside her cloak and allowed Verti to lead her up to the room through the morning crowd. She’d stopped carrying the key with her for fear of misplacing it.

“Breakfast, please. Something light. I’ve no appetite for more.”

“Of course, your Ladyship. Coffee?”

“Strong. From your stock please.” Verti bought hers from a particular vendor that Mertle couldn’t normally afford. This was one of the best things about playing Tianna’s role. “It’s been a terribly long night.”

“Of course, your Ladyship.”

The narrative she worked with was that Tianna was not impressed by the rumours of her healer running off in some romantic tryst with the human man. Worry had given way to wounded pride in being abandoned after the events of the Descent, and now her search had a more vengeful air to it. If she found the two, she would roast them alive for the trouble caused. A pyromancer’s patience was short on the best of days, and adding insult to the mix only led to explosive outcomes.

“We’ve received more word from the caravan,” Verti said as she unlocked the door to the apartment. “The last of the escort’s returned to Valen. Cassiopa has overheard them talking in their cups. The caravan has passed Bastra’s last encampment and it took on fresh guards. Signs are good it will reach Solstice before the thaw.”

Mertle knew this, of course, from her own wandering around the Guild’s halls. She nodded as she stepped into the darkened hallway and closed the door behind her. The rooms were all exactly as she’d left them. No signs of tampering or intrusion.

She spent half of a bell taking stock of all precautions set about the place, even the low-brow ones that only particularly low-born spies made use of.

The apartment had become a truly unwelcoming place in its starkness. She disrobed and headed for a bath, allowing herself the small luxury that her little shop never could. Ever since she’d been a whelp, the only bathing she’d known had been with a sponge and a pail of cool water, or submerged in a forest stream. Beril’s countryside afforded nothing more.

A whole tub all to herself and warm water? Luxury undreamed of by most Nen-born elend.

She heard the door opening and a cart brought in. She would eat, get a wink of sleep—the enchantment held strongest if she slept—and then head out again to make a nuisance of herself somewhere. Probably the Guild as Lucian was due another visit.

Yes, Lucian for today. She’d prepared a couple of the orders she was behind on so Tummy would run deliveries and the shop would be closed. It afforded her to be gone for some time.

Clean and still steaming, she ate sparsely, set the coffee aside for later, and went to rest in Sil’s bed. Without her lover, the bed was too big, too soft, and too foreign for her to enjoy. But the room still held the subtle scent of alchemy and fresh soap, and that brought her a measure of comfort.

Without Sil’s breathing and heartbeat, and without Tummy’s hammering and muttering, silence seeped in. On the cusp of sleep, this was the silence of memory unchained and shaken loose by the stress of the charade she barely kept up.

She drifted away to the sound of her own quick heartbeat and the old whispers of a lifetime and a world away.

“There is a traitor in the household,” Protector Aranar said, addressing the gathered servants and vassals in the large hollow of the Olden. “I have been informed of this by a friend. There is an assassin here, sent to kill me.” They all laughed at the notion.

Mertle laughed with them, barely hearing the Protector in the back of the crowd. Even from afar he was an impressive aelir’sar, tall and broad of shoulder, still coming into his prime. Twin atagans shone on his belt.

She’d been with the household for three seasons now. She’d broken bread and drank wine with the other servants. Had even allowed some of the aelir low-born to take her into their bed so her place in the household would be secured.

“Ridiculous,” Protector Aranar went on, pacing on the dais where his table normally sat when he ate with the vassals. “If this assassin is indeed here, I urge them to come to me. I would show mercy for I am blessed and in good spirit. If they do not desire mercy, then I shall eagerly await the thrust of their traitorous dagger.”

Again, Mertle laughed with the others. Mercy from Protector Aranar meant being flayed rather than handed over to his wife and her ministrations. Aelir’matar Aranar wasn’t here now or the servants wouldn’t have dared even a smile.

Aelir’matar Sarrinare had warned the Protector. And Mertle had received thus her own warning. The mission was taking too long. She’d gone beyond her allotted time frame and the aelir’matar was displeased. The next message would unveil and leave her to Aranar’s fancies.

She went to work that night.

Moonlight found her crouching in shadow among the high canopy of the Olden tree. She’d climbed there by the light of the Mother, the path prepared after two seasons of exploration and planning. The deed was to happen that very night, or she might expect an unkind end. It would still be better than returning to the Sarrinare household with her task unaccomplished.

Protector Aranar’s household had treated her kindly and hadn’t suspected her purpose. Now, she climbed, her path secured. Guards were of no concern so high. She knew all their routes and all their secret hiding spots. She’d taken tea to them more than once, the half-wit elendine born so low in Beril that she might as well have been an animal. What did it matter what she overheard?

Some of them would be discovered come morning with throats slit. Some had been in her way. Some had not been kind and this was petty vengeance. For two, it was mercy to stave off their lord’s fury, a reward for their gentleness and propriety in how they treated her.

She crawled underneath the highest branches, hands finding thick vines to support her, as the light slowly faded when clouds crossed the Mother’s face. She would accomplish her mission and then disappear into the ever-forest. Supplies waited below, hidden in a hollow beneath the east-most root of the Olden. It would a season’s trek back to the Sarrinare household, through the wilds of the steppes.

Protector Aranar was no fool. His lady wife was obscenely powerful with a spectacular nose for poisons. Together, they were an ascendant force in the Dominion with an excellent claim for a centre position, a bold undertaking for a lowly steppe lord.

Mertle suspected this her reason for being there. Those outside the Hearth Circle should remain where their station dictated, not lay claims to positions above their worth. That had always been the Sarrinare stance, though they’d never claim it aloud.

She pulled herself up to the highest part of the Olden’s crown, bare head to the bare sky above, moonlight fleeting. Barefooted, she made her way slowly to her destination, walking softly on swaying platforms, hidden in the long shadow of her destination.

The star-gazing nest observatory, a bulbous growth atop the Olden, lay just ahead. Moonlight cast its shadow across the rustling leaves and Mertle herself, the Mother moon still low in the night sky. If Mertle were lucky, it would rain by midnight.

Tubes protruded out of the observatory, aimed at the sky above. The glint of reflected light onto glass lenses staring somewhere into the far darkness of the night.

She’d been up there many times, sent up with food and drink, or to guide some of the household’s guests. She knew the way and how there were only two entrances: one beneath, and the window for the strange apparatus to poke out. Two entrances for the civilised.

Aelir’rei Kaleo, single scion of Protector Aranar, would be working late, bent over her sketches and notes, on the light-side of the observatory. She drew graphs whenever the weather did not permit her to gaze freely upon the stars. Given the darkening night, she would likely be drawing in the *telescope* to secure it against the coming rain*.*

Mertle cut her way in from beneath, through the thick-leaf floor. It had never been fashioned to resist a blade, and certainly not hers. It took some effort, but she made her way inside through the cut, emerging sticky with sap right behind her target, her arrival disguised by the nest’s swaying in the gathering wind.

Sure enough, there Kaleo was, bent over her apparatus, adjusting a complicated series of dials and knobs for purposes that Mertle couldn’t even guess at. Plaques full of schematics and drawings of the night sky littered the walls, filled with tight annotations that nobody was likely to even decipher.

The knife cut into her neatly, just between the ribs to split her heart in two. Kaleo gasped and tried to pull away, but Mertle’s hand was on her mouth as she twisted the knife. Hot blood coated her cold hand.

She lowered the aelir’rei to the floor and let her blood pool beneath. Kaleo died with eyes staring out at the night and Mertle found she had no strength in her to close them.",1,1729102305.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

In my heart lived,
Pipes poems rocking chairs  
sunsets on the porch 
Jumping into the waters of Hague 
Purple flowers blue night skies 
And Kisses that left bruises 

I swipe my thumb over your brow //across your eyes

and god forbid I touch your nose. 

Hands locked 
Hair in my mouth 
Bellies kiss 
Sweats mix

Game pieces indent the backs of my thighs//

But that one wasn’t about me. 

I was October nights and November mornings, 
Misted air and wool scarves. 
untouched powdered donuts and black coffee 
You were the drought on scorched sandy fields. 

To spite my mind/myself/my heart I ate my tail and bit down hard. 

I had to exist for you and you were bored of my attention
I showed dull reflections and scratched effaces, a washed patina. 
Golden kisses and drunken decisions shined and glittered in your mind 

I thought it was 
I dos in your favorite place 
officiated with grace 
and love 
Summers on the farm assuring I’d keep u safe. 
Egg swap, swap meets, fleas and baby olee. 
-
Nurturing an unloved side turned out to be giant thorns and surgical precision 

Unfortunately for me, I’ll love you until I die 
But you were never her and never could’ve been 
The you I knew never really loved anyone 
but reflections in mirrors in other people’s apartments -
At the people’s parties forever 

While I’m in the cave with a camera and an old guitar and a tiny grey dog drinking wine and drawing in the sand.

morning/noon: 
- neutrogena gentle cleanser in the shower
- benzoyl peroxide OR salicylic acid depending on the day
- cera-ve moisturizer immediately after shower

night: 
- cera-ve foaming cleanser 
- prescription adapalene 0.3% if i used salicylic acid in the shower

Sometimes I wonder if I would feel guilty coming home to see you out mowing the lawns, then going straight inside to watch TV, expecting a cup of tea made when you were done. Sometimes I wonder how you would feel if I told you, that you did “half a job”, because you had so many competing pressures - to get the lawns done, make a cup of tea for me, start dinner and look after the kids all at the same time.

Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be so perfect that I could criticise everyone else around me constantly.

Sometimes I wonder what it must be like to have my clothes picked up off the floor, because I would let them pile up for weeks otherwise, becoming a trip hazard for the person who cleans the shower, picks up the towels, makes the bed and opens the curtains everyday, getting angry when only the clothes in the hamper got washed and not the ones I just dumped on the floor. I wonder what it’s like having my clothes ironed for me because that’s just what is expected?

I wonder if I would be able to yell at the kids to be quiet because I am “tired” every day. I wonder if you would care if I told you that you were “pandering” to them when they cry and you try to hug them afterwards. I wonder if I could use the excuse of being “tired” like you do. 

Sometimes I wonder if I could be so derogatory about your work just because it didn’t fit into my own idea. If I could tell you it’s “just a hobby” and make comments about voting for the Green Party just because you were creative. If I would ever tell you that you needed to “get a real job”. I wonder if I would ever tell you not to publish your work. If I could ever think it was ok to make decisions about your time for you. Book appointments for you to attend during your dedicated work hours without checking what else you had planned. 

Sometimes I wonder if I would feel guilty about doing what I do to you, or would you be the only one that feels guilty and worthless all the time?

1g55mdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g55mdz/i_constantly_ruminate_about_my_entire/,I constantly ruminate about my entire relationship with bf,"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3 and a half years. For the past 3 months, I've been ruminating about everything I've done wrong in the relationship, and it won't stop. This is affecting our relationship, and I'm afraid I might push him to break up if I don't find a way to stop. I keep thinking back to when we first met in college. We lived in the same building and that's how we met. When we met for the first time, I had so much fun, but I wasn't entirely sure. At that time, I had no experience with guys at all, only chatting online. We hung out twice, and then I went back home. During those two weeks, I started chatting online with another guy, and I really liked him because he was direct, while my current boyfriend wasn’t showing any direct signs. And during those two weeks, he didn’t text me very often. When I returned to the city where I studied, I went for coffee with this other guy, and I didn’t like him. The very next day, I started liking my current boyfriend. I keep blaming myself for not knowing right away and for even talking to someone else.

The next thing I think about is that I couldn’t open up to him about private things, and that blocked me from committing to the relationship earlier. I have alopecia and wear a wig, and I didn’t want to commit to the relationship because I felt like I was withholding something important if he didn’t know.

There are some private things I didn’t tell him until now. I felt ashamed of the fact that I live with my family in a very small apartment, share a room with my brother, and my parents sleep in the living room. Everything is pretty old. I never talked about the issues at home with my brother, who hasn’t worked in a long time. Now I realize that none of those things are abnormal or something to be ashamed of. I feel like it really affected our relationship that I couldn’t open up about it.

The last thing I regret is related to sex. But that’s actually about my need for control. It was always important to me what date we had our first kiss, the date we officially started dating, and I wanted the first time we had sex to be with rose petals, candles...

Backstory on my situation: Female (mom) on the verge of 40, and recently decided to give alcohol the boot. In my newly sober era, I am trying to focus on habit stacking, building a solid routine I can rely on, and replacing all bad habits and cortisol spiking triggers with new things. I'd say the only 'habit' I have left is using a thc gummy edible to wind down in the hours before bed. I don't intend to ditch this, yet, as I'm new to not relying on alcohol to unwind.  

In the mornings, I wake VERY early, usually by 4 AM to get to the gym and complete my workout before the kids need to get out the door for school. I used to sit down for breakfast around 7-8 AM, scarf down avocado toast with eggs, and than feel like I was tired and needed a snack by 9-10 AM. And honestly, for the rest of the day I was in an on and off cycle of eating. My weight has never been a factor or issue, but I never felt 'great.' Today, I decided to give I.F. a try. Surprisingly, I got the noon mark with ease. This would mark a window of 8 PM- 12 PM that I didnt eat. 16 hours, is that recommended? (I had dessert at 8.) To my surprise, I feel better than I normally do at baseline, in terms of bloating (not as bad as I often struggle with) and more energy. I did have two cups of coffee in the morning hours, balanced w/ plenty of water in between. 

Any input, adjustments, or encouragement for my new IF journey? I'm absolutely perimenopausal, and can tell my hormones are wrecking my day to day life, so I am desperate to try anything. Except, wine or tequila- what I was using as a crutch and having two tequila drinks a night. I did the math and those 5 ounces a night were 35 ounces of tequila a WEEK. Gah! Why..  

And lastly, I'd love a recommendation for a podcast that delves into the benefits of IF for beginners like me. I have long drives for work, and anything entertaining and educational that touts the benefits of IF would be welcome to listen to. ",1,1729101255.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

1g55jid,https://www.reddit.com/r/itsthatbad/comments/1g55jid/female_nature/,Female nature,"I'm currently writing this at a very beautiful and very modern coffee shop in Midtown, a nice little place on Lexington Ave with impeccable decor sitting down and getting some work done. New York City in the autumn is always a sight to behold, I'm currently drinking a phenomenal Colombian blend with notes of rum raisin, apricot and caramel feeling like a million bucks. The cool morning breeze did wonders for my mood alongside the astounding beauty of the vermillion, gold and brown leaves spiraling in the autumn air under the pale blue morning sky. New York is such a genius juxtaposition between the marvels of man comingled with the wonders of God.

As I was typing away, fueled by the morning air and the soaking in the ambiance of the café, I was hit by a sudden burst of inspiration: female nature and what it means. As I sought to define it, pondering upon it I was given visions of my grandmother. You see, my grandmother is my hero and my greatest inspiration in life and taught me my foundational knowledge on female nature. I know some of our detractors here will be shocked, Cute-Revolution's greatest hero is a woman??

Yet it's true. My grandmother was born in the bloodiest time in human history, she was born and came of age in  El Trujillato. Her father, my great-grandfather, was what was called a 'vagabond'; he was apparently a very handsome man, a tiguere if there ever was one who slept his way around Santiago de los Cabelleros and fathered many children, my grandmother was one of them, and she was left to be raised in a convent. As a child I was raised by her primarily and lived in her house in Washington Heights. As a child she educated me heavily on female nature and how women *truly* operated. My grandmother was a priestess, she was a prophet, she predicted the 21st century back in the 1950s and told me her oracles as I grew up in the early 2000s. I'm blown away that every, single. thing my grandmother warned me about has come to pass EXACTLY as she foretold it. I was truly blessed by God to be born into the situation I was born into and to be under the guidance and tutelage of such a wise woman.

What is female nature? Women will do anything to protect themselves, their comfort and the lives of their children. That's it. And in the 21st century, protecting their children is highly debatable. Anything and everything can and will be sacrificed to maintain that. Women *will* destroy a man as necessary and whenever possible to maintain her comfort and her safety. We men are all nothing but pawns. Men are nothing but fools designed to keep women amused. Anything is on the table, nothing is sacred and any and every insecurity and weakness is perfectly valid to be weaponized against you.

What is male nature? Men will do anything to protect what they love, even at the sacrifice of themselves. That's why it's so common for men to be simps, it's built into men's DNA to destroy themselves for the expense of others. That's why it's possible for women to so openly hate men yet get nothing but money, praise and validation from men. Men are hard-wired for devotion: be it through military, through religion or in the 21st century relationships and women. Why do you think there are so many male whiteknights that argue with men on behalf of women? The current paradigm has women gaslight men to protect themselves and maintain their place in society while whiteknight idiot men are used like guard dogs by women.

You see the two natures are synergistic, a sort of yin-yang if you will. Men are the backbone, the provider, the protector. He is the sword and the shield, he is the farmer and the ox. But, women are *the soul*. Women carry the culture, women shape the hearts and minds of the youth. Any civilization's true values and beliefs are harboured by the women. Even for me, the way I think is not a byproduct of my father or any man in my family, my core beliefs of women and female nature, my foundation  was inherited from my grandmother.",0,1729101099.0,itsthatbad,0,0.33,False

1g55gvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1g55gvj/unclear_situation_with_a_colleague/,Unclear situation with a colleague,"So I've been working for this dysfunctional company for a year. With a precarious contract leaving me with no certainties whatsoever, an odd work environment, an unclear position and personal worries keeping my mind busy, I've always been polite to my colleagues. 

Now, I may not be the most sociable person ever and I'm a bit clumsy at work, as well, but all in all I don't believe I ever gave off any weird vibe around me. That being said, I never had any misunderstading with my colleagues, though I maintained a subtle distance from them. So far, I'd always been invited at mundane events and the like. Fast forward to a couple of months ago, a colleague indirectly admitted I wasn't invited to the last get-together which was a bit unexpected but if the group felt like it, so be it. I assumed this was due to the fact I sort of befriended a particular colleague which the rest of the group dislikes, I'll call her ""O"", and that hasn't been invited once while I joined them that time. 

One of the colleagues of the rest of the group is sort of the ""unofficial"" leader, I'll call him ""L"". I've never particularly liked him though at first I perceived he had sort of a curiosity towards me because I never really did anything to stand out. He wanted me to feel involved in leisure time and the like which I always gladly joined. Plus, for some time I had the impression he stared at me a bit longer than necessary and listened to everything I said to anyone even from his office.

At the beginning of the year he said I could use his nickname on our work e-mails which I did, but I felt like not using it for each e-mail after I once asked him a thing and he passive aggressively told me to leave him alone in a way that was a bit excessive for my taste, but I still used his nickname more often than not.

A couple of months ago I was talking to O and I complained about a colleague from my previous job who had a more advantageous work schedule because she had two kids. L is the only parent in our offices... Which came to my mind as soon as I finished talking (I did feel bad about it). I believe he definitely was listening (...from his office while O and I were at the coffee room) and I believe this was one of the possible reasons (?) why I got ""cancelled"" from the rest of the group as the last get-together happened after this episode.

After the get-together he jokingly picked on me with a couple of offensive and dirty jokes to which I clapped back and he just laughed.

I stopped using L's nickname on work e-mails, although he keeps signing his replies to me with it. He also stopped using my name in e-mails as well.

There's nothing in particular that is going on but he gives me these weird looks I can't decipher. I offered a dessert and he took some bites of it looking at me as if I was forcing him to (which I absolutely didn't).

Another time I was walking around the parking lot during the lunch break as I was smoking, I was a bit lost in my thoughts and he was on the other side of the road. I turned away the moment I saw him without him looking and I noticed I was close to his car. He used his remote key to switch the car on and off as if he thought I was going to do anything to his car (I have no reason to and I didn't realise it was his car at first, but I feel at this point *I* should be wary of him damaging my car, maybe).

Lastly, another time we were all sat on the coffee room chatting during a break and there was only a seat left beside me. Another colleague kept saying he could sit there but he didn't reply and ignored him and I'm sure it was because he didn't want to sit next to me (which I also wasn't enthusiastic about but I feigned ignorance).

Colleagues aren't friends and I don't expect them to be, but the car and the seat things are kind of bothering me. I thought to post this on reddit as outsiders can give interesting insight I may lack.

2 kids, age 6 and 3.

I’ve been home for almost a decade. Before my kids were born I babysat my stepdaughter when she got home from school. I helped with homework, ran her to school events, played the SAHM role before I became a mom.

I have sobbed desperately and screamed in agony during arguments with my husband about me wanting to have a job in the evenings. I have explained to him a thousand times how painfully lonely it is being home 24/7. 

No, mommy groups are not the answer. They are all extremely Christian and far too burnt out themselves. Sending the kids to daycare is not the answer. Can’t afford it. Working a second shift job is the answer. 

I have tried desperately to find a job. Sleep deprivation wrecked me on third shift jobs. And second shift jobs were never a possibility, because my husband, who runs his own construction business, says he needs all day for work and the evenings for paperwork. I hate him for this. 

What this means is he leaves after 9 for work in the AM after having coffee with me for fifteen minutes. Then he returns home for dinner at 6:30 or 7pm. He helps me put the kids to bed at 8:30pm. We go to bed by 10:30. Rinse, lather, repeat. 

So I am having, outside of reddit, 180 minutes of time with another adult per day. 

I’ve got some amazing kids. But this whole 180 minutes of adult time is so depressing. 

I deeply resent my husband for everything nice thing he does for me because all of those nice things amount to a mirage. He knows how to relieve my suffering and lift my depression, but he is too selfish. He wants to build his business and serve his ego more than he wants to build a life as my partner. 

I don’t care if it is financially stupid of me, I am filing for divoce and I am moving on. I don’t care if I “end up eating rice and ketchup” like he tells me I will. ",1,1729100592.0,Divorce,0,0.67,False

He of course would say he isn't an alcoholic nor have a gambling addiction. I was raised around addicts for parents. To me, if it affects aspects of your life, it's an addiction. Anyways, what does recovery look like to you? If it abstaining 100%? 

I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to figure out how to support & not enable. I had surgery so I've been focused on healing & trying to take care of your home. I wasn't paying attention to the money. My mistake. I did the numbers as I found myself pulling from my savings account to find he has kept & blown on alcohol & gambling right under $10k in four months. 

Last time we had set up some bumpers/safeguards of him not having access to the joint account. His ""free"" money is in his own separate account. Problem was that he changed jobs in June & never set up direct deposit. He had $1,000/mo of his own but he blows 100% of it. 

I was very raw & honest about my hurt this time vs anger. That in the four months, he made comments about getting my engagement ring ($400) but has blown the $$ we had got quoted for the wedding he wants & the honeymoon cruise I wanted. The $9,600 could've gotten the the SUV he wanted (trading in his current vehicle). It was just shy of the price for the new fencing project for the home we just bought, the front deck he wants built. It was the full funded emergency account we planned to put in a high yield savings account. 

I am crushed but the ONLY time he gambles at all, is when he drinks. He is the General Manager of a gas station w/the same machines be plays on. Never an issue, doesn't even cross his mind. But, when he goes to pool leagues at the bar, drinks his 6 or more beers, he will pull $200+ a night out. Totally lost on this. I don't want to be his controlling mother. I'm a mother of 4 & a supervisor at work. I want to be his partner. 

I've asked for transparency. I told him my only comfortable options are he either sets up his entire paychecks into the joint account OR I am given all his bank cards. Then we can find a better option....although when I say it out loud, I feel like a parent distributing the daily alcohol/drug/money allowance. 😢 That maybe he starts each day w/$20. That's for his 1-6pk of beer to come home with (another compromise we found that had worked for the last 6mo or so). He gets free fountain soda while at work. His soda, energy drinks & coffee i have in the grocery budget. So, that leave his cigarette money. Then, on pool or bar nights, he gets an extra $20 to take. 

I don't know if this feels super controlling to him to switch to a cash budgeting system because to him he sees it as a controlling childish allowance. His uncle lives in the granny flat on the back of our property...drinks up to a 24pk a day, gets multiple Amazon packages delivered a day. Lol. His entire family are bachelor's w/either gambling, alcohol &/or drug addictions. He's the only person with an intact family but I feel without boundaries, he'll lose it as well. 

He's (everyone in his family are too) very emotionally shut off. They don't like being vulnerable at all. He didn't tell me about the money, I sat him down & confronted him. He wouldn't make eye contact. He just said ""You're right, I gambled it away when I was drinking. You want me to say it?"" Yes!!!! Can't ignore it, if you say it. It's there at least. I'm trying to just understand what recovery looks like to you all? 

I don't know if my efforts are controlling or if I just need to move out or ask him to move. I love him so much but I told him, if he causes us to lose our roof over my children's head or not provide food for them, I'm out. I've lost it all before when I got divorced & I don't want to but absolutely can walk away. I'd rather us hold hands & walk through it together.

Also had an interview that I thought it was the last round but they will let me know next week, and I will have to compete with other candidates to see which one does it faster ad accurate. FML

Also I have been writing unsent letters to a crush, which is my friend, which doesn't love me back, and is gay. My letters in another sub reddit have gone viral so now I have a bunch of people messaging me thinking I am their person, but sadly I am not. My crush already read some, and gave me some space to write things off my chest and said he wouldn't even read them.

Story of my life... just kill me now. Not really, if you're a serial killer don't come and find please.

I will not say what other shit I'm going thru to avoid being recognized

But shit.. I'm so fucking ready for this day to be over. And this week, and this job market, and this life.

Maybe its just the coffee, maybe its the feeling worthless, jobless, deeply broken and broke.

1g556nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1g556nl/long_post_but_unsure_if_manipulation_was_in_my/,Long Post But Unsure If Manipulation Was In My Relationship Or Not,"I contemplated writing this out but after scrolling through this group on my main page a good few posts struck me as similar to my own experiences in the later months of my last relationship and I guess in a sense of making this post, it would be me coming to terms on if I was being manipulated/gaslit, whether intentional on their behalf or not, or if this was just normal behavior in a relationship but surely it isn't... right?

First I'll start by saying that I do not have screenshots of these incidents as they pretty much happened in person nor do I want to try and sift through months or texts for results. I myself am a (30M) and my partner at the time was (26NB). I would also like to add that I have a child, not with them but with someone else and they are under the age of 4. 

Our relationship was good, solid in the first couple of months where we would see each other often and hang out and do typical couple/relationship stuff but we were in that talking/dating stage for maybe 4 or 5 months? Which was odd to me but whatever. My kid was back and forth in my life due to stuff from their mother's side but became a constant in my life around the time we had made things ""official"" and I decided to take my kid's mother to court for custody. They were supportive throughout most of it and my ex had a good relationship with my kid. 

I had to go to court at one point for mediation with the mother and at the same time I was petitioning the option for full custody and an agreement to be able to move to another state with my kid. I dropped those options because of the new living situation I was in and the unruliness of the mother during the mediation alongside my own family saying that would be near impossible to win. So I dropped it and after the mediation I told my ex what happened during it all and they got incredibly angry at me because of dropping the move away petition and full custody, that did not sit right with me as it is at the end of the day, my decision to make regardless of how close you feel.  
  
We were together for roughly a year (counting that whole talking/dating/we aren't a couple stage) and the last 6 months of that relationship we decided to get an apartment together to try and make things easier on the two of us and that's more or less when issues between us started to grow. Obviously in hindsight getting a place together that soon is a bad idea but the cost of living was incredibly high and other options were slim. At the time, my work had me up at 4am to get there around 6am and getting off at 2pm getting home around 330. They, at the time, had a job where they would go in for roughly 4 hours a day maybe a bit more in the afternoon (it was a restaurant) and on the weekends they would probably do both shifts morning and evening. There would be times I would come home after work, incredibly tired and see them lounging on the couch with the cat while dishes would be piled up in the sink, the trash would be full, and the litter box unattended to. Sometimes I would make a remark about the mess and they would respond with they were intending to do it. So I would come home say my quick hello and begrudgingly do all of those tasks. My ex would end up getting annoyed that I would be taking too long with that stuff and get into an argument with me about it and even tell me to stop what I'm doing to talk to them. In fact, I couldn't do anything in the midst of them arguing with me. I had to give them my full undivided attention during arguments. Couldn't clean, couldn't walk around. Had to sit down and look them straight in the face and would get mad if my eyes looked elsewhere for even a moment. So if I started doing dishes for 10 minutes and an argument erupted I had to stop the dishes until the argument was over not knowing how long it would take and then finish the dishes. That happened often.

Another instance would be when it came time for going to bed. With me having to go to be up around 4am I tried my best to be in bed by 9pm or 10 at the latest. They bought me melatonin at some point to help with me going to sleep and it did help. However, they would also like to try and have a conversation (argument) at night while I'm trying to go to sleep and would get frustrated if I didn't respond or say ""hey I have work in the morning I need sleep"" or if they saw me take melatonin prior. This didn't stop and I would be going to bed around midnight or even 1am those nights. To compound this, they would state that they can't sleep sometimes, so one night I said I'll stay up so you don't feel alone and can fall asleep. I did it a few times but could not do it any longer so I went back to saying I needed sleep, I have to be up in x amount of hours. Argument on how I'm selfish and it isn't fair. The last 2/3 of months of the relationship they got a job as an assistant/substitute teacher so they were working a typical 8-5 job hours. The ""I can't sleep"" issues still persisted but also my kid would be there a few days out the week and they sometimes make noise in their sleep or wake up in the middle of the night. It was a one-bedroom apartment so my ex would get angry if my kid made a noise and would force us to sleep in the living room with a small portable heater to keep us warm just so they could get some sleep but when I voiced my concerns about my own sleep it became an argument and disregarded.

I don't drink anything with caffeine, I cannot drink coffee because my anxiety skyrockets and I feel like I have tunnel vision. Because of the being tired bit, my ex would regularly suggest I drink coffee and I would say no all the time in a serious manner. They would often give me a cup full of coffee and would throw a fit if I didn't drink it so it felt like I was forced to drink it. Never a good feeling both the forcing and the anxiety.

I realize this is turning out to be a lot longer than even I anticipated.

One day I came home from work they stated they wanted to go to the beach. I told them that I'm a little too tired to even consider doing that right now but maybe in a few hours I would be fine to go. They threw a fit saying how I never want to do anything they want to do to which I responded that it wasn't true, it's just difficult to fully commit to doing things in general when they're sprung upon someone last minute and also when that person is incredibly tired. The argument continued and they said they would just go to the beach alone and I said that's okay and sorry I couldn't go. ""Oh so you aren't going?"" and then I said never mind I will suck it up and just go ""well I don't want you to go if you're not going to enjoy it"" ""alright, so I will stay here anyways"" argument continues from them, we proceed to go to the beach anyways. They wanted to stop at the store to get alcohol but as soon as we got out the car, my kid's mother called saying she was running late and unable to pick up our kid from daycare and if I was able to. I couldn't say no because no one else was authorized for pick up. Got off the phone, told my ex and said that I'll catch an Uber to the daycare to get my kid so they could still go to the beach. They calmly said they'll do it instead and we left, not even 10 minutes into it they start saying how I could've said no and I don't have to do it and it's an inconvenience that it's some pagan holiday they wanted to celebrate like they did last year (they didn't) and all these thing to try and make me feel guilty and it put myself in a worse mood by the end of the day. We ended up getting to the beach after but the sun had already set which really upset them but by that point I had already shut down internally. 

We spent 2 Christmases together and the first one involved their somewhat extended family at a little gathering for a day or two close to a beach, it was really nice. The second Christmas was supposed to be with that extended family again doing similar activities. They had told me this was the plan way back in September or something and it was never brought up again so I forgot because I was also dealing with court (and lack of sleep). Three weeks before Christmas I told them that my work schedule had been posted and I was working my normal 6-2 shift at work but would be able to do whatever we had planned afterwards. Immediately sent them into this fit about how we had plans and they couldn't believe I didn't want to spend Christmas with them and I admitted that I had forgotten because it was never brought up even at Thanksgiving when majority of that extended family was present. They said that I should just know that it's happening because it happened last year so why wouldn't happen again. I asked if they had confirmed it and what time because working a holiday is considered overtime and I didn't want to necessarily miss out on that and working the morning shift is still giving me the rest of the day. Nope, didn't see any reason in what I was saying. Just arguing that I'm being selfish and don't want to spend with them, they ended up kicking me out of the bed at night because they didn't feel safe with me and I had to sleep on the floor in the bedroom or the couch (this became a reoccurring thing whenever there was an argument or inconvenience). So over the next couple of day I asked my coworkers if anyone could cover for me that day and thankfully someone was more than happy to. Told my ex I got it covered but instead of saying thank you it was more of a ""you should've gotten it covered in the first place, this is a big deal for me"". Cut to weekend after and they're on the phone with a family member and confirming what time and where the party is happening and the family member tells them that they/we weren't invited because the person hosting the party doesn't really like them. That conversation ended some time later and I told them I'm sorry that Christmas plans aren't happening but I was also a little bitter that we did that whole thing about me not working on Christmas for a party that we're just now finding out isn't happening with us included and they didn't bother to apologize for the argument.  

Okay this will be the last one as I think this was one of the bigger instances for me and one that still rings through my ears. We went from having sex routinely often to maybe once or twice every couple of weeks. They would bring this up and I would reiterate that I'm stressed, I don't get enough sleep, and so on and so on. One night as we were going to bed they randomly asked me if I was cheating on them. My heart sank and I felt so dejected? That they would ask that, I immediately said no and it was shameful for asking that question in the first place. Their response? ""Well I did some googling on why people don't have intercourse with their partner and I talked to my friends and they said that maybe you were cheating"". I was stunned and incredibly by this and I reiterated that no I'm not cheating on you and even if I did where would I find the time? and I said I couldn't believe they would take what a google result and your friends say over your own partner exhibiting signs of stress, depression, and lethargy. Didn't apologize for it, never have. Instead it grew silent between us for a few moments until they said ""well if I want to have sex then I'm going to have sex"" which is an utter baffling and possibly manipulative thing to say right after you ask someone if they're cheating, no? Like I'm being told that when they are in the mood, I have to have sex with them no matter how I'm feeling no matter how tired I am. It didn't feel good to hear at all and still makes me feel uneasy considering yes, we did have sex some time after that was said.

I'm not parading myself as someone who didn't argue in those situations but I didn't go out of my way to try and belittle my partner or make them feel terrible for doing something like they did constantly. I aired my issues with them when I felt I was able to without judgement or criticism (I didn't talk about that fun stuff). I made mistakes in the relationship too. I have many other examples that involve my kid, their friends, ""gender roles"", and alcohol (don't force your partner to drink pls) but the ones listed are the big ones that stick out to me.

It was actually her who approached me first, asked me things about uni stuff and I asked her back and we just ended up talking about our lives and it felt great. Right after the course I ended up sending her an email and asking her whether she wanted to keep in touch, and she was elated and sent me her number right away. Since then we've meen messaging each other frequently, and she suggested we'd meet up and grab coffee or something which I obviously was really open to. Neither of us called it a date but I assumed it was a date and that this fact would come up naturally during the date and I got myself all excited for it.

  
And then yesterday she mentioned that she had a girlfriend who she's been with for several years now. I have no clue how to proceed from here. The general advice I've seen for folks who find themselves with crushes on people in relationships is to just divest themselves entirely from the person, but idk whether I really want to do that. She really seems to appreciate my presence as a friend, and it'd feel really mean to her to abandon our plans for a meetup and everything just because of my crush on her, but I'm not really sure. To be honest I'm sort of hurting for friends as well, I feel like I've been growing apart from many of my old friendships and it'd feel like a huge waste to just completely cut contact with someone who seems this inclined to be my friend just because I have a crush on her. 

So, what do y'all say? Should I cut contact with her or should I try to ignore my crush and just be friends with her? Should I say something to her about my feelings, and if so, what and when? I feel like I'm at a loss here.

I’d love to get some opinions on a complicated situation involving my best friend (M24) and me (F23). Here’s some background:

We met in middle school. I was born and raised in my country, but he had just moved here and joined a special class for kids who didn’t yet speak the language. He was a math genius and attended our class just for that subject. Even though he couldn’t speak the language, we bonded over our shared ethnic background, and I communicated with him using the bits of the language I’d picked up from my parents. We became close quickly and stayed in touch throughout middle school, even though we were in different classes.

He became quite popular while I stuck with my group of friends. He was a flirt with girls, and I had a lot of guys’ attention, so we were both a bit annoyed with each other for that reason. People used to tease me, saying he might have feelings for me since he was very protective of me, but I always brushed it off.

At the end of middle school, we drifted apart a bit because of those tensions. By “coincidence” (as he says), we both ended up at the same high school, even though he was set to go to a science-focused school, and I chose a school better suited to my love for literature and languages. We reconnected, and soon we were inseparable again.

During high school, we hung out all the time, even after making new friends. A friend from my class once told me that my BFF was in love with me because of how we acted around each other, but I never saw him that way. At the time, I was in a long-distance relationship, and to me, he felt more like a brother.

After high school, he got accepted into a top European engineering school while I went to law school. Even though we attended different schools, he would still travel 45 minutes to meet me for lunch or pick me up after my classes.

In 2019, things changed. We both lost close family members within weeks of each other, which brought us even closer. Around that time, he decided to drop out of school to take over his late father’s struggling construction business. I wasn’t a fan of the idea because he had such a bright future in engineering, but he was determined to honor his father’s legacy.

So I just supported him and asked him to at least do both—keep studying and work on saving the family business—which he did by working day and night. Despite that, we still saw each other every day to study together, have our coffee in the morning, or enjoy McDonald’s inside his construction truck. He even taught me how to drive whenever he had a bit of time in the brand-new van he bought for the business. Not long after, I broke up with my long-distance boyfriend. Then my BFF confessed that he had always been in love with me. I wasn’t ready for it—I didn’t see him that way. After that confession, things felt different, and eventually, we drifted apart and stopped talking at the start of 2021 after an argument. He even called the brother of one of my closest girlfriends to ask her if I was serious about not speaking to him or if he had a chance at a comeback, but she just told him that I was working in another country.

Fast forward to 2023. I was living and pursuing my career abroad and was also in an abusive relationship. One night, I accidentally dialed my BFF’s number when I meant to call someone else (they have the same last four digits). He immediately recognized my voice, and we ended up talking all night. After that, we started seeing each other again whenever I visited home. He told me he was still in love with me and had always kept me in his thoughts and dreams, and he wanted to give a relationship a try. While I felt the same way and often thought about him, I wasn’t sure if I was ready. I was fresh out of a toxic relationship and living in another country.

It’s been a year and a half since we reconnected, and even though we kept talking, we also had periods of silence because he felt like I would never love him the way he does or that I had so many options in all the countries I lived in that I would just drop him like I did back in 2021. I finally realized I had feelings for him too last winter, but I was scared. He even surprised me this summer, thanks to my sister, who he contacted in secret to find out when I would be back in the country where I work since I was on vacation overseas. He drove 1,108 km (688 miles) to visit me after we hadn’t spoken for three months and stayed for days, even though he had a lot of work back home, and also brought me my favorite things to eat from our country.

We kissed for the first time since we met nearly a decade ago, and things between us became more intense, but I hesitated to go further, afraid of ruining our friendship. He was adamant that we shouldn’t do anything that might scare me away until we were officially dating, which I found very romantic because he told me he had wanted this for years. I also wanted this for a long time, but I might have been blinded by lust if it wasn’t for him telling me that it’s better to do it when I’m on the boat he’s in.

During this trip, we discussed trying to make a relationship work, but I was still nervous, especially given how hectic his life as a business owner is. He’s making millions of euros from his various companies, yet he’s constantly fatigued and often shows signs of wear and tear, like cuts, bruises, or injuries. He’s always on the front lines of his businesses, risking his health to the point of exhaustion, which worries me tremendously. He promised that whenever I came back to town for us to be together, he would hire a director to take over his responsibilities, allowing him to take some days off. He also committed to doing his best to establish normal working hours instead of the grueling schedule he was used to.

During my last trip home in September, we spent a lot of time together and agreed on me moving back home for a few months to try it out with him. If it worked, I’d stay permanently. But towards the end of my stay, he suddenly went MIA. I knew his mother was very sick, so I was worried since she’s the only family he has left with his two older brothers. I tried to contact him, but I heard nothing for a whole 24 hours, so I started blowing up his phone as I was also due to go back to the country where I work. Hours after my intense calls, he texted me saying he was okay, had just gotten out (still don’t know from where lol), and that he would call me back ASAP, but he didn’t call me back as he promised. I even went to check on him at a hospital because he sent me his location when he texted me to reassure me, and it showed he was there. But they had no record of him and told me he was in another hospital, which declined to give me information. With no more information since we don’t have any friends in common left, I started to watch his social media presence. A week later, I saw that he had been active on Snapchat (gained 3 points—very Gen Z of me), which hurt me because he could have at least let me know he was fine. So, I deleted him from all my contacts, and a few days later, he blocked me on Snapchat.

Now that I’m back in my hometown, as I said I would be for a few months, I can get some professional and personal things done and rest with my loved ones after years away, even though the main reason I returned was for him. My sister thinks I should reach out to him since we agreed to try being together if I moved back. I’ve noticed that he’s been viewing and rewinding my sister’s Snapchat stories where I appear; he never viewed her stories before and only kept her as a friend on social media to reach me if we weren’t on speaking terms. Also, he’s very inactive on social media—not that he usually puts himself out there—but, for instance, it’s been over six weeks since we last spoke, and he hasn’t gained the usual amount of points for someone who’s active on Snapchat, just a few. However, I’m unsure if I should make the first move.

I don’t know if I messed up by deleting him when he was going through a tough time, especially since his mother was sick, and it was around the anniversary of his father’s death.

It’s worth mentioning that we always end up deleting each other after fights. We’re both pretty proud and get sassy when we bicker, but we always end up talking again—mainly thanks to him putting his pride aside first.

So, AITAH for deleting him from everything after his hospital stay? What should I do? Should I reach out or leave it be? Any advice would be appreciated!",3,1729100027.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

This is my weirdest case.,"On the 25th of November 2018, the victim pulled into a budget motel in the early hours of the morning. He booked room 12 for a three day stay, and on the fourth day the owner of the establishment sent his son to check on the victim. What he found was something that someone his age should never have witnessed. Or anyone for that matter. 

By the time I arrived at the scene, it had already been cordoned off. Members of the county police department had swarmed the area and in the absence of the sun, it was the blue and red flashing lights that cast their glow over the building. I made my way past the tenants who were half-asleep, doing their best at giving witness testimonial.I stepped by a particularly shaken forensic pathologist who was trying to call his mother and entered room 12. 

Now, I've been working as a crime scene investigator for more than twenty years. I have dealt with some truly confounding scenes before. In 2006, a body of a missing hiker was found in the woods just on the county line. It had been burnt to a crisp, but only the upper half. Below the waist was completely untouched, as was the surrounding area. 

More recently, a farmer reported a break in just after New year's eve. Presumably, someone had broken into his warehouse which housed an industrial animal carcass shredder. It had been used in the night and a pile of jellied flesh was found clumped at its mouth. Horrifically, it was eventually proven to be human, although couldn't be identified beyond that. Only one other thing was found at the scene. Within the remains was a small steel plaque, about the size of a business card, with the number 0002916 engraved in it.

I say all this for simple context. I am no stranger to the unexplainable, but what I saw in Room 12… it still keeps me up at night. The following are excerpts from the crime scene report I filed that day. 


Incident Number: 24-0711
Date of Incident: November 29, 2018
Time of Arrival: 11:54 PM
Location: Room 12, Sir Sleep-a-Lot Motel, Yellow Smoke County
Reporting Officer: Detective Arthur Graham, Yellow Smoke County Police Department

Victim name: John Doe (Name yet to be confirmed through fingerprint or DNA)
Gender: male
Age: estimated to be mid-40s
Occupation: unknown 

Suspects: none at present 

The victim checked into the ‘Sir Sleep-a-Lot’ Motel on the morning of November 25th, 2018. He informed the motel owner, Mr. John Kelly, that he would be staying for three days. No known associates or visitors during the stay.

Victim was found laying on bed in supine position. Victim had skin removed crudely. Patches of flesh hang loosely, revealing bone in some areas. Teeth indents on right part of pelvic bone will be examined. The victim's head is absent from the scene. Notably, the body had been dressed in what appeared to be women’s undergarments, specifically a pair of lace stockings and a torn satin slip. Neither items of clothing belonged to the victim.  The body was likely dressed post-mortem. 

Addendum: Marks on right part of pelvic bone were positively identified as being from a human juvenile, estimated as between the ages of three and six. No dental record have been traced. 

Blood covers every inch of the room's four walls and carpet. The blood spray appears to be inconsistent with splatter from traumatic injury, possible use of pressurised device. The amount of blood was determined to be approximately two gallons, or 135% of the victim's total volume. 

Teeth were found on the room's desk, thirty-three in total arranged into a circular pattern ten inches in diameter. The careful arrangement appears to be ritualistic. The teeth are currently assumed to have been belonging to the victim. The location of the victim's head has not been identified.

Addendum: The findings of the forensic odontologist have determined that thirty-two of the thirty-three teeth belonged to a person matching the victim's description; a caucasian male in his forties. One of the teeth matches a younger caucasian female. It was eventually connected through dental records to be from twenty-four year old Alyssa Hadland, reported missing in 1997. The Hadland case was archived in 1999 due to absence of evidence. 

The victim’s tongue was discovered in the bathroom sink, exhibiting a complete severance at the base. The incision appeared clean and precise, suggesting the use of a surgical-grade or extremely sharp cutting instrument. Notably, the tongue was found in isolation within the sink, devoid of any other biological material, indicating that it may have been intentionally relocated post-excision. 

First responders noted signs of tampering on the coin-operated television in the room, which intermittently activated to static approximately once an hour. The television will be deconstructed for forensic examination to recover latent fingerprints and other trace evidence related to its manipulation.

Addendum: Both of the victim's eyes were recovered from the interior of the room's coin-operated television. The television screen had been removed and the eyes were placed within the cavity where the cathode ray tube was situated. This positioning suggests deliberate placement, indicating a possible symbolic motive.

The only item of clothing found at the scene belonging to the victim was one pair of denim jeans, which witness John Kelly recalls being worn by the victim the morning he checked in. The jeans were contaminated with the victim's blood. In the pockets were found a one-way bus ticket from the towns of Cosgrave to Mayor's Income, one packet of apple flavoured gum and a button. No other possessions of the victim were found. A pair of small, leather lace-up shoes were found at the foot of the bed. From the lack of blood stains, we can assume the shoes were placed there after the homicide. 

Addendum A: A shirt likely belonging to the victim was found three weeks later partially buried in a field in San Tommaso, a small town 240 miles south of Yellow smoke. The shirt matched the description given by John Kelly of the victim. Blood samples taken from the shirt were a strong match to those taken from the crime scene, although without the identity of the victim a definitive link is challenging to corroborate.

Addendum B: The small shoes found at the crime scene were dated to 1909 and determined to have some value among antique dealers. Due to their small size they can be assumed to be children's shoes. 

The room showed no obvious signs of damage. The furniture appeared to have been undisturbed although a Bible was missing from the bedside cabinet. Neither John Kelly nor his son David, lead witnesses of the case, recall seeing the victim with any luggage. For this reason, it is unclear if his possessions were taken or if he simply had none to begin with. The motive of this homicide remains unclear. 


I'll save you the rest of the procedural formalities. I've lost track of how many nights I've spent awake, staring at my computer screen reading and rereading this report. It's stayed with me for the past six years, constantly at the back of mind. At my personal behest, the case remained open despite insufficient evidence and a complete lack of any leads. When it was finally shelved at the beginning of this year, they were no closer to solving it than we were the day we found him. 

Earlier this week, I learnt that it had been reopened by the FBI. I assumed that there must be someone else in this department who felt the same way about the case as I did, strong enough to reach out and request assistance from the feds. I was tasked with compiling any and all digital evidence we had on the case onto a USB flash. 

I felt weird combing through all the reports, files and forensics. It felt like I was visiting an old friend. I added the documents I wrote up on the day, the dozens of crime scene photos and witness statements. I've studied them all meticulously myself. I doubted some Yale boy with a corner office could do any better. 

I kept trailing through the earmarked files, checking and double checking if there was anything I'd missed. It was dark now. I spent the day working from home, hunched over my computer in my sorry excuse for a library. That's what my job mostly consists of now. I couldn't wait for retirement. Maybe then I would have the time to read some of these books I have lying around.

I decided I was finished for the night. I'd squeezed every piece of relevant information I could find onto that hard drive. It was up to the FBI now. I only hoped that if our victim left any family behind, they could one day get some closure from this. I was about to shut my computer down when something caught my eye.

Witness_1.mp3 

It was an audio file. Somehow I hadn't noticed it before. Hell, I don't think I had even listened to it before. To my knowledge, all the Witness statements taken that night were written. I clicked on it, figuring it must've been taken from David Kelly, the kid who'd found the body. 

I took a sip of my last dregs of coffee and sat back in my chair, jacking up the volume. The audio wasn't the best quality. It was shrouded in the static of an analogue recording and to my shock, the supposed ‘1st witness’ had a woman's voice. The following is a transcript of what was on that file.

First responder: ""What were you doing in the area before you discovered the body?”

Witness 1: “I'm staying in Room 14, the room next door to where it happened. Been there for the past two weeks, thereabouts. I've come on hard times recently, you know how it is. I was living out of a van until this, but it wasn't exactly reliable.”

First responder: Apologies ma'am, I meant what were you doing immediately before discovering the body.

Witness 1: Right… Well, I came back from work around nine. I clean at the elementary school in town. I came back and spent the rest of the day in my room. I had dinner and I was just catching up with the news before I went to sleep.”

First responder: “Can you describe how and when you found the body?”

Witness 1: “Gee, it must've been around ten. I was turning in for the night when I heard a banging noise from next door. I guessed he must've brought a lady friend over so I tried my best to ignore it, but it kept getting louder. It didn't sound like a headboard neither, more like someone chopping wood. It was too much for me to ignore so I got up to go complain. I found the door unlocked and it opened wide up when I knocked. That's when I saw him that poor, poor man.”

First responder: “Could you please describe the scene you came across as detailed as you can?”

Witness 1: “It was terrible, just terrible. I saw my neighbour kneeling in the corner of his room. His head had been cut off! Can you imagine that? There was blood covering everything around him. I almost vomited there and then. Then I saw the man in the bathroom.”

*there's a pause*

First responder: “Could you please go on? You said there was someone else at the scene?”

Witness 1: “Yeah… a real weirdo. I didn't notice him at first. He was just peeking out from behind the bathroom door, watching me. When I did finally notice him, we just stared at each other for a moment or two. Then he just strolled out from his little hiding place.”

*another pause*

First responder: “Please continue, I assure you everything you have to say will be of some importance to our investigation. Start by describing this man you saw.”

Witness 1: OK then. He was a freak, I'll say it. When I got a good look at him I saw that he had this great bulbous head. He was bald as a newborn and the entire back part of his head was all deformed and sagging down. I think he had this disease. Oh what's it called? A boy I went to school with had it…”

First responder: “Are you thinking of hydrocephalus?”

Witness 1: Yes! Yeah, that's it. Hydrocephalus. But it was much worse than that kid I knew. Sorry if i'm coming across as rude but It looked like some horrible octopus. And the front part of his head was far too thin. He has this pointy chin and cheekbones. His eyes were as bulging as his skull. All yellow and white, I think he had cataracts. Oh, and he must've been around seven feet tall, at least. He was hunching over where he met the ceiling.

First responder: “Can you describe what he was wearing?”

Witness 1: “Sure… he had this battered old duster coat on. It was black, but he was covered in these stitched rags of red and green. The coat hung down to the floor, but I could make out the tips of brown leather boots poking out from the hem.”

First responder: “Can you-”

Witness 1: “Oh! Pardon my interrupting, but the man, he was holding this… Well I don't know what it was. It looked like a lobster pot with a handle and must be two dozen blades sticking out of it. Knives mostly, and razor blades, axe heads, chains, that sort of stuff. Anyway, go on.”

First responder: “Right. What did you do when he came closer to you?” 

Witness 1: “Well I ran. I just ran. Out of the motel and down the road until I realised everything I owned was in my room. I didn't fancy having to start over from nothing for a third time so I came back, and that's when you bumped into me.”

First responder: “Alright, and how long was it from discovering the body until you called 911?”

Witness 1: “Oh I didn't call 911, honey.”

First responder: “You… didn't?”

Witness 1: “Oh no, by the time I came back from my little jog the place was already crawling with police. I still haven't been allowed back in my room.”

First responder: “Are you aware that-”

End

His speech became muffled after that until the recording was nothing but static hum that'd been in the background since the beginning. After hearing this for the first time I didn't know what to think. I just sat in my old oak chair until my wife came in to tell me that she was going to bed. I kissed her goodnight and went back to aimlessly staring at the computer screen. Eventually, I closed it and stood up. I took the usb stick and left it on my desk. I left the room and locked the door behind me. I changed, washed and climbed into bed with my wife. I kissed her on the back of her neck and tried to fall asleep. That… thing that did this was still out there. But that wasn't my problem anymore.

Now hiking groceries back to where I have a couch to crash on for now.

The walk here felt so great moving my body completely freely without my heavy pack full of hygiene and camping supplies plus my side bag of food I carry while living out in the streets.

Finally, a moment of pulling just my own bodyweight!

Good for the soul, that.

Also, found a new pair of shoes I had been gifted a while back!

Excellent news because my old shoes were worn down past the treads into the sole construction material on the bottoms.

I actually slid down this hill yesterday in a clumsy way, skinning my knuckles attempting to slow my descent, a silly miscalculation which would not have happened had my shoes still had proper treads.

Location: US
Budget: Under $2000 for the machine (still evaluating grinders)
Drink Types: Mostly lattes*
Space: ECM Classika seems to be about as tall as I can go
Manual vs Electric: Manual, making coffee is a break from tech for me, an I like the E61 designs specifically
Comfort: In it in part for the journey thuogh want a machine that can make decent coffee out of the box

Short question: How annoying is making lattes with the ECM Classika PID or other SB? Can I make the milk first and then do the shot?

Longer probably unnecessary explanation:

I'm looking at the ECM Classika PID as my first big boi machine. I'm doing pour overs mostly now, with an occasionall French press and going to coffee shops for lattes.

I mostly want to do lattes. Mostly I drink one cup of coffee a day around the 500ml/16oz size (so for lattes, that'd be a grande). So most days it'll be just one cup. The other members of the household expresso'd interest (dad joke!) at least once they validate I can make good drinks :P So sometimes I might be doing back to backs, maybe on weekends.

I know ECM is an SB. I was looking at the Profitech 400 for XB but the price/features of the ECM seem worth it if I don't mind having to wait and do a bit more. Given I'm hand grinding my beans for pour over now, I don't think the extra time is that big a deal. It might be mildly annoying doing back to backs but since those won't be a regular thing, I think the ECM checks all my boxes.

But I wanted to double check to make sure I wasn't missing something. Based on videos/reviews I've seen of folks making lattes on it, that seemed fine to me but I've never owned a machine of this caliber before and thought I'd better ask the hive mind vs leaning on a reviewer.",1,1729099460.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

One is about the eating and being so hungry. How do you know if you are actually hungry because you’re starting to become more healthy so being hungry it’s normal. Like no mania so you’re not everywhere at once so you don’t feel like eating and now you’re more stable so you feel the hunger. And on the other hand you’re not depressed so you are hungry because it’s not that you’re depressed and you lost all of your appetite. Or is it actually side effect and it’s just a craving. Because I’m so used to the fact that I have just one meal and a coffee a lot of coffee by day so now when I actually have to have three meals in a day is so weird. But in the same time, I’ve actually gained weight and I am on Seroquel for about a year. And going up the dose to 300 mg. And it didn’t stop at some point I’m still gaining the weight.

The second thing is about not being able to wake up because I'm fell cravings few hours after I take Seroquel. So I would like to try taking it in the evening so those cravings are actually when I'm asleep but then if I take the Seroquel too late in a day, I just can't wake up.

The strep went away, but the pain in throat stayed, and after few doctor visits and a gastroendoscopy I was diagnosed with LPR. That was definitely unexpected, as prior to the infection my endoscopy was just fine. My primary symptom was daily sore throat, and I couldn't lay down or even lean backwards after eating anymore as it would cause the sensations of food rushing back into my esophagus. I also had dry cough at night. Of course, I was prescribed Omeprazole, but it had no positive effect and I was afraid of the side effects, so I was relieved to be switched to another drug, which is no longer prescribed. Nevertheless, I would say it helped me quite much. Additionally, I started having a dinner not later than 2 hours before bed, stopped laying down during the day and started eating more vegan foods and much, much less dairy. Chocolate, coffee, alcohol and cigarettes were already off my list, and I continued eating citrus fruit and fatty foods as before. I also treat myself with junk food from time to time and personally I experience no problems with that. I think that for me the most important part was spacing out eating and laying down. The symptoms disappeared very slowly, but surely, and after like a year I stopped having the acid-induced sore throat altogether, I very rarely wake up from coughing, and right now I can even sometimes lay down after eating without experiencing any weird feelings. I still can't bend down soon after eating/drinking, but I guess it's kinda normal?

I hate my husband and I want a divorce but I feel so damn trapped for my daughter. 
My husband is a SAHP with our 3 year old toddler. But 3 days a week for 2.5 hours, she goes to preschool. I also only work 3 days a week, and I’m home for 4. So there is “free” time. Time to do other things. Time for another job. A part time job. Something. This man does nothing besides smoke cigs and weed. He does not have a job, he does not cook for me, he does not clean except for when I am losing it and demanding help, he does not take care of the maintenance of the vehicles, of the bills, nothing. It’s all on me. He takes care of our daughter when I’m at work but when I’m home, I’m the default parent. I cook, I clean, I spend time with our child. Plan outings and activities for her. Then, when I take a nap, or something for myself, he complains and tells me when we are fighting , that my naps are the reason he has no free time to get a job. Make it make sense yall. I’m losing my mind. We are also fighting like cats and dogs. Over everything and anything, it can be WW3 if I’m not careful. He can’t take any responsibility for his actions. For example, this morning we stopped at a store to get coffee after dropping off our daughter at school. I had a tall cup of hot coffee in my hand, and hand sanitizer in my right hand. Husband opened my door because I asked him to. I sit down in the car, with the coffee between my legs while I’m cleaning my hands, and this man just plops himself in the drivers seat so hard that my coffee spills all over me as the whole car moves. Instead of him saying oops I’m sorry, something, he blames it on me. “Well you’re the one who filled it up all the way and put it in your lap”. Takes no responsibility. Every. This is a tiny example of the daily incompetence and gaslighting that I deal with. That incident sparked a full on argument. Eventually I told him to leave me alone, just don’t talk to me. I can’t stand him and the feeling is mutual I guess. He sees no fault in his actions. He cannot see how he talks to me, treats me, makes me feel. I’m tired of it but I stay for my daughter. She loves her family, she loves her dad, and she loves all 3 of us together. When it’s just one of us, she will ask about the other parent. It makes me sad. I can’t imagine having to split our days, weeks , holidays etc.

Also felt pretty cool recently when someone found out I was sober at the very end of a bachelorette weekend — I had several cups of coffee and someone made a comment to which I responded oh you know sometimes I get a fix from caffeine since I don’t have alcohol and they were SHOCKED I hadn’t been drinking all weekend (I usually have a mocktail or NA beverage).

IMHO, I found Babai Tiffins (HSR Layout 19th Main) the most superior of all the options I tried. The milk is thick and their own roast is well balanced. Overall the coffee is full-bodied and delicious as I imagined a great filter coffee to be. Although their coffee station folks couldn’t tell; I definitely tasted chicory in it. Do try it and let me know if you too found it to be as good. Costs ₹25. 

The second best I found was not in Bengaluru but in Hyderabad. At Rameshwaram Cafe. Costs ₹30. 

Not sure if MTR filter coffee (Lal Bagh) is regarded here as great, but I found their coffee to be too bitter, unnecessarily frothy and watery. Apparently they boast about not adding chicory. Costs ₹50.48.

I would love your thoughts on our current plan 

Thursday: 
- arrive 930am at MSY
- go to airbnb to freshen up 
- Cajun Pride swamp tour @ 12 
- rest at hotel 
- head to FQ for dinner/explore around 5 - any recs here? Is it a waste of time to do a ghost tour, cocktail tour etc? We were thinking Lilette but it’s a little more upscale than what we want! 
- Frenchmen street for music 

Friday: 
- Levee Baking Co for pastries + coffee @8/9
- walk the garden district 
- any lunch recs in uptown? We were planning to do high hat but it’s a little too north/out of the way
- rest + get ready
- take street car to garden district @ 2 
- walk magazine street to grab drinks and late lunch (rec we received here was the vintage, anything else?) on our way to the superdome

Feeling major imposter syndrome. HELP!,"Completely anonymous. I created this account just for this, because this is a burning question I have had for a long time now. I work at quite a specific company where I have to sign confidentiality and keep things under wraps, so I will be very very vague. My (F26) job is in marketing. I am part of a 3 person marketing team at a company that owns several other companies. We often get the other companies' work dumped onto us. Not to mention the countless other tasks that don't actually apply to marketing that I have to do. I have just had my 2 year anniversary at this company, and this is my first real marketing job. My boss, (40s F) is someone I would now even consider a friend. She hired me knowing I had no experience and took a chance on me. She always fights and advocates for me and looks out for me A LOT. She knows so many personal details about my life, and I hers. We have another female close to my age in my department as well, I'll refer to her as coworker. I like both boss and coworker very much. But, I sometimes feel like coworker does not get as much *pressure* as I get. She has been with the company aboht 6-8 months longer than myself. And boss is going on I believe 7-8 years total. When I say my boss does things for me, I mean it. She has randomly given me money, she sends me out for stuff and lets me keep the change for gas money, she buys me coffees or lunch on occasion, etc. I don't have a great relationship with my mom, I would almost consider her a mother figure. We get along amazingly 99% of the time, until we don't. When we don't, it is BRUTAL. I don't blame her 100%, as I know most of it is pressure coming from external factors, but I know she counts a lot on me and I can fall short at times. I have never seen her exhibit this behavior with coworker, and she never does this to me in front of coworker. She only directly does it days that coworker isn't in the office, but sometimes when coworker is in the office, she will make comments without directly saying me. I don't know what to do anymore at this point. I have so much sympathy for her and I want to help, but she makes it hard for me to. She is very much a giving person and it gets taken advantage of A LOT. She has sown so much into me I don't want to let her down by leaving. She relies on me to do a lot. There are several tasks that without me, SHE would have to be the one to do herself. And these aren't small tasks. They are time consuming and unpredictable. I would estimate that my job gave her back anywhere between 2-6 hours of her day back to focus on other things. Depending on the day. One big thing, is my department has to plan our company-wide Holiday party, where guest expectancy is about 400 people. This year, she has asked me to head this, aka basically do it all on my own, and just ask her and coworker for help when needed. She wanted this from me last year but I failed majorly under the pressure and I am so scared of this year. Going back to the ""bad times"" it got so bad a few weeks ago she sent me home. She told me she didn't want me in the office and told me to just go home. It wrecked me. I went home and I sobbed. I just feel so useless, and unfortunately, the way this company is structured, I know it's not completely her fault for the stress and pressure. She already works over 8 hours a day, some days I think she works even 16 hours, and she definitely works weekends. She never expects me or coworker to do that, but all I can picture is if I left, what would she do then? I don't feel cut out for this job and I am starting to wonder if I would be better suited somewhere else. I don't adjust well to change. I was at my last retail job for 5 years before I came to this one. However, I had a fashion marketing degree and this industry is not even close to fashion, so maybe I WOULD be better suited elsewhere. Basically, TLDR, I am dealing with guilt, imposter syndrome, and fear of change. I don't know what to do. I can't continue to let outbursts like this severely hurt me when I already struggle with anxiety, depression, and low self esteem. Also, please understand that I am not perfect, and I definitely make mistakes, but I feel like these ""outbursts"" or ""lashings"" for lack of better word are not warranted. I have a really hard time sticking up for myself. ",1,1729098700.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

Also, my birthday's in a few days 🥳

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

At the very start of covid-19 I changed times I went to the gym to very early mornings about 3:45-4 in the morning. I live in a smaller town and my gym is available 24/7 to people with tags/member card. At first I was alone, then maybe 2-3 weeks into my new schedule another person started going about same time as me.

He was a few years younger than me and had a feminine feel/look to him. He presented himself to me and remarked on my physique which was the first time someone did. Over the weeks he was at the gym same time as me sometimes and he asked me for tips and we talked about various things and it turned out we had common hobbies/interests also. He usually finished his routine and went home before me. But one morning we came in the same time and he came in on me and kissed me. I told him I had never been with someone of same gender before and we agreed to change numbers and social medias. 

Same day we changed contacts he told me about himself and how he was out as homosexual and wanted a boyfriend. I told him I didn’t really think much about being with someone of same gender before. But that I was open to the idea if it was with him which confused me as well when I said it. We went on a coffee date and after we agreed to go home to me where we watched a movie, snuggled/kissed each other and we had sex for the first time as well. I had some heterosexual relationships and had sex with some girls before I met him but with him it was the first time I felt the sex was amazing in all ways.

We committed ourselves to each other and we agreed to me coming out would be done when I was comfortable. I met some of his friends, followed him to Pride/LGBTQ gatherings and met some of his family and they knew we were together. 

In my family some members especially my father have been very outspoken against Pride/LGBTQ and ”gay” people, claiming at times they want to ”turn” other people gay. I told my now boyfriend about this and we agreed I would try to talk with my family alone. When someone at a family meeting brought up when I was getting a girlfriend I ”jokingly” said maybe I would get a boyfriend and my father non jokingly almost plainly said he would disown me and I would be no part of the family. And I felt I would also lose my part in the family company which is a source of income for me. 
I told my boyfriend this and he still wanted to be together with me. 

About 1.5 years into our relationship he told me he had applied for a university about 400km away from our town and had been accepted. This came as a surprise to me little bit as he had not prior said anything to me, but I decided not to hold him back. We had our last night together and I drove him to the train station in the morning. I was heartbroken at first but also scared as I know really didn’t know my sexuality anymore. I installed Grindr and was a bit appalled by what I saw on that app and I went on a date with a guy from a neighboring town. We had a rather strict sexual relationship, while not as amazing as with my now ex-boyfriend I still liked sex with same gender. 

My family now pressuring me for when I will get a girlfriend. I felt a sense of needing to adhere to norms or be outed from the family and I ”sadly” caved in. I met a girl from Tinder and we have now been in a relationship and recently started to live together for about 2 years. And while she really is great and I have feelings for her. I can’t help but miss my ex-boyfriend and while the sex we have is ok it’s not as good or amazing as it was with guys sadly. Many times I think I would enjoy giving a guy oralsex more. And the time I am alone I sometimes masturbate to homosexual porn and it makes me feel very guilty.",2,1729098463.0,lgbt,1,1.0,False

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

Have you ever wondered if Saiki could survive with coffee jelly? The answer is yes.

This is because Saiki's powers made his metabolism capable of extracting every possible nutrient from whatever Saiki eats: energy, emotions, thoughts, nuclear waste, are just Saiki's possible daily meals.

However, this has caused Saiki's palate to deteriorate towards human cuisine. So for Saiki it is the same for him to eat a piece of gold or his mother's food.

* The coffee jelly still has flavor for Saiki.

I am 31 and DH is 35. I am currently on CD1 as Aunt Flo arrived today and we're planning to start trying this month. We have tried on and off before but not sincerely so haven't had any luck so far.

We are both vegetarians. I normally don't eat breakfast and just have black coffee because I am not super hungry in the mornings and like to do intermittent fasting but I heard it's not the best idea when TTC so I plan to have oats and eggs for breakfast. Lunch is regular Indian meals such as roti, dal and vegetables. I sometimes have fruit for evening snack or chai and then dinner again is similar to lunch. I plan to increase my protein intake as well by adding premier protein since vegetarian diet does not include too much protein. I already take iron (as prescribed) and prenatal ever since we went unprotected.

We've been staying with his parents so things have been really stressful last couple of months and we've been drinking a lot more than we normally would because of the stress (almost every day). In general we both enjoy drinking as the town we live in doesn't have too many activities to do and most of our friends live really far away so that's sort of our only way to have fun when there's nothing to do. I am planning to cut down completely to start cleaning up and only drink during my period if I feel like it. DH is planning to cut down as well. We have never smoked or done any drugs. I also workout regularly for 20 mins daily but haven't been able to since past couple weeks due to back sprain.

(L-4,5 and S1). Recovery took three days and I was pain free, not using anything but Tylenol. Felt 20 years younger. 6 days later I was flat on my back again with 9/10 pain, a fever and wound drainage (not the good kind) had to be rushed to the ER and post CT scan showed a seroma 3cm by 7cm and infection in the discs and vertebrate. 

Had first clean out surgery the next day. They cultured it as Staphylococcus and started the IV antibiotics. I spent 14 days in the hospital. 

A week later my pain increases and I pop another fever so readmitted for another Cleanout surgery. That was Sept 20th. 

My recovery has been slow. I’m still on a 24/7 IV antibiotics via the picc line they installed and I have another 3 weeks of that still to go. I have been suffering bilateral muscle spasms that at times are extreme. I’m on Flexeril and gabapentin and do have Oxy to take when I really need it. 

Every day had been a bit better than the previous day but I’m still in bed 20 hours a day. This past week on Thursday I felt a light at the end of the tunnel. Spasms were mostly under control and every day I was sitting and walking more and more each day. 

Yesterday I got up and felt zero pain. Walked around the house and made coffee etc was great.  However three hours later as my wife is taking me for my picc line change the pain hits again. Really bad but only on my left side. Pain is mostly spasms but there is some nerve pain too. All on the left side only. 

My labs all look good. No elevated WBC etc. still have a high value for C-reactive protein (meaning still a lot of inflammation) 

I am very worried that the infection is back or that I have another seroma. The infectious disease doc is not worried but both she and I have reached out to my Nuro surgeon to see if he thinks we should do another MRI but have not heard back. 

I know progress is nonlinear but does this sound normal for 3 weeks post Cleanout and 6 weeks post initial surgery? I feel like I should not have this pain and should be more mobile at this point.

I’ve been replacing coffee with black tea, but I’m looking for more caffeine-free alternatives to help manage energy levels throughout the day.

Any suggestions for:

	•	Effective coffee substitutes that are caffeine-free or low in caffeine?
	•	Strategies to maintain energy without relying on caffeine, especially during those afternoon slumps?
	•	How to handle any withdrawal symptoms or reduce dependency gradually?

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

>

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

Photo by LyfeFuel on Unsplash

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

The bond to build the new rec center was passed in 2022 and construction has begun! They are going to start pouring the foundation shortly. Drive by SW 35th and Lava Ave. to see the progress (near the Highland Baptist Church). At the same time, a levy was out for a vote as well to cover initial operational expenses. The levy did not pass in 2022. 

As you may have guessed the levy is back on the ballot this year with a reduced rate. The tax impact is $0.21 per $1000 assessed value of the property. For the average home assessed value of $250k, this is about $52 per year (think about a gallon of gas or a coffee per month). You can find your assessed value on a property tax statement or at https://dial.deschutes.org/

The levy will fund operational expenses for RAPRD and the new facility, such as utilities, staffing, equipment and supplies. It will ensure that the current swim center stays open to reduce user conflicts for the pool. It will make sure the new facility is ready to go as soon as construction is over. RAPRD hasn't increased their tax rate in decades, so this levy is to help with the increased operational expenses of the new facility. 

If we don't pass the levy, then the Cascade Swim Center will close. This puts us right back to the issue we've been having - space for all of our activities and those interested in doing them. Right now, there isn't enough time in the day to provide access for multiple school swim teams and waterpolo, fitness classes, recreational lap swim, swim lessons and family swim times. The fitness classes are often too full and the pool can't accommodate everyone for only one session a day. The school teams need to practice but this ties up the pool for hours a day and then it closes to the community when there are competitions. With both the swim center and the new rec center open, there will be enough space for everyone.

A failing levy also means other concessions will be made, like reduced hours, reduced fitness programs, and increased admission fees.

Let's support our community and the new facility by voting yes on the levy. The facility is going to be awesome and such an asset for Redmond.",12,1729097552.0,Bend,4,1.0,False

The new run by Torunn Gronbekk, art by Fabiana Mascolo and colors by Patricio Delpeche. Even though I didn't hate Tini Howards run, no secret there, I'm glad to move on to another team. So lets actually do that, the previous run is the past and this run is the future for Selina Kyle. I've got my coffee, music playing (Dancing with the moonlight by Hotel Mira if you’re curious), it's the perfect time to write a review at 1:35 am and I just read issue 69 of Catwoman. 

This is a jump on issue. You pretty much need to know nothing of Tinis run and I mean nothing. This is the perfect or close to perfect jumping on point. If you dropped the book during Tinis run, give this issue a shot.

Everyone probably figured it out by now but I really loved this issue. From the writing to the art...most of the art (we'll circle back to that at the end) to the noir coloring. The coloring fits, it's a mystery story after all. It's definitely a strong issue though it may not be everyone’s cup of coffee or tea. The solicits have already spoiled this but just in case >!this is an international book so if you're looking for Gotham...save this issue, I don't think you'll find it for a bit!<. This book also sets up a story that will be adding to Catwomans past seemingly in a big way. I'm excited to see what Torunn does, especially if the issues stay this strong. 

This being the first issue of the run and a jumping on point, the review summary is going to be blocked off as spoilers. There is certainly things I want to talk about here so better safe than sorry.

>!The preview gives you the start. We find Selina in a safe house, one surprisingly close to her actual place. That place is under surveillance by the police. We don’t know why but we’re also told an id Selina used, Evie Hall, when she was younger, a time she was happy before it went wrong, has been killed.!<

>!We find out that someone is out to kill Selina herself in a flashback. Taking a shot at her at a party the night before. One where Selina is working a rich mark, a heist or part of the planning for a heist. This feels very back to basics for Catwoman. Planning to steal from a billionaire, least that’s the impression. The dialogue is brief, feels like Selina playing a role which is appropriate. It doesn’t feel like they know that she’s Catwoman but the newspaper shows they know shes Selina Kyle.!<

>!The shoot out is beautifully handled. Kept very short but it illustrates just how fast everything happens and how quick Selina is to react, to run. I love the way Catwoman is handled in this issue. We get a series of scenes of Catwoman putting everything together. It’s quick and to the point. There’s very little wasted time. Catwoman feels like she should, quick, perceptive and clever.!<

>!The next scene takes us to a very calculator like character and set up. They’re hunting for Selina using all forms of surveillance. Why they’re after her isn’t clear but the mystery of the book. You know it has to do with the past. Selina mentions that everything went bad with her now dead ID. I was reminded of enemy of the state. You can see how their access to this much surveillance options is going to force Catwoman to adjust how she moves about.!<

>!We return to now and we get the new suit. After the end of Tinis run and the loss of her most recent suit, a new one being developed isn’t a surprise. It’s a well handled dress up scene and the big reveal is worth the price of admission alone. I saw this under another post with the big shot, the comment by u/ogloria and i agree, seeing how a costume makes a character feel, how the mask affects them is great. Beautiful reveal. Perfect writing…papa John’s. I may be to online…!<

>!We move to the action. The car watching Selina’s place. The cops investigate while Catwoman watches on. Quick and hard hitting scene. The captions show that Selina knows what she’s dealing work and the action shows what they’re willing to do. The captions feel just a bit off but it’s hard to express why. Selena’s movement, the “tail” the poses…just lovely.!<

>!The next scene continues the action, Catwoman finding someone in her apartment. The action is quick but it’s also the weakest part of the issue. The art fails the fight, the layout is alright but it’s rushed. I’ll talk more about it under art. Anyway, based on the dialogue the hitman(?) doesn’t know Selina is Catwoman, mistaking her for another assassin. This explains I think why she can still operate as Catwoman while being hunted.!<

>!This is also a big scene for Selina as she takes stock of her apartment, her life. She could leave her life behind, vanish but she’s not ready to leave this life behind. Leave her home behind. We see our one hint of Bat presence in Gotham with the bat signal and then Selina is running.!<

>!I love the caption work here and the look into Catwomans mind as she explains disguises, as she shows her knowledge of people. People from different layers of society, we also see also just how clever she is, knowing the safest way to leave Gotham.!<

>!The whole trip out of Gotham is handled so well. It’s quick but it’s full. It’s complete. The page economy is fantastic. We learn more about Selina and how she operated in the past, about her past fake id of Evie Hall in such an easy clean way. This is great.!<

>!We end in Berlin, over the last pages they set up Selina teaching out to Evies friends and so we can assume that’s who she’s meeting. I love the clear focus on fighting for the life she’s built.!<

>!Of course started cameras in airports so the threat is there.!<

Just a fantastic issue, near perfect on two or three reads. 

Anyway let’s talk costume.

The costume is honestly fine. Great even in Fabianas hands. It's sleek, deceptively simple but the mixed medium with the shiny leather and the mat black body suit keeps it from actually being simple. The low cut top isn't to distracting but that may be due to the art style. A different artist might overemphasize it. Here under Fabiana the costume feels elegant. The mask connects to the neck or at least looks like it does and though based on the issue it may be under the jacket. The ears again in this art style doesn't stand out as much as on the standard cover. The whip being able to be attached to the lower back, simulating a tail is a stroke of genius, especially for silhouettes. I would love a little more detail to show where's it's connected because it can get a little lost in the suit, making it look like an actual tail.

The writing is fantastic. Like I said above, Torunn delivers a strong first issue to her run. Torunns Selina is interesting and already feels more complex. The dialogue and especially the captions push that this Catwoman while a fighter is a thief first. She doesn't hesitate to get out and reassess. She nails Catwoman voice, her feel to me. The core of the issue is the mystery and Torunn sets the hook up beautifully. The opening grabs you and you're given just enough information to keep you. I haven't read anything by Torunn until tonight but if her other work is this good, I have to catch up on it.

The art...I love Fabianas art in this issue for the most part. Her art fits the story perfectly. Sleek and I want to say soft..might edit that if I can find the right word. It's not overally detailed like Carmine Di Giandomenico who had a very detailed style. Here you have a noir story that is stylized. It kind of reminds me of Casper Wijngaard in a way. Her designs, her style all feel more grounded. Coupled with the colors, her art removes some of the fantastical, giving more of a gotham central feel. Her Catwoman, her Selina is divine. The costume again in her hands is elegant and sleek. That dress, oh me, oh my, beautiful.

Now you might be wondering why I keep saying for the most part...let's finally talk about it. The action...the action is on the weaker side. It's so simplified, nearly shapes and line work that you'd see on a storyboard, not the finished comic. I'm hoping the action is handled better in future issues. Otherwise...this is going to be a style heavy book and I think Fabiana Mascolo does a beautiful job overall. 

Patricio Delpeches colors are lovely. Each page looks like a water color. Neon technicolor or shades of greys with the sick yellow of headlines. It's all so very Se7en. They work perfectly with Fabiana. It has a very 70s feel with the explosuions of color, the minimal background...not sure why that's what I'm getting.

To wrap this up...I loved it. I'm excited for the run and for what Torunn has in store for Selina Kyle/Catwoman. I want to follow her on this journey and see who is trying to kill Catwoman. I want to learn as much as I can about Selinas past identities, who they were and why she left them behind. It's a mystery and baby consider me hooked. I hope everyone gives this a shot. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I don't know if Torunns Selina will be for everyone but try it out.

Anyway, i'll be back sooner rather than later for a special holiday appropriate review for Catwoman. So not the same Cat time but still the same cat channel.

If I missed any spoilers as always let me know.

We do everything together, I’ve met his friends and family he has met mine too, we slept together everyday at my place (basically lived together), we texted all day etc. etc. I mean, we were solid.

Thing is, for a long time now he does things that bother me (like not contributing financially -not even a cup of coffee- ,  cleaning up after himself, being insensitive sometimes etc.) and I’ve tried many times to communicate my needs and explain what I want him to do in order to be an equal partner in the relationship and split the responsibilities with me ‘cause I get to do most of the work. He didn’t . Then I gave him time to think. Then I pushed some more. Then I started nagging and being lowkey angry most of the time. I was exhausted. Then I cracked.

I told him everything, not filtering it with compassionate words and sprinkles. He said he’s listening and ready to try to work things out. 
I spoke some more the same day and he couldn’t stand it, he disappeared for days. 

Let me tell you that 2 days before, he was crying out of happiness and thanking me for going the extra mile to throw him a surprise birthday party.

Anyway, so 5 days pass, nothing. I text him to meet up and talk, he says he’s not ready. I pressure him. We meet and talk for 3 hours and we don’t get to a conclusion. He says he’s not well and he can’t stand it anymore, he has to go but he will text me to meet again and continue the convo. We weren’t fighting, he even kissed me once and I didn’t stop him, I didn’t ask for my keys and my stuff back and neither of us proposed to break up. He just kept saying he has a lot to process and he doesn’t know what to do. 

Now, three more days have passed and nothing. No text, no phone call.
And it’s the first time ever this happens, our record for not contacting each other has been 2 days tops. We break it ‘cause we miss each other.

So, I’m out here, waiting in limbo for 8 days, can’t concentrate on anything, not sure If I should start grieving or not.  

He seemed really sad when we met and that he was not in the mood for anything, eating, going out etc.  
 the days we spent  apart. 

Is he trying to find the courage to break up with me?
Should I give him space to think or should I text him and ask for my things back? 
Is it over or he’s gonna come around?

TL;DR : My bf is not contacting me after a fight. It has been 8 days. What does this mean?",1,1729097379.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

When it comes to fashion, I believe that basic casual styles are essential to our wardrobes. They’re versatile, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. Today, I want to dive into a fantastic option that perfectly embodies this philosophy: a basic casual garment featuring two side pockets and one pocket at the back. 

## Why Pockets Matter

Let’s be honest: pockets are a game changer. Here’s why I love them:

- **Convenience:** Whether you’re running errands or lounging at home, having a place to stash your phone or keys is a lifesaver.
- **Style:** Pockets add a touch of practicality without sacrificing style. The right placement can enhance the overall look of your outfit.
- **Functionality:** You can go hands-free, making it easier to grab that coffee or carry your shopping bags.

## Caring for Your Casual Style

Taking care of your clothing ensures they last longer and stay looking fresh. Here’s how to do it right:

- **Machine Wash:** Always use cold water. It’s gentler on fabrics and helps maintain the colour.
- **Avoid Bleach:** You don’t want to risk ruining the fabric. Stick to mild detergents.
- **Tumble Dry Low:** Heat can damage fibres, so keep it low to preserve your clothes.

## Styling Tips for Basic Casual Wear

Wearing basic casual styles doesn’t mean you have to look plain. Here are a few tips to elevate your look:

- **Layering:** Throw on a denim jacket or a lightweight cardigan for a stylish layer.
- **Footwear Choices:** Pair with trainers for a laid-back vibe or with ankle boots for a more polished look.
- **Accessorise:** A statement necklace or a stylish watch can transform your outfit from basic to fabulous.

## Real-Life Example

Just the other day, I wore a simple black basic casual piece with pockets to a friend’s casual brunch. I paired it with white sneakers and a trendy crossbody bag. I felt comfortable, stylish, and most importantly, I had space for my phone and wallet without carrying extra bags. It was the perfect balance of comfort and style.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I wear this style for a night out?**  
A: Absolutely! Just jazz it up with some accessories and a pair of heels.

**Q: What if I have a different washing machine?**  
A: Just ensure you’re washing on a gentle cycle with cold water. 

**Q: Are the pockets deep enough?**  
A: Yes! They’re designed to be functional, so your essentials will fit securely.

Just wanting to make a post thanking everyone for the great advice they gave on my last post!

After talking with some of you on my previous post, I went ahead and took some of the advice I was given and now I have a small collection developing. I bought 2 pipes to go alongside my corncob, a StoneHaven Briar and a generic clay pipe, both were wonderful, the briar smokes like a dream and it's been my go to since I got it, but I was also really quite fond of my little clay pipe, until it slipped out my hand and broke, tried reparing it a bit but it broke again and I'm planning to get a new one anyway so it might be time to put the little guy out of commission.

When it came to the topic of getting tongue bite, I honestly think it was mostly just my tobacco being too damp, like you guys said, after letting it dry out over night it was perfect, burned better and tasted nicer.

And on the topic of tobacco I must admit the St Bruno reccommendation was a good one and I can see why it's a lot of peoples go to, but I am fond of clan as well, and tend to use it if I want a quicker smoke.

I'm really quite enjoying the hobbie so far, my favourite thing to do on my lunch break now is go to Weatherspoons, get a coffee, sit in the smoking area and puff on my pipe for half an hour, it's become a bit of a ritual.

I'm planning to make train journey to a tobacconist soon, is there anything nice people could recommend, or should I just take a shot in the dark?

Also since I'm wanting to get another clay pipe, does anyone know of a good place to buy one online that's in the UK? Specifically a Churchwarden/Tavern Clay Pipe as I'd really like to try a long stem. The only place I've found those pipes is from an American distributor, which is fine if that's the only option but the less postage I have to pay and quicker delivery the better, so if anyone has a place please let me know.

On the topic of clays I'm also attempting to make some of my own, since my Uni has a pottery section I can make use of, I'll share my results when they're either finished or broken lol.

My gastritis started in March because of excessive stress with school, smoking, drinking, and dieting followed by binging spicy food and sweets. I would wake up nightly from intense nausea and would feel nauseous after almost every meal. 

I first thought I had something wrong with my ears like a balance issue because I was dizzy all the time. Finally realized it was something with my stomach when I would get such incredible gas pain that I couldn’t stand upright and it would last the entire day. Nothing helped, I tried ginger, tums, ibuprofen (which probably made it even worse). Got a scope down my throat from the ENT and they saw no signs of reflux on my esophagus but prescribed me omeprazole anyway. 

The omeprazole helped with the pain, but I still kept a bland diet, but I could eat more things than some of the more extreme cases in this subreddit. I had to avoid all greasy foods, spicy foods, alcohol, dairy, all the good stuff. Depended a lot on rice and chicken, sushi, fruit, and oat milk. 

I kept the strict diet along with starting therapy and getting on Prozac, which was necessary for me not just to manage my stress but to manage my health anxiety which was exacerbated by the gastritis. Finally got an endoscopy at the beginning of August after being on omeprazole for two months which only showed mild inflammation. After being very cautious with all my food, on a trip I decided to try drinking. As a recent 21 year old I was very upset about missing out on having a fun party summer. I had one drink, then two, then three, with absolutely no problems! Then the next night I drank again, no problems. And the night after that. I reintroduced more exciting foods but still kept away from spice, grease, and excessive dairy. 

Now I am weaning off omeprazole, but am able to drink coffee, alcohol, and the occasional spicy food with no problems! I try not to overdo it because I do not want to relapse. I always make sure to drink coffee and alcohol on a full stomach and I will pop a tums or a pepcid beforehand just to be safe. 

Do not give up hope everyone! I was so down about my gastritis which in turn made it worse. Once I found safe foods that I enjoyed it made it much easier.

My former best friend (let's call her Susan, 33F) and I (let's call me Ann, 33F) have known each other since the 4th grade. We went to the elementary school together and naturally stopped talking after as we weren't close, or even friends, back then.

It was many years after that, when we were around 24-25, when we met again. I need to say I consider it as it was meant to be because of the way it happened. One day I got a call from an unknown number, not knowing it was Susan calling me. I picked up recognizing her voice as she was asking me 'Hello, I got your number from X, are you still tutoring English? Are you the Ann I went to the elementary school with?' We started meeting for our lessons at first but quickly realized we get along very well. We started what later became a very strong friendship. We used to go to the movies, concerts, various sport events... One of my favourite memories is of a night color run around a lake nearby, where they would spray various dye powders at every passed kilometer. We laughed so hard some of the dye got into our mouths. 😂 I remember another one of my friends was having a barbecue party that night and invited both of us. We came there late at night and ended up having so much fun that we were inseparable since then. Susan was the first one to know about everything in my life and vice versa. We even spent some family vacations together. She really was the closest person to me for a significant period of time in my life.

Now, let's go to the part where it went down hill. She invited me for a coffee one day and showed me an ultrasound picture - she was pregnant. I couldn't be happier for her. Even though she'd been seeing the guy (now her husband) for only a couple of months, he was super nice to her (and me), a real fun and family guy - what she'd always wanted. While being pregnant and even a couple of years after, we still maintained a very strong friendship, always sharing everything and being there for each other. Of course we didn't see each other as often as we used to, but we still managed to find quality time for ourselves, and a couple of times even for our families. One time we took both our moms to this amazing mountain wellness hotel. It was a surprise girls trip which they absolutely loved.

I organized this trip and many other events after that. Susan's always been a little overwhelmed, later even chaotic, while organizing something. I never thought this would be an issue, even though I was caught by surprise sometimes. For example, she has never, to this day, driven her car to a major city (we both live in a small country, I might add). When she wanted to go somewhere, she asked me to drive and we'd make a trip of it.

As time went by, with her baby growing up, she had less and less time. I know being a new parent may be overwhelming and stressful, but there's a difference between getting used to the new baby schedule and not being able or willing to manage your time. After a couple of years, I got tired of hearing the same excuse over and over again. I offered we can take a look at what her day or week looks like and I'd help her make the best out of it, so she would have time even for herself. She said she was open to it but it would never work as she never knows what her day would look like as her husband randomly throws tasks at her - like promising to pick up their child from a day care and cancelling at the very last minute, so she has to drop everything and run there. She's been a stay at home mom and doesn't need to work as her husband provides everything.

A year and a half ago I was looking for a job and got an offer from her husband at his company. I was thrilled to start as a manager of a project I was passionate about. I was told the company just needed to wait two months to finalize the legal documents, so while waiting, I'd work as a dispatcher. Long story short, I quit after seven months with no project on the sight whatsoever, sleep deprived from working 12-24 hour shifts in a toxic environment. No words can express how disappointed I was seeing how the company works. Before this experience, I had a long term career in finance - an environment where great time management skills, among other things, are essential. Seeing the absolute lack of professionalism (anything and everything you imagine there) at this company made me question my sanity...

I left the company at the end of 2023 which was also the time I started planning my wedding. Without a doubt , I asked Susan to be my maid of honor. Even though we didn't see each other that often at the time, it was more about the quality over quantity for me and I genuinely enjoyed her company. Knowing how overwhelmed she may be when organizing something, I assured her it would be a very small wedding. (We had a barbecue party with 26 people and couldn't be happier about it.) I also told her I'd like to have a bachelorette party with only two of my best friends, her being one of them, and I'd like it to be a three-day trip to Milan. I pictured us just eating great food, drinking tasty wine, dancing, sightseeing... I prepared myself for the rare possibility she'd say no to organizing this event and looked everything up. Including eerything, it wouldn't cost more than 400€ (450 dollars at the time) per person and I wanted to pay my share, given I'd only ask two other people to come and one of them wasn't working. So, here we are at my favourite coffee shop, me asking her if she would organize this for me, and guess what I hear. As her body language tells she's super uncomfortable, she starts talking about how she doesn't have any money for it. I know that wasn't true as she'd told me they're remaking the whole house. (This is not the case 'We're remaking the house and that's why we don't have money', they're showered with cash and 400€ wasn't going to affect them. I may add they go to multiple vacations a year.) I know she doesn't have her own money as she's not working, but they'd been together for 7 years and married for 2 at the time, for crying out loud. Seeing I wouldn't let go, she told me she doesn't know how to use apps for booking the tickets, accomodation, etc. (I must say her husband organizes their trips. From what I saw she sometimes doesn't even know about a trip he's planning for them until a couple of days before.) I asked her if there is anything in the way of her getting familiar with these apps. With basically no response, she told me I could've planned it better as this time is not good for her because of the house make-over. I'd like to point out I didn't have a set date for the party as I wanted to agree on the date with the girls. Her being not able or willing to move forward with this conversation made the whole situation extremely uncomfortable and cringy. For me, it was gut wrenching. I still remember this part of the conversation a little blurry from experiencing very strong emotions I never thought I'd experience with her.

To make it clear why this was heartbreaking for me, I thought I could tell her anything, could rely on her and she'd be there for me the way I was there for her. I planned her baby shower with no help from her other girlfriends, made personalized gifts from scratch, even paid my sister to bake a two-level cake for that. I made a group chat for all her close girlfriends and they replied the day before the shower if I need any help. At that point, everything was taken care of... I planned the entire bachelorette party with some help from her friends and helped organize her wedding to the detail. I don't know what to say.

Oh wait, I do! She forgot it was my birthday two years in a row and we were together on those days both times. The second time was somewhat worse because she invited me for a dinner with a surprise, so of course I thought it was for my birthday. I dressed up and was happy to see she'd thought about our relationship. She came with a gift bag in her hand, hugging me, smiling, sitting down... We started eating and she told me she wanted to have one last blast with me till I'm married and handed me the bag. There were some bachelorette party decorations and two tickets for a striptease show which was happening in two hours. Not gonna lie, I loved it. 😂 While still at the dinner, she told me she has something else to show me. It was an ultrasound picture, she was pregnant again. I hugged her saying I'm happy for her as I knew they'd been trying for a while. My response may have been a little off because she asked me what's wrong. I told her it's my birthday. She immediately got red, I'm talking tomato red and apologized for forgetting two years in a row. I told her there are two ways to look at it - one way is the fact that she forgot about my birthday again, the other one is to enjoy this dinner and following program. Rest assured I enjoyed it. 😂

Back to planning my bachelorette party and wedding... After a couple of weeks, it seemed like both of us had cooled off. I started planning my wedding, and I asked my two bachelorette party girls for a very low-key party. We ended up having a nice dinner with drinks and we went to see a musical. I enjoyed every minute of it.

(Just a fun fact: my husband's bachelor party was a 5 day road trip to Tuscany in Italy where his 7 friends booked a gorgeous 14th century villa with wine tasting and various trips. I burst into tears when his best friend told me they're planning this. I admit I was 80% happy my husband has friends like this, and only 20% jealous. 😂)

A few weeks before my wedding, I asked Susan to help me make friendship bracelets. We were going to give one to everybody at the wedding. I specifically asked her if this can be an evening for us, we can order a take out, chat, etc... She came with her 6 y.o. son who got bored after an hour so they left early and I finished most of the bracelets myself.

I also wanted to show her what I was wearing for the wedding. We set a date, I came to her house, we were chatting and having fun. I was about to take my wedding clothes off and put normal clothes back on when she got a call from her husband saying there is a repairman by their door and he needs to go fix something in the house. She didn't even know about it, she was caught by surprised and so was I. It's so rude and disrespectful to not let your spouse know about something like this... To tell the truth, I felt like shit and I felt sorry for her.

Couple of weeks after the wedding, I called Susan and told her I wanted to sort things out with her. I know she's neither used to nor comfortable with having straight forward conversations, so I carefully asked if I had said or done anything, if there's any reason she doesn't want to spend time with me. She said she couldn't think of anything, she just doesn't have a lot of time. (From my experience with her, it's just an excuse she's been using for six years and at this point, I'm sick of it. You know, that's life. There's always going to be something and it's about the priorities you have. If you don't want me in your life, it's okay, but we need to stop pretending that.) I then told her I can think of two things, first is our disagreement about my bachelorette party, and second is me leaving my job at her husband's company and talking very fondly about my new job. Both happened around the same time and it was just a little tense since. She again said everything is okay. I understand both of us may have different views of what okay means. For me, going from super close best friends to rarely talking to each other is not okay.

It's been five months since the wedding and we've seen each other twice. Once when she invited me to her renewed house, giving me a tour and not asking a single thing about me, my new job, our new apartment, nothing... She seemed a little cold, not interested and the whole situation was like a spit in my face saying 'I don't have a couple of hundred euros but look at my gorgeous new house'. The other time was her second baby shower which I helped organized, I wasn't initiating it. I was partly doing it because Susan said to another friend of ours, who was actually initating and organizing the shower, that no one would do another baby shower for her. I mean if you say this, you must know why no one would want to do that for you again.

I'm not interested in being in a pretended relationship and at this point I can say I've done everything I could to make it work.

In its 'attack mode', it can fire 6 honing missiles, which begin to lock on within 20 meters of the target, as well as being dependent on infrared heat. The missiles can fly at around 100 mph, and each has an explosive yield of a quarter stick of dynamite. 

Electric Eye can, at the power of its user fly at up to 70 mph, but it can go much faster off the momentum of a divebomb. It cannot be called back in the typical sense, only once Electric Eye runs out of fuel it despawns, and then may it be called out again.

There's a fresh coat of paint on the exterior of 214 Fourth Ave.

Those with a good eye and better memory will recognize the red-and-black trimmings from a long-running business that hasn't graced the storefront since 2021, Java Joe's CoffeeHouse. While the iconic cafe isn't returning, a neighboring business hopes to open a different kind of community gathering space in its place.

The paint is just a signifier that it has the blessing of the family of Joe Coppola, who opened Java Joe's in 1992.

The Despensary, a natural plant medicine store specializing in products containing hemp-derived THC, plans to open Zaza — presumably, combining ""za,"" short for pizza, and ""zaza,"" a slang term for marijuana — in the space.

It will start out as a pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. Over time, plans call for it to expand into an entertainment venue, brunch spot and a place for casual drinks. The Despensary is looking for an operator who will be responsible for booking anything and everything from live music, stand-up comedy and karaoke to poetry readings, parties and more.

Where to begin. Given everything I've seen on reddit, I don't believe I've had an overly tough life. But boy does it feel like it sometimes. 

My Family Picture: I'm a 25M with three younger brothers, Dad 45M, Mum 45F, Step-Dad 44M. The youngest two brothers are from my Mum's current marriage. 

I’m not sure whether it's trauma or my lack of brain capacity, but I don't have many memories of my childhood... Whether I blocked them out or I can't remember, I'm not sure.

From the age of 5 my parents have been divorced. My mum has since re-married to my step-dad or as I call him the Devil Incarnate. This man has been in my life for longer than I can remember and I can honestly say I hate him, pure visceral hate.

He is a literal man child. My first memory of him was being sat in his gaming room, just watching as a kid and trying to give my opinion or help him win. Next thing you know he's swearing and shouting at me, telling me to get out of the room. 

The memories of him progress from there. I remember we moved to his city and his house. Which means he had his friends there, this would result in drunken nights where he would cause arguments with my mum. To the point where he was kicking doors down, making the whole house shake and screaming the place down for no reason at all, other than he was drunk. Again this progressed, to the point where my mum had been physically hit by this man and nothing was changing.

I'm unsure of the full context, but I believe at some point my dad caught wind of what was happening in that house and as you can imagine he was not very happy. We came back to my dad's house one day during the summer holidays, to which him and my Mum started arguing and it got heated to the point where my dad ended up with a coffee table over his head throwing it across the room. This is anger, I have never seen from him before or since.

Things did get better for a little bit, when my mum moved back to our home city where she had her own house and the step-dad only came to visit to see his son. However this was shorted lived as he soon wormed his way back into our lives, eventually living with us again and as you can imagine, some people don't change. More of the same drinking and arguing ensued for years and years.

Oddly enough I distinctly remember a lot of arguing happening on a Thursday evening. My younger brother had already had enough and left our house to live with our dad as he hated my step-dad & resented my mum for staying with him. 

To this day I am used a communication tool between that brother and my mum, as they rarely speak so I have to try bring them together or even get them to talk. Often times I would have to comfort my youngest brothers who would be balling their eyes out in their room. 

Again arguments became physical, loud and aggressive. A lot of the times things in the house were broken from the arguments and at times my mum would have black eyes. To the point where sometimes, I would message the neighbour to call the police (not that they did). This is where I realised, there are not many people out there that will help you.

Besides, countless other things he's done when drunk, one including walking into the hall where are shoes are kept thinking it's the bathroom and pissing over all our school shoes... The day before school, with my mum having to clean up his mess.

When I was around 10 it was just me and my mum in the house. My dad & brother were at their house which was a 5 mins walk away. I heard a glass smash downstairs, I come down to see that my mum is cutting her arm with a broken glass. I couldn't get her to stop. So, I had to phone my dad to help but maybe I didn't explain the urgency as my dad seemed to be taking a while to get there. So, I had to get on my bike and pedal as fast as I could to get to my dad, I met him halfway up the road and told him she was bleeding, to which he started running. He couldn't get her to stop cutting, in the end he had to threaten to calling the police before she would stop. 

Fast forward a few years, the normal cycle of arguing and drinking has continued. When I was 14 we had a street party. This included all 4 younger brothers my mum, step-dad & his sister with her two kids. As you can imagine there was plenty of drinking going on. Again my step-dad went too far, to the point at which he was outside the house trying to dance with other women. 

My mum managed to get him in the house and us kids were now in our rooms. He was arguing and wanting to continue the party and to drink, he came upstairs and threw up in the hallway, went to their bedroom and came back out the room accusing other people of throwing up, blaming everyone else in the house. Again screaming, shouting & kicking doors around the house, at this point his sister was so scared she took her kids and left. 

After which he proceeded to punch holes in the walls and TV. He then went downstairs continuing to argue, then falling into self pity ending up picking up a knife in the kitchen threatening to cut him himself (police now phoned) he continued to bellow and cry saying his kids don't love him. He did end up cutting into himself, making his arm bleed deep enough that both the police and ambulance were needed at the house to take him away. Still, my mum let him back in the house the next day as she took care of his arm. The cycle continues. 

Danny Elfman! That is to say the little things. By now the status quo was that an argument could break out at any time. However this was the peak of the mountain, some of the next parts may sound petty but they all add up. 

My step-dad would often create a sour atmosphere in the house, you knew when he was angry or in a mood, from his stomping around the house, slamming doors or swearing under his breath. If something wasn't done the way he liked it, everyone knew about it. On your phone whilst a his TV show is on? Then he's huffing and puffing because 'we should all be watching' and it’s rude to have phones out. 

He would also often complain about mum not cooking enough food, bear in mind he never cooks or does anything around the house. At one point, I found a book under my bed that my ‘um hid 'How to deal with a narcissist'. 

This combined with the atmosphere, meant that I would often eat less, as to not cause an argument giving him more food to eat. It got to the point where I didn't want to sit at the table with him because of the atmosphere he created, so again I would skip meals or make out I had eaten before getting home. Even timing my showers around dinner, so I could come downstairs and eat alone. To this day I still eat fast, my partner often tells me to slow down. 

Like I said previously, this man did nothing around the house. He had no driving license and everything seemed to be on my mum's head. He worked in another city, so every morning he would demand a lift to the train station, often times my mum had to cover his tickets, he would even have the cheek to ask for money for cigarettes. 

Meanwhile, my Mum covers this and pays for all most household bills and looking after the two sons of their marriage. To this day both my mum & step-dad are on very good money, however he often tells my mum he has no money or will often to promise to pay for half for things like sofas or holidays, but when it comes to paying he seemingly has no money left. Financial abuse in it's finest form. 

Fast forward to when I was around 13/14 my grandad passed away (Mum's Dad). Which means moving my Nan to come live with us, so she would not be alone. My nan & step-dad did not get along, plenty of arguments and stress within the household. This led to my mum's 2nd attempt of suicide, after a major argument my mum again ended up smashing a glass and cutting into her arm, this time a lot deeper and a longer cut. Spending her birthday in hospital. She still has the scar to this day. 

Back to modern-ish day, the arguing and power games continued in the house. However, my mum & step-Dad has decided to buy a house together (At this point they were living in a house only owned by my mum) I knew as soon as they owned a house together, that my step-dad would be flexing all of his ego & narcissism in that new house. 

I was unfortunately right, in any little way he could he would implement random rules and petty shit in the house, like not putting stickers on my wardrobe, like what even is that about??? To be honest I only ever stayed at my mums house as I didn't want anything to happen to her. At this point my other brothers are older and I can no longer stand staying at the house. So, over Covid I permanently moved to my dad’s.

Finally, late last year my mum re-visits the idea of divorce, which she has mentioned before. However, this time she seemed serious, even going to the police station to report my step-dad in case anything were to happen, when she brings divorce up at home. 

I of course along with my partner, younger brother and her friend supported her with going ahead with this, helping her finding a new property etc.... However this was short lived, as the step-dad begged and pleaded with her not to divorce him. Making her feel bad and dragging their two kids in as well, before she could speak to them. Of course, the two kids do not want the divorce and my mum feels trapped and guilty and nothing further happens. So, now she is still stuck in their unhappy marriage. 

All this has now led to a breakdown of my relationship I have with my mum. As she has become jealous and bitter. For example, my grandad (Dad's Dad) passed away and of course, now that I am older, I am able to help my grandma to grieve as well be more involved as a grandson. 

We had a trip planned for my cousin’s birthday before my grandad passed. So in order to honour my grandad, we decided to continue with the trip (all wearing his favourite colour) along with my dad’s family and partner. Fast forward a week or so later, my mum is messaging me in a jealous fit, about how me my partner never visit her or doing anything with that side of the family. Even going down to the point of saying “No one was there for your nan (her mum) when grandad passed away, and who was there for her?, but you can spend time with your grandma?” like WTF I was only a kid at that time??? 

Since then, I've been with my partner I have been on a couple of holidays with her and her family. Again she will often message me making me feel guilty about going away or giving snide comments about the holiday. I think she does this out of jealousy my step-dad never wants to go anywhere or get away. But I don't understand why she can't be happy for me. 

This is where, I have now started to lose some respect for my mother. As I have now been told by my partner that my mum is now cheating on the step-dad, with weekend get aways with her work friends and then confiding with my partner, then telling her not to tell me. This has now been on-going for a while. For which I have no idea what to do about, there has for sure been multiple occasions for cheating and some strings of relationship. I honestly just wish she would get a divorce rather than play these games.

I think this is it, but I'm sure there is plenty I've forgotten and plenty of other awful stories that my other brothers remember more than me.

That might be me next. I am so close to losing it.  Seriously. A thin thin line separates me from a psych ward I think.

This menopause is kicking my ass. I have too much going on and I can't whittle down the items and I'm so happy for this sub and I know y'all get it and I just don't know what to do about this.  I'm taking care of my mom with dementia and that alone is exhausting. She's a handful and makes me nuts.  Working on putting her into a home now as she can no longer walk but it's not easy to do and the paperwork and Medicaid is a hellscape.  I get no help from siblings who are estranged from her, yet she thinks they are wonderful and delightful (although they've blocked her phone and email). It's rough.  Nothing is ever enough. And she finds me fascinating to criticize: my weight, my makeup, my cooking, my hair, anything.  Anything I do is ""why"".  My shade of lipstick, when I wear it, is ""not flattering"".  Endlessly.

My husband, on the other hand, has turned into Beavis or Butthead. ENDLESS sexual innuendo and desire. Constant and I'm not amused. He says I should be flattered.  He should be shot.  I'm sick of it and ever little remark he makes.  Imagine me asking him to hand me the coffee creamer and he smiles and says, ""I got your creamer"" x 1000times a day. Yeah, that.  Maybe it's a midlife crisis thing but I'm so tense already and it's just not. Fun. At. All.

I have a kid at home still who is genuinely a delight except he thinks I'm an ATM which gets old as I'm decidedly not.  I'm broke.  

Then there's my body. EVERYTHING hurts. From both arms in pain (torn rotator cuff in one) and tingling, a broken toe, constant migraines, fatigue, dizziness, just everything feels painful. And nausea.  And I'm so so tired.

I had a rare hour out of the house this week to pick up stuff at Target. While there, I was going down the aisle and did have that sensation of just losing it and throwing stuff. I understood it. The rage.  I had that sensation and understanding WHY people lose their shit. I controlled it, with the help of a snickers bar.  Didn't feel good.  Felt like shit, which is status quo.

I have been asking for advice from friends of mine who have had similar experiences and thought I'd post here so please bear with me if I sound silly. Thanks!

I am a young professional who has been living in a 1 bedroom rental in Ottawa for 13 months now - this is my first rental ever after moving out from my parents'. It is a triplex and I am in the basement. The rent is fairly expensive especially considering the area, but as we know, the housing market is nuts so it is to be expected. However, being a clean, quiet, tidy tenant who always pays rent on time - I have general baseline expectations of my landlords (a couple) that I consider to be reasonable.

Since living here, I have had to argue with them about a few things including heating not being turned on (temperatures being under the municipal guidelines in the fall/spring), about the shitty air quality causing huge amounts of mold to grow in my kitchen behind my stove unbeknownst to me (and being told I would need to run 2 dehumidifiers and an A/C for the summer to prevent it from returning - my hydro bill went up by nearly $100 each of those months) and now cockroaches.

When I moved in, I noticed what looked like diatomaceous earth thrown around the kitchen cabinets. I did not think much of it at the time and did not hear of any roaches, until a few months in when my upstairs neighbour mentioned finding a roach. I asked her to communicate with the landlord to inform them of her sighting but she was told to use diatomaceous earth for the time being since the problem was not bad yet. I was anxious about this, having seen lots of roach infested units in my line of work and knowing how quick things can get bad but I let it slide, being a new tenant.

In June of this year, I sent a picture of a cockroach I found in the laundry area which is right outside my kitchen (I have a door in my kitchen that leads to this laundry/storage area that is not well kept AT ALL). I explained that although it was not inside my unit, it was right outside and it probably wouldn't be long until they made their way into my unit. I was told that none of the other tenants had complained yet and to monitor the issue and use diatomaceous earth (this I knew to be a lie, they clearly didn’t realize the other tenants and I speak). 

In September, I messaged my landlord because I had seen lots of cockroaches in the garbage of my neighbours on the third floor and had found an adult roach in my kitchen. It was clear the unit on the 3rd floor was infested - the garbages are kept along the side of the building, near my window. I requested we start placing the garbages further from the building but nothing was mentioned to the other tenants and there was no follow up. As of two weeks now, it has become obvious to myself and my neighbours in unit 2 that there is a bad infestation - babies have been crawling out from underneath my fridge and I've found multiple adults not only in the kitchen but in my bedroom and bathroom. They've laid eggs in my Nespresso machine and it's a piss off to see roaches crawling out of it. These all may seem like small things to deal with but it's not fair to work hard for the things you have and lose appliances over someone's inaction. I cannot live like this and I have been losing sleep over the issue. I don't think people realize the toll these things take on people's mental wellbeing.

I had to push very hard to finally get confirmation that they would be fumigating. My landlady is incredibly rude and has been super difficult to work with. In emails, I have asked her multiple times which company they've hired to come fumigate on Saturday and she outright ignores me and tells me she's given me all the info I need and that she's tired of repeating herself. Due to their history of being cheap, I am worried that they have not hired a reputable company and are just going to spray insecticide themselves. If they were sending in a company they would most likely give them a treatment plan - explain to them that fumigation must happen multiple times especially with how bad the infestation is on the third floor. But if it's just them doing it, then it'll be a total waste of time and resources, taking everything out of my kitchen and bathroom for nothing..

Maybe I am being petty due to how rude my landlady has been, how little compassion she has when communicating with tenants but my neighbours and I are wanting some sort of rent discount or abatement for our troubles - because the issue truly did not have to be this bad and we have reason to believe it existed before we moved in. It did not have to get this bad but they let it because they are cheap. 

So my questions are: 

* Do we have any grounds to stand on for requesting a rent discount? I know we cannot withhold rent and I will continue to pay rent, but is there any chance the LTB might favour with me in asking my landlord to reimburse some rent costs? I just find it criminal that they can charge these absurd rent costs and cause us such grief with their apathy.
* Can I request compensation on the T6 under Remedy 2 for items lost due to the infestation - such as a mini fridge, television and coffee machine?
* Can I continue to pursue the matter with the LTB even if I choose to give notice and move out?

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks.",1,1729095387.0,OntarioLandlord,1,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while it’s raining I’m drinking coffee and listening to the cranberries (sounds like a sad movie I know ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream. I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special 

I’m looking for preferably a girl best friends but anyone is welcome I also don’t mind any age . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

-Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
-a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
-complaints about stupid shit
