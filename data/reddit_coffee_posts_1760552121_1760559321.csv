1o7lrck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o7lrck/i_want_to_stop_eating_sweets_too_much/,I want to stop eating sweets too much.,"I don't consider myself a sweet tooth (maybe), but i'm sucker for chocolates. I've noticed that i started to eat sweets after lunch or dinner (sometimes breakfast) with a cup of tea or coffee, which are also have sweets in it. 

I'm also deathly sucker for nutella, i've been eating them frequently with bread every night but recently i stopped eating them too much because i feel guilty. Though i actually bought 4 jars of them after they went on sale so i think i have to finish them before expiration.

But now it seems like i'm eating more chocolates. Biscuits, bars would hate to see me coming. A pack of 4 biscuits is not enough for me, so i would two a day, sometimes 3 if it's so delicious. 

I'm 21 years old (if that's relevant) and my paternal family has history of diabetes, so it makes me genuinely worried. I have no symptoms yet so far. 

I don't know how long i've been doing this bad habit, back then i wasn't interested in those sweets, especially after meals. But since i started drinking hot drinks, i found it to go well with sweets. How can be motivated to stop eating them less frequently? ‡≤•_‡≤• 

P.S. I tried to prevent myself from sweets, my bestie's mom would happen to call and tell me she made some cheesecake, and then i have to go get one. Goddamn she made them so hard to resist, sweet sponge, cheese on top with melted condensed milk. I ate 4 slices in one setting. ",1,1760559047.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1o7lqjm,https://v.redd.it/tlargtc31cvf1,I made a coffee app puurfect for the tinkering Aeropresser!,"What makes [BeanBean](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beanbean.beanbean) different from other brewing apps is that it helps you refine your coffee recipes through intentional tweaks based on taste. Instead of guessing, you‚Äôll follow a meticulous process to dial in a perfectly balanced and delicious cup of coffee:

1. **Brew** \- Create a recipe with key variables like coffee dose, water amount, grind size, temperature, and brew time. These variables are dynamic and will change depending on what you taste.
2. **Taste** \- Sip and identify whether your cup leans sour (under-extracted), bitter (over-extracted) or balanced. Use the taste of your coffee as a northern star in your coffee brewing process is key!
3. **Tweak** \- Adjust your recipe by changing one variable at a time and aim for a balanced extraction. If your brew is balanced but bland, this is the time to tweak two variables in opposite directions!
4. **Repeat** \- Keep refining until you find you reach a sweet, balanced, and flavorful cup. With this process, you will be able to brew the best cup of coffee you can with your current setup, beans and skills!

The app is currently available on the Google Play Store and will in the near future hopefully be on the iOS store.

If you have any feature requests or find any bugs that need squashing, then I would love to hear from ya :D",1,1760558999.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

Alright, team, gather 'round the digital campfire. I need to confess my email marketing sins.","Alright, team, gather 'round the digital campfire. I need to confess my email marketing sins.

Two months ago, my email deliverability was so bad, I'm pretty sure Gmail had a dedicated ""Send to Spam"" button just for my domain. I was that guy. My ""strategy"" consisted of buying sketchy lists and praying to the algorithm gods. The result? My open rates were lower than my motivation on a Monday morning.

The final straw came when I got a reply: ""UNSUBSCRIBE AND NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN."" It was from my own cousin. Yeah. Awkward.

I knew I had to change. But tools like Apollo and Hunter were draining my wallet faster than my coffee addiction. As a bootstrapped marketer, I needed a plan that was cheaper than my takeout budget.

My ""Desperation Pipeline"" That Actually Worked

Phase 1: The Google Sleuth

I became a Google search ninja. My queries looked like something from a spy movie: ""CEO"" ""eco-friendly startups"" ""contact"". I was finding gold... but then spent hours copying and pasting emails like some digital scribe from the Middle Ages.

Phase 2: The ""Aha!"" Moment

One late night, covered in cookie crumbs and self-pity, I found a Chrome extension that felt like cheating. It was EmailScout. Suddenly, with one click, I could scrape an entire page of Google results. It was like going from a teaspoon to a firehose. I half-expected the email police to kick down my door for how easy it was.

Phase 3: The Redemption Arc

The process became stupidly simple:

Hunter-Gatherer Mode: ""Marketing Director"" ""SaaS"" ""Boston"" email on Google.

The Magic Click: Hit the [*EmailScout.io*](http://EmailScout.io) extension. Poof - emails in a spreadsheet.

The Cleanse: Run the list through a verifier (non-negotiable!).

The Glory: Import into a proper sending platform and watch the real opens roll in.

The Ironic Twist

The funniest part? Last week, I landed a client who said, ""Your email was so well-targeted, it felt like you read my mind.""

Little did he know, I basically had.

I'm not saying it's a magic wand, but for a free tool, it saved me from becoming the black sheep of the email marketing family. And my cousin? She still won't reply to my texts, but at least my emails aren't the reason anymore.

I just stumbled upon this sub today, and it looks I found gold as it feels like so many spaces on Reddit revolve around hookups, but I‚Äôve always been drawn to something softer: genuine closeness, comfort, and the warmth of touch. 

I‚Äôm looking for an ideally ongoing connection built on affection and mutual comfort. The kind of bond where holding someone close after a long day feels like hitting pause on the world for a while. I love long snuggles, slow kisses, lazy hugs, gentle head pats, hand-holding, and quiet moments that say more than words ever could. Kisses, to me, are reaffirming and affectionate: more about warmth and closeness than necessarily something purely sexual.

Lately, work‚Äôs been burning me out, and all of my close friends have moved away for new opportunities. This has made life to be sometimes very depressing and lonely. As we Vancouverites like to say, our city‚Äôs beautiful, but often lonely and I think cuddles could fix that for me

About me: 
I‚Äôm 28, brown-skinned, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, clean, hygienic, and respectful ‚Äî with a body built for cuddles: what I‚Äôd call a beefy dad bod, though I‚Äôve been working out daily lately (currently cutting). And apparently, I have a great smile too‚Ä¶ not just according to my dentist!

When it comes to comfort, I‚Äôm big on consent and communication. I like to check in about boundaries, even for simple things like hugging or kissing. I want you to always feel safe, seen, and in control.

As for me ‚Äî my biggest passion is guitar üé∏. I‚Äôve got four of them and love covering my favorite bands like Polyphia and others. Hugely into music (grew up listening to a lot of Y2K era bands) 
I game casually (mostly the big Riot titles rn‚Äî pls don‚Äôt judge, I‚Äôm not competitive ). 
I love cooking and think friendly cook-offs are a fun activity with a friend. 
I‚Äôm into movies, shows, and anime ‚Äî some shonen, thrillers, rom-coms, and slice-of-life are my favorites. 

I‚Äôm 420-friendly, but only socially it‚Äôs fun to get a little stoned and laugh endlessly with good company. Not a dealbreaker

At my core, I‚Äôm an affectionate person who enjoys being around someone I can both laugh and be vulnerable with. If you‚Äôve been feeling that same quiet loneliness, maybe we can make this city feel a little less lonely‚Äî one warm cuddle at a time. üíõ

Lastly: I‚Äôm able to host usually, and definitely able to be hosted too. Definitely would like to meet publicly for a coffee or something before my first time hosting

Shoot me a message and let‚Äôs see how we flow from there :) maybe we can exchange face pics first ",1,1760558916.0,cuddlebuddies,1,1.0,False

In brief though, my first flare was never more than what I would call ""pinging"" in my lower left abdomen.  This was before I knew.  Through testing everything was ok except diverticulosis was discovered.  I'd say that resolved within a few months by eliminating foods, sticking to yogurt, saltines, and eventually went back to fiber cereal. This was all after a low fiber Atkins diet attempt.

Fast forward four years, approximately the week leading up to labor day I started having those familiar symptoms after a stint of low fiber, probably less than optimal hydration, stress, and ibuprofen.  I've learned now ibuprofen is a no-no for diverticulosis.  Anyways, I've experienced mostly twinges (pinging), sometimes cramping. The first week there were some rare jolts of quick discomfort.  I did a 3 day liquid diet.  From there just low fiber and safer foods - eggs, white toast, yogurt, crackers, occasionally avocado.  I've done that for weeks now.  I had a few days with no symptoms.  Stupidly, I drank coffee thinking I was in the clear and had a return of symptoms.  I went back to my safe foods; I finally got to about a 7 day stint with no symptoms.

Again dumb me, went back to no-holds barred eating whatever, and I had a relapse to symptoms again.  I'm seem to be learning the hard way.  I don't recall my first recovery phase taking this long, but I've read accounts of people taking 6-8 weeks and even one person who took 5 months.  I am understanding the colon never gets a rest from digestion and takes time to heal.  

At no point have I experienced fever, worsening of symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite.  I'd say more than anything my symptoms have been more annoying and nagging than anything.  My symptoms seem to improve with the dietary changes.  I don't have any other way to explain the improvement where no symptoms were experienced throughout the course of this.

Chapter I ‚Äì Ashes and Starlight

San Mungo‚Äôs always smelled faintly of mint and moonlight ‚Äî the kind of scent that clung to hope.
For weeks, Isabel Fairfax had lived in that smell.
She had memorized the rhythm of footsteps in the ward, the hum of healing charms, the sound of Sirius Black breathing in his sleep.
He‚Äôd been asleep for hours now.
The first real rest in years.
She sat beside him, fingers curled around a cup of tea gone cold, wandlight flickering low.
His face was pale but peaceful, his hair tangled, his expression softer than she remembered.
For so long, she‚Äôd pictured this moment ‚Äî the day he‚Äôd be free, alive, whole again.
And now that it was here, she didn‚Äôt know what to do with her hands.
So she did what she‚Äôd always done.
She stayed.

I. A Kind of Home
When he finally woke, it was morning ‚Äî soft, quiet, golden.
He blinked at the ceiling for a long time, as though uncertain if this was still a dream.
Then he turned his head, and there she was ‚Äî messy bun, ink stains on her fingers, half-asleep beside his bed.
‚ÄúYou stayed,‚Äù he murmured.
‚ÄúI told you I would.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou always say that.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd I always mean it.‚Äù
His voice cracked, but his smile didn‚Äôt.
She poured him water, hands trembling only slightly.
‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù
‚ÄúLike I‚Äôve forgotten how to exist.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou can learn again.‚Äù
For the first time in twelve years, he let someone touch his hand without flinching.

II. The Release
The day of his discharge came with nervous laughter and too many forms to sign.
Izzy fussed over his coat, adjusting the sleeves as if he were about to sit exams again.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that,‚Äù he said, smiling.
‚ÄúYou always left everything wrinkled,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúYou always nagged about it.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe were young. I was delusional. Now I‚Äôm older and right.‚Äù
He chuckled ‚Äî quietly, but real.
It sounded like forgiveness.
Dumbledore and Augustus Fairfax handled the final formalities, leaving Izzy to do what she did best: take care of what truly mattered.
When they stepped out into the cool London air, Sirius stopped for a moment.
The sunlight made him squint.
‚ÄúIt feels strange,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúWhat does?‚Äù
‚ÄúBeing in the world again.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll take it slow,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne breath at a time.‚Äù
He nodded. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù
‚ÄúHome.‚Äù
‚ÄúHome,‚Äù he repeated softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd forgotten what that word feels like.‚Äù

III. The Flat
Their flat above the old bakery still smelled faintly of cinnamon and dust.
The stairs creaked the same way; the brass doorknob was still loose; the window still let in too much cold.
Izzy had never changed any of it.
‚ÄúYou kept everything,‚Äù Sirius said, running a hand along the bookshelf.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the heart to move it.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou kept our records.‚Äù
‚ÄúEven the awful ones.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe awful ones were your taste, love.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou liked them.‚Äù
‚ÄúI liked you.‚Äù
Her laughter filled the little room like sunlight through rain.
He dropped onto the sofa ‚Äî their old, crooked one ‚Äî and sighed, sinking into the cushions as if rediscovering gravity.
‚ÄúMerlin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt even smells the same.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the bakery downstairs. And probably the cat that keeps sneaking in.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou adopted a cat?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe adopted me.‚Äù

IV. Nights of Healing
The first few nights were the hardest.
Sirius woke at odd hours, startled by noises, shadows, memories.
Izzy didn‚Äôt try to wake him from nightmares ‚Äî she just stayed close, whispering softly until his breathing slowed.
Sometimes she sat by his bed, reading quietly until dawn.
Sometimes, when her eyes grew heavy, she‚Äôd rest her head near his pillow, close enough to feel the warmth returning to him.
Once, half-dreaming, he reached out, fingers brushing her hair.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre real,‚Äù he murmured.
‚ÄúUnfortunately for you, yes.‚Äù
‚ÄúLucky for me, then.‚Äù
She smiled into the dark, heart aching in the sweetest way.

V. Morning Light
On the fifth morning, sunlight spilled across the room in lazy gold.
Sirius was still asleep, his breathing even, his face finally peaceful.
Izzy sat beside him, barefoot, tea in hand, watching the light catch the streaks of silver in his hair.
For a long time, she didn‚Äôt move.
She just existed there ‚Äî in that fragile, miraculous stillness ‚Äî and thought of everything they‚Äôd survived.
When he stirred, she leaned forward.
‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she said softly.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here.‚Äù
‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù
He smiled ‚Äî sleepy, unguarded, real.
‚ÄúYou should get some rest,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm resting,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúYou just happen to be the view.‚Äù
He laughed, low and warm, the kind that made her chest ache.
‚ÄúO never changed, Izzy.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course I did,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I kept the good parts.‚Äù
She reached out and brushed his hair from his face, fingertips trembling just slightly.

Chapter II ‚Äì The Weight of Quiet Things
(The Healer and the Hound ‚Äì Book I)
Rain tapped gently against the window.
The city outside moved in slow motion ‚Äî carriages, umbrellas, the faint whistle of the baker downstairs.
Inside, the flat smelled of tea and warm bread.
Sirius sat curled on the sofa, a blanket over his shoulders, his hair still damp from the shower.
Izzy stood by the stove, stirring a pot with quiet concentration.
For the first time in years, there was peace ‚Äî fragile, borrowed, but real.
Then came a soft knock.
‚ÄúYou expecting anyone?‚Äù Sirius asked.
‚ÄúOnly one person knocks like that,‚Äù Izzy said with a smile.
She opened the door, and there he was ‚Äî Remus Lupin, with his tired smile and rain-soaked coat.
‚ÄúYou took your time,‚Äù she teased.
‚ÄúHad to find a florist brave enough to sell me tea roses at this hour,‚Äù he said, holding out a small bundle.
Izzy laughed, warmth softening her face.
‚ÄúStill the gentleman.‚Äù
‚ÄúStill hopelessly out of touch,‚Äù he replied, stepping inside.

I. The Three of Them
The kettle hissed.
Tea was poured, bread sliced.
For a while, no one said much ‚Äî just the comforting hum of old friends existing in the same room again.
‚ÄúYou look better,‚Äù Remus said finally, studying Sirius.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a low bar,‚Äù Sirius replied.
‚ÄúAnd Izzy looks exhausted,‚Äù Remus added.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because she hasn‚Äôt slept in weeks,‚Äù Sirius said, without looking at her.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying,‚Äù Izzy muttered. ‚ÄúI sleep sometimes.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou nap sitting up,‚Äù Remus said, smiling softly. ‚ÄúYou always did.‚Äù
The easy rhythm of their banter filled the flat ‚Äî old patterns returning like familiar spells.
But beneath it all, something heavier waited.
When the laughter faded, Sirius looked up.
‚ÄúWe never really talked about that night,‚Äù he said quietly.
Izzy froze mid-motion, her spoon still in the air.
Remus glanced at her, silent.

II. The Night of the Attack
‚ÄúYou already know what happened,‚Äù she said softly.
‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Sirius replied. ‚ÄúBut I need to hear you say it.‚Äù
She exhaled, setting the spoon down.
The rain outside grew louder, as if the world wanted to listen too.
‚ÄúThey came for Augustus,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúThe Death Eaters knew he‚Äôd been working with MACUSA, passing safe passage lists for Muggle-born families. We‚Äôd been hiding a few at the house.‚Äù
Remus‚Äôs jaw tightened.
‚ÄúI remember the reports,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThey called it a targeted strike.‚Äù
Izzy nodded, eyes far away.
‚ÄúI was in the kitchen with mam√°. She was making coffee, humming. She never believed evil could find her through a locked door.‚Äù
Her voice faltered. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even bother to knock. Three of them. Masks, curses, fire‚Äî‚Äù
Sirius moved, but she lifted a hand.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI have to finish this.‚Äù
She swallowed hard.
‚ÄúI managed to protect Augustus ‚Äî he was upstairs. But mam√°‚Ä¶‚Äù
Her eyes glistened. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt magical. She didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. She told me not to be afraid, and then‚Äî‚Äù
The words broke. She pressed her lips together, steadying herself.
‚ÄúBy the time the Aurors arrived, she was gone. The house was ash. Two nights later, Lily and James‚Ä¶‚Äù
Remus‚Äôs eyes closed. Sirius stared into the fire.
‚ÄúI knew,‚Äù he said hoarsely. ‚ÄúDumbledore told me about the attack when I went to check on Peter. I was already half mad with fear.‚Äù
Izzy turned toward him, tears slipping free.
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt the only one.‚Äù

III. The Memory Shared
Remus rose, moving quietly to the cabinet. From his coat pocket, he drew a small, silver basin ‚Äî Dumbledore‚Äôs Pensieve.
‚ÄúHe told me to leave this with you,‚Äù Remus said softly. ‚ÄúIn case you ever needed to show instead of explain.‚Äù
Izzy hesitated.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve already relived it enough.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen let him see it,‚Äù Remus said gently. ‚ÄúOn your terms.‚Äù
She nodded.
Drawing her wand, she pressed it to her temple and drew out a single, silvery thread. It floated like smoke, landing in the basin.
Sirius leaned closer.
He saw her ‚Äî younger, desperate, holding her mother‚Äôs hand amid the firelight, whispering every healing charm she knew.
He saw Augustus crawling through debris, calling her name.
He saw her collapse when the Aurors pulled her out, her hair covered in soot, eyes wide and unseeing.
When the memory faded, the silence was sacred.
Sirius reached out, voice breaking.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYou lost them too.‚Äù
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were fighting your own war,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe all were.‚Äù
Remus looked away, pretending to adjust his cup. His eyes shone.

IV. Promises and Plans
Later, as the storm eased, they sat by the fire ‚Äî three survivors, all quieter now.
‚ÄúDumbledore said we have to wait,‚Äù Remus said softly.
‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù Sirius asked.
‚ÄúFor Harry.‚Äù
Izzy turned to him, brows furrowed.
‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt come live with us yet,‚Äù Remus explained. ‚ÄúThe blood protection needs time. As long as Lily‚Äôs sister‚Äôs alive, that charm holds.‚Äù
Sirius nodded slowly.
‚ÄúSo we wait.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe wait,‚Äù Izzy echoed.
Remus smiled faintly. ‚ÄúYou two have always been good at that.‚Äù
Sirius huffed a laugh.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be bad at waiting and good at keeping him safe.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou will be,‚Äù Izzy said. ‚ÄúWe both will.‚Äù
She reached for his hand.
Warm. Steady. Real.

V. The Night Feels Smaller
When Remus left, the flat returned to its quiet rhythm ‚Äî fire crackling, rain softening to mist.
Sirius stood by the window, watching the city breathe.
Izzy came up beside him, wrapping her shawl tighter around her shoulders.
‚ÄúYou should sleep,‚Äù she murmured.
‚ÄúI might, if you stay nearby.‚Äù
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt planning to leave.‚Äù
He turned to her then, eyes softer than she‚Äôd ever seen them.
‚ÄúYou never did.‚Äù
Her throat tightened. ‚ÄúYou remember that?‚Äù
‚ÄúI remember everything that matters.‚Äù
They stood in silence, the warmth between them brighter than the fire.
Outside, the last raindrops fell against the glass, whispering softly as if the world itself exhaled.
And for the first time in twelve years, the night didn‚Äôt feel endless.
‚òÄÔ∏è 
Chapter III ‚Äì A Cup of Sunlight
(The Healer and the Hound ‚Äì Book I)
It was strange, how quickly life began to find rhythm again.
The flat filled with sound: music from the old record player, the kettle hissing, laughter between half-finished cups of tea.
Sirius still had bad nights sometimes, but now the mornings belonged to laughter.
And every morning, like clockwork, the owl from St. Mungo‚Äôs would arrive with a letter addressed to Healer Fairfax-Black ‚Äî though she wasn‚Äôt married yet.
Not officially.
Not yet.

I. The Visits
Every other week, they met Dumbledore in a quiet corner of Diagon Alley ‚Äî always the same caf√©, always the same order: black tea for Izzy, coffee for Sirius, lemon biscuits for Dumbledore.
He‚Äôd bring news ‚Äî coded, gentle.
‚ÄúHarry is well,‚Äù he‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúGrowing. Curious. Kind.‚Äù
Izzy always asked the same thing.
‚ÄúDoes he laugh?‚Äù
‚ÄúOften,‚Äù Dumbledore would reply. ‚ÄúLouder than James, sometimes.‚Äù
And she‚Äôd breathe again.
They weren‚Äôt raising him, not yet, but they were there.
Invisible guardians at the edges of his world.
Whenever the wind shifted over Privet Drive, it carried a trace of their protective charms ‚Äî small spells of warmth and safety woven through the air.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough,‚Äù Sirius said once.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what we can do,‚Äù Izzy answered.
‚ÄúI hate that that‚Äôs true.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo do I,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut love is still magic, even from afar.‚Äù

II. The Gala
That spring, Augustus Fairfax was honored by the International Confederation of Wizards for his decades of diplomatic work between MACUSA and the British Ministry.
Izzy couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she‚Äôd seen her father smile so easily.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange,‚Äù Augustus said as they entered the marble hall, ‚Äúto be celebrated for surviving bureaucracy.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou also survived being blown up twice,‚Äù Sirius said. ‚ÄúThat should count for something.‚Äù
Izzy squeezed her father‚Äôs arm, her silver gown shimmering faintly with starlight charms.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTonight you get to be proud.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you get to be dazzling,‚Äù Augustus replied, smiling. ‚ÄúThough I think you‚Äôve made my poor colleagues nervous.‚Äù
The ballroom glittered ‚Äî chandeliers floating, orchestras tuning, Ministry officials whispering about ‚Äúthat Fairfax girl and her infamous fianc√©.‚Äù
And, of course, the Malfoys were there.
Lucius Malfoy looked exactly as ever: perfect hair, perfect sneer, perfect smugness.
He approached with the kind of grace that made Sirius mutter, ‚ÄúBrace yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúMrs. Fairfax,‚Äù Lucius drawled, eyes sweeping over her. ‚ÄúOr is it still Miss? One loses track with so many changes in‚Ä¶ alliances.‚Äù
Izzy smiled ‚Äî the kind of smile that meant danger.
‚ÄúStill Miss, technically. But don‚Äôt let that inspire hope.‚Äù
He chuckled, low and condescending.
‚ÄúHope? Hardly. Merely admiration. Some of us remember the charm you displayed last year. Pity it came with such a‚Ä¶ violent aftertaste.‚Äù
Sirius blinked. ‚ÄúAftertaste?‚Äù
Izzy turned to him, still smiling.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs referring to the time I slapped him at a Ministry function.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù Sirius asked.
‚ÄúOffered to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô my father‚Äôs case in exchange for my company.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were very polite about it,‚Äù Remus added from behind them, dry as ever.
‚ÄúI said thank you, then I slapped him.‚Äù
Lucius flushed pale silver.
‚ÄúSome people never learn grace.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd some people never learn boundaries,‚Äù Izzy said sweetly.
Sirius slipped an arm around her waist.
‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he murmured loud enough for Lucius to hear, ‚ÄúI love it when you commit mild assault at parties.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my heritage,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúMam√° would be proud.‚Äù
Remus choked on his drink.
Augustus looked both horrified and delighted.

III. After the Gala
Later, when the night had quieted and they returned home, Sirius poured two glasses of wine and set them on the table.
‚ÄúYou were magnificent tonight,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI was my father‚Äôs daughter.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou were you. And you were fire.‚Äù
She laughed softly, undoing her earrings.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt romanticize it. I nearly tripped on the stairs.‚Äù
‚ÄúEven your near-falls are graceful.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous.‚Äù
‚ÄúHopelessly.‚Äù
He stepped closer.
The air between them shimmered, the same old electricity they‚Äôd carried since seventh year.
‚ÄúIzzy,‚Äù he said quietly.
‚ÄúYes?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste another second pretending we have time to spare.‚Äù
She blinked, caught off guard.
‚ÄúYou mean‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI mean I‚Äôm tired of almosts. We‚Äôve done our waiting. I want to marry you. Not in six months, not after the Ministry quiets down. Now.‚Äù
Her eyes softened.
‚ÄúSirius, you don‚Äôt even have a tie that matches my patience.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll wear the blue one.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe one with the stain?‚Äù
‚ÄúExactly. To remind you who you‚Äôre marrying.‚Äù
She laughed ‚Äî the kind of laugh that sounded like the life they‚Äôd fought for.
‚ÄúYou really mean it.‚Äù
‚ÄúI really do.‚Äù
She set her wine aside and took his face in her hands.
‚ÄúThen say it properly, Black.‚Äù
‚ÄúMarry me, Fairfax. Before I die of good intentions.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do something wildly impractical.‚Äù

IV. The Wedding
They married three days later in the small walled garden behind the flat.
Remus stood as witness; Augustus walked his daughter down a path lit by floating candles.
Izzy wore a pale blue dress that caught the dawn light.
Sirius, miraculously, wore the blue tie ‚Äî clean this time.
No reporters, no Ministry, no grand speeches.
Just vows whispered under their breath, and a spell of warmth that shimmered like sunlight through leaves.
When the officiating witch sealed the bond, a flock of enchanted doves escaped from somewhere above ‚Äî Augustus‚Äô doing, undoubtedly.
‚ÄúSubtle,‚Äù Sirius muttered.
‚ÄúMy father has never been subtle,‚Äù Izzy said, laughing.
Afterward, they danced barefoot on the grass, music floating softly from the record player inside.
‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Sirius said, spinning her gently, ‚Äúif I‚Äôd known happiness looked like this, I‚Äôd have caused less chaos in my twenties.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have caused different chaos,‚Äù she replied.
‚ÄúTrue. But at least this time, I‚Äôd have you to bail me out.‚Äù
He smiled, that rare, quiet smile that meant he was at peace.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my home, Izzy.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre my impossible miracle.‚Äù
They kissed, soft and sure, as the morning spilled golden light across the city.
Chapter IV ‚Äì The Language of Ordinary Days
(The Healer and the Hound ‚Äì Book I)
Mornings came differently now, laced with a quiet fire that chased away the shadows of the past.
No more nightmares clawing at the edges of sleep. No more empty rooms echoing with ghosts.
Just sunlight spilling through the window like liquid gold, the rich, earthy smell of coffee brewing, and the sound of Sirius humming some half-remembered tune‚Äîa low, velvety rumble that wrapped around her heart like a lover‚Äôs embrace.
Izzy would pretend to still be asleep, her breath shallow and feigned, just to savor it longer, to let his voice seep into her bones.
Then he‚Äôd lean down, his warmth enveloping her, brush his lips against her temple‚Äîsoft, lingering, electric‚Äîand whisper, his breath hot against her skin,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terrible at pretending, love.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre terrible at being quiet,‚Äù she‚Äôd mumble, smiling into the pillow, her cheeks flushing with a heat that had nothing to do with the sun.
‚∏ª
I.  The Rituals
They built a rhythm out of small things, each one a spark in the slow-burning fire of their shared life:
tea leaves scattered on the counter like forgotten stars, shared books with dog-eared pages whispering secrets, mismatched socks drying by the fire, steaming and intimate.
When Sirius read the Prophet aloud, his voice dramatic and teasing, Izzy corrected every exaggeration with healer-precision, her laughter bubbling up like champagne.
When she came home late from the ward, exhausted but alive, he waited with dinner‚Äîusually edible, sometimes heroic, the scents of herbs and spice pulling her into his arms before words ever could.
They argued about spoons‚Äîplayful barbs that dissolved into giggles.
They kissed between sentences, lips brushing mid-thought, igniting little fires that spread through their veins.
They existed like people who had finally been allowed to exhale, their breaths mingling in the air, heavy with unspoken promises.
‚ÄúDo you ever get tired of peace?‚Äù she asked one night, her fingers tracing lazy circles on his chest, feeling the steady thunder of his heart.
‚ÄúNever,‚Äù he said, his eyes darkening with that familiar hunger. ‚ÄúBut I do get tired of not kissing you enough.‚Äù
He proved his point‚Äîsoftly at first, the kind of kiss that tasted like wine and laughter, his lips warm and insistent, drawing her in like gravity.
Then deeper, slower, his hands sliding up her back, pulling her flush against him until she had to hold the edge of the table just to stay grounded, her pulse racing, her body arching toward his in silent plea.
No rush, no fear. Just two people rediscovering how to breathe together, their sighs intertwining, the world narrowing to the heat between them.
‚∏ª
II.  Letters and Laughter
Dumbledore‚Äôs owls still came every fortnight with brief notes, feathers ruffled and eyes wise:
Harry healthy, growing fast, still insists on climbing furniture‚Äîlike a miniature Marauder in the making.
They read them over breakfast, smiling like parents who hadn‚Äôt yet been allowed to claim the title, their eyes misty with a joy so profound it ached.
Sometimes Sirius would charm the parchment so the words shimmered gold, dancing like fireflies; Izzy would tuck each one inside a small wooden box marked For Someday, her fingers lingering on the lid as if sealing dreams inside.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have them all when he‚Äôs ready,‚Äù she said, her voice soft with longing.
‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll have gray hair and stories,‚Äù Sirius added, pulling her close, his lips grazing her ear.
‚ÄúYou already have both.‚Äù
‚ÄúRude.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrue.‚Äù
Their laughter filled the room, bright and unfiltered, a sound that healed old wounds with every echo.
‚∏ª
III.  The Evening Storm
That night a summer storm rolled through London, wild and untamed, mirroring the storm they‚Äôd once carried inside.
Thunder rattled the windows like a primal drum, and the lights flickered with every flash, casting shadows that danced like forbidden lovers.
Izzy lit candles, the warm glow painting her skin in gold, highlighting the curve of her neck, the spark in her eyes.
Sirius stood behind her, arms slipping around her waist, strong and possessive, chin resting on her shoulder, his stubble grazing her skin and sending shivers down her spine.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve survived wars,‚Äù she said, her voice a husky whisper amid the roar. ‚ÄúSurely we can survive bad weather.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, I intend to enjoy it,‚Äù he murmured, his lips brushing her earlobe, igniting a trail of fire that pooled low in her belly.
The rain hit harder, lashing the glass like a lover‚Äôs frantic knocks. She turned in his arms, the candlelight catching his smile‚Äîwicked, adoring, utterly hers.
The kiss that followed wasn‚Äôt careful‚Äîit was certain, devouring, a clash of lips and tongues that spoke of pent-up desires finally unleashed.
Years of fear, waiting, loss‚Äîall burned away in the heat of his mouth on hers, his hands roaming, claiming, until there was only warmth and rain and the faint, dizzy laughter of two people who‚Äôd found home in each other‚Äôs arms, bodies pressed together, hearts pounding in sync.
When the thunder finally faded, they stayed close, tangled and quiet, skin slick with sweat and rain-kissed air, listening to the city breathe again‚Äîand to each other, breaths ragged, souls entwined.
‚ÄúWe deserve ordinary days,‚Äù she whispered, her fingers tracing the scars on his back, reminders of battles won.
‚ÄúWe do,‚Äù he said, his voice rough with emotion. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll take a few extraordinary nights, too.‚Äù His eyes promised more, endless more.
‚∏ª
IV.  Morning After
The next day dawned clear, the storm‚Äôs fury spent, leaving the world washed clean and vibrant.
Sirius was in the kitchen, humming again, his hair wild and tousled from her fingers, his grin worse‚Äîboyish, seductive, utterly disarming.
‚ÄúTea or coffee?‚Äù he asked, his gaze lingering on her like a caress.
‚ÄúBoth,‚Äù she said, stepping into his space, her body still humming from the night. ‚ÄúWe earned it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù
He slid her mug across the table, kissed her forehead‚Äîtender, then not, stealing a deeper taste from her lips‚Äîand stole a bite of her toast, his teeth grazing her fingers playfully.
It was nothing grand‚Äîjust sunlight, tea, and the scent of someone you love lingering in every corner, wrapping around them like an unbreakable spell.
But to them, it was everything: a passion reborn in the ordinary, fierce and eternal, burning brighter with every shared glance, every stolen touch.

1o7le9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1o7le9k/so_my_exbest_friend_wanted_me_then_my_husband/,"So, my ex-best friend wanted me, then my husband‚Ä¶ then wanted to be me?","Hi. This is a throwaway. I‚Äôve never told this story to people who weren‚Äôt close friends and I think outside perspective would be interesting. Buckle up.

I (25F at the time) met Ash (39F) several years ago through a mutual online friend. I was in graduate school and working full-time, so I had very little energy or time to prioritize making friends. Our mutual friend connected us because she & I lived close together and shared similar interests. 

Ash was sweet, a little naive, but had a big heart. Her husband & mine both got along very well. They‚Äôd play games together while she & I went swimming, had coffee, etc. We‚Äôd all do weekly group dinners together with other friends. During the last hurricane, we regained power before most others & hosted a hot meal at our place for those who needed it, including them. In kind, I felt I could go to her & discuss my struggles without someone immediately overwhelming me with potential solutions. She was a good listener. 

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that she and her husband are polyamorous. My husband and I are ethically non-monogamous. They‚Äôve been polyamorous for quite a while & she‚Äôs had partners come and go. My husband and I were dipping our toes in and made it clear that we were selective with who we are involved with, clear communication among all parties is needed, and we thought she understood. 

One day, we were helping Ash & her husband move. I was in the car with her & her husband, while my husband was following them in his. She admits to me that she has feelings for me. However, I do not reciprocate. I just laugh a little and say, ‚ÄúAw, that‚Äôs really sweet,‚Äù - internally, I want to throw myself onto the highway. She shares in the awkward laughter, says, ‚ÄúI figured you didn‚Äôt feel the same‚Ä¶.‚Äù and the rest of the ride is awkward silence. I tell my husband about it later. He finds it kind of amusing, but we move on. 

Months pass. Ash and I are business as usual. I have a falling out with a mutual friend of ours. I feel he often speaks disrespectfully to myself and other friends, tells jokes at the expense of others, belittles them, etc. They tolerate it because they‚Äôve known him for over a decade and that‚Äôs ‚Äújust how he is‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to. Because of this, he left the Discord group we had & created a new one, but told neither my husband or I. It really wasn‚Äôt a secret. The same time we had a falling out, our mutual friends stopped answering messages or engaging with us. I can put one and one together. It didn‚Äôt really bother me a ton, because logically they were his friends first & normalized the way he spoke to others. I knew he was definitely dragging my name there. Considering Ash was part of their group, I asked her one day over message if she was in a new channel with him. She was indirect & said ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt spoken in some time.‚Äù I let it be. Later on when I ask her in person, she says she is in that group and didn‚Äôt want to say anything because she didn‚Äôt want to be in the middle. I told her that I‚Äôd never put her in that position. I‚Äôm fine with her being friends with people I don‚Äôt want to see eating at my table. I was just disappointed that she kinda lied. She apologized for ‚Äúbeing untruthful with her best friend‚Äù. 

More months pass and Ash is struggling quite a bit with self-esteem and men who she plans dates with ghosting her. She talks about all the apps she‚Äôs tried, the men who never message back, and I can tell that her confidence is taking a hit. She‚Äôs wondering what she‚Äôs doing wrong. My husband posts some selfies online. She‚Äôs met him plenty at this point, hung with us in group settings, but really never engages 1 on 1 with him. So, you can imagine my surprise when he tells me that she tried to ‚Äúhit him up‚Äù and insinuate a date. He showed me the messages and all. I was a little taken aback, especially because she told me that she often felt intimidated by him & never really spoke to him, but I was her ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô. He kind of let her down gently & they joked around. I said nothing to her and let it be. 

Some time later, she meets a guy she‚Äôs getting along with and introduces us. He‚Äôs alright. He messages me directly to get to know me, we make small talk. He‚Äôs new to the area, so I discuss some places they could go together. I let her know he messaged me, and all seems well. However, they end up not working out. She goes through another depressive cycle and wonders what she did wrong. 

Around this time, my husband & I are involved with another couple. They are the only ones we were involved with for a long time. We all hang together weekly, play card games together, go to concerts together, spoil his ex-wife‚Äôs kiddo around holidays, that kinda thing. She begins chatting with them. His wife doesn‚Äôt really seem interested in getting to know her. Which, is fine. She begins to message him directly. You can imagine where this is going by now. He updates us throughout the weeks. At first, it was small and friendly talk. However, he told us she was constantly messaging him even if he didn‚Äôt respond. If he didn‚Äôt reply, she‚Äôd ask if he was mad at her and apologize for no reason. Bombard him with messages. Began wanting to exchange explicit pictures with him, but he didn‚Äôt really engage in it. He stopped opening her messages altogether when they approached ‚Äúsorry for being clingy,‚Äù ‚Äúam I clingy?‚Äù territory. Again, this entire time, I‚Äôd have been totally oblivious this was going on with my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù, had I not been told by someone else. His wife and I joked about how weird it was that she went after me, then my husband, and then the only other guy I‚Äôm involved with. She told me she wasn‚Äôt interested in being friends with her because her ‚Äúvibes were weird‚Äù, but supported my individual friendship with her. Again, I said nothing to Ash and let it be. 

More time passes. Things begin to get‚Ä¶ weird. She‚Äôs still having troubles finding someone. Don‚Äôt know the specifics. I begin to notice things, and so do my friends. 

It began small. When I told our group that I made plans to get my tubes tied, which is a very intimate procedure, she wanted to know the doctor I would be seeing because she wanted the same one. No, I don‚Äôt know what her insurance looked like. She also asked me who my primary care doctor was, because she needed a new one and wanted someone with good recommendations. I‚Äôve been seeing mine for 15 years and have moved around a lot, but because I love him, I endure the 35 minute drive to see him. She told me she‚Äôd love to make an appointment with him despite him being so far from us. She began asking me where I buy my clothes, what lipstick I use, the shade, what my skincare routine is. I once colored my hair a dark cherry cola and the next day, she sends a picture to our group of hers being colored similar. Her aesthetic quickly changed from pink & bright to, well, mine. Which is fine. But all of these things all so close together were a little.. jarring. She‚Äôd been working on losing weight with Weight Watchers and kept saying she wanted to be ‚Äúmy size‚Äù, or would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be your size in a year,‚Äù. I got my chest pierced and despite having really no piercings, she voiced a desire for the same piercings very soon. 

One day, I sat down with my close friends and their mother (who is like one to me) and told her I was getting worried. All of this was feeling weird. I watched her jaw drop further and further as I continued. She told me I needed to strongly consider distancing myself or ending the friendship because this would not get any better. However, I again gave Ash the benefit of the doubt. Until I couldn‚Äôt. 

Her language & how she treated me began to change. This started innocently enough. I would post a selfie in the group, and she would post one or two right after. Within 30 minutes without fail every time. I posted one captioned ‚Äúbad girls do it better,‚Äù because I was listening to ‚ÄúBad Girls‚Äù by MIA at the time. She posted one immediately after of herself posted up with a guy grabbing her chest, captioned ‚ÄúBut good girls get treats,‚Äù. On a separate occasion days later, I posted a selfie and mentioned how I looked tired, but was excited to dress up and ‚Äúget gorgeous for the club tomorrow,‚Äù. She posted one after saying, ‚ÄúDressed up for dinner tonight to look gorgeous as always,‚Äù. When this started, my husband and some others in the chat voiced their concerns to me. What she was doing now seemed apparent to them. 

I realized I needed to draw boundaries and address things with her, but didn‚Äôt quite know how or where to begin. I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt for so long, but felt in over my head. I decided I‚Äôd create some distance temporarily, then work out how to address it moving forward. I would also be going to the club & wanted to fully disconnect and enjoy myself without this on my mind. So I did. During this time, my replies to her were short, or infrequent. Photos were posted of the night out. It was my husband & I plus some people we were ‚Äúinvolved with‚Äù. The next day, she asked me who those people were from the photos posted on social media. I was vague, and just said ‚Äúsome friends,‚Äù.  Her response was, ‚Äúoh‚Äù. She later asked me, I guess because of that and my scant replies, if I was upset. This is where things blew up. 

I told her that honestly, I had things on my mind and that if I brought them up, I was certain one of us or both would be hurt or angry. That there would be no ‚Äúgood ending‚Äù. She asked me to tell her, so I did. 

I laid it out. I gave her a huge list. Probably overwhelmingly so. I started with the first lie she told, all the way up to her recent actions. The disrespect of it all. She asked for 24 hours to ‚Äúthink about it,‚Äù and I told her there was no rush at all. The next day, she tells me that she doesn‚Äôt know what to say. That she thinks I have a misunderstanding of ‚Äúpoly dynamics‚Äù in reference to her hitting up the men (which, again, I just wish she communicated it. I was led to assume she understood the importance of simple communication). That her asking me about all my stuff, from doctors to skincare, was ‚Äúnormal girl stuff‚Äù. And, that the ‚Äúsnarky‚Äù remarks she made in our group chat ‚Äúmake it hard to understand being silly over message‚Äù. She basically dismissed every concern of mine or had an excuse. In response, I told her that‚Äôs untrue. I‚Äôve had plenty of female friends who do nothing like what she has. I told her that if she‚Äôs the self-proclaimed ‚Äúempath‚Äù she always talked about being, she would consider how her actions could hurt someone she called a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù before executing them. That she‚Äôs no empath in my eyes. That I didn‚Äôt appreciate her defending and deflecting as a first response to my concerns. I indicated I wanted to end our friendship, requested she not contact my husband or I, and blocked her. 

Well, after this, I left several groups of hers and chats that she was in. My husband didn‚Äôt have the chance to until later since he was driving. But he showed me that after I left, she was saying to everyone, including mutuals, ‚ÄúFinally got rid of this toxic awful friend I‚Äôve been dealing with,‚Äù. Meanwhile, I was over here telling our friends, ‚ÄúOur friendship ended, it was a rough discussion. Out of respect for her, I‚Äôd rather not discuss it and apologize if I‚Äôm a little moody,‚Äù. Imagine my anger finding out that after all this, I was still giving her grace and she was dragging my name in the mud for the crime of standing up for myself. 

Regrettably, I took her petty to another level. Messaged her on Instagram and told her that how we‚Äôre handling this in spaces with shared mutual friends is a funny representation of our entire friendship. Told her I‚Äôd happily share screenshots of the grace I was showing in contrast to her ugly. That while she‚Äôs taking pages out of my book, she should stop taking selfies and NSFW photos with piles of trash and toilet paper in the background. All she said was, ‚ÄúNo thank you,‚Äù before blocking me. So, yeah. 

After that, she has continued to post quite a bit about it on social media. About ‚Äútrying to heal from a traumatic friendship and she needs some time to adjust,‚Äù and about, ‚Äúsurrounding herself with people who love her,‚Äù. She shares a lot of posts from pages about getting over narcissists and toxic people. This all went down six months ago & she still does it, even mentioning me by name in one she shared a few days ago. Our mutual friends all unfriended me and quietly removed themselves from me after she ranted and raved to them about how toxic I was, but probably never bothered to share anything about what got us to that point anyways. I wish we could have just done this quietly and peacefully, but she wanted to initiate a smear campaign for some reason.

I‚Äôve always wanted to drop the screenshots to everyone and see how whatever version of the story she told them stacks up. But I realized that if they were so willing to blindly believe her about how awful and terrible I was, and cast me aside, without even talking to me, they probably already thought that way about me. I don‚Äôt owe ‚Äúproof‚Äù that I wasn‚Äôt the only bad guy to anyone. 

I think the lack of closure is the really shitty part of this all. Was she even aware of how toxic she was being? Were others? Was this intentional? Why did she prioritize defending & deflecting over simply validating my emotions? And why is she still talking about it six months later on social media? ",3,1760558226.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

1o7lblg,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1o7lblg/sunday_diy_wedding_recap_warning_its_a_long_one/,Sunday DIY Wedding Recap (Warning: It's a long one and there's no TLDR),"We did it! My husband(!) and I got married on Sunday in the Portland, ME area. It was about as perfect as we could have hoped for and the ceremony was everything I dreamed it would be. Honestly I‚Äôm shocked that it went as smoothly as it did. We both have serious ADHD so it‚Äôs a small miracle that we were able to get it all done on time and under budget. Thank the gods for our friends and family, it was very much a group effort and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without all of them. We have been thanking people nonstop for the last two days. Since I‚Äôve been lurking on this subreddit for the last 8 months I wanted to do a write-up to help future couples that want a smaller (60 guests), very non-traditional, mostly DIY wedding.

When we first got engaged we set the expectation that as long as the paperwork was legal and all of our guests went home happy and well-fed it‚Äôd be a success. We also went in with the mindset of ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre stressing about it‚Äôs probably not worth it.‚Äù We expected at least a few things to not go according to plan and decided in advance to just roll with whatever happened instead of driving ourselves crazy trying to make it ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù

The ceremony was at his mom‚Äôs house. They have a cute little gazebo overlooking a duck/turtle pond. His mom got married in the same spot last year and part way through her ceremony I leaned over to my partner and whispered I‚Äôd kind of like to get married there when he eventually proposed. While I was willing to go with a different location if necessary, I‚Äôm so glad we were able to make it work because it made our ceremony that much more meaningful.

Our original plan was to have the reception at his mom‚Äôs house as well but after talking it over we decided that having the ceremony there was already stressful enough. The logistics of even a simple backyard reception was more money and effort than it was worth. We ended up renting a small event space in the Old Port, about a 30 minute drive from his mom‚Äôs. I always swore I‚Äôd have my ceremony and reception at the same location instead of splitting them up but it all worked out in the end.

It was a cocktail style reception with buffet stations of things like sliders, savory tartlets, kebabs, stuffed mushrooms, and a hot cocoa bar. We had a few reasons for doing it this way. One was that we had board games instead of dancing. I know some people on here hate that but it‚Äôs a very ‚Äúknow your crowd‚Äù situation. Not many of our guests are into dancing and most of them love games. Small plates made it easier for people to grab a snack in between rounds of games. We also had a lot of guests who are picky eaters or had dietary restrictions so we felt this was a good way to accommodate everyone.¬†

**Things that went well**

1. *The weather was perfect*. A lot of guests were worried that the Nor‚ÄôEaster blowing in would rain out the ceremony. I‚Äôd been tracking every pressure front from Canada and every tropical depression across the Atlantic for the last month so I was confident we‚Äôd be fine. The sun was shining all through the ceremony and it was the perfect temperature that no one was sweating through their suit or freezing in their dress. Clouds rolled in later in the afternoon but we were all inside at the reception at that point so it didn‚Äôt matter.
2. *Pre-ceremony coffee and pastries were a hit.* This is probably the best decision we made. Our ceremony was at 11am and the first round of food at the reception was put out around 1pm. So it was partly bribery to make sure guests showed up on time and partly to make sure we didn‚Äôt commit the cardinal sin of not feeding our guests over what would normally be lunch time. Apparently my MIL was concerned we had ordered too much but it ended up being just the right amount. Everything leftover after the ceremony was brought over to the reception. After it was over we only had 6 pastries left.¬†
3. *Timing for everything was spot on, despite everyone but me running late.* I planned for everything except the ceremony itself to take 15-20 minutes longer than anticipated. My husband has really bad time blindness and gets easily distracted talking to people so I knew even with multiple people reminding him of the schedule he‚Äôd still be behind. I also knew that getting any sized group of people to a designated location would take some time. I don‚Äôt know what time the ceremony actually started but by the time we wrapped up, did the family photos, and signed the paperwork we were right on time for the reception.
4. *The flower girl was adorable, everyone commented on how well behaved she and her brother were.* My 6 year old niece was so happy to be the flower girl. A couple weeks ago her 8 year old brother decided to give her a hair cut. She went from waist length to chin length hair faster than you can say ‚Äúscissors.‚Äù My sister was worried I‚Äôd be upset but I was just happy that she could be a part of our day. At the reception they were just happy to spend time with their aunt and munch on cupcakes.
5. *Short cocktail reception.* I was a little worried people would be disappointed that we didn‚Äôt have dancing or a plated meal, despite making it clear on our website that would be the case. Most of our guests were from out of town, with anywhere from a two hour to an eight hour drive home. Also, most of our friends are neurodivergent introverts so a wedding would be particularly draining for them. The official end time for the reception was 6pm but we anticipated most people would leave shortly after the cake cutting. We made a point of telling people that we wouldn‚Äôt be offended if they pulled an Irish goodbye before cake. By 4:30 we only had a handful of people left. They volunteered to assist with clean up and helped us carry everything back to our hotel room, which was right across the street. I know a lot of brides tend to get upset when people don‚Äôt stay until the end but I‚Äôd rather they leave early and happy than stay late and be miserable/burned out.¬†
6. *Doing a handfasting*. I was raised as Wiccan and while I no longer practice I still wanted to honor that part of my life. My husband is a ‚Äúdevout agnostic‚Äù so once I explained what it was and how it would go he was on board. We kept it simple and practiced tying the knot with our officiant. It went very smoothly and helped make the ceremony perfect.
7. *Writing our own vows*. I wasn‚Äôt too keen on this initially since I tend to stutter and trip over words. Even at the best of times it takes a lot of focus for me to slow down and speak clearly. I‚Äôd suggested private vows during our first look and then scripted vows at the ceremony but he really wanted us to do our own in front of everyone. Despite being nervous we both did great. He made the right call on this one.
8. *Our guests.* I initially only wanted a maximum of 30 people at our wedding, limiting it to only immediate family and closest friends. My husband has a bigger social circle than me and wanted to use this as an opportunity to hang out with people he doesn‚Äôt get to see as often as he‚Äôd like. He also wanted to introduce our diverse friend groups to each other. In the end we had about 60 which was the perfect amount. It was quite the mix of people and seeing people who have known us at different points in our lives get together and swap stories was really fun.¬†
9. *Keeping it local and sustainable.* This was one of our biggest priorities from the outset. We‚Äôre staunch anti-capitalists and didn‚Äôt want to give in to the wedding industrial complex more than absolutely necessary. We knew that would make the wedding more expensive but we love Portland and wanted to make sure that the money we were spending stayed in the community. Getting to work directly with small businesses and seeing them get excited to make our visions come to life was worth every extra penny.

**Things that didn‚Äôt go according to plan**

1. *Didn‚Äôt delegate someone to queue up the reception playlist.* We spent hours curating a playlist for the reception and asked everyone for song requests but totally forgot to give the venue instructions on how to set it up. Someone hooked up generic instrumental background music so there wasn‚Äôt silence. While I‚Äôm a little bummed our guests didn‚Äôt get to hear their songs I‚Äôm still glad we have a playlist that reminds us of all our loved ones. We‚Äôre thinking of including the Spotify link in our thank you cards.
2. *Didn‚Äôt put out guest book instructions or photo sharing QR code.* This was another thing that was forgotten in the rush to get everything set up. I‚Äôm less bothered by this than the playlist. My husband suggested we also include the QR code for photo sharing in our thank you cards.
3. *Didn‚Äôt do puzzle boxes or prizes like we planned.* This was my husband‚Äôs idea. He loves puzzle boxes and thought it would be fun to have some out on the tables with gift cards to our favorite local shops inside. They didn‚Äôt end up getting used but he said he‚Äôll give them to people later on.¬†

**Things we should have done differently**

1. *Not hiring a coordinator.* We did pretty much everything ourselves, with **a ton** of help from my SIL. Seriously, I think we owe her a Switch 2 for Christmas. I don‚Äôt know why we never even considered hiring one but we really should have. Maybe we were worried our plans were too non-traditional and weird? We managed to pull it off but it was a lot of work, time, and stress. Do yourselves a favor and hire a coordinator.
2. *DIYing the flowers.* My SIL did the flowers for her mom‚Äôs wedding last year and she did such a great job with just some wildflowers she had picked that morning. When we got engaged I asked if she would help me with my flowers. The plan was that I‚Äôd pick them up from the farm-stand on Friday and then we‚Äôd assembled the arrangements together. I ended up having so much other stuff to do that she was stuck doing it herself. She did a beautiful job but I really feel like an asshole for putting that on her. In hindsight I should have just gotten a bouquet at Trader Joe‚Äôs and called it a day.¬†
3. *Not having ceremony chairs.* Before you all jump down my throat please know I tried so hard to convince my husband not having chairs at the ceremony would be a huge mistake. Everyone stood at his mom‚Äôs wedding so he didn‚Äôt see why it would be a big deal if we didn‚Äôt have chairs. It wasn‚Äôt until the day before at the rehearsal when my dad said something that he realized how bad he screwed up. He apologized for being so obstinate and promised to make it clear the blame lies with him if anyone comments on it. I‚Äôm still not sure why he was so opposed to getting chairs considering in every other aspect of life his priority is making sure other people are cared for.

**Things that surprised us**

1. *Nobody no-showed.* One couple cancelled at the last minute because they caught COVID and another couple had two unexpected deaths in the family so they stayed for the ceremony but not the reception. We told them that we‚Äôd miss having them there but were glad they put their health and well-being first. It also allowed us to extend some last minute invites to people on our B list.¬†
2. *Our conservative parents behaved.* A lot of our friends are LGBTQ+ and/or BIPOC and we weren‚Äôt sure how much of an issue it would be since my dad is homophobic, my mom is racist, and his dad is an ex-cop. We warned our friends ahead of time and let them know we‚Äôd have their backs if anyone said or did anything to make them feel unwelcome. Thankfully it wasn‚Äôt an issue. To our knowledge our families mostly kept to themselves and didn‚Äôt say anything inappropriate.
3. *People respected our ‚Äúno gifts‚Äù policy.* We were very clear that we didn‚Äôt want any gifts. Time, money, and energy are in short supply these days and we knew that asking people to drive to Portland on a holiday weekend during peak wedding and leaf peeping season was already a huge ask. If people insisted on giving us something we requested cash/check/etc. Only 3 people got us presents and fewer than a dozen people gave us cards with money in them. That was still more than we expected from people and we are thankful to each one of them.¬†

**Conclusion**

Wedding planning is hard and it‚Äôs stressful. Even keeping it as laid back as we did there were moments of frustration, but we worked through it together. I‚Äôm very lucky that my husband took an active role in planning the wedding. Pretty much every aspect of the wedding from vendors to decor we made as a team. It really confirmed that we were making the right choice in marrying each other. If we could handle this without any major arguments we can handle just about anything.¬†

Our wedding was also very much a community event. His mom and step-dad let us use their property, his sister did the flowers, our roommate made our cake, and his oldest friend was our officiant. The only professionals we hired were the caterer and the photographer because those jobs were too big and too important to leave up to anyone else. We knew we were asking a lot of people and did our best to keep it as simple as possible and make it clear that they could tell us if it became too much. My biggest concern was that we were asking too much of people, especially with the set up and take down. More than one person had to pull me aside and remind me that everyone who was there helping was doing it because they wanted to out of love for my husband and I.

Seeing everyone we love gathered together to celebrate with us, and working to help make our wedding as successful as it was filled me with so much joy. I was overwhelmed by the amount of support we got from everyone and feel like I can‚Äôt thank them enough for all that they did. I‚Äôve never felt more loved than I did on my wedding day. Not just from my husband but from our families and our friends. During the ceremony, especially as my dad and I walked down the aisle, I had to remind myself to focus on my husband because I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at all the people that showed up for us.¬†

I‚Äôm planning my wedding and considering having a coffee cocktail station because the venue is in a region known for its amazing coffee. I‚Äôm torn on timing and would love your thoughts/experiences.

The plan is to serve espresso martinis and a coffee rum mojito-style cocktail. My ideas for timing:

- Just during cocktail hour and dessert after dinner.

- Or keep it going through the night until around midnight (the venue lets us stay until 3am).

I personally love coffee cocktails and think it could be a fun pick-me-up for guests, especially since our wedding will go into the early morning. But I‚Äôm unsure if people actually continue drinking these types of cocktails later at night.

For context, there will also be a regular bar with standard cocktails, beer, and liquor.

So I‚Äôm curious:

- If you‚Äôve had coffee cocktails at your wedding, what was the timing and how did it go?

- As a guest, would you enjoy having espresso martinis or similar drinks available late into the night, or think you‚Äôd only grab them during dessert/cocktail hour?

Thanks in advance for any insight!

Tell people you love them. Apologize when you should. Forgive. Everything in life has an expiration date. Opportunities don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre ready. Miss them now and you miss them forever.

But what does ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wait‚Äù actually look like day-to-day? 

1. Say the words.
Too many feelings sit in our chests because we‚Äôre waiting for the ‚Äúright‚Äù moment. There is rarely a perfect moment. If someone matters to you, tell them. Not tomorrow. Not when you‚Äôve rehearsed it perfectly. Speak it plainly: ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI appreciate you,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou inspired me today.‚Äù Small admissions change relationships, and big admissions change lives.

2. Take the leap.
That idea that keeps whispering in your ear? The one that feels both terrifying and thrilling? Try a small experiment. Commit 30 days to it. Book a single meeting, buy the domain, sign up for the class. Movement reduces fear. Action creates clarity.

3. Apologize when you should.
Pride is costly. An honest apology is short, genuine, and immediate: acknowledge what you did, name how it affected the other person, and offer to make it right. Don‚Äôt wait for the other person to demand it ‚Äî that only prolongs the wound.

4. Forgive to unshackle yourself.
Forgiveness isn‚Äôt for the person who hurt you; it‚Äôs for your peace. It doesn‚Äôt mean excusing bad behavior. It means you choose not to carry that resentment as ballast. Practice it: write (and then destroy) a letter you don‚Äôt send. Release the story that keeps you stuck.

5. Treat chances like perishable goods.
Opportunities ‚Äî jobs, conversations, travel, mentorship ‚Äî have windows. The shelf life varies, but it exists. When you see a door that opens even a little, step through. If it closes, you learn faster and you‚Äôre still standing to find the next one.

6. Tiny habits that keep you from waiting

Set a 10-minute timer: spend it calling one person you‚Äôve been meaning to call.

If you feel fear, do one small thing that contradicts it. (Say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a coffee, submit a draft, hit send.)

Keep a ‚Äúsay it now‚Äù note on your phone ‚Äî three names you‚Äôll contact this week.

Maintain a ‚Äúforgive list‚Äù where you write down and release a grievance once a month.

7. Consequences aren‚Äôt dramatic ‚Äî they‚Äôre real.
Not taking chances doesn‚Äôt always produce fireworks. It quietly narrows your life: fewer stories, fewer relationships deepened, fewer ‚Äúremember when‚Äù moments. The regret of not trying often outlasts the discomfort of trying.

8. Courage is a muscle.
It grows with repetition. The more you speak, risk, apologize, and forgive, the less each act costs you emotionally. Start small, then scale. Celebrate the attempts, not just the outcomes.

Final note ‚Äî a short challenge:
Today, do one of these three things: tell someone you love them, apologize to someone you‚Äôve wronged, or send that idea into the world. Take a picture of the sent message or jot down how it felt. Repeat next week.

Don‚Äôt wait for a green light you may never get. Life hands out chances in imperfect windows ‚Äî lean forward, make noise, and live with fewer what-ifs.",2,1760557768.0,GetMotivatedMindset,0,1.0,False

Bronx Voice¬†

October 15, 2025



NEW YORK - If it feels like your money isn‚Äôt stretching as far as it used to, you‚Äôre not imagining things. Groceries cost more, rent keeps climbing, and even that morning coffee seems to have gotten pricier. That‚Äôs inflation at work ‚Äî the slow (and sometimes not-so-slow) rise in prices that quietly eats away at your purchasing power.

We‚Äôve all felt the pinch lately. Whether you‚Äôre trying to keep your family budget on track, save for a big goal, or just make ends meet, inflation can make it feel like you‚Äôre swimming against the current. The good news? You don‚Äôt have to just ride it out and hope for the best. There are smart, practical steps you can take right now to protect your finances and stay ahead of rising costs.

In this article, we‚Äôll walk through five simple but powerful strategies to help you deal with inflation ‚Äî from adjusting your budget and tackling debt, to making smarter investments and boosting your earning power. You don‚Äôt need a finance degree or a six-figure salary to make these work ‚Äî just a willingness to take a fresh look at how you manage your money.



Ready to stretch your dollars a little further and feel more in control again? Let‚Äôs dive in.



1. Rework Your Budget to Match New Realities



When prices go up, your old budget stops working ‚Äî plain and simple. What used to cover a week‚Äôs worth of groceries might only last five days now. And that ‚Äúextra‚Äù money you thought you had at the end of the month? It might have quietly disappeared into higher bills or fuel costs.

That‚Äôs why the first step in dealing with inflation is to revisit your budget. Think of it like giving your finances a health check-up. You don‚Äôt need to overhaul everything overnight, but you *do* need to make sure your money is being spent on what actually matters most right now.

Start by tracking your expenses for a month. It might sound tedious, but it‚Äôs eye-opening. Use a budgeting app like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or even a simple spreadsheet. Seeing where your cash is going ‚Äî every coffee, every subscription, every takeout order ‚Äî helps you spot leaks you didn‚Äôt know existed.

Next, separate your ‚Äúneeds‚Äù from your ‚Äúwants.‚Äù Needs are your essentials: rent or mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, healthcare. Wants are the nice-to-haves: streaming services, takeout dinners, impulse online buys. During inflation, it‚Äôs okay to press pause on some wants so your needs stay fully covered.

Also, adjust your budget categories to reflect reality. Maybe groceries need a little more room while entertainment gets trimmed. The goal isn‚Äôt to cut out fun entirely ‚Äî it‚Äôs to make sure you‚Äôre spending intentionally, not automatically.



And here‚Äôs a pro tip: build in a little buffer. Prices fluctuate, and having even a small cushion (say, 5‚Äì10% of your monthly spending) helps absorb surprises without blowing your whole plan.

Reworking your budget isn‚Äôt about restriction ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *control*. Once you know exactly where your money‚Äôs going, you‚Äôll feel less stressed and better prepared for whatever inflation throws your way next.



2. Pay Down High-Interest Debt

If there‚Äôs one thing inflation and rising interest rates *love* to do, it‚Äôs team up and make debt even more painful. When prices go up, central banks often raise interest rates to cool things down ‚Äî and that means credit cards, personal loans, and variable-rate debts suddenly start costing you more.



In other words, if you‚Äôre carrying high-interest debt right now, it‚Äôs time to make it a top priority.



Start by listing out all your debts ‚Äî how much you owe, what the interest rate is, and what the minimum payments are. Then, tackle the ones with the highest interest rates first. This is called the avalanche method, and it saves you the most money in the long run because you stop paying so much in interest.

If you‚Äôve got multiple balances, consider consolidating them into a lower-rate loan or transferring your credit card balance to a 0% promo card (just make sure you pay it off before the promo period ends!). Refinancing or locking in a fixed-rate loan can also protect you from future rate hikes.



And most importantly ‚Äî try not to take on new high-interest debt unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. Inflation makes everything pricier, but adding more monthly payments on top only makes it harder to keep up.



Think of it this way: every dollar you free up from interest payments is a dollar you can put toward something that actually benefits you ‚Äî like savings, investments, or even just breathing room in your budget.

So, before you look for new ways to grow your money, make sure you‚Äôre not letting high-interest debt quietly eat it away.¬†



Paying down debt might not feel exciting, but it‚Äôs one of the safest, smartest inflation-fighting moves you can make.



3. Invest in Inflation-Resilient Assets



Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî when inflation is high, just saving money in a regular bank account can feel like trying to hold water in your hands. Prices go up, but your savings don‚Äôt. Over time, the money sitting in your account actually *loses* buying power. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to look at investing as part of your inflation game plan.



Now, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to become a day trader or gamble your savings on risky bets. The key is to put your money into assets that tend to grow faster than inflation or at least keep pace with it.



Here are a few places to start:



* Stocks (or index funds): Over the long term, the stock market has historically outpaced inflation. If you‚Äôre not already investing, consider low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broader market. You don‚Äôt need to pick individual stocks ‚Äî the goal is steady growth over time.



* Real estate: Property values and rents often rise along with inflation, which makes real estate a solid hedge. Even if you‚Äôre not buying a home or investment property, you can look into REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) to get real estate exposure without needing to be a landlord.



* TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): These government bonds are designed specifically to protect against inflation. Their value adjusts with inflation, so your purchasing power stays more stable.



* Commodities and precious metals: Gold, silver, and even commodities like oil or agricultural products can sometimes rise when inflation does ‚Äî though they can be a bit more volatile.



Whatever you do, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is your best friend here. A balanced mix of investments helps smooth out the ups and downs while keeping your long-term goals in focus.





And remember: the worst time to make investment decisions is when you‚Äôre panicking. Inflation can make people rush into ‚Äúhot tips‚Äù or risky trends (crypto, meme stocks ‚Äî you name it), but slow and steady almost always wins the race.



The bottom line? Inflation may chip away at cash, but with the right investments, you can make your money work harder ‚Äî and protect your future purchasing power in the process.



4. Boost Your Earning Power



Cutting costs can only take you so far ‚Äî there‚Äôs a limit to how much you can save, but there‚Äôs *no limit* to how much you can earn. When prices are climbing, one of the best defenses against inflation is simply to make more money. Sounds easier said than done, right? But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî there are real, practical ways to do it.



Start by looking at your current job.

  
When was the last time you got a raise? If it‚Äôs been a while, inflation gives you a pretty solid reason to ask for one. Do a little research on what people in your role and industry are earning (websites like Glassdoor or Payscale can help), then make your case. Show how you‚Äôve added value or taken on more responsibility ‚Äî employers are often more open to adjustments when they see clear results.



If that‚Äôs not an option, it might be time to look for new opportunities. The job market is constantly shifting, and sometimes a move to a new company can mean a big pay bump.



Next, think about developing new skills ‚Äî especially ones that are in high demand. Digital skills, project management, trades, or data analysis can all open doors to higher-paying roles. There are tons of free or affordable courses online that can help you level up (sites like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Skillshare are great places to start).



And don‚Äôt forget about side hustles. Whether it‚Äôs freelancing, tutoring, selling products online, or even monetizing a hobby, extra income can go a long way toward cushioning the blow of rising prices.





Finally, consider passive income ‚Äî things like dividend-paying investments, rental income, or creating digital products that earn money over time. It takes effort to set up, but it can really pay off down the line.



Here‚Äôs the bottom line: You can only cut so much from your budget, but there‚Äôs no ceiling on your earning potential. Every new skill, project, or side gig you take on builds your financial resilience ‚Äî not just against inflation, but against whatever life throws your way.



5. Shop Smarter and Plan Ahead

When prices are climbing, every little bit of savings counts ‚Äî and the good news is, small changes in how you shop can add up faster than you‚Äôd think. You don‚Äôt have to start clipping coupons like it‚Äôs 1995 (unless you want to!), but being a little more strategic with your spending can go a long way toward beating inflation.

Start with the basics: buy in bulk when it makes sense. Non-perishables like rice, pasta, paper products, and canned goods are often cheaper per unit when you buy bigger packages.¬†



Just make sure you‚Äôre stocking up on things you actually use ‚Äî nobody needs a five-year supply of pickles.

Next, compare prices before you buy. With so many shopping apps and websites out there, it only takes a minute to check if that ‚Äúsale‚Äù is really a deal. Tools like Honey or Rakuten can help you find discounts or earn cashback automatically.



Loyalty programs and store rewards cards can also be a quiet source of savings if you use them strategically. If you shop somewhere often, those points and cashbacks can add up to free groceries or discounts over time.



And here‚Äôs a big one ‚Äî plan your meals. It sounds simple, but meal planning reduces waste, helps you shop only for what you need, and makes it easier to stick to your grocery budget. Fewer last-minute takeout runs mean more money stays in your pocket.



For big purchases ‚Äî like appliances, furniture, or tech ‚Äî wait it out if you can. Prices tend to fluctuate, and patience can pay off. Sign up for price alerts or wait for major sale periods like Black Friday or end-of-season clearance events.



Finally, think ahead. If you know prices are likely to rise on something you use regularly ‚Äî like fuel, pet food, or household items ‚Äî grab a little extra now while it‚Äôs still cheaper. Just be smart about storage and avoid overbuying perishable goods.



The key idea here is this: inflation doesn‚Äôt have to catch you off guard. A little planning and intentional shopping can help you stretch your dollars further and keep your financial stress in check.

We fade in to a shimmering, sleek futuristic smartphone screen, its surface so clean it could reflect a supermodel‚Äôs deepest insecurities. The camera, like a nosy digital ghost, zooms in on a social media app pulsating with electric blue and fiery orange hues, named ""BuzzByte U-Campus."" Notifications pinged, little digital gnats buzzing around a single, dominant topic. The top-trending hashtag wasn't about exams, or cafeteria food, or even the scandalous new campus couple. Oh no. This one was sizzling hotter than a solar flare gossip:

**#MieMieMustFall**

The digital finger scrolling through the feed paused, hovering over a profile picture so aggressively anonymous it practically screamed ""I have no life outside of this vendetta."" The user account name glared, capitalized and bold, like a neon sign of pure malice: u/M**√≠√©nal√≠aShouldDie!**

And below it, the mother of all venomous paragraphs, a screed so acidic it could melt steel, poured forth onto the pristine digital canvas. The post read like a love letter to hatred and petty jealousy incarnate, each word a venomous dart aimed squarely at M√≠√©nal√≠a:

u/M**√≠√©nal√≠aShouldDie! Posted:**

You know who I‚Äôm talking about. That girl who thinks she‚Äôs the queen of campus, prancing around like she owns every single one of us. She‚Äôs 5‚Äô6‚Äù of pure arrogance, with that short red hair‚Äîorange flamy highlights trailing down the back like she‚Äôs some kind of wannabe fire goddess, and those tacky neon pink bangs screaming for attention. Always got those stupid hairpins clipped in, like she‚Äôs fooling anyone into thinking she‚Äôs cute. Her magenta eyes practically glow against her dark brown skin, and she‚Äôs got those beauty marks‚Äîone above her lip, one under her eye‚Äîthat she probably thinks make her irresistible. And the way she dresses? Tight leggings or tights hugging her legs like she‚Äôs begging to be noticed, paired with those off-shoulder T-shirts or long sleeves plastered with dumb emojis and ironic crap. It‚Äôs a joke. I hate her. M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs a thief, a disgusting manipulator who doesn‚Äôt care who she hurts. Just last week, I caught her in the cafeteria, giggling like an idiot at my crush‚Äôs jokes‚Äîmy crush, the one I‚Äôve been in love with forever. She flipped her stupid hair and smirked at me, like she knew she‚Äôd won. She stole him, ripped him right out of my life, and now she‚Äôs got her claws in every good-looking guy on campus. She thinks she‚Äôs some goddess, but she‚Äôs nothing but a slimy, backstabbing snake. And her clothes? Always flaunting those legs in skin-tight leggings, acting like she‚Äôs some runway model. It‚Äôs pathetic‚Äîdesperate, even. I wish she‚Äôd just vanish. Pack her bags, leave campus, and never show her smug face again. The world would be so much better without her poisoning everything she touches. She‚Äôs a disease, a cancer spreading through this university, and someone needs to cut her out. I hope she sees this. I hope it burns her to read every word and realize she‚Äôs not untouchable. I hope she cries herself to sleep knowing how much we despise her. M√≠√©nal√≠a deserves every ounce of hate coming her way‚Äîevery single bit of it.

**INT. UNIVERSITY DORM - DYIALA'S ROOM - LATE MORNING**

The camera panned, or rather, gingerly tiptopped, over the neon-lit chaos of Dyiala's lavish dorm room. Designer clothes, flung with reckless abandon, lay in heaps like fallen fashionistas. Empty takeaway containers formed precarious towers on every available surface, and a single, deflated party balloon, emblazoned with ""Party Hard or Go Home,"" clung limply to the ceiling. The air itself reeked of expensive perfume trying (and failing) to mask the lingering scent of last night‚Äôs libations and existential regret.

A groan, deep and guttural, like a sleeping dragon attempting a karaoke rendition of a sad song, emanated from the luxurious, albeit slightly sticky, couch. **DYIALA**, a crumpled heap of silk pajamas and disheveled hair, began to stir.

**DYIALA:** (half-dead, voice rough like sandpaper) Ughhh... my spleen is hangovered. My brain feels like it‚Äôs trying to escape through my nostrils.

She stretched with the grace of a malfunctioning robot, her limbs protesting every twitch. Her eyes, still struggling to focus, landed on a neat, almost angelic, sight beside her. On the pristine white coffee table, a small, covered tray sat like a beacon of hope next to a familiar bottle of hangover medicine. With a grunt of curiosity, and a monumental effort, Dyiala reached out, her fingers fumbling before she lifted the cover.

Her eyes, still blurry, widened in genuine surprise. Beneath the lid lay a breakfast so fresh and artfully arranged it could have been a culinary masterpiece. Pancakes, shaped like smiling suns, stacked perfectly. Toast wore jaunty bacon scarves. A perfectly cooked omelet, fluffy and golden, sat beside a vibrant fruit salad arranged into a tiny, edible flower. And nestled beside the plate, a crisp, neatly folded note. Dyiala, still battling the remnants of last night‚Äôs revelry, carefully picked it up, her brow furrowing slightly as she began to read.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA'S NOTE:**

""Ah, my dormmate, the queen of the night, how you dey? Hope you dey alright? Na me be M√≠√©nal√≠a, your new dormmate. I suppose don show face earlier, like a proper good neighbor, but kasala burst!

With better love and small jollof, M√≠√©nal√≠a""

Dyiala‚Äôs lips curved into a soft, genuine smile as she finished reading the note. She hugged the letter to her chest, a pleasant warmth spreading through her lingering hangover haze.

**DYIALA:** (smiling softly, a genuine lightness in her voice) Yeah... she‚Äôs definitely gonna be fun. This M√≠√©nal√≠a, she's something else entirely.

**EXT. CAMPUS - DAYTIME**

Meanwhile, on the sun-drenched campus, **M√ç√âNAL√çA** strutted, a beacon of vibrant energy in her signature off-shoulder tee, its cheeky emoji design beaming. Her flamingo-level confidence was palpable, her short red hair, with its fiery orange highlights, seemed to dance with every confident stride. She hummed a little tune, blissfully unaware of the digital storm brewing.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (muttering to herself with sparkly eyes, a wide, innocent smile) Chai! Calv√©ri really get sense sha. Him help me set up my club last night even though sleep dey drag am like mad. The way he just knew where to find the best space, even helped me brainstorm names! I swear, dat guy na low-key sweet corn, always looking out for me. Thanks to him, now I can help so many students in the university with my new club, and my friends and I can manage it together. We can all decide the name together! Maybe ""The Vibe Tribe,"" or ""Gen Z Central""... so many options!

She continued humming, a picture of pure, unadulterated optimism. Until... the smiles around her began to warp. The ambient campus chatter, usually a comforting hum, began to coalesce into sharp, hostile whispers. Glares, heavy and cold, followed her every move. Students walking past would deliberately turn their heads, offering her the universal symbol of disdain: middle fingers raised with an almost ritualistic intensity. Verbal slaps, sharp and cutting, whizzed past her ears.

**RANDOM STUDENT 1:** (shouting, eyes narrowed) ""Get outta here, ho\*!""

**RANDOM STUDENT 2:** (voice dripping with malice) ""Go back to your sugar daddies! We don't want your type here!""

**RANDOM STUDENT 3:** (eyes wide with performative disgust) ""Why‚Äôs she walking like we won‚Äôt throw her out the next window?! She needs to vanish!""

M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs steps faltered. Her bright smile slowly, uncertainly, faded. She stopped dead in her tracks, confusion clouding her expressive magenta eyes.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (confused, patting her cheek, muttering to herself) Abeg, I get suya crumbs for face or wetin dey happen? My breakfast biscuit maybe drop on my cheek? Or did I forget to wipe my mouth after my morning tea? That‚Äôs probably it! It must be something silly like that!

Just then, her phone vibrated, then rang, its cheerful melody jarring against the sudden, hostile silence of the crowd. It was **HAUNNAH**, her best friend. M√≠√©nal√≠a, grateful for the distraction, quickly answered, holding the phone to her ear.

**HAUNNAH:** (on phone, her usual elegant French accent laced with an unmistakable edge of panic, her voice barely controlled) M√≠√©nal√≠a! *Mon amour!* Tu as vu ton t√©l√©phone?! Did you check anything? Don‚Äôt look at social media! *Pour l'amour de Dieu, ne regarde pas!* Come vite, vite! To my dorm, now! I‚Ä¶ I am hurt! It‚Äôs my leg! *Je suis bless√©e!*

M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs playful demeanor instantly vanished, replaced by a surge of raw, cold panic. Her mind, quick as lightning, flashed back to painful, recent memories: the bad people who had attacked her family, her brother also injured. The memory of his vulnerability, his pain, gripped her heart. ""Oh God, not again!"" she thought, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. The hostile glares around her suddenly felt insignificant compared to the fear for her friend.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (screams into the phone, her voice trembling with genuine terror) Ehh?! You too?? Haunnah, are you serious?! My brother dey injury list, now you too??! What happened?! Who hurt you?! I dey come sharp-sharp! Don't move! I‚Äôm running!

She bolted, the angry murmurs of the crowd fading behind her as she sprinted towards Haunnah‚Äôs dorm, a streak of red and worry.

**INT. HAUNNAH'S LUXURY DORM - MIDDAY**

Inside **Haunnah‚Äôs** luxurious, celebrity-fancy dorm, the air hung thick with the expensive, artificial scent of Versace No. 5 ‚Äì a fragrance trying desperately to mask the very real tension. Haunnah was pacing, a picture of restless elegance, her long blue hair swaying. Her leg, supposedly injured, was propped up on a velvet ottoman, an unnecessary ice pack gently resting on her perfectly sculpted calf. She kept glancing at the door, her beautiful face a mask of carefully constructed concern.

**HAUNNAH:** (to herself, her soft French tone imbued with a troubled whisper) *D√©sol√©*, M√≠√©nal√≠a... I truly am sorry for this deception. But if this gets worse, it won‚Äôt be just teasing or online gossip. She‚Äôll be destroyed. Her spirit, her dreams... Everything. I have to protect her, even if it means a little white lie. At least until I find the person who posted that hateful message. *Je dois la prot√©ger.*

Just then, a thunder of rapid footsteps echoed from the hallway outside. The ornate door, carved with intricate designs, flung open with such force it rattled on its hinges. In crashed **M√≠√©nal√≠a**, breathless and wide-eyed with panic, followed closely by **LUCA**, his brow furrowed with a mixture of concern and simmering fury. Luca, ever the dramatic protective younger brother, immediately began to shout, his voice carrying that endearing blend of sophisticated French and rough-around-the-edges countryside accent.

**LUCA:** (loud, eyes blazing with furious protectiveness) *Ma ch√®re s≈ìur!* Haunnah! Are you okay?! Tell me who dared touch you?! Tell me who did this to you! I swear, I will find them, and I will remove their ribs and fry them like *escargot*! *Je te jure!* They will regret the day they were born!

M√≠√©nal√≠a, seeing Haunnah and sensing the dramatic energy from Luca, instinctively stepped in, her usual playful nature returning, but with a dark, comedic twist.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (gasps, hands on her hips, shaking her head dramatically) No ooo! Luca, *haba*! We no dey do that type wahala again! We done pass that level of mere hand-to-hand combat, abeg!

(beat, then her eyes glinted with mischief, a wide, wicked grin spreading across her face)

...UNLESS we dey carry weapons join am! KNIVES! CHAINS! GBESEEEEE! We go use them do proper surgery on dem! Their body parts will just *disappear*!

Luca‚Äôs eyes, which had been narrowed in fury, suddenly lit up with a conspiratorial delight. He threw his hands into the air, a wide, matching grin splitting his face, perfectly aligning with M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs wonderfully unhinged energy.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA & LUCA:** (in unison, yelling with gleeful, exaggerated menace, high-fiving) YEEAAAAHHH!! We go show them pepper!

Haunnah, watching their ridiculous, bloodthirsty display, couldn't help but let out a soft, gentle chuckle. She loved their unpredictable chaos, but it was time to bring them back to reality. ""Oh, you two,"" she sighed playfully, a fond exasperation in her voice. She then put on her most convincing 'puppy eyes' for M√≠√©nal√≠a, forcing a tiny wince as if her leg pained her.

**HAUNNAH:** (with a delicate sigh, still French) Actually... my little warriors, I am okay. I simply twisted my ankle rather badly during my last modeling shoot. It is nothing so dramatic as ribs being fried. *Non, non, non!* But... there is a rather important modeling party tomorrow evening in XiaoZaizi, and because of this silly injury, I cannot go. My partner, she refuses to go without me. So... (she turned to M√≠√©nal√≠a, her eyes wide and pleading) ...will you two, M√≠√©nal√≠a and Luca, go in me and my partner's places? It would be a huge favor, *ch√©rie*. My social image... it relies on this event!

M√≠√©nal√≠a, ever empathetic and eager to help her friend, grabbed Haunnah‚Äôs hands warmly, her grip firm and reassuring. Her magenta eyes sparkled with loyal determination.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (her voice brimming with warmth and sparkling loyalty) No wahala at all, Haunnah! *Abeg!* Don't you worry your pretty head about anything. We got this! Luca and I will shine pass lights for you at this party, I promise! We go do our absolute best to go in both you and your partner's place. So you should just focus on recovering, okay? Get that leg healed up! *E go be!*

Haunnah, genuinely touched by M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs immediate and unwavering loyalty, felt a blush creep up her cheeks. *Elle est trop gentille... je ne la m√©rite pas.* She thought to herself, a pang of guilt mixed with profound gratitude. ""M√≠√©nal√≠a is so kind,"" she mused internally, ""She deserves better than a bunch of false rumors and lies circulating around her. She deserves all the good things in this world."" A genuine, soft smile finally touched Haunnah's lips.

**HAUNNAH:** (smiling warmly at M√≠√©nal√≠a) *Merci, ch√©rie.* I trust you completely. You will do great, I know it. Just be yourselves.

She then turned to Luca, her expression shifting to one of mock sternness, but a hint of playful mischief danced in her eyes.

**HAUNNAH:** (to Luca, wagging a finger playfully) And Luca, *mon fr√®re*, you better take good care of M√≠√©nal√≠a, or else... you should not come back! *Comprends?!*

Luca pouted, feigning indignation, though a tremor of excitement shot through him. ""Of course, I‚Äôm going to take good care of M√≠√©nal√≠a!"" he insisted, his voice a touch too loud, trying to sound nonchalant. As he said it, he turned his head, using the palm of his hand to cover his mouth, trying desperately to hide the blush that was blooming on his face, spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. It was a clear sign of some unspoken, blossoming affection stirring in his heart at the mention of him taking care of M√≠√©nal√≠a, just the two of them, traveling abroad. Alone. Together. The possibilities stretched out before him, vast and exhilarating.

**INT. HAUNNAH & LUCA‚ÄôS PRIVATE JET - NIGHT - IN THE AIR TO XIAOZAIZI**

Hours later, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues, **M√≠√©nal√≠a** and **Luca** were ensconced in the plush, ridiculously luxurious interior of Haunnah and Luca‚Äôs private jet. The sleek aircraft, a silver streak against the twilight, soared through the sky en route to XiaoZaizi, a country known for its vibrant culture, dazzling lights, and exclusive events.

They sat next to each other in ergonomic leather seats that molded perfectly to their bodies, the low hum of the powerful engines a soothing, distant murmur. Luca, who had been staring out the window at the distant, glittering clouds, slowly turned his head to face M√≠√©nal√≠a. A slight hesitancy touched his features, a vulnerability she rarely saw.

**LUCA:** (his voice quiet, almost shy, with a soft French lilt) *Petite fleur*... you knew I was doing music again, before University, *non*?

M√≠√©nal√≠a, who had been casually scrolling through her phone, looked up, genuinely confused.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** Music *ke*? Since when, biko? Last I checked, you were busy being a drama king!

Luca‚Äôs lips quirked into a small, knowing smile. He reached out, gently tapping her knee.

**LUCA:** Don‚Äôt act innocent, *ma belle*. You were the first to listen to my new song when I posted it. The first to like it. You always were. Even when I was a *petit gar√ßon* and used to just make noise with my toy guitar, you were my biggest fan.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (pouting, feigning innocence, crossing her arms stubbornly) *E fit be anybody!* The internet is big, Luca. Why do you think it's me? I listen to a lot of music! Maybe I just have good taste!

Luca‚Äôs smirk widened, a knowing glint in his light purple eyes. He leaned closer, his fingers gently touching her chin, tilting her face towards him until their eyes met.

**LUCA:** Because your username on the site where I post my songs is u/HotGirlMieWrites... and if my memory serves me right, that happens to be the same username on most of your social media accounts. *N'est-ce pas*?

M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs face instantly flushed crimson with embarrassment, the color spreading from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. She had been caught! Her attempts at denial felt flimsy now. But ever the playful arguer, she still tried to bluff her way out.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (swatting his hand away playfully, but still blushing furiously) See this FBI wannabe o! You dey monitor me! Are you a stalker, Luca?!¬† It's still not me! My twin sister, HotGirlMieWritesToo, must be doing it!

She then playfully patted his head, a gesture that spoke of deep sibling affection, and perhaps a touch of exasperated endearment. ""But no worry, my dear,"" she declared, her voice firm with mock authority, ""Even though you‚Äôre older now and trying to act all grown up, I go still dey babysit you like when you be small pikin. My duty as your older, wiser, and infinitely more chaotic 'big sister'!""

Luca, his eyes still holding hers, leaned his forehead gently against hers. His gaze was serious, intense, a vulnerable plea in their depths.

**LUCA:** (his voice low, soft, with that captivating French countryside tone) M√≠√©nal√≠a... what if I don't want you to see me as a kid anymore? What if I want you to see me as an actual man? A man who... sees you differently?

M√≠√©nal√≠a froze. Her breath hitched. She looked into his sincere, searching eyes, and for the first time, she saw no teasing, no playful banter, only raw, unadulterated seriousness. Her heart did a strange little flutter, a nervous butterfly in her chest. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. But then, almost instinctively, she pulled back slightly, her hand still on his head, and patted it again, a gentle, almost patronizing gesture that perfectly diffused the moment.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (her voice soft but firm, a teasing smile returning) Oh, Luca, you dey try sha! You‚Äôre such a good kid. And you're growing up into a very fine young man. Good boy. Oya go collect sweet. You want juice?

Luca, completely deflated, low-key folded his arms across his chest. He turned away from her, staring out the window with a grumpy pout, muttering under his breath. He clearly felt his very direct hint had been completely, utterly missed (lolüòÇ). He had tried. Oh, he had tried!

**EXT. XIAOZAIZI - DAY**

M√≠√©nal√≠a and Luca arrived in XiaoZaizi, a country that pulsed with an electric energy, a vibrant tapestry of ancient traditions and futuristic skylines. They were whisked away to a private, impossibly rich hotel, a palace of marble and gold, overlooking the glittering cityscape.

The next few hours were a blissful blur of pre-party preparations. We see scenes of Luca, surprisingly adept at fashion, accompanying M√≠√©nal√≠a to a high-end boutique. He helped her choose an exquisite dress for the modeling party ‚Äì a shimmering emerald gown that perfectly complemented her dark skin and fiery hair. They shopped, laughing as Luca gave surprisingly blunt fashion advice.

**LUCA:** (holding up a sequined monstrosity) *Non, non, non!* M√≠√©nal√≠a, this looks like a fish net that swallowed a disco ball. Your beauty, it deserves more!

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (giggling) My guy, you too harsh! But okay, I dey trust your fashion eye, oh!

Later, Luca, ever the attentive one, shyly asked her if she was hungry (which, of course, she was, *always* hungry after a shopping spree). They went to a charming eatery, indulging in savory XiaoZaizi street food and luxurious pastries, the conversation light and easy. They headed back to the hotel, and Luca, still a bit tired from the travel, decided to take a short nap before the party, opting for some much-needed rest.

A few hours passed. Luca stirred, waking from his nap, stretching lazily like a contented lion. He opened his eyes, blinked, then blinked again. The spot on the couch where M√≠√©nal√≠a had been sitting earlier, watching TV, was empty. M√≠√©nal√≠a was gone.

**EXT. XIAOZAIZI CITY STREETS - DAY (PRESENT)**

**M√ç√âNAL√çA** darted through the bustling, vibrant city streets of XiaoZaizi, her short red hair, with its fiery orange highlights, a literal streak of fire against the backdrop of modern skyscrapers and ancient temples. Behind her, the piercing, urgent wail of a XiaoZaizi police car siren cut through the urban symphony, officers in hot pursuit of a group of shadowy, fleeing crooks.

The scene abruptly freezes. M√≠√©nal√≠a, mid-drive, turns to the camera, a cheeky, almost mischievous grin playing on her lips, her magenta eyes sparkling.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (to audience, with a playful shrug, her Nigerian cadence evident) I know you're probably wondering what‚Äôs going on, *abi*? You're like, ""M√≠√©nal√≠a, *how you manage to get involved with police and criminals again*? My girl, *you sabi trouble sha*!"" Don't worry, my people, I'll take you back a few hours earlier. Everything will make sense, I promise!

**FLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY**

**REPLAY:** The scene shifts back in time, a soft ripple effect on the screen. It's M√≠√©nal√≠a in her opulent hotel room. Luca, bless his heart, is peacefully asleep on her massive bed, a faint, contented snore rumbling from him. M√≠√©nal√≠a, however, sits on the plush couch, aimlessly flipping through TV channels, bored out of her mind. The space cowboys show she found just wasn‚Äôt cutting it. The quiet of the room, broken only by Luca's soft snores, became too much. She craved fresh air, adventure, anything to spark her restless spirit.

She slipped out of the room, a stealthy shadow in the luxurious hotel, heading down to the hotel‚Äôs opulent lobby for some air. As she passed the main entrance, a snippet of conversation caught her ear. She overheard a taxi driver talking on his phone, his voice tinged with both exhaustion and a profound sadness. It sounded like his daughter on the other end, her voice small and hopeful, asking if he was coming home. The driver struggled, stammering that he had too many people to drive, too many requests to fulfill before he could go home. M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs keen eyes and sharp instincts picked up on the subtle clues in his voice, the way his shoulders slumped, the wistful tone ‚Äì it must be his daughter‚Äôs birthday.

M√≠√©nal√≠a, ever the spontaneous problem-solver and champion of good vibes, began to make a series of exaggerated faces and enthusiastic body movements, subtly urging him through gestures to say ""yes."" He looked at her, bewildered, then back at his phone, a flicker of hope in his eyes. He reluctantly agreed, his voice wavering, promising his daughter he was coming home.

M√≠√©nal√≠a, satisfied, stepped forward, a confident, dazzling smile on her face.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (her voice warm and reassuring, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes) Oga, go house abeg. No need to dey stress! Na today be your beautiful daughter's birthday, abi? Go and be with your family! I go drive the taxi for you. Consider it my good deed for the day!

The man looked at her, utterly bewildered, his mouth agape. ""You fit drive?"" he stammered, a flurry of questions tumbling out. ""Why? What's the catch? Are you even old enough? What about the car? Do you have a license? *Ehn*?""

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (waving off his concerns with a dismissive flick of her hand) My dear Oga, don‚Äôt you worry! Emotionally? I be F1 champion, I can drive anything! And physically? Let‚Äôs just say I passed my test with flying colors. I‚Äôve got this! You should take this opportunity and go be with your family. Your daughter deserves her father on her birthday, not a tired taxi driver. Go, before she blows out the candles without you! *Make una no waste time!*

She even pressed a wad of cash into his hand, a generous tip for his trouble and a bonus for his daughter‚Äôs celebration. He looked at the money, then at her, still stunned, but a grateful, relieved smile slowly spread across his face. He told her to take good care of the taxi car and that once she was done with all the requests, she should meet him back here at the hotel. With a final grateful nod, he dashed off, a spring in his step.

**MONTAGE: M√ç√âNAL√çA THE TAXI QUEEN**

**(I don't even know how or where girly learned how to drive lolüòÇ)**

The taxi, a surprisingly sleek sedan, sped through the vibrant, neon-lit streets of XiaoZaizi, driven by its most unexpected and charismatic new chauffeur. M√≠√©nal√≠a, behind the wheel, was an absolute natural. Her red hair, a fiery halo, bounced with every joyful turn. She chatted effortlessly with each passenger, her charisma a powerful, undeniable magnet.

* **Passenger 1 (Elderly Tourist):** An elderly woman with a prim hat and a tightly clutched, meticulously folded map. M√≠√©nal√≠a immediately sensed her nervousness. ""Auntie, welcome to XiaoZaizi! First time in this beautiful city? Don't worry, you are in safe hands! I'm like your personal tour guide on wheels, eh? Where we headed? I know all the hidden gems, the places the guidebooks don't tell you about, where the *jollof rice* hits different, even here in XiaoZaizi!"" The woman, initially stiff as a board, soon found herself chuckling, sharing delightful stories of her hometown, and even asking M√≠√©nal√≠a for personalized restaurant recommendations. She ended the ride with a warm hug and a generous tip.
* **Passenger 2 (Tired Businesswoman):** A stern-faced businesswoman, buried in her tablet, her shoulders practically screaming ""stressed."" M√≠√©nal√≠a noticed her tense posture. ""Madam, you look like you carry the weight of the world on your shoulders! Haba! Take a break, eh? My car, it's a chill zone, no work talk allowed! Tell me, what's your favorite comfort food? Or the silliest thing you did when you were my age? Let's talk about something that makes you smile, just for a few minutes, *abeg*!"" The businesswoman, initially reluctant and curt, slowly lowered her tablet, a small, genuine smile playing on her lips as M√≠√©nal√≠a regaled her with a hilariously exaggerated story about her first week at university and a run-in with a rogue squirrel.
* **Passenger 3 (Shy Student):** A young university student, headphones plastered to his ears, looking intensely shy and withdrawn. M√≠√©nal√≠a saw him fidgeting, avoiding eye contact. ""Hey, my guy! You dey listen to good music? Share the vibe! Or you got a big exam coming up? Don't worry, me too! We all dey pass through the struggle! What‚Äôs your major? Maybe I can give you some tips, or at least a good laugh to calm your nerves before you turn into a bundle of exam-induced anxiety!"" The student, initially unresponsive, eventually pulled off his headphones, hesitantly answering M√≠√©nal√≠a's questions, then finding himself engaged in a surprisingly lively discussion about campus life, the best study spots, and the absolute worst cafeteria food on offer.
* **Passenger 4 (The Mysterious Four):** M√≠√©nal√≠a, with her infectious energy, greeted them cheerfully. ""Una dey go costume party? Or abi na Avengers audition? Your outfits are *on point*, though! Very mysterious!"" She giggled. They simply handed her a card with their destination address, their faces impassive behind the masks. During the drive, they were strangely quiet, their bodies rigid, wary of her cheerful demeanor. M√≠√©nal√≠a, oblivious to their true nature, continued her attempts to lighten the mood. ""So, where are you all headed? Big party tonight, eh? Or maybe a super-secret society meeting? I won't tell! Are those masks comfortable? They look super cool, like something out of a spy movie! Do they make it hard to breathe?"" Her incessant chatter, laced with genuine curiosity, seemed to chip away at their collective silence. One by one, they slowly began to chat, sharing seemingly innocuous details, letting their guard down slightly under her relentless charm and sunny disposition.

Then, suddenly, one of the masked passengers, caught off guard by M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs infectious laughter, accidentally let slip their true, horrifying intention: ""We‚Äôre going to kidnap 'The Gang Prince' called R√≠kki Kaludra.""

M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs cheerful fa√ßade froze. Her mind immediately clicked. *R√≠kki Kaludra.* She recognized the name, HE‚ÄôS THE SAME GUY WHO ATTENDS UNIVERSITY WITH ME ABE!? CHAI!! NOW I FE HAVE HIS FULL NAME! MWUAHAHAHA!"" she thought to herself, a mischievous glint in her eyes, ""I just got his full name now! What a scoop! But wait... he's a *gang prince*?! And he‚Äôs here in this country, just casually existing? Wahala dey ooo!"" Her thoughts raced, a million questions flooding her mind. She made a mental note to ask about his true identity, his full story, and everything in between when she returned to university.

But then, the immediate, crucial detail crashed into her mind like a sudden bolt of lightning: these passengers wanted to *kidnap* him! Her heart jolted, a cold dread replacing her earlier mirth. ""Oh no, no, no! This is not good at all!"" Her inner hero, ever vigilant, kicked in. She had to protect him, whoever he was. She had to turn these crooks in to the police. No gangster kidnapping on her watch!

M√≠√©nal√≠a, with a sudden, subtle shift of the steering wheel, subtly changed her route, veering towards the nearest XiaoZaizi police station. The masked passengers, initially distracted by her chatter, slowly began to realize her deviation. Their casual conversation ceased, replaced by a chilling, knowing silence. One of them, quicker than the others, looked at the GPS, his eyes widening behind his mask. ""She's trying to get us busted!"" he hissed, his voice a low, dangerous growl. Then, with a swift, terrifying motion, he reached into his dark clothing and pulled out a glint of cold metal ‚Äì a gun.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (screaming, her voice surprisingly loud and clear) *No try me!* You dey pull out weapon for my taxi?! *Haba!* Police dey here o! You are surrounded, my friends!

But it was too late for their escape. Just as the gun appeared, the streets ahead erupted. Police cars, sirens wailing like banshees, their blue and red lights flashing in a dizzying strobe, surrounded the taxi from all sides. The crooks, realizing they were completely cornered, scrambled out of the car in a desperate frenzy and started running, dispersing into the crowded streets, hoping to lose themselves in the throng.

**EXT. XIAOZAIZI CITY STREETS - DAY (PRESENT)**

And thus, we return to the present: **M√≠√©nal√≠a** running alongside the XiaoZaizi police, her red hair a fiery beacon, effortlessly keeping pace with the trained officers, chasing the fleeing crooks. Luca, back at the hotel, had just woken up to find her gone, a knot of worry tightening in his stomach, a worried frown on his face. After a few minutes of chaotic pursuit through narrow alleyways and bustling markets, the police, aided by M√≠√©nal√≠a's surprising agility, her keen eye for shortcuts, and her surprisingly accurate shouts of ""The one in the green mask went left! The tall one with the weird limp is heading towards the noodle stall!"", managed to catch all the robbers.

M√≠√©nal√≠a, beaming with satisfaction, returned the taxi car, safe and sound, to the bewildered and profoundly grateful taxi driver. She gave him another wad of cash, enough to buy his daughter the best birthday ever, and then some. ""Go and enjoy your day, Oga!"" she told him, waving him off cheerfully.

Later that night, at the extravagant modeling party, surrounded by glittering gowns and flashing cameras, M√≠√©nal√≠a animatedly recounted her entire taxi adventure to Luca. She dramatized every moment, from the grumpy businesswoman to the masked kidnappers, leaving him wide-eyed and a mix of horrified, impressed, and slightly annoyed that she‚Äôd had an adventure without him.

**LUCA:** (shaking his head, a mix of awe and exasperation) You chased criminals before coming here?! *Mon Dieu*, M√≠√©nal√≠a, you are unbelievable!

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (waving a dismissive hand, sipping a sparkling mocktail) *Haba!* It was just small run, Luca. Just morning cardio, you know. Got to stay fit! And think of the story I got!

**EXT. PARTY BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT**

As the modeling party continued in full, glamorous swing below, a soft, intimate hum of music and laughter drifting upwards, M√≠√©nal√≠a and Luca found a quiet moment on the sprawling balcony of the party's building. They leaned against the ornate railing, looking out onto the breathtaking XiaoZaizi night sky. Stars, like scattered diamonds, glittered above them, reflecting in M√≠√©nal√≠a's mesmerized eyes.

Luca, turning from the celestial view, his light purple eyes earnest and filled with a tender longing, knelt down next to M√≠√©nal√≠a. He gently lifted her hands, his touch warm and hesitant, holding them reverently.

**LUCA:** (his voice soft, earnest, a beautiful vulnerability in it, the French lilt more pronounced) M√≠√©nal√≠a... *ma petite √©toile*... I hope someday you can truly see me not as a kid, not just your little brother. I hope you can see me as a man. A man who wants to do crazy, exhilarating things with you, for you. Now that I'm in the same University as you, back home... we're going to go on so many more adventures together, I promise. And this time, I won't miss out by oversleeping in a hotel room. *Jamais!* (lolüòÇ)

M√≠√©nal√≠a‚Äôs heart fluttered, a warmth spreading through her chest. She looked into his sincere, yearning eyes. Then, she knelt down as well, bringing herself to his level. She reached out and, with a gentle, affectionate gesture, patted his head. It was a gesture of deep fondness, but also one that kept him firmly in the ""little brother"" zone.

**M√ç√âNAL√çA:** (her voice filled with tenderness, a playful smile on her lips) My fine smallie. You‚Äôre such a good kid. And you dey grow, oh! Growing up into a very fine young man. Just no rush am, eh? Take your time.

Luca, completely deflated by her response, low-key folded his arms across his chest. He turned his head away, staring out at the cityscape with a grumpy pout, muttering under his breath. He clearly felt his most heartfelt, vulnerable hint had been completely, utterly missed, or perhaps, deliberately ignored (lolüòÇ). He slumped slightly, a picture of endearing frustration. ""I tried..."" he mumbled, a silent testament to his unrequited longing.

**INT. UNIVERSITY - HAUNNAH'S ROOM - NIGHT**

Back at the University, in a dim and oppressively tense atmosphere, **Haunnah** stood in her luxurious dorm room. The only light came from the city glow outside, casting long, unsettling shadows. Her back was to the camera, her silhouette framed against the window, her body language radiating pure disgust. She was looking at someone whose face and body were completely hidden through the dark lighting and deep shadows, their presence a mere, ominous outline.

**HAUNNAH:** (her voice a low frown, heavy with disappointment and a chilling resolve, her French accent sharp) I can‚Äôt believe you did this. After everything... M√≠√©nal√≠a deserves so much better than this. Whatever your twisted reasons are... whatever you hope to gain from this deception... you owe her the truth. And she has to be the one to hear it first.

I‚Äôve been in Vancouver for almost three years now and still find it tricky to meet people who I genuinely click with. I‚Äôve met some great people along the way, but figured I‚Äôd put myself out there and see if anyone‚Äôs down to hang out semi regularly or build a solid friend group.

I‚Äôm 24M, 6‚Äô2, with Irish, German, and Pakistani roots. I travel often, like exploring the city, checking out new events, restaurants and in general going on random adventures. I‚Äôm into the outdoors stuff like surfing, camping, climbing, and skiing also hoping to learn snowboarding and fishing soon.

I‚Äôll be starting flight school sometime soon and would also love to meet some people who ski or snowboard this season. Always down for a day on the mountain or an impromptu trip to Whistler. I‚Äôm pretty easygoing, enjoy good conversations, and like both spontaneous plans and chill nights in.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to send me a message or share your socials. Always down for coffee, a hike, or just hanging out somewhere around the city.

Looking forward to meeting all of you!",1,1760557567.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

Y'all were super helpful when I [posted my old place a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalelivingspace/comments/13ozrdv/thank_you_for_the_rug_recommendations_i_cant/). I was lucky enough to save up for my own place and have been in this new space for just over a year now. 

Lately, I've been feeling kind of meh about the space. It just feels off to me. I have a few ideas about why, but if you see something I haven't noticed, please don't hold back!

* I feel like the space is leaning too vintage. I'm more of a MCM / post-modern fan. If you've ever seen Living with LK on YouTube, that's pretty much the style I like! 
* A few things I already know have to go: the Ikea lamp behind the chair, the coffee table (want to switch it out for something oval-shaped), and the Kallax.
* I'm not sure I'm feeling the rug here - it's super nice but feels too busy.
* I'm stumped on the angled ceiling. Thoughts on a full wall floor-to-ceiling bookshelf situation? 
* The ceiling has can lights - I was thinking of bringing in a Nelson style pendant? 
* Litter box placements are not ideal but my space is small and this is the best I've come up with, unfortunately :-( 
* I'm a print maker and art collector so I have sooo many small / medium sized art pieces that I'd love to display but I kind of hate the look of a gallery wall.

I have had my father on supplements for 5 months now post hospital and learning about his LATE alzheimer diagnosis (mixed pathology TDP43) We have had extreme highs and lows for these 5 months. We tried mementine and he was EXTREMELY agitated and mean for his 2 week trial so we stopped that. Months later we tried tapering off of 20mg Celexa onto the Rivastigmine patch and that was also very unsuccessful. So we are now reintroducing the 10mg of celexa hoping to get him back to where he was during that taper because he was INCREDIBLE. At the moment - 5 days in - its still not looking great. Very restless, VERY confused, hes now suddenly misplacing all of his things and scattering things all over the house. He has OCD and this is very not like him. Im hoping reintoducing the celexa will level things out again? His auditiory recognition and aphasia are also really impaired lately. The only other med he is on is only Resperidone .25 in the AM and 1mg at PM. 

any help or advice or if anyone has been through any of this above would love to hear \^\^

  
ON ANOTHER NOTE - here are the supplements that hes taking and I get monthly blood work done to make sure things are all doing great and not being compromised:

\-Glutathione

\-OMEGA 3 (DHA,DPA,EPA)

\-Ubiquinol 

\-Beetroot 

\-Magnesium theronate & glycinate 

\-Tumeric+Curcumin

\-Vitamin D3+K2

\-iron (eod due to low levels)

\-soluable PAC for bladder 

\-MCT oil with coffee in AM

  
Things I have and have holded off on until he gets leveled out - hes never taken all of these together ive just bought them through research and never intro something withoiut making sure it doesnt interfere with meds/other supplements and arent too stimulating etc. 

\- Reverestrol, Acetyl-L-carnitine, NAC, Iron, Multivitamin with choline.

It started out with things like him asking me once to brush my teeth after lunch, and eventually turned into this unwritten rule that we brush, floss, and mouthwash after anything we eat or drink. 

What started out as him seeing some spots on our tile floors turned into him being fearful that it is due to acid erosion, and so coffee is now off limits to me. He must brew it and pour it in a spill proof mug for me and I am never allowed to touch it otherwise including during any cleaning tasks. I am oftentimes not allowed to talk to him while sipping coffee for fear that I will inadvertently spit it on my clothes or our furniture/floor. 

What began as us seeing one roach in the home turned into us never being allowed to touch food without immediately washing hands after. This makes things like eating a snack where there is not easy access to a sink impossible (ex: hiking, street food, etc). I‚Äôm not really allowed to help with meal prep or dishes at all. When I want to make my own food I am either denied and instead he will make it, or he cannot watch me do it and has to go in another room. 

What has really set me over the edge is that he has been controlling what I wear when we are at home. After a long day at work, when we both just want to relax and watch a show on TV, I‚Äôm not allowed to wear anything more than what he has on (usually shorts and a t-shirt.) If I put on another layer if I‚Äôm cold (long sleeve instead of short sleeve, pants instead of shorts, etc.) he will exit the room and refuse to spend the rest of the night with me or start an argument about how I‚Äôm going to get sweaty and that agitates him. He even checks my hands sometimes or gets agitated if I‚Äôm in a certain posture that might ‚Äúmake me sweaty.‚Äù

The other night I told him that this was a boundary for me. That it is my body, he cannot regulate what I am feeling, and has no right to tell me I cannot dress a certain way or assume a certain posture if I‚Äôm cold. He thinks that I shouldn‚Äôt be cold if the house is 70 degrees and that if I‚Äôm cold I should just leave the room. But even if I do this, he will come into the other room and tell me how he cannot believe I am so ‚Äúbundled up‚Äù and that it is disgusting that I am ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù and making more laundry for him. 
It‚Äôs my home too, I should be able to wear what I want and not constantly be monitored. I know I‚Äôm not being unreasonable here, but he basically makes me concede to keep the peace or I‚Äôm ‚Äúhurting him‚Äù because it physically makes him uncomfortable if he thinks I am too hot and I‚Äôm ‚Äúhurting the relationship‚Äù if I don‚Äôt give in to his compulsions. He says he ‚Äúcannot be close to me‚Äù if I am that warm. 

I acknowledge my concessions over the last 5 years have been a slippery slope, but this issue in particular is making me feel crazy. I feel like it‚Äôs difficult to say he is abusive because it‚Äôs not the overt abuse you hear about- huge explosions, physical violence, name calling- but all the rules feel like they are chipping away at my autonomy. And while I‚Äôm not getting hit if I don‚Äôt follow them, I know I will be forced to concede via guilt, stonewalling, or just no peace till I do. He is not interested in any type of therapy for himself or us as a couple and has threatened to kick me out if I so much a begin to discuss our issues with an outside person. I‚Äôm at my wits end. Anyways- I have no outlet to vent to so here‚Äôs me shouting into the void that is Reddit, and wondering if anyone else experiences control like this specifically over domestic tasks and bodily autonomy?

But I always wondered why you would even need cities if everyone WFH.

A city is there to provide a centralized place for mostly office workers and support jobs for those office workers (think restaurants, coffee shops, stores, even police and cleaning of streets), but WFH decentralizes office workers so they can work anywhere.

Thus, the city has no real purpose to exist.  Even most government work could be WFH.

At that point, after hours and nightlife activities would be the main reason to have a centralized location.  But even that could be decentralized.  So could restaurants, coffee shops, police, etc.

And converting those office spaces into apartments may not be feasible since people who work from home want to be away from the cities to do that.

Because these last few months, I think I am experiencing something different??
I am someone who has never had sleep issues, I sleep regularly, and healthy. I have never had a nightmare other than maybe the falling sensation dream. but these last 4 or 5 months I have been having the same reoccurring dream. I thought nothing of it at first, but its getting crazy. And I don‚Äôt know why, but I cannot think about anything else.
The dream is me in a mall. It looks like a mall in my hometown, but alot bigger and the stores are different. I know where I am going in the mall, and I seem to know other people who work at the stores, sometimes the mall is busy, and sometimes it‚Äôs completely dead. However, I always end up at the mall‚Äôs restaurant, where I work. I seem to be very familiar with the job, I am a waitress and no matter how dead the mall is, the restaurant is always filled with families, and I feel very comfortable and known there. I love my coworkers and my ‚Äúregulars‚Äù i even have shifts where I have call ins and take more tables. After the shift, I usually walk my ‚Äúcoworker‚Äù to her car. once we go outside its always a dead parking lot, and very dark out. I no longer feel safe. She always asks ti drive me home and for some reason I say no. Then I take two busses and a long walk home, when I get off the bus it‚Äôs always daylight outside again and no longer dark. I walk to my old house, I haven‚Äôt lived in, in like a decade and it‚Äôs always empty. problem with these dreams, is they are too nonchalant. They happen everynight like its a life I am living. theres no scary creatures, no weird dream distortion, just me working. Sometimes I even have a friendgroup come with me to the mall, i never know these people but apparently im friends with them. i feel comfortable with them. we go downstairs to the mall which the staircase looks rough and gross but the basement of the mall is this GIANT theatre. I have been to this theatre inmy dreams ALOT. sometimes i am there for concerts, sometimes movies, and sometimes dance competitions. I know its at the bottom of the mall, and sometimes i go after my shift in the resturant. something always happens during the show though. each night jts different. last night my boyfriend was there and we ended up hooking up in the back of the theatre while the show was on. this only seems significant bc its the first time ive known someone in my real life in these dreams. sometimes im pulled onto the stage and I dont know the routine (i was a dancer growing up) sometimes, its a movie and I end up talking through the whole thing with my friend group. idk something always happens and I can‚Äôt watch whatever im there to see. but im happy in the theatre. even in the mall, i can probably map the whole thing out. i even have a go to coffee shop where I know my order for my breaks

again, these dreams aren‚Äôt distorted or weird or even problematic. they have been normal day to day life but the same setting for MONTHS.

On Wednesday, June 25th, I get up at 5:00 a.m. after a wonderful night's sleep, do some final work on my bike, and repack my panniers. Then I have breakfast.

I set off at 7:30 a.m. and first have to cross the high bridge again and over the hills of Troms√∏, then over another high bridge until, after an hour and a lot of energy spent, I finally reach the start of my stage. (Picture 1: Bridge over the eastern arm of the fjord

The road leads through the suburbs of Troms√∏ and, with a fresh headwind, there are many uphill and downhill sections, making it a challenging ride. The E6, where the route continues, is fraught with traffic. At 10 a.m., I take an hour-long break to eat in my bivouac bag on a small patch of grass, as the grass is wet and there's a light drizzle. From the turnoff from the E6 to the ferry to Breivikeidet, it's mostly uphill, but at least I'm no longer facing a headwind. At around 2 p.m., I take a lunch break at a spot where I am plagued by small biting flies from the outset. And then it starts to rain heavily, so I hastily pack everything up, put on my rain gear, and finish eating. Not only the rain, but also the cold wind and the mountains covered in snow far below impressively show me that I am in Arctic latitudes beyond 70 degrees north. At 3:30 p.m., I'm on the ferry, where I drink coffee in the warm lounge. (Picture 2: The ferry from Breivikeidet to the other side of the fjord)

With renewed energy and a tailwind, I continue on National Road 91. The sky is getting darker and darker, with only the distant mountain peaks catching the sun. The wind blows coldly down from the snow-capped mountains. Only the exertion of cycling and my rain gear keep me warm. Around 6 p.m., I reach the next ferry. After about 10 minutes, the ship arrives and takes on an entire tanker truckload of fuel, so we don't reach the other side until 7:20 p.m. Because of the strong, cold north wind, I'm quite cold by now, so I head to the campsite at the pier, where I rent a simple cabin, as it's too cold for me in my tent with my sleeping bag, which is only warm enough to 10¬∞C. (Picture 3: My cabin, which I preferred to a tent here in the Arctic latitudes.) 

After a hot shower and settling in, I eat, chat with a Swiss man camping who's cycled everywhere since May 1st, and send a WhatsApp message to my family. I go to bed at 11 p.m., but have a bit of trouble falling asleep. I've cycled 100 km in over seven hours, but because of the detours, I've only managed half of the stage I'd planned for the first day.

When I get up briefly at midnight, I see that the sun is shining, so I go outside and see the midnight sun rising above the road along Lynger Fjord. A magnificent sight I've dreamed of for 65 years.

1o7klpv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7klpv,1992 Schwinn Crosspoint - My first build,"I bought this bike for $50 back in August. The paint was scratched to hell, and there was some minor surface rust on the frame and fork. Pretty much everything was shot: broken teeth on the chainrings, busted rear derailleur, crummy grip shifters, dry-rotted original spec 38 Special tires, very out of true wheels, ripped up 3‚Äù thick saddle etc. Everything grimy. 

I stripped the whole thing down and cleaned up the frame, removed rust, and poorly went over some of the scratches with not-quite-matching nail polish. My son helped me which was fun. Don‚Äôt look too close. 

Rebuilt it with Microshift Sword Black 2x9 drivetrain (170 mm cranks with 46/29 up front, 11-38 in the rear) with the clutched Microshift Sword rear derailleur, new Shimano square taper bottom bracket, DT Swiss R460/Shimano 105 wheels, 38mm Panaracer GravelKing slicks, Tektro RX1 mini-V brakes, Brooks C17 saddle, Salsa Cowbell 46 cm handlebars, Dimension threaded-threadless stem adapter, cheap 80mm stem from Amazon and Shimano pedals I had on hand. 

It rides super smooth and handles great. I hate the aesthetics of the stem adapter but it does the job. I‚Äôd like eventually replace it with a nice removable faceplate quill.

1o7kk0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o7kk0p/its_been_a_while_since_ive_had_the_urge_to_write/,It's been a while since I‚Äôve had the urge to write anything.,"Going through school, writing used to be the only way I could really express myself. I never really caught on with drawing or music, sitting around and piling up drafts of things I‚Äôd never release just always seemed like the best way to unwind.

But of course, the stress of growing up, keeping track of bills, performance reviews, car maintenance, all of the little things adding up, I fell out of practice. One day, I realized I just didn‚Äôt have the spark I needed to put words to paper anymore.

That bothered me, of course, but when I sat down and tried to convince myself just to write a rough paragraph, just to get back into it, the only things that came to mind were how I could ‚Äúspend my time better‚Äù or ‚Äúdo something that‚Äôd help me get ahead‚Äù, as if my creativity was a hindrance, and nourishing it was self-sabotage.

That was, until one day, scrolling through reels and shorts, I saw an ad for one of the first consumer-grade behavioral implants. The ad said it was a quick process, and because it was still in its infancy, the whole procedure would be cheap and include plenty of communication with the developers. I was obviously skeptical, so after a minute of checking out the website, I decided against it and returned to my doomscrolling, lamenting over how many things got in the way of my self-expression.

A week later, I lost my job. There was a company-wide financial audit, and my entire department was deemed ‚Äúredundant and not conducive to meeting shareholder profit margins‚Äù. I was offered a small severance package, about enough to cover my bills for two months, and then I was sitting in my car, my desk packed into the backseat, with no idea where to go from there. That‚Äôs when I decided I was going to do it.

The website had sent one of those automatic emails to me after I had signed up to look at the website, so I replied and set up an appointment. It only took a few days to have the paperwork submitted and filed, and before I knew it, I was sitting in a waiting room that was five degrees too cold, the smell of iodine and cheap air freshener filling my nostrils.

The process was quick and painless - according to them it only took about an hour (I asked to be put out, even though they said it wasn‚Äôt necessary), and I responded incredibly well to the implant. There was a quick rundown of what it could do, how to adjust my feelings and mood from the app, and the number to call in case something goes wrong. They had set me to a default of high-attentiveness and retention, so I understood perfectly well and was practically an expert by the time I finished their pamphlet. Simply put, I had 100% of my mind to allot to different aspects of my personality. Creativity, emotional stability, attentiveness, et cetera. Easy enough to understand, especially with it all condensed into a user-friendly app.

The drive home was incredible; it was like I was seeing the world for the first time. I realized my town had ten different coffee shops within three miles from each other, I noticed the patterns in the medians where city planners had decided how many bushes would best fit in a 5‚Äôx10‚Äô strip, and I noticed that my town had two libraries, of all things (I‚Äôll be stopping by the closest one later.) I pulled over and adjusted my focus ever-so-slightly to creativity, and the colors of the flowers and trees seemed to be brand-new hues that I had never even known existed. Even cars and pedestrians seemed to be entirely new entities, like blood cells keeping the body of the city alive.

After I got home, I did my laundry, meal-prepped lunch for a few days, and watered my plants, all the things that always seemed like insurmountable tasks by themselves, let alone all at once. Finally, I saw it. My notebook, the same one I had bought myself 10 years ago, one of my many attempts to push myself back into the saddle. I sat down, relaxed, and words started flowing without any effort whatsoever. The spark was finally back, and I was able to relive the joy of putting pen to paper again. I gave myself a little more creative juice, and analogies started coming to me as simply as breathing, finding it almost trivial to draw connections between almost entirely unrelated events. I kept writing and pouring my feelings out onto the page like I had never spoken a true word before, and I had finally found it within myself to speak freely to a loved one.

A little bit more, and I could practically feel the words, they were so real I could see them taking form in front of my eyes, every word that I wrote was made real twice over. Once in the act of giving it life by writing, and again when it presented itself anew to me, the words themselves being reborn in my mind as if they were the next line in a book I couldn‚Äôt put down, one that I would stay up late into the night reading for the scandalous luxury of just one more page. I took a short break, tidying up around the house a little more to celebrate my rekindled passion, and give my writing the clean and comfortable surroundings they deserve.

A little more, and it dawned on me that I had wasted so much time, so much effort, trying to give myself a life where all I needed to worry about was making it to work on time, and then all of my woes would be handled, so I could focus on what truly mattered, expressing myself. I had put my personality aside and snubbed the spark of my soul in an errant attempt to give myself near unattainable security and stability. Why had I done this, what goal was I attempting to achieve before I allowed myself the supposed luxury of enjoying myself? Wracking my mind, I‚Äôm met with only half-truths and compromises, perhaps I‚Äôm just not thinking creatively enough. I stepped away for a moment; I was getting stuck in my own head. I cleaned a bit and re-folded my clothes, I had practically shoved them into my dresser earlier.

Getting back into it, a little bit more won‚Äôt hurt, I‚Äôm sure. 65% has allowed me to see the outside world with a newfound beauty and respect, who‚Äôs to say 80% won‚Äôt give me the ability to do the same with myself?

I think I get it. I wasn‚Äôt good enough, that‚Äôs why I stopped. Everyone else seemed so much better, so much more natural. Writing always made me feel like a child wearing their father‚Äôs suit. I wasn‚Äôt one of the good writers, but I was playing pretend and acting like I was creating masterpieces up until it came down to showing anyone. Not anymore, I‚Äôm making a name for myself. I lost my job, I‚Äôm likely to lose my car and apartment, but I‚Äôm finally ready. Seeing the magic and beauty of my own writing acting itself out before my eyes has finally convinced me that I have a story worth sharing. I‚Äôm committing myself to my passion. I‚Äôm devoting myself to my creativity, and I‚Äôll strike out against the endless tides of visionaries, hoping to leave a mark somewhere they can see it.

1o7khvi,https://i.redd.it/nz1l12patbvf1.jpeg,Citrobacter Koseri + IC diagnosis,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 30F. I‚Äôve been dealing with recurrent UTIs since 2010, including at least two kidney infections in 2011 and 2013. In 2019, I was diagnosed with endometriosis, which was surgically removed. Before that diagnosis, I had UTI-like symptoms that lasted for about six months.

I also had a cystoscopy in 2019 with a rigid scope ‚Äî it was the most painful experience of my life, far worse than anything else I‚Äôve been through. A kidney ultrasound the same year showed nephroptosis (my kidneys drop 4‚Äì6 cm when standing), microlithiasis (1.5‚Äì2.6 mm, bilateral), and incomplete duplication of the right collecting system.

After moving to the U.S. in 2020, my UTIs started again around 2021. Cultures repeatedly came back negative, and I was eventually diagnosed with interstitial cystitis (IC). I underwent six bladder instillations with DMSO in late 2022, but they only made my pain worse, so I just stopped the treatment. 

From early 2023 until September 2024, I took D-Mannose every single day, then stopped because I thought it had done its job. Shortly after stopping, the UTIs came back. I‚Äôve had five UTIs in the past 12 months. The most recent one started on September 25 (burning, urgency, flank pain), and I took a MicrogenDX test on October 1. Every single culture before this was negative, and this is the first time a bacteria was actually identified. Every single time, beginning 2010, antibiotics did work, but sometimes it took longer than usual to provide a complete or nearly complete relief. 

I saw a urology PA today, and the appointment went terribly. She dismissed the timeline note I had neatly written out (dating back to 2010), looked at my MicrogenDX vaginal swab showing Lactobacillus crispatus instead of the urine test that showed Citrobacter, and told me, ‚Äúthose bacteria are completely normal.‚Äù When I pointed out the urine test results, she brushed them off, saying that because the standard culture came back negative, there was no infection whatsoever.

She gave me a referral for a kidney ultrasound this Friday, and of course, another cystoscopy. When I told her my last cystoscopy was unbearably painful, she dismissed my concern, saying that ‚Äútechnologies have advanced‚Äù and that the new scopes are ‚Äúvery narrow and won‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù After reading this subreddit, I realized I should probably cancel it, since it sounds like it could be another traumatic and painful experience.

She didn‚Äôt even listen when I explained that I don‚Äôt eat spicy food, pee after sex, and only drink one half-caff cup of coffee in the morning, always followed by a glass of water. Water has been my primary source of hydration for years. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or soda, and I already follow all those generic lifestyle recommendations she mentioned. I‚Äôm just so frustrated and devastated right now I feel completely dismissed and angry.

Has anyone else had Citrobacter show up through MicrogenDX? What did you do, and what helped?

Right now, I‚Äôm taking D-Mannose and NAC (Life Extension), but I‚Äôm open to any other suggestions or approaches that might help. Of my ongoing symptoms, I still have mild but persistent burning and need to use the bathroom more often than most people. I‚Äôm also worried the UTI will come back again in another two to three months.

Now I‚Äôm not so sure.

When Tom moved in, I didn‚Äôt think twice. A friend of a friend had mentioned he needed a room, and my old roommate had just moved out. Rent‚Äôs expensive, and Tom seemed normal enough when he came by to look at the place. Quiet, polite, even a little shy. We split rent, set up the Wi-Fi, went grocery shopping once together. He liked instant noodles and those cheap iced coffees. Simple guy.

At first, living with him was easy. We‚Äôd say hi in the hallway, sometimes eat at the same time, but mostly stayed out of each other‚Äôs way. I liked that. I work late shifts, so I often got home around midnight. The apartment was dark, calm, predictable.

Until it wasn‚Äôt.

The first thing I noticed was how often Tom was awake when I got home. I‚Äôd unlock the door, and he‚Äôd already be standing in the living room. No TV, no lights on‚Äîjust standing there.  
The first few times, I thought I‚Äôd startled him. But he never jumped. Never moved. He‚Äôd just look at me and smile faintly.  
‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù I asked once.  
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

After that, I started hearing him walk around at night. Slow, steady steps up and down the hall. Sometimes he‚Äôd stop right outside my door. Just stand there. I knew because the old wood floors creaked whenever someone moved. I‚Äôd stare at the ceiling, frozen, waiting for the sound to stop.

He never knocked.

By morning, everything was normal again. He‚Äôd be sitting at the kitchen table, eating cereal like nothing happened. When I tried to bring it up, he‚Äôd tilt his head slightly, confused.  
‚ÄúI was asleep,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou sure you didn‚Äôt dream that?‚Äù

I started double-checking the locks at night. Making sure my door was closed tight. But sometimes I‚Äôd wake up and it would be open‚Äîjust a crack.

Then came the smell.  
A faint, metallic scent, like old blood or rust, drifting from his room late at night. I told myself it was pipes, or food gone bad. I even tried to peek in once when he wasn‚Äôt home, but his door was locked.

After that, I started keeping my phone next to my bed, recording audio through the night.  
The first night‚Äînothing.  
The second‚Äîsoft noises. Breathing. Too close. Too human.  
The third‚ÄîI heard my door open.

When I listened back, my stomach dropped. The hinge squeaked, then a pause. And then a quiet voice, almost a whisper:  
‚ÄúYou sleep so still.‚Äù

I confronted him the next morning, shaking, voice barely steady.  
‚ÄúTom, were you in my room last night?‚Äù  
He smiled. Calm. Too calm.  
‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù  
His tone was light, almost playful. ‚ÄúYou should get more sleep, man. You‚Äôre starting to sound paranoid.‚Äù

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep at all.

At 2:47 a.m., I heard a faint sound again‚Äîa soft scrape beneath me.  
At first, I thought it was in my head. Then I heard breathing.  
Slow, deliberate. Under my bed.

I leaned over the edge, heart pounding, and saw two eyes staring back at me.

I froze. Couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt scream. The eyes didn‚Äôt blink. Then his voice‚Äîcalm, quiet, way too close:  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù

I jumped out of bed so fast I nearly fell. Tom crawled out from underneath, brushing dust off his clothes, as if this was normal.  
‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?!‚Äù I shouted.  
He blinked slowly.  
‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ wanted to be close.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
He tilted his head.  
‚ÄúYou always sleep with your back to the door. You‚Äôre so quiet. I wanted to know what it‚Äôs like to be that close to someone without them knowing.‚Äù

He said it so softly, like it was something tender, something intimate. I couldn‚Äôt even breathe.

He stood up, looked around my room like he was admiring it, and smiled faintly.  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hurt you,‚Äù he said. Then he walked out, closing the door gently behind him.

I sat there until sunrise, knife in hand, every sound amplified. When I finally opened my door, his room was empty. No clothes, no toothbrush, no trace he‚Äôd ever lived there.

I called the landlord that morning. He sounded confused.  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one tenant on the lease,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou. No one else was supposed to live there.‚Äù

I swear Tom was real. I met him. I spoke to him. There were dishes he used, receipts in his name. But now, it‚Äôs like he never existed.

I moved out a week later. I don‚Äôt tell people why‚ÄîI just say it was too quiet there.

Sometimes, though, when I‚Äôm lying in bed in my new place, I swear I hear it again.  
A faint scrape.  
A slow breath.  
Just beneath me.

And I can‚Äôt help thinking about what he said that night.

‚ÄúI just wanted to be close.‚Äù",6,1760555930.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

I tend to use the same things but don‚Äôt know where the culprit lies. If there‚Äôs any ingredients I should avoid in products or know what this could be please lmk.

I do have eczema & but it seems to have flared up just this year all the sudden. Get the severe itchiness mostly on my shins, inner thighs, top of arms. I don‚Äôt get rash or huge dry patches. I have always had sensitive dry skin. Only body lotion I will use & have been using is the cetaphil restoraderm for the last 8 years. Not easy to find so I‚Äôm subscribed on AMZ.

Honestly could be my diet. My weakness is sweets. But that‚Äôs nothing new? I try to avoid dairy for the most part. Doesn‚Äôt bother me in small amounts. If I eat ice cream I take a lactaid. I think my eczema flares up eating eggs so I cut back on those. Which sucks. I do drink coffee everyday only the last 8 months or so? Kind of wondering if caffeine is doing that? I used to only drink chai‚Ä¶

How can I find out what it is without a dermatologist just guessing? I don‚Äôt want to be a guinea pig tbh. I want to really start focusing on eating clean & detoxing from sugars (besides fruits). If you have tips on a diet I should follow like Mediterranean etc.

Where should I start to find out whats causing? Process of elimination? I‚Äôve been consistent in the gym now for 7 months. ",1,1760555830.0,DermatologyQuestions,0,1.0,False

Very low fat , large portions , I find myself taking the homemade cherry pie.  I walked through two tent of local crafts, hoping to run into someone from my past.

I was taking my 87 year old Mom to get some of her favorites.  I‚Äôll post more pictures as I go!  It‚Äôs about 12 miles north of Rockville, a short drive!

Headed to Rockville next, looking for some specific items:  Sassafras candy, made locally along with hot tea .  I used to dig up the tree roots as a kid, shaving them and making tea is a saucepan.  The flavor takes me back.

Stop by at Worth‚Äôs Kettle Corn, a classmate of mine where her dad used to make it, now I find her son at the stand.  My mother was his kindergarten teacher, how time flies!

The corn is tasty as usual, and I work my way thru the crowd to the other side of the square, looking for the Catholic Church‚Äôs krueller stand.  

My Mom had helped out, twisting the kruellers by hand.  As I say hi and introduce myself, I find nieces and nephews happily making them.  Oh it smells sooo good!  I ask if I could get two dozen, so I can freeze some and ration them out, making them last as long as possible.   

I couldn‚Äôt stand it any longer , eating one as soon as I got back to my Mom‚Äôs house.  She ate one as soon as I brought them back to the car!  Over the years Mom had mailed me frozen ones for me to reheat and enjoy.

1o7k8k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/1o7k8k9/your_presence_is_their_peace_a_message_for/,Your presence is their peace (A message for caregivers),"I don't know why 3 AM hits different when you're caring for someone, but it does.

The house is quiet. Everyone else is sleeping. You're exhausted but your brain won't shut off because what if they need you? What if something happens and you're not paying attention?

So you check on them. Again. For the third time tonight. You adjust their blanket even though it's fine. You watch their chest rise and fall just to make sure. You sit in that chair by their bed with your coffee or tea or whatever gets you through the night, and you wonder if you're doing enough.

Here's what I learned after years of this: You are.

1997. My grandma had a stroke. Left side paralyzed. Right side still worked, barely. I was just a kid, but I became one of her caregivers alongside my mom and siblings.

My mom was already on dialysis since 1995. She was sick herself but still showing up for her own mother. That's the kind of strength I grew up watching. A sick woman caring for a paralyzed woman while raising kids who were trying to help both of them.

We were all caregivers in that house. All trying to be strong for each other. All scared.

2003. My grandma was at the end. I couldn't sleep. Couldn't eat. I just watched her.

I had this thing I'd do. I'd tap her toe gently on her right side, the side that still worked, just to check if she was okay, to see if she was suffering, to make sure she was still there with me.

And she'd wiggle it back.

Every single time, she'd wiggle her toe back. Just a little movement. Just enough to tell me ""I'm here. I'm not okay, but I'm here. And you being here matters.""

I told myself I wouldn't cry writing this, but here we are.

That toe wiggle was our language when words were mostly gone. It was her way of saying ""I know you're scared. I know you're trying. Thank you for not leaving me alone.""

I was just a kid doing what I thought I was supposed to do. I didn't know I was being a caregiver. I didn't know that sitting there, tapping her toe at 3 AM, barely breathing myself because I was so scared of losing her... I didn't know that was love in its purest form.

But it was.

My mom kept caring for her own mother while fighting her own battle with kidney disease. Dialysis three times a week, exhausted, sick, but still showing up. I watched my mom be a caregiver while being a patient. I watched her choose presence even when her own body was failing.

That's when I learned what it really means to show up.

I was 11 when my mom started dialysis in 1995. By the time my grandma had her stroke in 1997, I was already learning how to be the man of the house even though I was still a kid. I was learning medication schedules and dialysis appointments and how to take care of people who were supposed to be taking care of me.

My grandma lived with that paralysis for six years. My mom fought dialysis for fifteen years, from 1995 to 2010.

Fifteen years of showing up three times a week to have your blood cleaned by a machine. Fifteen years of being exhausted and still caring for everyone else. Fifteen years of being strong when her body was betraying her.

I learned everything about caregiving from those two women and from the years I spent trying to hold our family together.

Your presence is their peace. Even when they can't say it. Even when all they can do is wiggle a toe or look at you in a way that breaks your heart because you know what it means.

The fact that you're there, at 3 AM, checking on them when no one else is awake to see it... that's everything. That's the stuff that matters when everything else falls away.

Nobody ever told me that just showing up was enough. I thought I had to fix everything, save everyone, never break down. I thought if I was strong enough, if I tried hard enough, if I stayed awake long enough, I could keep them here.

But that's not how it works.

What I could do was be there. Hold space. Tap a toe. Make sure they knew they weren't alone.

And that was enough. It had to be enough. Because it's all any of us can really do.

If you're reading this at 3 AM, or 2 AM, or 4 AM, or during another sleepless night wondering if you're doing this right... you are. You're doing the hardest job in the world, and nobody's giving you medals or bonuses or time off.

But you're doing it anyway.

You're the person who taps the toe. Who adjusts the blanket. Who sits in the dark and watches them breathe. Who stays when everyone else has gone to bed because someone has to be there, and you chose to be that someone.

Maybe you're like my mom was, sick yourself but still showing up for someone else. Maybe you're like I was, young and scared but doing it anyway. Maybe you're carrying the weight alone or maybe you have siblings helping like I did.

However it looks for you, you're doing sacred work.

That's what makes you extraordinary.

I started Day1father because of my grandma's toe wiggle and my mom's fifteen year fight and every sleepless night I spent wondering if I was doing enough. I wanted to create something that reminds caregivers that their presence matters. That showing up is the work. That love isn't always big gestures... sometimes it's just a toe wiggle in the dark.

You're not alone in this. There's a whole community of us awake at weird hours, checking on the people we love, trying to be strong when we're falling apart. We're all tapping toes in our own way, hoping for that little wiggle back that says ""I know. Thank you. Keep going.""

So if you need to hear it today: You're doing enough. Your presence matters. And it's okay to not be okay sometimes.

It's okay to cry at 3 AM. It's okay to be exhausted. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to wonder if any of this makes a difference.

It does. Every toe tap. Every blanket adjustment. Every time you check on them when you could be sleeping. Every time you show up even when you're sick yourself. Every time you choose to be there when it would be easier to look away.

They feel it. Even when they can't say it.

Take care of yourself too. Even if it's just ten minutes. My grandma would want that for you. My mom would want that for you. I want that for you.

You can't pour from an empty cup, and you've been pouring for so long.

Sending you strength today. You're doing sacred work, even if it doesn't feel like it. üíô

I'm curious as to what you would charge for the following housekeeping support.

I have a work colleague who's house I go and do a reset at, each week. Reset meaning I will go in, clean the kitchen, run the dishwasher and empty the dishwasher, reset the coffee maker, wash the countertops, clean the microwave, will collect all the dirty, laundry and run, dry, and put away three loads of laundry. Will clean 2 to 3 bedrooms, including making the beds, putting away toys, putting away laundry, etc. I clean three bathrooms. I vacuum the large sized main floor as well as the upstairs that has three bedrooms and two bathrooms and a Sitting room type area. He has one dog so I also tend to the water bowls, usually feed him while I am there, take him out to go potty twice. I clean the refrigerator and clean and cut fruit. I take out the trash. I restocked the snacks and food cabinet. About every two weeks I will put fresh sheets on all the beds and wash the sheets and put those away.

This takes me anywhere from 3.5 hours to five hours, depending on the workload.

I know the information I just provided is pretty general, and there are lots of nuances to be considered, but just as a general, rough gas, what would you charge for this work?

A little history, they started out in 1890 founded by brothers and a few friends and they originally sold sliced bacon in vacuum sealed jars which was a novelty and cured hams. The recipe for the ham was from the father of one of the founders and his hams were well known locally for their exceptional nutty flavor.  The company was originally named Imperial packing company but a friend told them that was an undemocratic name for an American company so they renamed it. The flavor of that ham and the many beech trees growing in the area is what inspired the name beech-nut for the company.

One of the founders was advised by his mentor ham ""Baron"" Philip Armour to use cans for their ham because he felt the fat should be hidden in cans, but he went against that advice. He wanted to use transparent vacuum sealed jars for their bacon and hams and later on with baby food all of which were sold in cans by other companies. The bacon was so popular they were grossing $1 million a year by 1905. 

In the next few years they added more products including sliced meats, peanut butter, baked beans, jam, tomato sauce, coffee, mustard, ginger ale, spaghetti, biscuits, candy, gum, and canned fish bait. The peanut butter was the top selling peanut butter in the country in its heyday. 

Chewing gum was a major breakthrough for them in 1910 and keep them afloat during the depression. They had $18 million in sales in 1935 and $11 million of it was their chewing gum. Baby food came into the picture in 1931 and after WW11 their products were down to gum, peanut butter, coffee, and baby food. The baby food was the biggest selling product for the next 50 years. 

This cookbook is fun to look at now

We couldn't afford somewhere nice, so we got married on this side of the courthouse, surrounded by old brick with the backdrop of a parking garage. I couldn't afford a wedding dress, so I wore a dress out of my closet. I couldn't sleep at all the night before so I had to rely on monster energy and coffee to get me through the day. I was on the heaviest day of my period, so I had multiple crisis moments and nearly bled through on multiple occasions. It wasn't sunny so we got relatively cloudy pictures. Walking in heels was extremely hard and I was barely able to move very much while wearing them. It was a very imperfect day. It wasn't glamorous. It was messy. And I wouldn't change a thing about it. Not much of it was very planned out and I was absolutely exhausted, but the day was very us. It was raw and authentic. But we got to be early to the court house, so we could do the paper work early and we were even able to take our vows earlier than the meeting was scheduled. Then we went to the park to meet my family for pictures and we managed to find a very nice hill. We didn't get sun, but we got a tree that was beginning to change colors for fall. It was windy. We managed to get the angles just right to have a wind work in our favor. I brought flats with me so I could change in and out of my heels, so my feet weren't killing me too much. I brought a second dress out of my closet that I've always wanted to use for something and I was able to use it for pictures. My dog, who had relly scary health issues only 2 months ago, was able to be there and dress up for pictures. It was a very imperfect day, and yet I think it's just about the best kind of wedding day we could have ever imagined.

- Kissed the top of his head
- Put pajamas on him
- Offered him a bite of the dinner he had already been eating for the last 10 minutes
- Generally existed in his presence
- Left the room for 5 seconds

1o7k0b3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1o7k0b3/on_benefits_of_abstinence/,On benefits of abstinence,"**Nowadays, there is a widespread belief among the general public and even among doctors that the physiological benefits of abstinence are nothing more than medieval religious superstitions and scientific ignorance, and that this is incompatible with modern knowledge of physiology. Some doctors use this idea for their own commercial gain and create a fear of abstinence in society, which is supposedly the cause of nervous system diseases and has a detrimental effect on overall health.**

**Based on this belief, doctors and psychoanalysts sometimes go so far as to advise young men to use the services of prostitutes, claiming that the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease is incomparable to the harmful effects of prolonged abstinence on the nervous system.**

**However, further study of this article should convince any sensible reader that everything written above is false, and that abstinence cannot actually cause harm, but is, on the contrary, beneficial; and that when health problems do occur in people who are not sexually active, it is only the result of unhealthy sexual behavior. Given that semen is very rich in substances such as lecithin, cholesterol, and phosphorus, it becomes clear that the loss of these valuable substances, together with poor nutrition, is the cause of disorders of the nervous system and brain, and not abstinence, contrary to the absurd claims of corrupt psychoanalysts.**

**We have seen that the secretions of the sex glands are the basis of human vital energy, both physical and mental. This is achieved through the reabsorption of semen. Preserving semen means preserving sex hormones and increasing energy, while losing semen means losing hormones and decreasing energy. A chronic deficiency of sex hormones leads to the appearance of symptoms of aging. Semen is a viscous liquid with an alkaline reaction, very rich in calcium and phosphorus, as well as lecithin, cholesterol, protein, iron, vitamin E, and others. During one ejaculation, a man loses about 226 million sperm cells, which contain large amounts of lecithin, cholesterol, protein, and iron. One ounce of semen is equal in value to 60 ounces of blood. In this regard, Dr. Frederick McKenna is convinced that semen truly has enormous potential, as ancient scientists claimed.**

**Sperm contains substances of high physiological value, especially for nourishing brain tissue and the nervous system. It is known that the absorption of sperm through the wall of the female va.ina has a very positive effect on the female body, and the same should be true in the male body, where this semen is stored. Conversely, the loss of semen should deprive the body of vital energy and valuable substances necessary for nourishing nerve cells, such as lecithin, which has been used therapeutically with great success to cure neurasthenia resulting from sexual excesses.**

**Here are some facts demonstrating the benefits of abstinence: 1. The chemical composition of semen is very similar to that of the cells of the central nervous system (especially cholesterol, lecithin, and phosphorus). 2. Excessive loss of semen (through masturbation, sexual intercourse, interrupted sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse with the use of contraceptives) is exhausting and harmful to the body and brain. 3. Excessive unintentional loss of semen (wet dreams, spermatorrhea, etc.) has a detrimental effect on the nervous system and can cause neurasthenia. 4. Studies have shown that orgasm temporarily depresses the nervous system, and when abused, often leads to chronic nervous disorders (sexual neurasthenia). 5. Abstinence is beneficial for the brain (as it preserves valuable lecithin, one of the most important components of the brain). Many great geniuses practiced abstinence, including Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Newton, Kant, Beethoven, Wagner, Spencer, and others. 6. The experiments of Professor Brown Secord and Professor Steinak prove the rejuvenating effect of male semen. 7. Leading physiologists, urologists, genitourinary specialists, neuropathologists, psychiatrists, sexologists, gynecologists, and endocrinologists confirm the physiological value of abstinence. Among them are Moll, Kraepelin, Marshall, Lydston, Talmey, and others.**

**Professor von Gruber of Munich, a prominent sexologist, says that it is absurd to consider semen as a harmful, unnecessary secretion like urine, which requires regular excretion from the body. Sperm is a vital fluid that is not only reused by the body during sexual abstinence, but thanks to this reabsorption, has a positive effect on physiological health, as confirmed by the great geniuses who practiced complete abstinence for most of their lives. Dr. Bernard S. Telmy, a prominent American gynecologist, shares this view and believes that in the absence of stimulating factors, semen is completely absorbed through the seminal vesicles, thereby making abstinence easy and habitual over time.**

**Professor Alfred Fournier, a renowned physiologist, ridicules the idea of ‚Äúthe dangers of abstinence for young people‚Äù and states that in his many years of medical practice, he has never encountered a single such case. Professor Montegazza, on the other hand, is convinced of the positive effects of chastity on both the body and the brain. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg cites the example of many famous athletes of Ancient Greece (such as Astylos, Dopompos, and others mentioned by Plato) who practiced complete abstinence during their training, which contributed to their unusually high energy levels. Professor Furbringer, a prominent German researcher, writes: ‚ÄúContrary to the opinion of modern medicine, sexual abstinence is not harmful to health.‚Äù He writes that the problems experienced by bachelors arise not from abstinence, but from masturbation and other forms of sexual gratification. Krafft-Ebing, a specialist in sexual matters, considers ‚Äúabstinence sickness‚Äù to be a myth. Gynecologist Loewenfeld believes it is entirely possible for a healthy person to live in complete abstinence without any side effects. Professor F.G. Lydston, an endocrinologist at the University of Illinois, says: ""Abstinence can never be harmful. Moreover, preserving semen in the testicles often has a positive effect on physical and mental energy."" Chassaignac asserts that the healthier a person is, the easier it is for them to practice complete abstinence; only people who are pathologically ill, with an unhealthy nervous system, find abstinence difficult. The famous researcher Acton writes that the common misconception about abstinence as a cause of genital atrophy and impotence is a serious mistake.**

**Convincing evidence of the benefits of abstinence is provided by studies of sexual orgasm. Havelock Ellis, in his Studies in the Psychology of Sex, refers to the research of Dr. F.B. Robinson. He notes that when a stallion is first allowed to mate with a mare, after a short, vigorous copulation, the stallion often loses consciousness, which Robinson attributes to cerebral anemia thus produced. He mentions one case where, after copulation, the stallion fell dead. Young bulls also often lose consciousness after their first mating with a cow, and it is very common to see a young bull so exhausted that he crawls away to a quiet corner and lies there for several hours. However, fainting during copulation does not occur in dogs, since sexual intercourse lasts longer in them, and dogs do not have seminal vesicles. As for boars, the orgasm in these animals is so strong that it seems as if the animal is experiencing severe pain shock, from which it cannot recover for several hours after mating. Havelock Ellis writes:**

**""Understanding the significant impact of detumescence (the cessation of erection after ejaculation and orgasm, approx.), we can explain the serious consequences following copulation. Young bulls and stallions fainted after their first intercourse; bulls can be seriously injured after mating; stallions, as has been said, have even died. In humans (men), the period of detumescence lasts a little longer, but there are numerous known cases of accidents after intercourse resulting from vascular and muscular spasms involved in the process of detumescence. Fainting, vomiting, and the urge to urinate often occur in young people after their first sexual intercourse. Epilepsy was rare. Sometimes there were injuries to various organs, even a ruptured spleen. In mature men, cerebral hemorrhage occurred after sexual intercourse as a result of an inability to resist high blood pressure. In elderly men, sexual intercourse often caused death; there are many examples of old men dying after sexual intercourse with their young wives or prostitutes.**

**The famous Russian general Skobelev died while cohabiting with a young girl, possibly a prostitute. Researcher Robinson draws attention to the case of a judge who died shortly after having intercourse with a girl in a brothel, and the case of a 70-year-old man who died after sexual intercourse with a prostitute. Such sad cases usually occur with older men as a result of sexual intimacy with young girls.**

**Acton, a famous researcher in the field of medicine, writes that in some people, orgasm is accompanied by processes resembling a mild form of epilepsy. After sexual intercourse, the nervous system becomes exhausted for a while. This was also observed in rabbits, which, after each copulation, fell into a mild epileptic seizure and rolled their eyes back. The animals often had several spasmodic convulsions of their hind limbs and gasped for a while until their nervous system recovered. Acton mentions fatal cases that occurred in brothels as a result of the adverse effects of orgasm on the nervous system and the body as a whole, especially in sensitive people. Geddes and Thomson, in their book, ‚ÄúThe Development of Sex,‚Äù refer to the fact that some species of spiders die after fertilizing the female. Similar cases occur in some species of insects.**

**After sexual intercourse, any living creature experiences a temporary decrease in disease resistance, fatigue, and low energy. ""Reproduction (procreation) is the beginning of death**

**. The loss of lecithin and phosphorus with each loss of semen in any case leads to a temporary deficiency of these substances in the body, as a result of which the nervous system and the brain suffer first of all. Psychiatric hospitals are overflowing with patients who have suffered as a result of excessive sexual activity. A lack of lecithin has a very detrimental effect on the brain; measurements have shown that all mentally ill people have a deficiency of this substance.**

**The greatest geniuses of antiquity and modern times reached the peak of their creativity precisely during periods of forced abstinence. Examples include Dante, who wrote The Divine Comedy while in exile, and Miguel de Cervantes, who wrote Don Quixote in prison. Milton wrote Paradise Lost while blind, unable to have sex. Newton kept his mind sharp until he was 80 thanks to abstinence, and the same can be said for Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and many other great geniuses.**

**""With every loss of semen, you lose the best of your body; every drop of semen lost will be compensated for by your blood. Semen must be reabsorbed by the body and become the material for the formation of healthy muscles, joints, bones, and brain. By throwing away semen, you are throwing away your life.**

**""When you see phenomena such as paralysis, apoplexy, rheumatism, brain diseases, tired, exhausted faces, slumped shoulders, when young people turn into old people before their time, you can be sure that this is the result of excessive semen loss and the harmful effects of orgasm and sexual abuse.**

**""You will observe these consequences around you. The consequences will be denied, all diseases of the body will be explained by any other causes, but we assure you that nothing is as exhausting as excessive sexual activity, and any sexual intercourse is excessive if it does not have the purpose of conceiving children.**

**‚ÄúThe consequences of disobeying this law are a shortened life and an increase in diseases, examples of which can be seen everywhere.‚Äù According to Acton, sexual orgasm resembles an epileptic seizure in its manifestations and effects. Mental weakness and physical exhaustion are always companions of sexual orgasm. Acton says that only very healthy, sexually mature men can endure a moderate sex life without consequences. Young people, on the other hand, must preserve all their vitality for growth and development.**

**Dr. Ryan writes that sexual intercourse can be compared to an electric shock; it affects both the mind and body, and the effect is so great that a person cannot hear or see anything for a few seconds, and some people even die after sexual intercourse. This is why sexual intercourse is dangerous after serious injuries, bleeding, etc. This is how Rouband describes the effects of sexual orgasm, comparing it to a mild epileptic seizure:**

**""Blood circulation accelerates, the beating of the arteries intensifies, venous blood, blocked by muscle contractions, increases the overall body temperature, and this temporary stagnation, especially in the brain, as a result of neck muscle contractions and sometimes throwing the head back, causes a sharp accumulation of blood in the brain tissue, at which time perception of the surrounding world is lost and the ability to think is suspended. The eyes take on a characteristic exhausted, inflamed appearance. Often, during orgasm, the eyes are completely closed spasmodically to avoid contact with light. Breathing quickens, sometimes interrupts, and may be completely suspended by spasmodic contractions of the larynx, and the air, compressed for a while, is finally exhaled in the form of moans or fragments of words. The jaws, tightly clenched, often injure the teeth, lips, or even the shoulders of the partner. This frenzied state lasts for a very short time, but it is enough to exhaust the body's strength, especially that of a human being.**

**Professor Lidstone believes that the consequences of sexual excess are similar to those of masturbation; in both cases, there is a change in blood composition and overall metabolism as a result of the loss of lecithin, cholesterol, iron, calcium, phosphorus, etc. Nowadays, it is widely believed that, unlike masturbation, sexual intercourse is harmless under any conditions and in any quantity. However, Lidstone strongly disagrees with this statement. He believes that sexual excess is the most common cause of many diseases in modern society. Moreover, according to the professor, sexual excesses have a detrimental effect not only on the male but also on the female body.**

**This is how Tissot describes the consequences of sexual excesses:**

**""Sexual excesses disrupt the functioning of virtually all organs... Digestion and perspiration are disrupted. Rheumatic pains appear, as well as characteristic weakness in the back (posture disorder), underdevelopment of the genitals, loss of appetite, headaches, etc. In short, nothing shortens life as much as the abuse of sexual pleasures.**

**Dr. Telmi states that frequent sexual intercourse leads to anemia, muscle and nerve asthenia, malabsorption of food, malnutrition, and mental exhaustion. People who are overly fond of sexual pleasures can be recognized by their pale, elongated, flabby faces, which are sometimes particularly tense. These people are depressed and usually completely unsuitable for any laborious, prolonged physical or mental work.**

**Professor von Gruber believes that frequent loss of seminal fluid leads to a ‚Äúreduction in specific internal secretion of the testicles,‚Äù which would otherwise enter the bloodstream. Depression, fatigue and general exhaustion, a feeling of pressure in the head, insomnia, ringing in the ears, spots before the eyes, fear of bright light, tremors, excessive sweating, muscle weakness, memory loss, neurasthenia, inability to perform mental and physical work, and decreased digestive efficiency are, according to the professor, the consequences of sexual excesses for men.**

**What is excess? Any sexual act that does not have the purpose of conceiving children is, in essence, an excess. Man is sexually perverted. He is the only animal that supports prostitution, the only animal that is demoralized by all forms of sexual perversion, the only animal whose male attacks females, the only animal where the woman's desire is not law, the only one who does not use his sexual energy in harmony, as nature intended.**

**Of all mammals, only civilized man suffers from a cult of sexual gratification and unhealthy sexual excesses that he himself has invented. Wild animals mate only at certain times of the year and only for the purpose of reproduction. Civilized man practices this act all the time, and in most cases without the goal of conception. On the other hand, as Havelock Ellis notes, more primitive human races, leading a more natural lifestyle, are much more chaste and do not suffer from sexual excesses. This should lead us to believe that the sex lives of civilized men are unnatural, and that their excessive sexual activity is not due to natural instinct, but rather to artificial social stimuli, as well as a high-protein diet (combined with a lack of physical activity), tobacco, alcohol, and coffee, sexually stimulating literature, movies, conversations, etc. This may well explain why civilized people give birth to defective offspring much more often than primitive peoples (savages) and animals.**

**The ancient Spartans were a people with high sexual ethics, among whom the practice of abstaining from sexual excesses was widespread. Men and women lived separately, even when married.**

**In order to preserve chastity, which Lycurgus (the lawgiver of Sparta) considered essential for preserving the energy of the Spartan race, he (Lycurgus) prohibited the consumption of meat and other stimulating foods and introduced a vegetarian diet. Alcohol was also banned. Lycurgus also prohibited eating at home so that the people of Sparta would only eat at communal tables, thus controlling their diet and, in this way, controlling their ethics. The people of Sparta became famous throughout the world for their morality, bravery, and physical and mental development.**",3,1760555046.0,conspiracy_commons,1,0.8,False

1o7jz9j,https://v.redd.it/4gjnbkzupbvf1,Why Do We Say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fine‚Äù When We‚Äôre Not?,"How conversational habits reveal what we hide‚Äîand what we need

üì¶ Framing the Question
We‚Äôve all done it. Someone asks, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù and out comes the automatic, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù But why do we default to this‚Äîeven when we‚Äôre anything but fine? Through the lens of conversational analysis, this everyday phrase reveals a lot about social rituals, emotional management, and how language maintains balance between honesty and politeness. By unpacking what ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù really means, we uncover how talk functions not just to share information‚Äîbut to preserve connection, dignity, and rhythm in human interaction.

The Hidden Mechanics of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fine‚Äù

From a conversational analysis (CA) perspective, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù are part of an adjacency pair‚Äîa two-part conversational structure where the first utterance sets up an expected response.

This isn‚Äôt about truth‚Äîit‚Äôs about cooperation. The exchange keeps conversation flowing smoothly and avoids friction. In linguistics, this is called phatic communication‚Äîlanguage used not to convey meaning, but to maintain social ties.

In other words, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really ask how you are. It says, ‚ÄúI acknowledge you.‚Äù And ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù means, ‚ÄúI acknowledge you back.‚Äù It‚Äôs a verbal handshake‚Äîbrief, predictable, and socially efficient.

Facework: Protecting Ourselves and Others

Linguists Brown and Levinson introduced the idea of facework‚Äîhow people manage their public image (‚Äúface‚Äù) in conversation. Saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù often protects both parties‚Äô face needs.

Positive face: We want to be seen as stable, competent, and pleasant.
Negative face: We don‚Äôt want to impose our problems or create discomfort.
If a stranger or coworker asks ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù and we answer, ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm not doing well,‚Äù it can feel like an emotional overshare in a casual context. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù politely upholds the social script while keeping our inner world private.

It‚Äôs not deception‚Äîit‚Äôs diplomacy.

When ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fine‚Äù Becomes Emotional Code

Of course, tone and timing can change everything. In CA, these subtle cues‚Äîpauses, sighs, emphasis‚Äîare called prosodic markers, and they‚Äôre often more revealing than words.

Compare:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù (neutral tone) ‚Üí routine completion of a social ritual.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ fine.‚Äù (hesitation) ‚Üí emotional leakage; a cue for empathy.
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM FINE!‚Äù (emphatic) ‚Üí defensive signal; emotional denial or frustration.
In these cases, the structure stays the same, but the music changes. The words are camouflage; the delivery is the truth. Skilled listeners pick up on this and use ‚Äúrepair moves‚Äù‚Äîquestions or acknowledgments that gently re-open the conversational space.

Example:
Friend: ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù
You: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù (hesitant)
Friend: ‚ÄúJust fine, or one of those ‚Äòfine but hanging on‚Äô kinds?‚Äù

That moment shifts the script‚Äîfrom surface talk to sincere connection.

Real-World Example: From Small Talk to Real Talk

Picture a morning coffee line.
Barista: ‚ÄúHey there, how are you?‚Äù
Customer: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, thanks.‚Äù

Quick, smooth, socially tidy. Now picture the same question between two friends who‚Äôve seen each other struggle.
Friend: ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù
You: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù
Friend: (pauses) ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

The same question now carries emotional gravity. CA shows that the relationship, setting, and timing reframe meaning. The shift from ritual to authenticity often starts not with the words, but with how they‚Äôre heard.

Breaking the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fine‚Äù Reflex

To build deeper conversations without breaking social norms:

Reframe your question: Instead of ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù, try ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been good lately?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your energy this week?‚Äù
Upgrade your answer: Even a small truth helps‚Äî‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a busy week, but I‚Äôm managing.‚Äù
Listen for the unsaid: Watch for tone, pacing, and body language‚Äîyour empathy begins where the words end.
The goal isn‚Äôt to abolish ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù but to become aware of when it‚Äôs a shield and when it‚Äôs a bridge.

üß≠ Summary

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù is a masterclass in conversational choreography‚Äîa phrase that smooths interactions, preserves dignity, and maintains rhythm. Through conversational analysis, we see it not as dishonesty but as a balancing act between truth and social grace. By learning to read the patterns beneath our talk, we can transform everyday small talk into opportunities for real connection.

My girlfriend disappeared for 4 hours one night and now I found out she called her ex right before‚Ä¶,"So for a little back story, my girlfriend had met up with her ex to get some paperwork worked out. After the papers were done getting worked out they went separate ways as far as I know. An hour later she went to a fast food place and ordered some food and then her location went off completely, this was at 11pm at night when it happened. When she got home it was at 3am in the morning and I asked her where she had been because her location had blanketed that day and that I noticed her location had gone off. She stated she never turned her location off but did turn her airplane mode when she left from getting the paperwork‚Äôs done with her ex. This was at 9ish pm. But her life showed her trip to the fast food restaurant as well as google maps which both showed her disappear from location services at 11pm this was all figured out after she wanted to prove to me she hadn‚Äôt turned her location off and pulled it up herself. She said she went and got some fast food and then got sick and went to her mom‚Äôs to sleep in her car and then came home, she stated she didn‚Äôt turn her location off and has no idea how it turned off but tried to tell me it must have done it itself after her phone died. 

I believed her because she gets sick often from when or what she eats. It‚Äôs pretty normal at times. 

Today we were both working on some paperwork and we needed some call logs from our accounts. After going through my call logs I brought up hers. After bringing up hers she started to get on a weird defense so I decided to log into the account and pull the logs myself. While browsing through the logs I noticed her ex had received a call from her about 2-6 minutes before her location went off. After I noticed the phone calls on the accounts phone logs I decided to pull up her phones direct logs and noticed that she ignored my call that night but called him two times after ignoring my call and then deleted them from her phone. 

I brought up the fact that she deleted them from her phone as if she was hiding something. She continues to state that whatever she says I won‚Äôt believe her and I feel like I have every right not to believe a thing she says. She keeps trying to make me feel like I‚Äôm the bad guy here when I was the one lied too and not to mention it was her ex and the last calls that were made that night was between them. After that night he started to message her more asking if she wanted to get coffee and hang out or go see a show. Etc. 

I‚Äôm confused and idk what to do tbh, my prior relationships used me and lied up until I was no longer convenient for them and now I‚Äôm hurting again because all I can think is she called him and then disappeared for 4 hours leading me to believe her original story was just a cover up for something else. 

AIO???

Edit: I was asked to give a little more context behind the location blanketing. We had life 360 and when I was on the phone with her before all of this happened she mentioned to look at it because of where she was at that time. When I went to view it had blipped and showed general locations and tbh I didn‚Äôt know how it worked fully. This was the free version and it wouldn‚Äôt give me much detail so I signed up for the free trial membership. After noticing some weird things about it I did a little research on how it worked. The moment she went to work out the paperwork with her ex her location had turned on instantly in the middle of the road and showed the actual trip from that point forward up until the fast food location where the location turned off completely.",5,1760554936.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.86,False
1o7jya8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o7jya8/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_should_be_grateful/,AITA for telling my husband he should be grateful I still want him after I brought my boyfriend into our bed?,"I told my husband he should be grateful I still wanted him after I brought another man into our bed, and he packed his bags before sunrise.

Let me back up. We'd been married for six years. I loved him. I did. But things got stale. I started talking to this guy at my gym three months ago. He was exciting. Dangerous. Everything my husband wasn't. My husband worked from home, wore the same sweats every day, and forgot our anniversary two years running. I felt invisible.

So when gym guy suggested we meet up, I said yes. It started as coffee. Then hotel rooms. Then I got this insane idea. Why hide it? Why sneak around like some teenager? My husband and I were equals. Partners. I could make my own choices about my body and my pleasure.

I sat him down one night after dinner. I said, ""I've been seeing someone. I want to explore this. I think we should open our marriage.""

He just stared at me. His fork was still in his hand. He put it down slowly.

""What?"" he said.

""I need more,"" I told him. ""You've let yourself go. You don't make me feel desired anymore. But I still love you. I'm not leaving. I just want to add someone to our dynamic.""

His face went white. ""You're already sleeping with someone.""

""Yes,"" I said. ""And I want to bring him here. To our home. So we can all be adults about this.""

He stood up. Walked to the bedroom. I followed him.

""Where are you going?"" I asked.

""I need to think,"" he said.

""Think about what? This is happening. You can either accept it or be alone.""

He turned around. His eyes were wet but he wasn't crying. ""You're telling me you cheated and now you want me to watch?""

""It's not cheating if I'm honest about it,"" I said. ""And you don't have to watch. You can leave the house for a few hours. But I'm not going to keep sneaking around. I deserve to feel alive.""

He didn't say anything. He just sat on the bed. I thought I had him. I thought he'd cave because he always caved. He was passive. Agreeable. Safe.

Two days later I brought gym guy home. My husband wasn't there. I texted him. Told him we'd be done by nine. He didn't respond. Fine. Whatever. Gym guy and I spent the afternoon in my bed. Our bed. It felt powerful. Like I was reclaiming something.

My husband came home at ten. He walked past the bedroom without looking at me. Slept on the couch.

The next morning I found him in the kitchen. I tried to talk to him.

""Look,"" I said. ""I know this is hard. But you should be grateful I still want you in my life. Most women would just leave. I'm giving you a choice.""

He looked at me like I was a stranger.

""Grateful,"" he repeated.

""Yes. I could've divorced you. Taken half of everything. Instead I'm trying to make this work for both of us.""

He nodded slowly. Then he said, ""I'm going to visit my brother for a few days.""

I shrugged. ""Fine. Take your time.""

He left that afternoon. I thought he'd be back in a week. Maybe two.

But three days later his brother called me. He was screaming. Calling me every name you can imagine. He said my husband told him everything. That his whole family knew. That I was a selfish piece of garbage who destroyed a good man.

I hung up. Then my phone started blowing up. My mother in law. My sister in law. Even my husband's friends. People I'd known for years. They all had something to say.

Then my own family found out. My sister called me crying. She said I humiliated her. That everyone at her church was talking about it. My mom said she didn't raise me to be this kind of person.

But it gets worse.

My husband cleaned out our joint bank account. Not all of it. Just his half. But it left me scrambling to pay bills. Then he filed for divorce. His lawyer sent me a letter detailing everything. The affair. The ""open marriage"" demand. My exact words about him being grateful.

Gym guy stopped answering my texts after the first week. Turns out he wasn't looking for anything serious. Shocker.

My husband won't talk to me. His lawyer does all the communicating. I tried to call him once and he blocked my number. I showed up at his brother's house and his brother threatened to call the cops.

Now I'm sitting in this empty house. Half my friends won't speak to me. The other half lecture me about respect and boundaries. My job is awkward because someone told my boss and now everyone looks at me weird.

I thought I was being honest. I thought I was standing up for my needs. But nobody sees it that way. They all think I'm some kind of monster. My own mother said I threw away a man who loved me for cheap thrills.

And the worst part? I miss him. I miss my husband. I miss the boring routine. I miss him reading on the couch while I watched TV. I miss his stupid jokes. But it's too late. He's gone. Really gone.

I tried to send him an email last week. I said I was sorry. That I made a mistake. That I wanted to fix things. He responded with two words. ""We're done.""

His family is telling everyone what happened. My reputation is destroyed. I can't go anywhere without someone whispering. Last week I ran into his cousin at the grocery store and she said, ""You got what you deserved.""

Maybe she's right. I don't know anymore.

**Did I really destroy my marriage by asking for honesty, or was I just cruel and selfish the whole time?**

I'm not perfect by any means, I have bad days just like everyone else, I had moments where I wasn't patient, where I said things I didn't mean, where I didn't understand what you were saying and assumed it would work itself out because we each had more pressing matters to deal with.

However, you only seeing these things and blaming me for all the issues between us is so super bogus.

You're not inherently special however you were special to me, you are not necessarily the most beautiful woman in the world however you were to me, you wanted a strong man who offered: compassion, loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, empathy, respect, dominance while maintaining a softer side, romance, leadership qualities, outgoing personality, a sensual sexual appetite, cuddles, forehead kisses, sweet moments, dancing in shower together, cooking together, spending time enjoying each other's company, laughs because I'm honestly a funny motherfucker, you wanted uppies, holding hands, night rides, going on adventures, staying home and just chilling, someone who actually helped with chores, someone who walked an hour to your work just so he could see you, someone who knew your coffee order and would surprise you with food while you were at work, someone who loved your dog as she was their own, someone who showed up and didn't judge you for your flaws, someone who didn't put you down but rather went above and beyond to pick you up, someone who got you flowers, someone who rubbed your feet after a long day, someone who gave you massages because you were in pain, someone who made you dinner and a bubble bath because you had a rough day at work, some who was gentle with you, someone who saw you as the brightest star in their sky, someone who wanted to see you succeed, someone who not only hugged you but held you in their arms, someone who offered safety, someone who spent their free time going to the farm with you despite not wanting to go, someone who didn't prioritize video games over you, someone who moved their boundaries in order to see you smile.

How and why you or anyone would throw that away in order to have empty sexual moments or to find ""friendship"" away from them or push them away is honestly crazy to me.

It's not you showing up for yourself, it's you being selfish. It's you choosing to not be happy and appreciating what / who you have. It's narcissistic. It's abusive. Running away because things aren't perfect isn't love. Love is choosing someone and accepting the good with bad & working together in order to have more good than bad.

You never posted us on your socials, you never introduced me to your friends, you even went as far as wanting me to come with you to hang out at one of their houses and you left me in the car for hours as if I was uncared for dog while you and her had lunch. Tell me my love do these things sound like things a good friend would do? Furthermore had I done that to you would you not have gotten upset and called me a bad boyfriend? Was I wrong to go through your phone? Yes absolutely. However finding you show an interest in sexting some other guy is a level of disrespect that I would've told you it was over and you needed to move out but I didn't, I got upset and asked about it, you deflected and I let it go.

The difference between us is many and yet no matter what you did or said that I didn't like, that pushed my boundaries, I still stayed the same man to you and chose to see your good qualities because I love you.

My traumas didn't make me heartless but you.. you made me feel like I'm nothing. As if I don't deserve to be treated with the same love I give. You fucked me up and you don't even care.

If someone had told me I'd ever talk about something like this, I would've laughed. But here I am, typing this with shaky hands.

It started on one of those strangely warm October Saturdays when the air smells like dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just to drink some coffee at the top and look at the city.
I've always liked that place. There's something heavy about it, old and alive somehow. The Turks called it ""Djendem"" which means ""hell."" My grandmother used to tell me that at night you could hear footsteps up there, but you should never ask who it is. I laughed back then. I would not now.
It was around noon. The sun was strong, the air was trembling, and everything was quiet in a strange way. We sat on the rocks near the antenna and watched Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. After a while, Petar went silent. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
""Do you see that down there?"" he asked.

At first I thought it was a man. But the more I stared, the less human it looked. I could not make out any details, no clothes, no face, no reflection from the sun. It wasn't just black. It was the kind of black that eats the light around it, like a hole in the world.

Then I smelled it. Burnt metal, mixed with something rotten. Petar cursed and said we should leave. I wanted to move, but my body wouldn‚Äôt listen. The thing turned toward us. Not like a person. It didn't move, just shifted, like space itself bent the wrong way.
The air suddenly felt heavy. Everything went dead silent, no birds, no wind, even the city noise disappeared.

Then came the sound. Not really a voice, more like a whisper scraping against metal. I could not understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my head instead of my ears.

And then it was gone. No movement, no sound, just empty air where it had been. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we reached the bottom, neither of us said a word. He looked pale, like he hadn't slept in days. Then he said quietly, ""Don‚Äôt call me. I do not want to remember this"", and walked away.
The next day I texted him. No answer. Two days later I heard he'd been taken to the hospital. His mother said he woke up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven't been the same since. At night, when I turn off the lights, I keep seeing something move at the edge of my vision. Shapes darker than the dark. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that faint metallic whisper, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week I was standing on my balcony. You can see the whole hill from there. Right on the top, where we sat that day, I saw it again. A black figure, still as a statue, watching the city below.
Maybe I'm imagining things. Maybe fear's just messing with my head.
But deep down, I know one thing.

The snappy blog posts, the catchy social media captions, the endless product descriptions‚Äîyet somehow you‚Äôre still not raking in the dough.  What gives? ü§î

Here‚Äôs the thing: **your AI content isn‚Äôt just clever wordplay; it‚Äôs a money-making machine waiting to be unleashed!** üí∞ You just need to tap into its full potential. 

Here are a few easy peasy ways to turn your AI content into cold, hard cash faster than you can say ‚Äúpass me another coffee, please‚Äù:

- **Diversify your content**: Why stop at just one platform? Repurpose that stellar AI content! Turn blog posts into infographics, snippets into tweets, and long articles into podcasts. More formats = more eyeballs = more cash. Ka-ching!

- **Know your audience**: Get inside their heads. What keeps them up at night? How can your content solve their burning questions? Tailoring your content to fit their needs is like handing them a jackpot they never knew they needed. üí•

- **Create packages**: If you‚Äôre offering services like writing or social media management, package your AI-generated content into sweet deals. Discounts for bulk orders? Give them more reasons to hit that checkout button!

- **Monetize your expertise**: Think mastermind groups, exclusive webinars, or mini-courses. If you‚Äôve become a wizard with AI content creation, share your magic! People are out there ready to pay for the secret sauce.

- **Stay ahead of trends**: The digital content landscape is always shifting. Leveraging trending topics can give your content a viral boost. Remember that one random TikTok dance that made everyone‚Äôs day? Find trends and sprinkle them into your content. üéâ

- **Networking, baby!**: Join communities (like this one!), attend webinars, or just, you know, engage with fellow creators. You'd be amazed at the opportunities that come knocking when you share your content successes with others. Collaboration over competition, am I right?

So, why are we still twiddling our thumbs? It‚Äôs time to roll up those sleeves, embrace your AI tools, and watch your content blossom into something that not only feeds your passion but pays the bills too! üåü

My mom‚Äôs a teacher. It‚Äôs always been her dream job. She doesn‚Äôt earn a fortune, but her salary‚Äôs steady and it‚Äôs enough for us to live without real problems. My dad, on the other hand, has had about eleven different jobs in wood processing over the last eighteen years. He‚Äôs always been ‚Äúlaid off‚Äù when there were redundancies, and he always says it‚Äôs because of ‚Äúdouchebag bosses.‚Äù

When he was younger, he wanted to be an artist. He paints and does wood carvings, which are lovely. Due to his parents being ""problematic"" to the communist system at the time, he hadn't been allowed into art school, so he ended up in an agriculture institute instead. I guess that broke something in him.

At home, things were always calm but tense. My parents didn‚Äôt fight, but everyone sort of accepted that my mom was the main provider while Dad just... floated. My grandpa (my mom‚Äôs dad) openly mocked him, which I hated even as a kid.

This summer, I finished my third year of high school (we have four years after elementary school here). My dad helped me get a part-time job at his company, and I was honestly happy about it. I wanted my own money for summer music festivals and didn‚Äôt want to ask my parents.

From the start, I noticed something off. The men at the workshop would smirk around my dad and act kind of dismissive toward him, and by extension, me. I just kept my head down and worked hard. I‚Äôm studying IT, but I actually find manual work kind of relaxing. You can switch off your brain and just do. After a while, the other guys warmed up to me.

Since the beginning, I 've been noticing my dad‚Äôs work habits. He did his assigned jobs, but so slowly. Like, painfully slow. The big moment came when there was a lull in production, and he was told to repaint the workshop‚Äôs front facade. It was a simple job, something you could do in a day. Three days later, he‚Äôd only applied a primer coat. Every time I came to say hi during my breaks, he was drinking coffee and sketching ideas in his notebook for what he‚Äôd like to paint instead. When I said gently that it was just supposed to be white paint, he got frustrated and said, ""Anyone could do that.""

That‚Äôs when it clicked. This is his whole life pattern. If something doesn‚Äôt feel meaningful or creative to him, he drags it out or loses motivation completely. And whenever he does something he‚Äôs passionate about, it ends badly because he can‚Äôt just do it ‚Äúthe way the boss wants.‚Äù

I felt for him. I get that it must suck to be an artist in a world that only values efficiency. But when I told him that Mom works herself to the bone, taking every extra qualification and training just to bring in more money, he said that it's different because ""she‚Äôs doing what she loves.""

That really stung.

So now I‚Äôm quietly judging him. I still love him, and I get that his dreams were crushed by the system, but part of me thinks he‚Äôs used that as an excuse for almost two decades while Mom carried the family.

AITA for judging my dad for not contributing more ‚Äî even if his job kills his character a little each day?",3,1760554339.0,AITAH,7,0.64,False

1o7jn7a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7jn7a,Blur India Perfume Review,"Picked up Blur India perfumes from a sale. An impulse purchase purely based on reviews I read and decided to do a blind buy. Smells Like Breakfast In Bed is..an interesting name for a fragrance line. Another Indian brand that is venturing into perfumes, I didn't have high hopes but the packaging is what stood out to me, along with the whole visuals around breakfast desserts (even though the whole edible thing is a little overdone). Plus they're affordable, all under 500 so I thought might aswell try take the risk. The box said these require maceration so I left them in the fridge for a day. Tried them on 2 days later and oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised. I went in expecting nothing from these perfumes because of their price points (and the fact that everyone is jumping on to the perfume bandwagon), but this turned out to be a good buy.

Crucial review points-
1. These are in 2 sizes, 50ml price at 799 and 30ml priced at 499. They also have a discovery set of all 5 at 399 (which i recommend you get before blind buying) So overall, in the extremely affordable category. 
2. These are all gourmand, sweet vanilla heavy scents.
3. The brand mentions these are freshly brewed, hence maceration is required. I kept them in the fridge for 24 hours, and then left them in my cupboard without their caps for a day or two.

Now coming down to the actual performance of the perfume-- I was pretty impressed. 

Vanilla melts- A mix of woody, vanilla and a hint of fruity notes, just hit the right spots. It's an absolute delight if you're into vanilla fragrances. It last 6-7 odd hours and is a perfect balance of sweet, musky and woody. Did remind me of Vanilla 28.

Cookie crumble took the cake for me. The mesh of florals and vanilla is subtle, yet impressive. It's not a groundbreaking scent, and I feel I have smelled this in some other fragrance, but can't recall. And I think it is an original scent. Lasts pretty good, about 6+ hours on my skin. Opens very floral and sweet, simmers down to a soft woody, musky vanilla. Hands down, my favorite. I actually did not expect to like this one so much. Lasts longer than most floral perfumes I have. PSA: Does not smell like cookies unless you're putting flowers in your cookies. The scent is floral with hint of vanilla.

Coffee Cake- Smells like lighter version of Kamrah Qahwa. I have the OG so yeah, it's between kamrah and kamrah qahwa. Performs the best out of all 3. Lasted almost 9-10hours and there was a faint smell even after 10 hours!

Pros and cons:
Very affordable. Probably the best looking perfumes in the affordable category. Excellent projection. Good lasting on most variants.

Cons: Gourmand, sweet fragrances are a bit oversaturated in the market. 
I didn't like the wooden caps. If it was a normal metal or plastic would've been sturdier.

Overall my review would be 3.5/5 for the notes- they are not synthetic smelling at all which is a huge plus, 4/5 for the packaging- it's genz and cute, 4.5/5 for the projection and lasting on these. I'd say these are good for everyday affordable scent options.",2,1760554276.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

Im planning a high school final project. It is supposed to be a espresso type machine, capable of delivering coffee either with handpump or connected to system seen on picture. Principle is pretty easy, a input is sent with one of the buttons which determines lenght of pumping. Microcontroller processes the input and sends signal to a heating element, heating water inside pump, temperature sensor placed after the heating element monitors water temperature, after reaching desired temperature(94-96C) microcontroller sends signal to vibrational pump which starts pumping for desired coffee volume, with the temperature sensor controlling the temperature of the water. 

Pretty simple in concept, idk how much harder it will be. Probably both the heating element and the pump are 230V so controlled by relay. 

Problem is I have 0 experience with programming microcontrollers and very small experience in programming in general. I would like to hear how possible this is, what could be the limitations and if there are any things i could simplify. And the biggest question is what MC should i choose for this use if normal ardurino would be ok or if i need esp32.

Her hands trembled as she fought back the urge to pull out her notebook and begin writing down everything she had seen.

The armour that Anita and her soldiers wore could make them invisible. That she could believe; after all, the Shimmer Wolves had the same ability, thanks to their fur. But something as big as the Chameleon? It went beyond anything she could‚Äôve expected.

The shock and surprise of seeing the entire truck appear out of thin air were still fresh, even though almost half an hour had passed. It terrified her, the thought that one of these people could be anywhere they wanted to be and no one would even know.

*‚ÄúPeople.‚Äù* Layla looked up at the soldier, now unmasked, sitting across from her.  
*‚ÄúYes. They are people. Same as I, Elisia, or Her Majesty.‚Äù*

The mage remembered her time as a student of magic in the Holy City of Larmuth. Thanks to being friends with a noble‚Äôs daughter who also attended the school, Layla had the rare opportunity of riding inside a chariot powered solely by mana crystals. Being inside the Chameleon was nothing like that. The vehicle was perfectly silent, and its movement felt incredibly smooth.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù The driver spoke, snapping Layla back to reality.

*‚ÄúAlready?‚Äù* She thought, lamenting the fact that the vehicle had no windows besides the ones in the driver‚Äôs cabin. The mage would‚Äôve loved to see just how fast they were going.

The back door opened, and the soldiers all hopped out one by one, with Layla being the last to exit the Chameleon. A large shadow was cast on the snowy ground, a shadow that belonged to that which brought unrivalled fear to the Vatur elves.

The mage‚Äôs eyes went wide when she turned to look at the gargantuan monster made of metal. The Iron Fortress stood before her, its cold barrel still aimed in the direction of the Vatur kingdom‚Äôs Home Tree, which wasn‚Äôt even visible in the distance. She heard about it time and time again, but seeing it in person was a whole different story. If there ever were any doubts in her mind about the weapons capabilities, those thoughts were irrevocably gone.

Layla‚Äôs attention was so glued to the Iron Fortress that she didn‚Äôt even notice when the soldiers dragged the elven general from the vehicle when she struggled and mumbled barely comprehensible curses at them in her native language. Despite being stripped of all her armour, Eirlys was still heavily restrained. Cuffs that looked like metal gloves kept her arms behind her back, ensuring she couldn‚Äôt even snap her fingers. As the otherworlders were by now familiar with the spell known as ‚ÄúStep‚Äù, they made sure to cuff the general‚Äôs legs too, with heavy-looking cuffs around her ankles.

Lastly, and Layla wasn‚Äôt sure if this was to prevent Eirlys from chanting anything or just to humiliate her further, the Warhound known as Anita personally muzzled the elf with a piece of oily, foul-smelling cloth she found in the back of the vehicle. ¬†

Eirlys had her feet dug into the ground, resisting the soldiers who tried dragging her with them. It wasn‚Äôt until Howler approached the elf gleefully and drove her right fist into the general‚Äôs stomach that the elf stopped struggling against the men who held her.

The mage and the cat both looked at the Warhound with disgust. Layla wanted to speak up, to tell the cruel woman that such actions were unnecessary, but she was never the type to do so. In truth, a lot of Layla‚Äôs confidence came from her friends and companions, especially Elisia, as Mitsy wasn‚Äôt the talkative type at all.

While Layla did trust the three men that she got to know quite well, she was still very anxious about being surrounded by so many otherworlders, especially considering how aggressive Anita and her unit seemed to be. It was more than just plain aggression. Layla could understand if Anita had an axe to grind with the elf, but she didn‚Äôt. The female Warhound just seemed to view Eirlys as a little more than a plaything, like the elf wasn‚Äôt truly alive or, at the very least, like her life had no worth on its own.

As the group walked through the entrance to the outpost, a thought crossed the mage‚Äôs mind.  
*‚ÄúWere the three former prisoners always as friendly as she came to know them to be? Or were they just like Anita at some point in time? If so, would they return to how they were, now that they were reunited with their people?‚Äù*

Layla didn‚Äôt have much time to dwell on that thought because the very moment they stepped into the outpost, one of the soldiers guarding the entrance shouted and raised his weapon, his aim trained on something in the faraway fields. The group all turned around at once, except the men who still held the exhausted and battered General Eirlys.

‚ÄúSomeone is approaching, Sir.‚Äù The soldier said to Clyde while looking through the scope of his rifle.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a woman, dressed like a knight. Blonde. On horseback and moving very fast. I have a clear shot; say the word and I‚Äôll drop her.‚Äù

Layla suddenly felt panic begin to flood her as she realized it was Elisia whom the soldier was describing. Fearing that Anita would give the order to fire without hesitation, Layla shouted.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot! She‚Äôs a friend. It‚Äôs Elisia!‚Äù

No gunshot rang out. The mage nervously glanced in Howler‚Äôs direction, fully expecting to be met with a furious glare. To her surprise, Anita remained stoic, eyes locked on Elisia in the distance.

‚ÄúStand down,‚Äù Clyde said to the soldier, before mumbling something to the others.  
‚ÄúWhat happened to the other guys? Why is she alone?‚Äù

Elisia was pushing the animal far beyond its limits. The horse was foaming at the mouth, its muscles overloaded by the haste spell, its lungs burning and heart pounding on the verge of imploding. The Haste spell made it move incredibly fast, enhancing its speed, endurance and allowing the animal to ignore the pain of its body falling apart for as long as the spell was active.

Once she was close enough, Elisia jumped off the animal and tumbled through the snow, no longer having the mana necessary to maintain the spell. With Haste broken, the animal neighed and collapsed as well, grunting and panting as all the accumulated damage to its system hit it all at once.

Clyde raised his right hand next to his head, snapping his fingers and pointing two of them towards the horse. Without hesitation, one of the soldiers fired a single shot, putting the animal out of its misery.

Layla and Jeremy didn‚Äôt even notice; they were too busy rushing to lift Elisia off the ground. The knight was exhausted, her legs barely supported her weight as the pair lifted her to her feet, Jeremy putting Elisia‚Äôs arm over his shoulder to support her weight.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with her?‚Äù He asked Layla, whose facial expression was one of confusion rather than worry.

‚ÄúShe used up a lot of mana. Nothing too serious, she just needs rest.‚Äù The mage replied.

‚ÄúShe reeks of sweat and... burning flesh.‚Äù Mitsura, still sitting on Layla‚Äôs left shoulder, spoke.

Layla noticed the cat‚Äôs discomfort, the way her fur rose as she sniffed Elisia, but Clyde interrupted the mage before she could say more.

The large man moved his hands around while talking to the other soldiers.  
‚ÄúAlright. Enough standing out in the open. Toss the elf somewhere she can‚Äôt escape from and keep her monitored. Howler, I want a mission report before we start interrogating her.‚Äù

Each soldier moved without hesitation. Howler walked off from the group, while the others dragged Eirlys away. With only the ones Layla knew left, Clyde finally turned his attention to Jeremy.  
‚ÄúJeremy, get our friends settled in. Give ‚Äòem something to eat, too. Let me know when Elisia gets her strength back. I want to be there when she tells us what happened.‚Äù

The group entered the outpost together, but Clyde and Marcel soon split from the others and went in a different direction, leaving the three women with the only soldier that they knew. The other otherworlders paid them no mind as they went about their duties. Layla could properly soak in the interior of the outpost due to her attention being primarily focused on Elisia; still, she could not help but notice how cubical everything looked.

Every structure inside the outpost, safe for the Iron Fortress itself, looked like a metallic box with smooth edges. Some were longer than others, but the look and design remained the same. The barracks that Jeremy took them to seemed both sturdy and flimsy at the same time.

Both the knight and the mage were given a bed and a blanket. Mitsura refused both, as she spent the majority of her time in cat form anyway.  
Jeremy helped Layla take Elisia‚Äôs armour off, much to the initial quiet dissatisfaction of the mage. Elisia, while often said to be ‚Äúmarried to the crown‚Äù, was the village beauty in the small place she came from. She avoided suitors like the plague, but that did not mean there wasn‚Äôt an overabundance of men still willing to put their confidence on the line to try and win her hand.

While the knight was far from naked beneath the armour, she did wear it more than regular clothing, to the point that Queen Kyara often joked that Elisia would even wear it to her own wedding. Even though it was just armour, Elisia firmly stood by the decision that if any man wanted to undress her in any way, he would first have to place a wedding bracelet on her wrist. Layla did not like that the first man to ‚Äòstrip‚Äô her friend would be one from an entirely different world, but the mage knew the sooner she got Elisia out of the armour, the better.

The more the armour was removed, the more Layla‚Äôs dissatisfaction at the situation turned to surprise. Elisia wore fabrics that clung tightly to her curvy form, even more so now that they were soaked in sweat. Yet Jeremy showed no interest at all in nature‚Äôs artistic craftsmanship, his eyes only moving from one part of the armour to the next, and his hands quickly followed.

Once no armour besides the boots remained, he stood up and told the mage to remove the sweat-soaked blouse Elisia wore.  
‚ÄúGet that shirt off of her before she catches a cold or worse. I‚Äôll see to find her some replacement clothes in the meantime.‚Äù

With those words, he turned on his heels and walked outside the barracks, stationing two soldiers to guard the entrance to the box.

\*\*\*

Colonel Clyde Sullivan sat in his quarters, reading Howler‚Äôs mission report and smoking. Anita‚Äôs mission was a success, had no casualties and even netted them a prisoner they could question. Had Clyde been reading the report a year ago, he wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about what was written on it. But now, after everything he had learned about the elves, mages, and, to some extent, how magic worked, the Warhound couldn‚Äôt help but feel something was wrong about the whole clash between Anita‚Äôs unit and Eirlys‚Äôs elves. And that pestering feeling had nothing to do with his people, but with the elves.

Eirlys, despite not having ever encountered a foe like Anita and her unit before, still responded to the attack and handled the situation extremely well. For a time, at least. According to the report, which Clyde was now reading through a second time, the structure of the elven defence started to crumble the very second that the protective dome of branches and trees began to come undone.

If there was one fact that was drilled into Clyde‚Äôs head over and over since he came to the other world, it was that elves are the best there is, especially when it came to mana and magic. They had more mana, were loved by it, and their long lives allowed them to study it far better than any other race. So, at the very least, one could expect them to know their own limits and understand which spell would best fit a certain situation.

Acquiring the rank of general wasn‚Äôt an easy feat; It demanded time, skill and knowledge. For a race whose lifespan dwarfed that of humans, that rank would probably take over a century for a person to reach. Someone with that level of experience would most certainly know what they can and can‚Äôt do, even if the enemy were entirely alien to them.

‚ÄúIf you know yourself, but not the enemy‚Ä¶‚Äù Clyde mumbled, taking a long drag from the cigarillo.

He put the report down, exhaling smoke while looking up at the ceiling.  
*‚ÄúSummoning or awakening the forest was a smart move. Countering the enemy that is unknown with something unknown to them. They must‚Äôve planned to wall themselves off and wait for reinforcement.‚Äù*

Clyde had seen a lot of Hail Marys in his time. Never once was one used as an opening to a performance. Summoning the woods to protect them and occupy the enemy until backup arrived wasn‚Äôt a last-ditch effort. It was something that the elven general was certain would work. Something she believed wouldn‚Äôt, couldn‚Äôt fail, judging by how chaotic the fight became once the forest began to abandon them. Enchanted fire arrows, that was a Hail Mary attempt; a desperate struggle to push the enemy back.

If Eirlys and her soldiers put such trust in the forest, why did it fail? Why did it abandon them?

The Colonel sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose, lowering his head and taking another drag from the cigar. He felt like there was more to it than just a spell backfiring, but he didn‚Äôt have enough information to draw any theories from. At least not theories that he could use as a basis for any plans moving forward.

He hoped whatever they could squeeze from the captured elf would provide enough information to draw a solid conclusion.

Clyde shifted his gaze from the table in front of him to the door of his cube that was open without warning. Marcel walked in with a smile on his face, as if summoned by the coffee aroma of the tobacco that Sullivan smoked.

‚ÄúChrist, fifty-five years and you never learned to knock. What if I was sliming it in here?‚Äù The massive man asked with a grin.

‚ÄúThen the door would be locked, I hope.‚Äù Replied Marcel, grabbing and unfolding a chair from the corner.

Clyde pulled another cigar from the box and tossed it to the much shorter man, his grin widening.  
‚ÄúNah, brother. Wiiiideee open.‚Äù

Marcel lit the cigar, taking a few puffs, followed by a long drag, before he slumped in the chair. He savoured the flavour and aroma for a few seconds before exhaling.  
‚ÄúThe knight woke up.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, she can wait a little longer. The sun has already set, it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs gonna go anywhere now.‚Äù

The short Warhound took the cigarillo and looked at it from an angle for a second, as if inspecting it..  
‚ÄúI missed these.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, right? If those elven fucks got their hands on us, I doubt they‚Äôd let us get one last puff before offing us. Besides, whatever they smoke probably tastes like dandelions and pixie dust or someshit.‚Äù Clyde replied with a chuckle, closing his eyes as if that would enhance the sensation of smoking.

The two smoked in silence for about a minute before Marcel spoke again.  
‚ÄúI feel kind of bad for the guards. Real shame.‚Äù

Clyde stared at the ceiling, blowing rings of smoke in between words.  
‚ÄúYeah. They were solid dudes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think happened?‚Äù The major asked.

The behemoth of a man shrugged.  
‚ÄúProbably elven reinforcements. They must have arrived just after we left. Elisia and the guys weren‚Äôt quick enough to get the fuck out of dodge, so the elves decided to take out their anger on them. There were a bunch of crows flying around instead of feasting on the corpses, like they were fucking drones.‚Äù

Marcel raised an eyebrow and flicked some of the ash on the ground.  
‚ÄúYou think they used crows as scouts?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. Sure hope not, or we would have to shoot every fucking bird we see. But if they could summon an entire forest, roots and all, to fight for them and protect them, why not crows too?‚Äù Clyde replied, tapping the report on the data pad with his right middle finger.  
‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt know until we talk to Elisia.‚Äù

His friend nodded in agreement before slowly getting up from his seat.  
‚ÄúSpeaking of, we should probably go. The curiosity is starting to overwhelm me.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Elisia was never a fan of cucumbers. While she hated eating them as a child, often fussing over the fact that they had no flavour at all, the knight did not like being dressed as one either. The clothes that Jeremy provided as a substitute for her drenched clothing were a standard military long-sleeved shirt and baggy pants with big pockets. Both of which were a darkish green colour.

‚ÄúBetrayal rarely comes from an enemy‚Äù was a human saying, one that rang true on both sides of the gates. And Elisia felt it first-hand, because it was none other than Layla who pointed out how silly the green clothes looked on the knight.

In truth, the clothes and how out of place she looked in them were a welcome distraction. Something to fuss over to keep her mind occupied, to keep the thoughts of her run-in with Aurelia at bay. Though she avoided thinking about it as much as she could, pacing back and forth inside the room and checking the outfit from different angles, Elisia couldn‚Äôt help but face the realisation that she finally understood how Filtz felt after his party disbanded following the dungeon quest.

Ever since the wyvern attack on Perriman‚Äôs duchy did Elisia felt like she had her arms tied behind her back. Like she was helpless and unable to act. She wasn‚Äôt able to keep guards like Savik in line. She wasn‚Äôt able to punish the wrongdoers for their crimes. She wasn‚Äôt able to prevent Perriman‚Äôs escape. She was helpless in the face of her brother‚Äôs turmoil, unable to even see the darkness clutching his heart for so long. If it weren‚Äôt for the three otherworlders, she wouldn‚Äôt have even been able to save Filtz.

The string of failures did not end there. She wasn‚Äôt able to hold on to her anger towards the invaders, wasn‚Äôt even able to follow the Queen‚Äôs orders to the end. The thoughts overwhelmed her, tearing down the flimsy dam of distractions she created.  
*‚ÄúMaybe Aurelia‚Äôs attack wasn‚Äôt random. Maybe she was sent by the Gods as my punishment. To remind me how much I fucked up.‚Äù*

Though the room was quiet and smelled like dirt and rubber, Elisia could still smell the stench of burning. Flesh sticking to metal, the men under her command screaming in agony. She clenched her fists hard, not even feeling the pain of her nails digging into her palms, nor the warm tears rolling down her cheeks.

Layla was still in the room with Elisia, but her presence was no longer registered by the knight. All that she could feel was guilt and rage, which quickly dragged her mind to the darkest of places. It wasn‚Äôt until Layla‚Äôs hand was firmly on her shoulder that she snapped out of it.

Elisia sniffed and quickly wiped her face with the palms of her right hand, while the other tugged on the shirt, pretending to inspect it for the tenth time as she turned to face Layla.  
‚ÄúYou think I should ask if they have a different colour? Maybe something less green?‚Äù

The mage gave no reply. She simply wrapped her arms around the knight, embracing her tightly. What few mental barriers remained were shattered in an instant. Elisia hugged Layla, squeezing her as if she were drowning and the other woman was her only lifeline. No sobs, just soft trembling while she shared her burden.

Their moment was cut short by three loud knocks on the door. Layla took a step back from Elisia, giving the blonde woman some space to compose herself and wipe her face with the shirt. Just as Elisia straightened herself out, the door opened and in walked Clyde and Marcel.

The men looked just like they did when Layla first met them. The tall Warhound‚Äôs head was cleanly shaven, and his beard, while still thick, no longer looked like an unkempt mess. Marcel, on the other hand, kept his hair; however, it was cut very short, same with his beard. Both men looked like entirely different people, now that they wore their usual clothes instead of rags or whatever clothes Elisia‚Äôs mother gave them.

Elisia sat down on her bed, and Layla sat next to her, while the two Warhounds sat on the bed across from them. The question hung in the air before any words were even said.

‚ÄúIt was Aurelia.‚Äù The knight said without hesitation, looking up from her hands, which rested in her lap, towards the men.  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you came to ask, right?‚Äù

Clyde chuckled.  
‚ÄúWell, I was gonna open with asking ‚Äòhow are you feeling?‚Äô‚Äù

Elisia felt the question tug at her heartstrings, drawing out a pitiful smile.  
‚ÄúI would say I‚Äôve been through worse, but then I‚Äôd be a liar.‚Äù

Elisia‚Äôs words hit Layla like a bag of bricks. She had, just like the two Warhounds, assumed Elisia and the guards were attacked by the elven reinforcements. The mage knew her friend would eventually tell her what happened, so she didn‚Äôt press the question immediately when the knight woke up. But she never would‚Äôve guessed who truly was to blame, even if she were given a lifetime to do so.

Aurelia‚Äôs name seemed to hang in the air, and besides Elisia, Layla was the only one who understood its weight. Mitsura had no clue who the High Elf was, and the same applied to Clyde and Marcel.

‚ÄúAurelia? That name supposed to mean something?‚Äù Clyde asked, finally breaking the tense silence.

Elisia wasn‚Äôt surprised at the man‚Äôs lack of appropriate reaction. High Elves never dealt with the world‚Äôs issues directly, but by guiding lesser, mortal races through wisdom and counsel. So even when faced with a supposed threat that the otherworldly humans posed, Aurelia wouldn‚Äôt have engaged them directly.

Seeing that Elisia was struggling with finding her voice, Layla took it upon herself to answer Clyde‚Äôs question.  
‚ÄúShe is a High Elf and a Great Mage. She goes by many names: ‚ÄòWhite Maiden‚Äô, ‚ÄòGuardian of Vatur‚Äô, just to name a few. She was the one who brokered peace between the Vatur Kingdom and the Marbella Kingdom, seven centuries ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh Elf? So, there is more than one kind of elf?‚Äù Marcel asked.

‚ÄúYes. Elves, High Elves and Dark Elves.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me, they come in more flavours than a Snickers bar.‚Äù The Colonel groaned.

Layla nodded, turning to look at Elisia. By logic alone, the knight should not be sitting next to her. Elisia was skilled and talented, so much so that the thought of her fighting off elven reinforcements while being outnumbered and somehow escaping with her life was believable. But no amount of skill or talent would ever be enough for a human to survive a fight against a Great Mage. Even Queen Kyara Ikaris Marbella, blessed with the dragon‚Äôs soul, would not stand a chance if a High Elf truly wanted her dead.

‚ÄúJudging by the look on your faces, that Aurelia must be a big deal, huh?‚Äù Clyde said with a grin.

‚ÄúYes. High Elves are venerated as divine by the Elves. Adored by mana, all-powerful, truly immortal. The passing of time does not affect them; they can cast even the most complex of spells without so much as uttering a word. They are as close to being demigods made flesh as one can be.‚Äù Layla replied, speaking louder and louder with each word, hoping to paint a picture that the two men would understand.

She turned to Elisia once more, looking at her with disbelief. She didn‚Äôt wish to inflict further pain upon her friend, but the need to know was too much to hold back.  
‚ÄúTo have faced her and lived, it‚Äôs just not possible. Please, tell us everything.‚Äù

And so, Elisia told them of her fight with the High Elf, if one could even call it that. She spared no words, omitted no details, no matter how painful they were. The group listened intently.

When the knight told them what Aurelia told her, Clyde‚Äôs face brightened as his suspicion was slowly confirmed. He rubbed his beard a few times while thinking to himself.  
*‚ÄúSo, the elven general didn‚Äôt botch the spell. She was purposefully thrown under the bus. Why, though?‚Äù*

Layla went from shocked to mortified as the story went on, realising that the High Elf truly had every intention of killing Elisia. As the knight took a pause to compose herself again, the cat seized the opportunity to ask a question of her own.  
‚ÄúHow did you survive then? If she had you encased in ice.‚Äù

Memories of the High Elf‚Äôs fingers and ear being shot off resurfaced in the knight‚Äôs mind, bringing a weak but triumphant smile to her face. She pointed towards the two men sitting across from her and repeated the very words Aurelia screamed.  
‚ÄúThey left one behind.‚Äù

Clyde‚Äôs eyes lit up as she said those words. Neither of the two women has seen the large Warhound look so alive before. To Layla, in that moment, the Colonel looked the same as Captain Howler; more animal than man. The mage couldn‚Äôt understand the reason for such sudden glee.

‚ÄúThe bitch bleeds, doesn‚Äôt she?‚Äù He asked, never breaking eye contact with Elisia.

The knight just nodded. Layla felt as if she was witnessing an exchange she wasn‚Äôt a part of anymore. She simply stared at Elisia, more curious than ever.

Clyde clapped his hands once and then wiped his palms against his pants. The atmosphere returned to normal, and the spark in his eyes disappeared without a trace. He stood up and stretched before speaking.  
‚ÄúWell, it seems that that Aurelia character is much more involved than just guiding the elves.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWait. Don‚Äôt you want to hear the rest of what happened?‚Äù Layla said as the two men headed for the door.

Clyde stopped and turned halfway around, looking at both of them..  
‚ÄúIs there anything else important she said before getting shot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. She simply began tearing the forest apart, looking for the shooter.‚Äù The knight replied.

Layla felt like her head was seconds from exploding. Too much information, too impossible to believe, all at once. Aurelia, the High Elf, attacked Elisia, and the latter only managed to survive because the Great Mage was shot by one of the soldiers Clyde ordered to stay behind. It sounded surreal, yet her gut told her that it was true. She sighed and fell backwards on the bed, staring up at the ceiling, choosing to let her mind slowly think about nothing instead. Elisia joined her as well.

Outside, the two men discussed everything they had heard from the knight.

Clyde sighed and fished around in his pocket for a pair of cigarillos.  
‚ÄúThis is turning into quite the shitshow.‚Äù

Marcel nodded and accepted the cig offered by the larger man. He sniffed it, savouring the coffee aroma before lighting it.  
‚ÄúYes, seems the elves are definitely taking this seriously. Especially if they have someone like Aurelia at the helm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should try to keep our dealings under her radar as much as possible.‚Äù Said the Colonel.

**Hi.**¬†

Everyone finally got together to get their stories straight. And all the strings lead to one woman: The Great Mage Aurelia. She has attracted the attention of her enemy, and their suspicion regarding her motives and involvement, but that's alright, so long as the puppets from Vatur and Marbella remain dancing to her tune, right?

Now that the otherworlders are back in their element, who knows what that spells for the elves and the Marbella girls in the outpost.¬†

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o7j4vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o7j4vm/she_stole_his_microwave/,She stole his microwave,"Okay so this is a situation that happened almost a decade ago.. 

I (30) female and my partner (33) male, worked together at a warehouse where it was always a revolving door, people would come in and quit the same day sometimes.. the work was boring, but the people made it totally worth it (the good and bad) 

At the time of this story I was about 23/24 at the time, and my partner was 24ish/25. 

We made some friends through the years at this warehouse, and some friendships are still going strong, and others dropped off, but we always have a good laugh about this specific situation from time to time still. 

A girl had started working there one day and I was next to her that day, and where we worked was a production line, if you could strike up a conversation it could make the day go by a little quicker sometimes. We started talking about our hobbies and interests, and she informed me she had dated someone that works there in the past, one of our friends.  

My partner and him were more friends than I was but we did get along and would have good laughs outside of work sometimes, when we would go hang out. 

Me and the girl we can call her ‚ÄúK‚Äù started to form a little bond and did start to hang outside of work, like go out and get lunch places and sometimes just hang out at my place. 

Her and we can call him ‚ÄúD‚Äù started to talk and then date again, so I and my partner would go over and hang out with them at their place (she moved in with him ) we started to feel kind of off about things after a couple months would go by. 

They really didn‚Äôt have much of a chemistry but still tried to work things out, but they would sometimes argue about silly things when we were over, K would be made that D used the wrong forks when we would come by and have food, (she had specific fancy utensils when they had guests).  

One day we came over and she completely shut down and was mad about how he used the wrong color fork, and it wasn‚Äôt just her.. he would be mad that she would try to decorate or make the place more homey, he thought it didn‚Äôt match his personality so he would object. 

K and I would talk about how they were and I would try to give her advice about how they should communicate better about their feelings, and what they want to work in this relationship, communication is always key üîë  if you can‚Äôt communicate then it‚Äôs not gonna work. 

She took my advice and would try to communicate, but it just didn‚Äôt work out for both sides. 

During these few months though we would hang out and chat still, and then K and D broke up, and she moved out, and said she would be back to pick her stuff up after she came back from visiting family down south. 

*back story: when K moved in she had been bargain shopping and picked some things out for the place, like furniture and a bed, some kitchen supplies and appliances, like a microwave, and a coffee pot and plates and silverware. She had made D get rid of everything he had, so she could bring her things, so he got rid of his furniture, and microwave and those items, the only thing he really did keep was his mattress which he put into another room. 

Fast forward to the week she left, I still spoke to her after the break up, but leading up to it she started to act weird towards my partner and I, she would always want to be with us, and would call us her ‚Äòloves‚Äô and would treat us as if we were all in a relationship, she would also express how she wanted to have a relationship like ours, where we could talk about EVERYTHING together and I mean it‚Äôs not bad to admire how people act in a relationship, but it just made us feel like she wanted to share what we had. 

It would get more awkward when she would get mad when we would hang with other people, or that we were still friends with D, mind you we knew D way before knowing K. 

The weekend K went to see family we went to spend time with D, K found out and was livid, and legitimately blocked me on all social platforms, and my number, without a word. 

When K came back she went to D‚Äôs house and took everything that she had brought with her, so D came home to find everything gone, and all he had was his mattress and tv. He didn‚Äôt have a working stove , or anything so she left him with nothing, even though she didn‚Äôt have any space for any of the items she took, and got a storage unit and put it all in there, she took the dang microwave after making him get rid of his , because she didn‚Äôt like it. 

We still have a good laugh about it, and make microwave jokes sometimes, but honestly I do feel bad for K and I wish her the best, and hope she finds the happiness she deserves.. everyone deserves happiness.

It‚Äôs been over 5 years since this happened, and I think I‚Äôm in a better place in my life to share this now. Leaving some details out for anonymity and I apologize in advance for the length.

When I, (now 24 F) turned 18, I made an account on Tinder. In hindsight, it was probably one of the dumbest things to do at the time, but to be freshly ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and enter the online dating pool for validation/excitement was what a lot of 18 y/o girls (at least that I knew) were doing. At the time, I had been several months out of a long-term relationship with my high school ex-boyfriend and was ready to talk to people who‚Äôd actually appreciate me. That relationship was quite terrible to be frank, and if any of you want to hear those details I‚Äôd be happy to share. 

I eventually matched with my ex (22 M at the time) and we hit it off pretty quickly. At 18, I didn‚Äôt think a 4 year age gap was so bad, but it is VERY evident to me now that any 18 year old girls should not be looking for age gap relationships. Again, hindsight is 20/20. It should have been my first red flag that a 22-year-old guy couldn‚Äôt find a girl his age, or wanted to be with a girl who was barely graduated from high school.

We texted for a while, and eventually face-timed to test the vibes. Honestly, I thought he seemed super sweet, genuine, and interesting to talk to. It helped that I was attracted as well. Our first date was nothing stellar‚Äîwe got take out and had a picnic at a park, but he seemed pretty genuine and we connected on a lot of things. Something interesting to note here is he asked me what my ideal type was/what I was looking for in a partner. I told him I wanted someone who was driven, family-oriented, wanted to get to know my family, and some other things I can‚Äôt remember. 

Following our first date, I don‚Äôt have much of a desire to share everything that went on during the time we continued to see each other, but to summarize, it was largely positive. He treated me kindly, paid for many things, was always chivalrous, played video games with my younger brother, and showed an effort to get to know my family (it was everything my ex high school boyfriend didn‚Äôt do). The time we spent together was pretty wholesome‚Äîlots of hiking, working out, visiting nearby towns, meal dates, etc. We were ‚Äúdating‚Äù without an exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend title like this for around 3 months. 

At the time, things were almost too good to be true. We had almost no significant conflict and it seemed we were so compatible. However, there were some minor red flags that I was wary of. For example, on a day he was picking me up for a date, I looked out the window and saw him sipping coffee from a glass cup. When I got out to the car, I simply said ‚ÄúOh, it smells like coffee in here, what are you drinking?‚Äù

He simply replied that he didn‚Äôt have any coffee that morning. I‚Äôm not sure why I didn‚Äôt press further at the time, but I absolutely made note of it in my head. What a weird thing to lie about.

The next red flag I got from him was regarding his past relationships. He told me he had 1 girlfriend before me, also a high school relationship. According to him, they were a ‚Äúpower couple‚Äù as they both played in their respective sport and people thought they were cute together. He said they broke up because long distance didn‚Äôt work out for them when she got to college. For some context, the place we live in is quite large, but the community is pretty tightly knit. His ex supposedly played the same sport I did in high school, and that community of people is VERY small. I was very active in being at open gyms, and their high school was our rival school. When he told me her name, you know I immediately went to digging to find out who she was (nosy high school me).

I‚Äôm not sure what my gut feeling was saying to me then, but I just had this weird feeling about this ex. Her name was THE most generic name ever, but yet, I had never heard of this girl who played my same sport and went to this particular college. I was familiar with pretty much all the players from this rival school, especially since I played varsity starting freshman year and played against upperclassmen from their school (we would have overlapped for 1 year if we played together). I searched through MANY social media platforms to at least see what she looked like but I could not find that this girl ever existed. 

Again, I had no intention of asking him or pressing him about the matter because it was a little crazy of me to go FBI investigation on his ex. We WILL come back to this part of the story later.

Now to the REAL red flags. After being sexually intimate for quite a bit, he asked if he could record us having intercourse. I was shocked, and angry, to say the least. We were not even officially bf/gf, and I could NOT understand why he would need that kind of recording. I do know that some couples record that kind of stuff for fun, but we had barely been together for several months. It was an immediate no from me, but the way he asked was in a very joking manner and he let go of it immediately as soon as he could see my reaction. 

He asked me again, at a later date, and I was even angrier this time. I demanded he explain why he was so insistent on this. His explanation was that I was soon moving away for college and he‚Äôd want something to watch while I was gone. I remained firm in telling him no, and he was fine with it. He apologized for asking as well. I should have broken things off right then and there but, then there‚Äôd be no rest of this story.

After that, we had pretty much no conflict (as I said before) and things were moving very smoothly for us. He had no problem expressing affection and love in multiple ways, and besides the red flags, I thought we‚Äôd be okay. We spent a lot of time together and were both developing feelings. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend, and did it in a very thoughtful way that I don‚Äôt care to share here. 

Things didn‚Äôt change after we became official since we were already acting as a couple. It was just nice to have the title and be officially committed to each other. About a week after, my friends planned a trip to a nearby town to rent a house with a pool and just hang out, drink, etc. We had a good time, and the only thing that was off on the trip was that I noticed my ex acting more introverted and withdrawn than usual. He was usually quite extroverted and adept at making conversation in any social situation. 

On the last night of our trip, we were about to do the deed when I had this very strong gut feeling that something was wrong. (I was not fully unclothed yet). For context, I was slightly buzzed and he was sober. Even without a fully clear head, I just knew he was up to something. I quickly turned my head into the corner of the room and saw his phone propped up on the window sill recording us. I got up immediately and stopped the recording, and demanded him to delete that shit. 

It‚Äôs been so long now that I can‚Äôt remember what he said or the look on his face, but I knew in that moment that we were done. I slept in my best friend‚Äôs room that night and told her everything. I remember feeling numb more than anything, but honestly even after that I was never even sad. I was able to immediately move on for my feelings for him, but honestly I think I didn‚Äôt love him or like him that much in the first place. To go back to my comment about how he asked what my type was on our first date, it became very clear to me that he was trying his best to become my ideal person without it actually being who he was. 

The next morning, I SOMEHOW pitied him enough to drive him back to our hometown. We were at least 3 hours away from home and I felt bad to just leave him there. On the drive home, I was not sad nor angry, just wanted to drop him off and never see him again. We didn‚Äôt speak a single word. He sat in the passenger seat and cried while looking out the window, his jacket draped over his shoulders like he was the one who had his life turned upside down. I grabbed a single tissue and dropped it onto his shoulder. 

When we got back to our city, he asked if we could talk about things soon because he needed to explain himself. I asked for space and would decide if I‚Äôd even want to talk to him. The timeline is pretty blurry for me at this point, but to make things brief since this is already quite long, he spent weeks trying to win me back and apologize for everything. He did everything, you name it‚Äîflowers, a long card, a shadow box filled with photos of us, a psychology book with a chapter bookmarked for me to read. After reading that chapter, it helped me realize I would DEFINITELY not get back with him.

I asked him to stop contacting me because we were truly done, and he really couldn‚Äôt come to terms with it. He‚Äôd send me texts for days and days, talking to himself because I stopped replying. He would show up to my house, knocking at my door asking to talk or to give him a hug. I denied him many times. He even texted me at one point that sometimes he‚Äôd drive to my house and just sit outside because it is what he said VERBATIM ‚Äúwhat any normal person would do in his situation.‚Äù WHAT THE HELL!!!! 

On a night around 11 PM when I was home alone and studying, I heard tapping on my window and a ‚Äúpssst! pssst! *my name*‚Äù

This was probably the point I began to feel real fear by his stalking. After hearing my name, I remember feeling completely frozen and moving away from my room and the open window. He eventually left, but after that night, I had intense anxiety while studying in my room at night because I feared he would come to harass me again. 
 
I blocked his phone number and his communication moved to other platforms. He DM‚Äôed me on instagram, facebook messenger, and eventually email when I blocked him on everything else. 

The emails were probably the worst. They‚Äôd go from long winded confessions of love and begging for forgiveness, to anger, or to h*rniness and with a request to meet up with a winky face. Even when you block someone‚Äôs email, it will get forwarded to your spam box. As much as I didn‚Äôt want to see it, I also couldn‚Äôt stop checking my spam. I wanted nothing to do with him and yet I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at those emails. 

In one of his emails, he revealed that he made up the entire story of having an ex girlfriend. (I had already concluded this on my own but it was laughable and shocking he confessed on his own. I told you we‚Äôd come back to the girlfriend story!). He said he was embarrassed to have never had a girlfriend until meeting me, was a virgin, and didn‚Äôt know why he lied for so long.

These emails continued for around 5-6 months. I was depressed and hated school, and also felt super isolated. I felt I couldn‚Äôt tell my parents about everything that was going on because I was too embarrassed to talk about the intimacy, and we just didn‚Äôt have the relationship where I felt comfortable opening up to them. 

I eventually unloaded everything to my aunt, who is basically my best friend and like my second mom, about how he was still emailing me 6 months after the breakup. She didn‚Äôt know he had still been trying to contact me (but she did know about everything that happened). I never read it, but she sent a long text to my dad letting him know I needed help and that he needed to intervene to protect me in this situation. After that, my dad sent him a text asking him to stop contacting me. I finally stopped hearing from him after that. 

It feels like I‚Äôve retold his story many times to close friends or to therapists, but writing it out all here like this feels different. I‚Äôve moved on from the past, graduated with a B.S. degree in neuroscience, and am now in a happy 5-year relationship with my girlfriend (Turns out I‚Äôm actually lesbian). I am applying for grad school next year. 

To summarize this story up, I hope at least one other person who has been in a similar situation gets the help they need‚Äîwhether it be a therapist, reaching out to an old friend, or family member‚Äîending up in relationships or breakups like this can be really isolating. I also hope any younger people who see this and are dating much older guys, that they aren‚Äôt with you because you‚Äôre extra special or mature for your age. There are plenty of people out there who want to love and appreciate you, and not in a power dynamic. If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading and taking the time out of your day to do so. If anyone happens to read this, I‚Äôll try and respond to any questions you have.

1o7j004,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1o7j004/another_sorce_review/,Another Sorce review.,"A few months ago, I posted the first half of this review. So if you saw that, there are gonna be repeats, sorrrrry. Let‚Äôs get into it.


2AM in Lafayette: The first time I smelled this I immediately was brought back to high school, walking into Quick Check and smelling the fresh roasted coffee at 5 in the morning lmao. Like omg the NOSTALGIA! It starts off with coffee, and as it dries down I can smell the beignet. It ends with this decadent vanilla. I also love the addition of oakmoss, it makes it earthy. I am in love with this perfume, it is my new signature scent. I get sooooo many compliments when I wear this.

The Cookie Party: Yum, dude. This is tangy. This is straight up cookie butter. Toffee-y. A true gourmand. My co-worker demanded the name of this one.

Snow Moon Magic: Okay. Let me collect my thoughts. This is the best smelling perfume of. MY. LIIIIIIIIIIIFE. (Said in Ilana‚Äôs voice from Broad City). I‚Äôm throwing my hands up because what the fuck is this? This is hands down the most nostalgic, I was just in my grandma‚Äôs kitchen, most delicious chai I‚Äôve ever smelled. My grandma used to make my brother and me warm milk with honey before bed at her house. This is that. With some chai sprinkled in. She is warm, she is cozy, she IS The Moment!

Moon Magic: Okay, this is slamming. At first sniff I thought it smelled exactly like the Wiccy Massage Bar from LUSH. Like I just got straight cinnamon. Well, I let it sit and omg. It‚Äôs delicious. She‚Äôs creamy, she‚Äôs dreamy, she‚Äôs scream(ing. It‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm screaming because this is so good). I like to wear this for bedtime.

IDAF Pistachio: This perfume. YUM. Same pistachio as in A Party, Or Something. It‚Äôs soooo smooth. Like smooth with an edge, though? I‚Äôm a vanilla girlie, and I‚Äôm in love with the vanilla in this. But the pistachio really adds some almost smokiness? Ugh it‚Äôs good.

IDAF Vanilla: This is such a good vanilla. You can smell the meringue. Not sure I can smell chamomile. I‚Äôll let my bottle age a bit. I like the pistachio better, but this is decadent too.

Falling Stars Black- Yup, that‚Äôs the base of all of the Falling Stars variations. I would probably only wear this layered with something else. It‚Äôs bitter, but I don‚Äôt hate it. It‚Äôs just not enough on its own.

Falling Stars Salted Vanilla Sweet Cream- This smells almost cold to me. It‚Äôs super smooth and light. I LOVE this perfume. I‚Äôm always sniffing myself when I wear this one. Sorce‚Äôs vanillas are unmatched. I‚Äôm actually shook. If this tasted like something, it‚Äôd be Starbuck‚Äôs Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew.

Falling Stars Marshmallow Cloud: This is similar to Salted Vanilla Sweet Cream. But it doesn‚Äôt have the same coldness to it. It‚Äôs warmer and slightly sticky to me. Like, marshmallows ü§£

Falling Stars Strawberry Coconut Milk: The strawberry in this reminds me of a baked strawberry. I don‚Äôt get much coconut milk, but I‚Äôm willing to stash it for a couple of months and re-smell then. It‚Äôs nice and cozy.

Falling Stars Cookie Butter Oat Milk: This is foody for sure. Sweet and cookie-y. Almost remind me of a chocolate chip granola bar. A sticky one.

Falling Stars Cardamom Orange Cream- This immediately punches you in the face with cardamom, which I love. The orange is more subtle. Don‚Äôt really get a lot of cream. You can definitely small the black base of coffee. Not sure this is a keeper for me.

A Party, Or Something- Omg yes. Just yes. This is fuzzy. You immediately smell the pistachio. It‚Äôs DELICIOUS. It‚Äôs DECADENT. The buttercream comes in strong too. And the yellow cake‚Ä¶..yummmm. This is a delightful scent. It‚Äôs strong as fuck too. I‚Äôve been complimented on this perfume in a Subway.

Don‚Äôt Whistle in the Woods: Hoooooooo Boy DAT VANILLA! Omg. This opens with the fur note for me. It‚Äôs super interesting. Like, it somehow really smells like fur. The dry down is this suppppper rich and dark vanilla. It‚Äôs to die for. When I get whiffs of this, it alters my mood lmao. This vanilla is deep.

What Big Eyes You Have- This is straight up delicious creamy lemon meringue. I‚Äôm addicted to it. I wish the lemon lasted a little longer, but I don‚Äôt even care. The pie crust element that may or may not actually be in here is yummy too. I‚Äôm a sucker for anything pastry-like.

English Major- I do not like this one, and that‚Äôs all I have to say about that.

A Bump in the Night- Something‚Äôs burning, and it‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs sour.

Sit for a Spell- The most realistic salted cantaloupe. Not for me, but I will say it does smell good.

Your GF is a Badass- This smells like dirt and chocolate, I‚Äôm so sorry.

Match Made in Heaven- BITCH, YUM. This and 2am are my longest lasting fragrances from Sorce. This smells like a dream. If dreams smelled like something. Creamy, but a tiny bit earthy with the matcha. I get the vanilla/waffle cone the most. I don‚Äôt get any almond blossom. This is my second most complimented Sorce fragrance. Give me a little spritz of this in my coffin before people start coming to pay their respects, thank you.

C‚Äôest Noel- This will not be for everyone, so send it all to meeeeeee. This perfume reminds me of when my mom would drag me kicking and screaming to midnight mass. But then the priest decided to throw some roasted chestnuts in the incense burner thing that he‚Äôs swinging around. I‚Äôm going to describe this as a graveyard at Christmas at like 3am.

Cake for Breakfast- It‚Äôs a no from me, Dawg. This is maple syrup and musty with a hint of stale coffee. Really watered down coffee. Maybe a little nostalgic though.

Nothing Burns Like the Cold- I‚Äôll be honest, I hated this at first. Whatever that opening note is (saffron??????), I did not like it. I let it sit for a few months, and whew, I‚Äôm obsessed now. That dry down!!!!!!!

She‚Äôs A Witch- Oh, she‚Äôs good. If my grandma ever decided to crawl out of her grave and come home, this is what my house would smell like. Bro, I don‚Äôt even like anise, but this reminds me of when my uncle would come over on Christmas Eve and him and my dad would have espresso with a shot of sambuca with a lil espresso bean in it. And then add heaps of powdered sugar on top. This does smell like a cookie. But a sophisticated and sexy cookie. She knows what she‚Äôs doing.

The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake- Okay, I really wanted this to smell more like cake, but it doesn‚Äôt. Just think of the juiciest, ripest peaches and spank some ginger and cardamom on her ass, and here she is. I actually am obsessed with it even without the cake. She‚Äôs caked up in different ways, if you know what I mean.

Strings of Light in the Forest- She‚Äôs WEIRD, and I LIKE it!!!! If you don‚Äôt like the smell of beeswax, don‚Äôt bother with this one. I feel like Queen of the bees when I wear this. And then a vanilla milkshake was dumped on my head. I get hints of the lavender and vetiver too.

Circe- This is banana runts; FULL STOP. It‚Äôs fun, and cute. I gave it to my daughter lmao.

Pelicans Dive in the Ocean- This is the best, most fresh smelling shampoo. This smells like I‚Äôm taking an outdoor shower at my Aunt Carmine‚Äôs house in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, right after getting home from State Beach. IYKYK.

Follow Me Into the Deep- I reach for this when I‚Äôm overwhelmed and need something light. It‚Äôs so beautiful. The coconut in this is the sweetened coconut flakes that my mom used to get for cookies. I‚Äôd be shoving it into my mouth by the handful. The vanilla orchid is a nice touch, and I get just a hint of nutmeg on the dry down. Like just a single particle of nutmeg. One tiny speck.

Tarot at Tea Time- This slaps yo mama in the face with sweet orange immediately. After the slap imprint fades from her face a little, she can smell that black tea coming through. She‚Äôs into it, and might welcome a slap to the other side of her face. I also want to add that I mixed this with MMIH, and it smelled like an orange creamsicle. Heavy on the MMIH, and light on the Tarot if you‚Äôre thinking of trying it.",20,1760552852.0,Indiemakeupandmore,8,0.95,False

__________________________________
**(A few days after Eren left)**

**2024-05-06 Monday [Morning 07:00 AM]**

**(Normal POV)**

A week had gone by since Eren left. Mikasa and Eren still talked, through chats and calls, but it wasn‚Äôt like before. The distance between them wasn't just miles; it was creeping into their hearts. They missed each other deeply, yet something in their conversations felt quieter, thinner.

In Mikasa‚Äôs room, morning light filtered gently through the curtains. She moved quietly, almost robotically, as she prepared her coffee. Her face looked dull, and her eyes no longer had that spark they once did. Everything around her seemed the same‚Äîher room, her desk, the half-open window‚Äîbut it felt different. The difference was Eren.

Finally, she poured her coffee and walked to the window, the steam brushing past her lips. She looked outside, feeling the emptiness beside her where he used to be‚Äîthat familiar warmth she could no longer reach.

After a while, she picked up her phone. She unlocked it, her thumb hesitating for a moment before opening their chat. Part of her already knew what she‚Äôd find, yet she still hoped.

There it was. A simple **‚ÄúHey girl, how are you?‚Äù**

Her lips formed a small, faint smile. But it didn‚Äôt feel the same anymore. His messages used to be warm‚Äîfilled with jokes, affection, and little stories about his day. Now, they were shorter and more distant, swallowed by his busy schedule and the time difference.

She typed back, **‚ÄúHey, fine. How about you?‚Äù** It was a brief reply, full of anxiety she couldn‚Äôt express in words.

She set her phone aside and reached for her scarf‚Äîhis scarf. She held it tightly, tracing its fabric as if she were holding a piece of him. The familiar scent was faint now, but the memory lingered.

Her chest ached. Tears welled up and rolled silently down her cheeks. She tried to stop them but couldn‚Äôt.

All she wanted was to be with him. To hear his voice not through a speaker, but right next to her. To feel his hand fix her scarf like he always did.

She pressed the scarf against her heart, whispering to herself‚Äîalmost like a prayer. *‚ÄúThis warmth‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the same without you.‚Äù*

The morning sun continued to rise, but for Mikasa, it only made the emptiness clearer.


**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

I returned to college. The familiar walls and crowded hallways felt empty without him. The laughter around me sounded different. Every corner reminded me of him‚Äîour walks together and the way he teased me to make me smile.

I moved slowly through the hallway, holding my books close to my chest. My mind raced, tumbling through worry and longing.

From a distance, I saw Annie and Armin walking together, hand in hand, smiling softly at each other. They looked so happy and peaceful. For a moment, I wanted to smile for them. Then something tightened in my chest. Their laughter echoed faintly in the corridor, pulling me back to a memory of him. Before they could see me, I quietly turned away and walked down another hallway.

I sat on a bench near the courtyard, staring blankly at the floor. My coffee had gone cold in my stomach, leaving only a bitter taste. His texts are getting shorter, I thought. He still messages me, but it feels distant, as if he‚Äôs fading away from me one word at a time.

I sighed deeply. **‚ÄúWhy does it all have to hurt this much?‚Äù** I whispered.

Just then, a shadow fell in front of me. I looked up and saw Armin standing there, his face soft and worried. **‚ÄúHey, Mikasa,‚Äù** he said gently. **‚ÄúHow are you holding up?‚Äù**

I blinked and forced a small smile. **‚ÄúOh, hey, Armin. I didn‚Äôt see you there. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ fine.‚Äù** My voice sounded calm, but I knew he could hear the strain beneath it.

He sat beside me. **‚ÄúDid Eren text you? He hasn‚Äôt messaged me since yesterday.‚Äù** When he said Eren's name, my throat tightened. I lowered my gaze. **‚ÄúNo. He didn‚Äôt.‚Äù**

Armin‚Äôs expression softened immediately. I could tell he understood without me saying anything more. **‚ÄúOh,‚Äù** he murmured. **‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably just busy. You know, new place, new routines. It might take him a while to settle in.‚Äù**

Before I could respond, Annie appeared, cheerful as always. **‚ÄúHey, Armin, Mikasa!‚Äù** she greeted. **‚ÄúWhat are you two talking about?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúEren,‚Äù** Armin said simply. **‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt texted recently.‚Äù**

Annie‚Äôs smile dimmed slightly. **‚ÄúYeah, he must be really busy adjusting. It‚Äôs not easy at first.‚Äù**

I nodded quickly. **‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to class,‚Äù** I said, cutting the conversation short. I couldn‚Äôt handle hearing more about him‚Äînot when every word made my chest feel heavier.

During class, I tried to focus. I really did. I watched the professor move across the board, listened to the sound of pens and the shuffle of notebooks. But my thoughts wouldn't stay. They kept drifting back to him.

I remembered how he whispered jokes during lectures just to see me roll my eyes. How he laughed when I tried to stay serious. Those little moments annoyed me back then, but now I‚Äôd give anything to live them again.

After class, I walked out and found myself sitting alone on a bench again. I took out my phone and scrolled through my gallery. Every photo was a piece of him‚Äîa smile, a memory, a heartbeat. Then I found a video. The one from the beach.

We were all there‚Äîme, Eren, Armin, Annie. The sound of waves, our laughter, splashes of water. Everyone was happy. But as I watched, my eyes only followed him. His laughter. His smile. The way his hair stuck to his forehead.

For a brief second, I heard someone laughing nearby. It sounded exactly like him. My heart skipped; my whole body froze. I turned immediately, searching the crowd with desperate hope.

But it wasn‚Äôt him. It was just someone else‚Äîa stranger whose laugh carried the same rhythm.

Disappointment washed over me like a cold wave. I stared at my phone again, at his face frozen in the video‚Äôs still frame. My thumb hovered over the call button.

*Should I call him?* My heart screamed yes. But then my mind whispered‚Äî*what if he‚Äôs busy? What if I‚Äôm disturbing him?*

I set my phone down on my lap and leaned back, closing my eyes. The wind brushed past softly, carrying the faint scent of rain. And all I could think was‚Äî

**‚ÄúI just miss him. That‚Äôs all I ever do now.‚Äù**

**(Time skip: Evening 05:40 PM, Japan)**

I returned home after college. The moment I opened the door, silence greeted me. It felt heavy, almost suffocating. It was the kind of silence that reminded me what, or who, was missing.

I shut the door behind me and leaned against it for a moment, staring blankly at the floor. My apartment hadn‚Äôt changed; the same couch, the same soft light from the window, the same faint scent of coffee from the morning. But everything felt different now. Because he wasn‚Äôt here anymore.

I dropped my bag onto the couch and walked toward my bed. Each step felt slower than the last, as if my body was too tired to move, but my heart was even heavier. I lay down, staring at the ceiling.

For a while, I didn‚Äôt move. I just listened to the quiet hum of the city outside and the faint ticking of the clock on my wall. My chest ached quietly as memories flooded my mind‚Äîhis voice, his laughter, the way he called my name when I got upset over small things. Those moments felt like yesterday, but also like they belonged to another lifetime.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand and held it close to my chest. The screen was dark, reflecting only my eyes‚Äîtired, lonely, and full of questions I didn‚Äôt have answers for.

Should I call him? My thumb hovered over his name, my heart pounding softly.

I hesitated, staring at the small contact photo of him‚Äî that smile I used to see every day. Before I could stop myself, I pressed the call button. The ringing tone echoed softly in my ear. Once, twice‚Ä¶

No answer.

I bit my lip and stared at the ceiling again. Maybe he‚Äôs busy. Maybe he‚Äôs studying. Maybe he‚Äôs out with friends. Still, something inside me twisted.

I called again. This time I listened longer, hoping to hear his voice.

But again, nothing. Only silence.

I slowly lowered the phone beside me and stared at it. The screen dimmed to black once more. My reflection stared back at me, and I felt the warmth leave my body.

*‚ÄúGuess he‚Äôs busy,‚Äù* I whispered. My voice cracked slightly, barely audible in the quiet room.

But the truth I was scared to face whispered back in my mind‚Äî or maybe he‚Äôs just slipping away.

I turned to my side, hugging the pillow close. My eyes burned, and I didn‚Äôt even try to stop the tears. They came softly, silently‚Äîthe kind of tears that hurt more because they come from missing someone you can‚Äôt reach anymore.

Even oceans apart, I still feel him near. Sometimes, I swear I can still sense him‚Äîin the sound of the rain, in the warmth of the scarf he once fixed for me.

As I wiped my tears away, a quiet thought broke through the ache‚Äî will this feeling last forever? Or will time take even that away too?

The phone lay beside me, silent and still. I stared at it one last time before closing my eyes, letting the faint hum of the city fill the emptiness he left behind. Even oceans apart, I still feel him near. But will this feeling last forever?


**(Evening, France ‚Äì 05:30 PM)**

**(Eren‚Äôs POV)**

A week has passed since I arrived here. It feels longer. Every day without her seems stretched, heavy, and endless.

Adjusting to this new life isn‚Äôt easy. The streets are unfamiliar, the air feels different, and the light here is unique. The people are kind, but I still feel like an outsider. The language trips me up, the classes are tougher than I expected, and my apartment still doesn‚Äôt feel like home.

But none of that compares to the real struggle‚Äîbeing away from her.

Sometimes, I find myself checking my phone without even thinking. I look for her name‚Äî for a message, a missed call, something. I tell myself I‚Äôm not addicted, but the truth is‚Ä¶ I miss her more than I ever thought I could.

Tonight, I glanced at my phone again. Two missed calls.

Her name lit up softly on the screen. My heart sank.

**‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶‚Äù** I muttered under my breath. She must‚Äôve called while I was in class. I was helping a professor sort research notes and had left my phone on silent.

I ran a hand through my hair, feeling guilt crawl inside me. She must‚Äôve been waiting. Maybe she wanted to hear my voice. Maybe she couldn‚Äôt sleep.

I sighed, staring at the screen, unsure whether to call her back. Then I remembered the time difference‚ÄîJapan was seven hours ahead. It‚Äôs already late there. She must be asleep.

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mikasa,‚Äù** I whispered to the quiet room. **‚ÄúI should‚Äôve picked up.‚Äù**

I unlocked my phone and opened her chat. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment before I started typing.

**Me [05:30 PM]:**
*Sorry, girl. I was busy earlier; that‚Äôs why I missed your call. You‚Äôd love this place, you know. I wish you were here too.*

I looked at the message before sending it. It felt too small for what I truly wanted to say, but I couldn‚Äôt find the right words.

I waited a while, hoping she would reply. But nothing came. The screen stayed still‚Äîno typing, no blue ticks. Guess she‚Äôs asleep.

Still, I typed again.

**Me [05:32 PM]:**
*Okay, I think you‚Äôve fallen asleep. I‚Äôll call you tomorrow.*

Before putting my phone away, I looked out the window. The sky outside was painted in soft orange and pink. The sunset here was different‚Äîquieter and gentler. I pulled out my camera and took a picture. For a moment, I imagined her beside me, her hair brushing against my arm, her eyes lighting up at the view.

I sent her the photo with no caption‚Äîjust a small gesture, like saying *I was thinking of you.*

Because I always am.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the dimming sky. My thoughts drifted back to all the times we walked home together at this hour‚Äîthe way she teased me for walking too fast, the quiet moments when neither of us talked, but everything felt complete.

She still texts me whenever she can. I try to do the same. But no matter how hard we both try, the distance feels heavier every day. The time zones, the workload, the responsibilities‚Äî they‚Äôre all slowly getting in the way.

Still, every night before I sleep, I scroll through our old messages, our photos, and the voice notes she sent me when she laughed too much to talk.

Even oceans apart, I still feel her close. Sometimes I can almost hear her soft voice calling my name.

But as I looked at the empty room and the fading sky, a quiet thought crossed my mind‚Äî *How long will this feeling last?* *How long before even this warmth fades?*

I set the phone beside my bed, letting the screen fade to black‚Äîthe last light disappearing just like the sunset outside. Even oceans apart, I still feel her near. But will this feeling last forever? In the silence that followed, I whispered one more time,

**‚ÄúGoodnight, Mikasa.‚Äù**

I‚Äôm writing to share a short update on my situation with a girl I met two months ago. We hit it off right from the start, with flirting and deep conversations. However, due to our busy schedules, we only managed to meet twice. The first time was at a fancy restaurant, and the second was for coffee, which led to an Aperol/dinner date. Everything was going smoothly, but we hadn‚Äôt kissed yet. The energy and vibe were great, with only a few brief silences that made our eye contact even more intense.

After our second date, she sent me a lovely message expressing her desire to meet again, and couldn‚Äôt believe we made it after almost four weeks of not meetimg. During our second date, she also planned the third and fourth dates. While I was giving her a ride home, we talked about our future together and agreed that we both wanted to take things slow but steadily.

However, things took a turn for the worse. She became distant, and her responses to my messages were delayed by hours. I had expressed my concern about the lack of communication and emphasized that I value open and honest conversations. She apologized, but the situation remained the same.

We‚Äôre both workaholics, so we have very busy days at work. Despite this, I still make time to text someone I like and want to build something with.

We haven‚Äôt texted in two days, even though I‚Äôve sent her three messages. The last one was this:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be at the place I picked you up last time at 7 p.m. If you‚Äôd like to continue, come by and we can talk about it.‚Äù

There‚Äôs been radio silence since then. I was at the place I mentioned from 6:46 to 7:15 p.m., and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve done this for a girl. I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm not into ghosting, playing games, or being toxic. I believe in real feelings and real life, just like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù adult should live and perceive life.

I need your support to handle this situation. I genuinely want to make it work with her, and I‚Äôm not living in an illusion.

Firstly, regarding the metal items, they're meant to be used for cooking and serving food... any tips on how to get them nice and shiny again? I've heard putting them in a vinegar acid bath is good, but what do I do after?

And for figures, cups etc out of ceramics, what's the best way to clean them up? Also heard vinegar acid there, but a bit unsure.

Lastly, we had a metal bowl and tray, coated in this ceramic glass enamel, vintage stuff. I assume this is the most difficult one, since they have to be re-enameled. Is that something that can be done at home?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o7ipob,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o7ipob/the_other_side_of_the_glass_isnt_empty_anymore_i/,"The other side of the glass isn't empty anymore, i don't know what to do.","A few days ago I moved into my new apartment, its not the best but it's the only thing I could afford. My land lord said it would be 500$ a month but said he would drag it out for as long as he could due to him having a close relationship with my dad.

When I first arrived in the apartment i noticed two things. The first being that half of the lights didn't work, i found this odd because my land lord said it was in perfect condition but I figured I could deal with it later once I had money. The second being the windows, or the lack of windows. There was only one window, the view out of it lead to the road below, making it easy to hear the traffic of the city.

Once I finished contemplating if this was the best option for my living situation, I walked into the room I planned to make as my bedroom. No windows but the light did work in this room so that was an upside. I set my suitcase in the corner of the room, unzipping it and taking my compactible air mattress out and laying it on the floor.

After unpacking everything, I decided to explore the rest of my apartment. I went to the living room where the couch set and a few feet infront of it was the coffee table where the TV sat. Then I went to the kitchen, a stove, fridge, and microwave were there. I was more than happy to find this since the land lord said that there wouldn't be any appliances in the apartment.

Later that night around 8pm I sat down on the couch and started watching TV. It was about 8:47 that I started to hear it, subtle scratching on the window. At first I brushed it off as sounds of the wind, until it started getting louder. I quickly looked towards the window but saw nothing, so I decided to go over to it and take a peek out. Nothing, I saw nothing, no scracth marks, no animal, or anything that could be making the noise. Just me and my faint reflection.

I stood there for a bit, staring deep into my reflection. Something was off about it, everytime I would move, it was like the reflection was a beat off. This immediately startled me and I made sure the window was locked. After that I went to my room and locked the door, sitting on my air mattress trying to make sense of what I saw. I know what I saw, and I know it was real. Or maybe I am hallucinating, maybe its the stress of moving into a new place, trying to get adjusted to things.

I decided to get some rest for the night. I fell asleep around 10pm and got some much needed rest. The next morning, I wake up to being layed out right infornt of the winodw in the living room, I don't recall getting up last night at all. To make matters worse, the window was unlocked and opened. As soon as I saw this I immediately got up and closed the window, breathing heavily from the shock of this occurance.

I started staring into the reflection again, my reflection was smiling back at me, I wasn't smiling. I know I wasn't because after I saw my reflection, I pulled my phone camera out and looked at myself, i wasn't smiling. I put my phone away and I looked back at my reflection and I noticed it mouthing the words ""Your not alone"". Once I understood what my reflection was mouthing I instantly rushed to my room and locked the door.

I stayed there for what felt like hours, waiting for something, anything to happen. What did it mean by I wasn't alone? There was no one else in my apartment with me, atleast there wasn't the night before.",1,1760552213.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been rejected asking a woman out in person well over 100 times now (bars, coffee shops, concerts, parks, book stores, etc), it‚Äôs just business as usual.  No need to get all riled up about it and make a scene or make her feel like she‚Äôs in danger.  I think handling rejection with maturity is a really valuable quality.  I‚Äôll pretty often get numbers or IGs, but go nowhere over them.  I have gotten a couple of casual partners through this, but overall the effectiveness has been well under 1%.

But the more and more I ‚Äúput myself out there,‚Äù the more I feel anxiety that each rejection isn‚Äôt in a vacuum and the cumulative reputation of being the guy who asks women out (to no avail most times) is going to catch up to me and harm my social life.  It never has in any noticeable way, but the anxiety has really weighed on me.  I‚Äôm proud of my ability to put myself out there without fear, and that I‚Äôve built extreme resilience by facing so much rejection.  I think most guys who‚Äôve faced even 1/10th the rejection as me would‚Äôve given up long ago, and that‚Äôs a source of esteem for me.

  But how, as a guy do you cope with these conflicting standards of society‚Ä¶ this desire to put yourself out there and take initiative like your told to do, and this expectation to not be a nuisance to women.  I feel like every time I approach a woman I treat her with the utmost respect, and smile graciously through rejection.  I try to pick up on body language queues and eject quickly if she‚Äôs not interested.  I try to keep my persistence to a minimum.  But still, I fear that despite all that, a lot of people are just going to judge me as being ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù‚Ä¶ simply for the act of starting a conversation in the first place.

I‚Äôve even asked women who I approached to be brutally honest with me and tell me if they enjoyed that convo and if it was ok I talked to them in that situation.  It‚Äôs been resounding yes‚Äôs, with the usual analysis being ‚Äúhow else are you supposed to meet people.‚Äù  But still, in the back of mind, I can‚Äôt help but feeling shame over what I‚Äôm doing and fear that if friends and my community found out, they‚Äôd ostracize me.",0,1760552160.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False
1o7ioih,https://i.redd.it/bp1p7emahbvf1.jpeg,Blur perfume honest review,"Got these Blur India Smells like breakfast in bed perfumes and  solid perfumes as an impulse purchase cuz I saw good/mixed reviews around it. Randomly saw them in a cafe at Saket and did a sniff test and was pleasantly surprised at how nice they smelled ü§åüèª. Ended up buying 3 of them and here's my detailed review to help anyone who is eyeing these-



The notes in these perfumes are good. I got the ones scented like coffee, berries and candy and the berry one is my absolute favorite. I wish i could get these exact scents as EDPs too (I got their coffee cake perfume but that doesn't smell like coffee, but rather a spicy arabic scent with hints of vanilla)



I use them for layering, especially the coffee one with my other vanilla perfumes and the scent just becomes 10x better. They also tend to last longer. I got it at 10% off so paid about 250rs for a solid perfume, which isn't bad at all. I got the EDPs at 450 each with some free charms.



Reviewing solid perfume notes: The coffee one smells like straight up coffee, which is god scent for someone like me who is obsessed with coffee. The berry one is a juicy fruity + floral mesh which I really enjoy. This would smell amazing as an EDP. The candy one is a bit strong. Less vanilla, more candy and peppermint.



Reviewing the perfumes: The Notes are pleasant, warm gourmands. The bottles are sturdy, heavy, good quality and cute to look at. The lasting is good, about 6-7 hours on clothes. They're a good affordable option.



Overall I'd say these are good for people who want to layer fragrances and are looking for easy going daily wear fragrances except coffee cake which is definitely a night time fragrance.



The best part is the solid perfumes make it though airport security which is a blessing lol. Hope this detail¬†review¬†helps!",1,1760552141.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
