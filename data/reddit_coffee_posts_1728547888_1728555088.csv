Instead of imagining a future where technology replaces jobs, think of it as an opportunity to enhance what we do best: connect, create, and innovate. By 2025, we can expect a shift in industries, where AI becomes a partner in our daily tasks, allowing us to engage in more meaningful work that requires our human touch.

One noteworthy trend is the fusion of AI with the Internet of Things (IoT). This combination will create environments‚Äîboth at home and at work‚Äîthat adjust to our needs seamlessly. Envision waking up to the smell of coffee brewing, just as your alarm goes off, or stepping into an office that knows how to set the perfect atmosphere for your project. These advancements will redefine our daily experiences, making them smoother and more intuitive. As AI systems develop the ability to understand and respond to our emotions, interactions with technology will feel more personal and enriching.

Another exciting development is the democratization of AI. Automation will no longer be confined to large corporations; small businesses will access the same advanced tools that once seemed out of reach. This leveling of the playing field will empower diverse voices and creative thinkers to bring their ideas to life. Imagine local startups using AI to solve community challenges or innovate in ways that resonate with their customers. This shift will spark a wave of entrepreneurial spirit, leading to innovations that not only disrupt markets but also contribute positively to society.

However, as we embrace this technological evolution, we must also consider the ethical implications of AI. Companies will need to place emphasis on transparency, ensuring that data privacy is respected and that AI is used responsibly. Picture a future where ethical guidelines inform every decision surrounding AI development, making technology a force for good. As we find our footing in this new landscape, the balance between human judgment and machine efficiency will pave the way for opportunities that we have yet to imagine. It‚Äôs a future that invites collaboration and growth, creating possibilities that can benefit everyone. https://firebringerai.com/2024/10/09/top-ai-automation-trends-to-watch-in-2025-3/",1,1728554095.0,FirebringerAI,0,1.0,False
1g0f7bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/1g0f7bg/spoilers_discussion_about_the_part_of_beware_of/,[Spoilers] Discussion about the part of Beware of Chicken I like the least.,"These are spoilers for Volume 5 of BoC mostly, but will include comments about earlier events, so if you aren't caught up to the latest chapters, I'd avoid this post.

So, first, I love BoC, I love the characters, I like the way its written, and it's one of the things I check for new chapters every day.

But it aint perfect, and there's this one thing that I just wanna complain about and hear your thoughts.

# Modernizing

I've hated the trope of Modernizing, and it's mostly because I think most writers don't do it all that well. Most MCs that originate from modern earth are ignorant, oblivious and blinded by their nostalgia and missing their home to realise that the technology we use daily, is not wholly good.

Coffee is **NOT THE BEST DRINK KNOWN TO MAN**. I have ADHD, not only do I hate the taste of coffee, but caffeine is what I drink before I go to bed because it makes falling asleep easier. So the continuous trope in these stories that coffee is this ""wonder drink"" that ""everyone loves"" and ""does all this stuff I think it does"", is annoying. Its fine that the MC believes this, but when the author shows they believe it? It's mildly annoying to read.

This isn't a specific dig at BoC, but as a general concept, when an MC introduces something and gets a universal reaction of ""I love this"" from everyone, and its all good news, I hate it. Please, at least make some people just ""not like it"", don't have to make it some philosophical quandary, just have some people that are unimpressed.

# Jins Modernizing

So, Jin is a lot less egregious than your typical isekai Protag in this regard, but he does do it. It's mostly done in a fairly tolerable way, and I love all the more advanced knowledge that people have, but there are one or two specific things that were done, and I just personally hate the way they were done.

From the very first few chapters, Jin spoke about his way of growing Rice. Later, Jin invites Gou Ren to live with him, with the ""reason"" supposedly being, to teach Gou Ren how he farms, so Gou Ren can go teach Hong Yaowu. Rens IMMEDIATE response to the knowledge is, ""This is too much work for the farmers, no go.""

And I do not recall a single word later, that countered that argument. Yet, later on, we are going to see Hong Yaowu thriving like never before. We'll go into that in a moment.

I just want to stress though. Farmers, especially in the past, deal with Low periods and High periods, a single bumper harvest is NOT going to change their lives. When you tell me this village has people recovering from a terrible famine a decade prior, with scars they all still carry, yes these people will be jouyous about a good year, but a single good year is not going to change their lives. Lets not get carried away.

# Bowu Machines

Bowu, cute kid. He knows something about the principles about steam, cool. Jin passing over some information? Sure. My issue is, we went from vague mutterings of Bowu learning blacksmithing from Yao Che in private, to suddenly having full on machines and a demonstration for farmers in the region.

Sorry, what?

The demonstration includes an Elden Ring style Iron Maiden scythe machine for cutting rice stalks, pulled by an Ox. The second is is a steam powered version.

Where did all this come from? How did we go this entire period with no updates on his progress?

Why is the first thing we see is these people riding these machines for races?

Why is the next page suddenly going to Hong Yaowu and everything is different, all the villagers are better off, casually using machines and having bumper crops that are unexplained?

When did these machines first appear? How long has Hong Yaowu had them? Going by the plants, did they in fact go with Jins rice method? Wasn't that not possible for them?

Jin brought change, and the change has come abruptly.

It was a mild nick in my mood when I read the demonstration, but every time I hear about these machines and them riding them, it bothers me more.

# My Complaint

It feels out of left field, with no build up. There are no consequences, no downsides, everyone loves it. You don't even have to get ""depressingly realistic"", there are so many small things.

Steam Engines? Those things are fucking dangerous. How on earth is Bowu giving the green light for random farmers to ride on something that could have an accident and blow up? Hot steam shoots out, melts flesh off bone? Where's the safety warnings? Where's the demonstration of danger, just to make sure they're aware.

How long have these things been a thing? Hong Yaowu makes it seem like they've had these things for years as a testing ground, yet the boys only been here, what? A few months?

The Ox powered one lived and died in a moment. its entire existence seems to be solely to act as a bridge for their understanding.

And the Rice shit? What about some villagers not doing it for the work involved. How about villagers joining fields, less space used, more rice grown, as they balance the work load?

Why do we not have a single chapter dedicated to talking about all this shit in some capacity? Give me Gou Ren visiting home and suggesting architectural changes to make their life easier, while they discuss trying out Jins technique.

Make Bowu take a few months to get his first Ox powered invention ready and being used by Hong Yaowu, then sold off to other farmers to make their lives easier.

Give them time to adjust, give us time to soak it in, let the technologies mature as we introduce steam powered stuff later.

Give us information about the trials Bowu has had to overcome to get things working.

STOP MAKING MODERN TECHNOLOGY AN EASILY IMPLEMENTABLE THING THAT EVERYONE LOVES AND MAKES EVERYONES LIVES BETTER.

Give us challenges, give us overcoming them, give us people who can't use it or don't want to use it!

# My Conclusion

I think if these technologies had been deployed in a ""Simpler"" form earlier, with a few chapters over these last 2 volumes dedicated to side characters and interactions with the village to implement these changes? Push back the steam industrialisation for a year, with more chapters past, present and future, devoted to exploring the difficulties Bowu experiences. Heck, a sub plotline of ""Cultivator BS"" being offered to make it easier and Bowu refusing because he wants to do all the work himself? A lot of potential for good stuff here.

1g0f390,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppgains/comments/1g0f390/my_honest_experience_with_natural_fat_burners/,My honest experience with natural fat burners that worked,"I've tried pretty much every natural fat burner out there to get leaner, and it hasn't been all smooth sailing.

You might've heard about a bunch of these products, but I'm here to share you my actual experiences.

I'm talking about the stuff that worked, the stuff that didn't, and all the gritty details in between.

Here's what I found after experimenting with the top natural fat burners for men.

# green tea extract

First on the list has to be green tea extract.

There's a reason why this is everywhere‚Äîit actually works.

I started taking it with my morning smoothie, and it definitely helped me lean out, especially around the belly.

The secret lies in EGCG, which supposedly increases metabolism.

For me, it wasn't like magic or anything, but I noticed more definition in my abs within a few weeks.

Just make sure you combine it with a workout routine‚Äîit's not gonna do all the work for you.

* Boosts metabolism, especially effective with consistent exercise
* Helps reduce stubborn belly fat

# caffeine

Next up is caffeine, and I don't mean those jittery caffeine pills.

I'm talking about the natural stuff from coffee or green coffee bean extract.

Caffeine worked wonders for me pre-workout‚Äîit gave me the kick I needed to push harder in the gym.

The fat-burning effects? Yeah, those were a nice bonus, but for me, it was mainly about the increased energy and better workouts.

If you're sensitive to caffeine, though, start slow. I learned that the hard way when I couldn't sleep after taking too much in the afternoon.

* Boosts energy and workout performance
* Can suppress appetite if taken in moderation

# forskolin

Forskolin was something I was super skeptical about, but I saw a lot of good reviews, so I figured why not.

Turns out, it‚Äôs pretty solid if you're looking to maintain muscle while shedding fat.

I used it during a body recomposition phase, and I genuinely felt like I was losing fat while still gaining strength.

I can't say the results were dramatic, but it definitely made a difference when combined with a calorie deficit.

* Helps maintain muscle while losing fat
* Works best during body recomposition

# l-carnitine

L-carnitine‚Äîthis is one I had a love-hate relationship with.

It doesn't give you any crazy boost or jittery feelings, which I liked.

But you know what? It takes time to feel the effects.

I noticed that when I was consistent with it, my endurance during cardio improved a lot.

It's definitely not a quick fix, but it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre committed long-term.

* Improves endurance and aids in fat metabolism
* No stimulant effects, ideal for sensitivity to caffeine

# conjugated linoleic acid (cla)

I took CLA because I heard it‚Äôs great for reducing body fat and holding onto lean muscle.

Honestly, I didn't expect much, but I ended up liking it.

It‚Äôs subtle‚Äîlike, don't expect overnight fat loss‚Äîbut it seemed to help me keep my gains while dropping body fat.

Especially good for targeting that stubborn fat (looking at you, lower abs).

* Reduces fat while preserving lean muscle
* Takes time, but helps with stubborn fat areas

# capsaicin

Spicy food lovers, this one's for you.

Capsaicin, the stuff in chili peppers, is a legit fat burner.

I took it in supplement form because I can't eat spicy food every day.

It really cranks up the thermogenesis‚Äîbasically, you feel warm, and that's your body burning more calories.

Noticed it mostly helped me not feel hungry all the time, which made staying in a calorie deficit way easier.

* Boosts calorie burning by increasing thermogenesis
* Helps control appetite naturally

# garcinia cambogia

Garcinia cambogia was probably the most ""meh"" one I tried.

It‚Äôs supposed to help block fat production and reduce cravings.

I did feel like my cravings were a bit more under control, especially at night, but the fat loss itself wasn‚Äôt anything crazy.

Still, if you struggle with late-night snacking, it‚Äôs worth a shot.

* Helps control cravings, especially late at night
* Not the most powerful for fat burning on its own

# best natural fat burners I've used

* [Lean by Transparent Labs](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/g1yKgX) - This one has caffeine, L-carnitine, and capsaicin, and it‚Äôs great for those who want an all-in-one product that doesn‚Äôt give jitters.
* [Recomp by Transparent Labs](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/oqQ30W) - Perfect if you‚Äôre trying to hold onto muscle while losing fat. The combo of green tea extract and forskolin worked well for me during my cut.
* [Genius Burn](https://lvnta.com/lv_lJjIiHIc6NsOJ8Z35u?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01GP2Y3BS) - Stim-free, which I love. It has garcinia cambogia, and I felt it helped me keep cravings in check.
* [Nitrosurge Shred Max by Jacked Factory](https://jackedfactory.pxf.io/EKrrg4) - I liked this one for the energy boost during workouts. It has caffeine and capsaicin, so expect to feel warm and ready to go.

# conclusion

Look, natural fat burners aren't magic, but they do help.

If you go in with realistic expectations‚Äîmeaning you still need to eat right and work out‚Äîthese can be a great addition.

For me, it was all about finding what worked best with my routine and not expecting any miracles.

Try a few, see what fits your lifestyle, and remember: consistency is key.",1,1728553579.0,suppgains,0,1.0,False
1g0f31g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadMyCup/comments/1g0f31g/getting_started_everything_you_need_to_know_about/,GETTING STARTED - Everything You Need To Know About Tasseography,"# START HERE: Learn How to Read Your Cup¬†

Welcome to the Readmycup community, where every cup tells a story‚Äîone that only you can unlock. Tasseography is not just about reading patterns; it‚Äôs about tuning into the energy that exists within your cup, embracing the journey of self-discovery, and connecting with the hidden layers of meaning that reside in everyday life. Whether you‚Äôre fascinated by coffee grounds, tea leaves, or even wine sediment, this guide will help you get started and invite you into a space where intuition meets insight, and logic harmonizes with mystery.

As expert readers with generational knowledge passed down through years of practice, we‚Äôre not only here to teach you, but to learn from you as well. Every person who picks up a cup to read brings their own unique perspective, experiences, and energy to the process. At Readmycup, we believe that everyone‚Äôs journey in tasseography adds value to our collective understanding. Whether you‚Äôre just beginning or you‚Äôve been reading for years, we encourage you to share your insights, experiences, and interpretations.

**1. Is The Tasseography A Real Thing?**

Yes, **tasseography** is a real and recognized form of divination, dating back centuries. It is the practice of interpreting the patterns and symbols left behind by coffee grounds, tea leaves, or wine sediment in a cup. While tasseography has spiritual and mystical connotations, it also relies heavily on **pattern recognition** and **symbolic interpretation**, which can appeal to both intuitive and analytical minds.

Historically, tasseography has been practiced in various cultures, especially in the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and China. It is often seen as a tool for self-reflection, guidance, or even fortune-telling. While some view it purely as a spiritual or mystical practice, others approach it more psychologically, seeing the symbols as reflections of the subconscious, much like how dreams are interpreted.

**2. Why Learn Tasseography?**

You might be drawn to tasseography out of curiosity or the desire to connect with something deeper. But here‚Äôs the truth: **every reading is unique** because it‚Äôs connected to your personal energy, your question, and your current state of mind. Learning tasseography is like opening a window to your subconscious‚Äîoffering clarity, guidance, and sometimes answers to questions you didn‚Äôt even know you had.

Think of it this way: the patterns left in your cup are more than just random remnants. **They are maps**, shaped by your thoughts, emotions, and the world around you. When you learn how to read these maps, you‚Äôll be able to navigate life‚Äôs twists and turns with more clarity. The more you understand the language of symbols, the more you realize that your cup is constantly reflecting the world inside and outside of you.

**3. What Do You Need to Begin?**

To start your journey, all you need is **a cup, a drink, and an open mind.**

* **For Coffee Grounds:** Use finely ground Turkish, Greek, or Lebanese coffee and brew it traditionally in a small pot (called a **cezve**). Drink slowly, focusing on your thoughts, and leave a small amount of liquid with the grounds. Once you flip the cup and let the grounds settle, the patterns will form.
* **For Tea Leaves:** Loose-leaf tea works best. Drink your tea with intention, leaving just enough liquid to swirl the leaves. The act of swirling spreads the leaves into shapes and symbols, ready to be interpreted.
* **For Wine Sediment or Other Drinks:** If your drink leaves residue, it can be read. Use the same method: drink, reflect, and let the sediment settle.

Your tools can be as simple or as elegant as you wish. What matters is the **connection** between you, the drink, and the energy you bring to the reading.

**4. Symbol Reading**

Now that your cup is ready, let‚Äôs talk about symbols. Symbols aren‚Äôt just arbitrary shapes‚Äîthey hold meaning that resonates on a deeper level, much like music that strikes a chord in your soul. The experience of reading is visceral. As you see symbols emerge in your cup, you‚Äôll notice how they speak to your current situation. A **heart** might feel like a burst of love on the horizon, while a **path** could remind you of a decision you‚Äôve been contemplating.

Here‚Äôs where the logic comes in: The symbols you interpret are shaped by **patterns in human psychology**. Our brains are wired to recognize symbols, and they often carry universal meanings. For example:

* **A bird** may suggest freedom or an incoming message.
* **A tree** can symbolize growth, roots, or stability.
* **Circles** often indicate completion or harmony.

But don‚Äôt stop there‚Äîevery reader sees these symbols through the lens of their own experience. You might see a bird and think of adventure, while someone else may feel it signifies a message from a loved one. **Tasseography blends both the intuitive and analytical sides of your mind.**

**5. Dream Interpretation: A Gateway to Understanding Symbols**

One of the most effective ways to sharpen your tasseography skills is to delve into **dream interpretation**. Why? Because both dreams and tasseography draw from the same symbolic language. The images in your cup are like fragments of a dream, and by learning to interpret them, you‚Äôll become fluent in the language of symbols.

Consider this: when you see something in a dream, whether it‚Äôs a snake, a key, or a bridge, it‚Äôs not just about what the object is but how it **feels** to you. The same applies to the cup. By using **dream interpretation dictionaries**, you can expand your understanding of symbols and start forming your own intuitive connections.

**Recommendations for Dream Interpretation:**

* **The Dreamer‚Äôs Dictionary: The Complete Guide to Interpreting Your Dreams** by Stearn Robinson & Tom Corbett: A timeless classic, passed down through generations.
* **Dream Moods** (Online): A comprehensive and trusted source for symbol interpretation, used by many readers to deepen their practice.

**6. Your Journey as a Reader: Trust Yourself**

Learning to read a cup is not about mastering a set of rules‚Äîit‚Äôs about learning to **trust your intuition**. The truth is, you already have the tools within you.

My gf (f30) and I (f29) have been together almost 2 years. We have had a lot of issues, boundaries set because of certain ppl in our past, mistrust, and drama. 

This guy, let's call him Herbert. (30m) Herbert was her ex fling. Not a real relationship. Herbert has no job, cannot drive, stinks, and is basically a loser. Herbert was the thing before me. She lied about who Herbert was and claimed he was just a friend in December of 2022. He texted her often and it was too suspicious. I found out they met on a dating app in March of 2023 and that's where things made sense. During that time, she brought her mom in the picture to lie for her and say Herbert was just a friend. A family friend at that. Basically putting this guy on a pedestal. At the end of it, I stood my ground and I didn't believe Herbert was just a friend. I never did. She was in tears and didn't want to block him but she did. So in September of 2023, everything comes out. She was still secretly talking to Herbert. Even went to his house and he supposedly kissed her but she didn't reciprocate. In October she finally ended the so called friendship and fessed up that they were never friends. It was a fuck buddy but supposedly just oral and hand. 

Fast forward in March of 2024, Herbert texts her from some random number saying he misses having sex in the shower with her. And I'm like ""huh?? You told me you never had sex sex? And that he was never here? And in the shower also?"" I was so distraught and since then I cannot shower with her anymore or use her shower. I just don't. I think of the stuff they did. And what bothers me is she didn't touch me much in the shower but with him, according to his message, she was on his lap, etc. 

I am not a looker but I'm not what that dude is. I have never questioned my looks and I have always been pretty confident. I used to love my average body and how I looked. And I compare and compare.

Anyways, besides not using their sex shower, I cannot go to the bookstore she went with him too or a certain coffee shop. I make an excuse or something. I think she knows why. I want to get past this because yeah I love my gf a lot and after all this stupid bullshit she has put in a lot of effort to make me comfortable. I know she realized her mistakes way too late but I am not perfect either and she has given me chances too. I want to be able to shower with her and adore her body and stuff. But I can't help but think of what that dude said.

What do I do to move past the shower thing and the places? Any advice? Has anyone gone through this?

The goal is to support fat loss without compromising muscle mass or relying on harsh stimulants.

Below, we'll explore the best natural fat burners for men that are effective, easy to use, and can be integrated into your current fitness routine.

By following these suggestions, you'll be better equipped to make an informed choice.

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea extract is one of the most researched natural fat burners.

It contains catechins, particularly **epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)**, which boosts metabolism and enhances fat oxidation.

Studies suggest that combining green tea extract with moderate exercise can significantly increase fat burning over time.

It‚Äôs particularly effective for reducing visceral fat, the type that surrounds internal organs.

* Boosts metabolism and enhances fat oxidation
* Effective for reducing visceral fat
* Works well when combined with moderate exercise

# Caffeine

Caffeine, when taken naturally from sources like green coffee bean, is a great fat burner.

It stimulates the central nervous system, increases energy expenditure, and promotes the breakdown of fatty acids.

Caffeine is often used pre-workout to enhance performance, but it also helps with appetite suppression, making it a go-to option for natural fat loss.

* Stimulates the central nervous system
* Increases energy expenditure and promotes fat breakdown
* Helps suppress appetite, ideal for pre-workout

# Forskolin

Forskolin, derived from the coleus forskohlii plant, has shown promise in reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle mass.

It works by stimulating an enzyme called **adenylyl cyclase**, which increases levels of a compound known as **cyclic AMP (cAMP)** in the body.

cAMP helps stimulate fat loss while preserving muscle mass, making forskolin particularly useful during body recomposition phases.

* Reduces body fat while increasing lean muscle mass
* Stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, boosting cAMP levels
* Useful for body recomposition phases

# L-Carnitine

L-carnitine plays a vital role in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria of cells, where they can be burned for energy.

It‚Äôs not a stimulant, which makes it a great choice for those who are sensitive to caffeine or other stimulants.

L-carnitine also aids in recovery, which is beneficial for maintaining a high level of physical activity.

* Transports fatty acids to mitochondria for energy
* Non-stimulant, ideal for those sensitive to caffeine
* Aids in recovery to support high physical activity levels

# Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)

CLA is a naturally occurring fatty acid found in meat and dairy products.

It‚Äôs been shown to help reduce body fat and increase lean body mass.

CLA works by reducing fat storage, increasing fat burning, and enhancing metabolic rate.

It‚Äôs particularly effective for targeting stubborn fat areas like the abdomen.

* Reduces body fat and increases lean body mass
* Reduces fat storage and boosts metabolic rate
* Effective for targeting stubborn fat areas

# Capsaicin

Capsaicin is the compound that gives chili peppers their heat.

It‚Äôs known to boost metabolism by increasing **thermogenesis**, which is the body‚Äôs process of burning calories to produce heat.

Capsaicin also helps reduce appetite, making it easier to stick to a calorie deficit.

Adding more spicy foods to your diet or taking capsaicin supplements can aid in fat loss.

* Boosts metabolism through thermogenesis
* Helps reduce appetite
* Found in chili peppers or available as supplements

# Garcinia Cambogia

Garcinia cambogia is a tropical fruit that contains **hydroxycitric acid (HCA)**, which may help block an enzyme that your body uses to make fat.

It also increases levels of serotonin, which can help reduce cravings and emotional eating.

While results can vary, it‚Äôs a popular choice for those looking to manage their appetite naturally.

* Blocks enzyme used to make fat
* Increases serotonin levels to reduce cravings
* Helps manage emotional eating

# How To Use Natural Fat Burners Effectively

For the best results, combine these natural fat burners with a balanced diet and consistent exercise routine.

Using a **stim-free product** can be beneficial for late-day workouts, while products like **Stim Recomp** are more suitable for morning use to kickstart metabolism.

Always start with a lower dose to assess tolerance, especially if you‚Äôre combining different supplements.

* Combine with balanced diet and consistent exercise
* Use stim-free products for late-day workouts
* Start with a lower dose to assess tolerance

# Top Products For Natural Fat Burning

* [Lean by Transparent Labs](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/g1yKgX) - Contains natural caffeine, L-carnitine, and capsaicin to boost fat loss without the jitters.

By focusing on well-researched ingredients like green tea extract, caffeine, and forskolin, you can enhance your efforts without relying on harsh stimulants.

Remember, there‚Äôs no magic pill‚Äîfat loss takes time, dedication, and a combination of proper nutrition, exercise, and smart supplementation.

1g0exe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g0exe1/i_am_bothered_by_gfs_ex_thing/,I am bothered by gfs ex thing,"I was trying to find something related or close to what I am going through on here so I could find answers but I cannot. I need advice. 

My gf (f30) and I (f29) have been together almost 2 years. We have had a lot of issues, boundaries set because of certain ppl in our past, mistrust, and drama. 

This guy, let's call him Herbert. (30m) Herbert was her ex fling. Not a real relationship. Herbert has no job, cannot drive, stinks, and is basically a loser. Herbert was the thing before me. She lied about who Herbert was and claimed he was just a friend in December of 2022. He texted her often and it was too suspicious. I found out they met on a dating app in March of 2023 and that's where things made sense. During that time, she brought her mom in the picture to lie for her and say Herbert was just a friend. A family friend at that. Basically putting this guy on a pedestal. At the end of it, I stood my ground and I didn't believe Herbert was just a friend. I never did. She was in tears and didn't want to block him but she did. So in September of 2023, everything comes out. She was still secretly talking to Herbert. Even went to his house and he supposedly kissed her but she didn't reciprocate. In October she finally ended the so called friendship and fessed up that they were never friends. It was a fuck buddy but supposedly just oral and hand. 

Fast forward in March of 2024, Herbert texts her from some random number saying he misses having sex in the shower with her. And I'm like ""huh?? You told me you never had sex sex? And that he was never here? And in the shower also?"" I was so distraught and since then I cannot shower with her anymore or use her shower. I just don't. I think of the stuff they did. And what bothers me is she didn't touch me much in the shower but with him, according to his message, she was on his lap, etc. 

I am not a looker but I'm not what that dude is. I have never questioned my looks and I have always been pretty confident. I used to love my average body and how I looked. And I compare and compare.

Anyways, besides not using their sex shower, I cannot go to the bookstore she went with him too or a certain coffee shop. I make an excuse or something. I think she knows why. I want to get past this because yeah I love my gf a lot and after all this stupid bullshit she has put in a lot of effort to make me comfortable. I know she realized her mistakes way too late but I am not perfect either and she has given me chances too. I want to be able to shower with her and adore her body and stuff. But I can't help but think of what that dude said.

What do I do to move past the shower thing and the places? Any advice? Has anyone gone through this?

I'm on week 2 of 7.5mg (so not quite 3 months), have dropped about ¬£450 on Mounjaro and have only lost 3.6lbs roughly 1% of my 312lbs. 
The Mrs has taken over cooking and we're using Gousto for portion control too (for the last 5 weeks). I'm eating 2 meals per day, lunch & dinner, easily under 2k calories. Lunch is the 2nd portion of last night's dinner, so probably about 1400-1600cal per day on AVERAGE, I will have something sweet no more than 3x per week, I drink mostly water throughout the day (with electrolytes, but zero cal) and never take sugar in my tea & coffee. 
My brother & sister are both super sensitive to this stuff so have both lost several stone and theyre both moving up to 12.5mg this week. 

I've just reported to my sister that this feels like an awful lot of money to be spending on mild nausea & indigestion. 

Food noise is only ever gone for 48hrs max after injection. 

I walk 2miles per day and significantly more on weekends (did over 30k steps last weekend alone) 

By month 3 on keto, I'm usually about 15-20lbs down. I'm trying Mounjaro as I can't ever last more than about 3-4 months on a low/no carb diet, and the weight just piles back on right after I reintroduce ANY carbs to my diet). So I thought I'd take the financial hit to ENJOY weight loss by still being able to eat the foods I want, just less of it. 

Is there such a thing as a non-responder? I sure as hell FEEL like I get full quicker, but it is NOT being represented in the scales!

1g0ew4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g0ew4i/iatah_for_ruining_our_holiday/,IATAH for ruining our holiday?,"Throwaway account. Because duh.
Me(26m) and my girlfriend(29f) are currently on holiday abroad for a week to celebrate her birthday.
We've been together for roughly 7 years now, and we have our ups and downs, however our arguments have been getting uglier and I don't understand why.

We always argue about nonsense things, and rarely ever about anything that would be deemed a valuable disagreement.

A little about ourselves:
I am a sensitive person, maybe overly sensitive, where even just the tone or the wording of the other person can make me wonder ""are they mad?"" Or ""did they mean to sound harsh?""
I'm usually laid-back, and hate confrontation, I avoid it as much as I can because it intimidates me, but I tend to lash out when I feel unfairly treated by others. (Even though the fairness is questionable sometimes)
I tend to sometimes be selfish and not see the bigger picture, which I'm trying to work on.

My girlfriend, has a naturally harsh / no filter tone. It would be easy to confuse her being angry/mad at someone if she didn't pitch her voice down into an overlay soft, almost squeaky voice (which she does in public & at work to be polite, but it takes effort & it's not her true self.)
She's otherwise a caring, kind person - but rather pragmatic & relies on logic rather than emotion. She's the typical Libra. She's beautiful, she's incredibly intelligent. She's literally smarter than anyone I've ever met.

I love her to bits, but obviously her logic & my emotion are biting each other a lot.

The issue:

Today when we woke up, I was cuddling up to her while she was using her phone, and I saw her texting with a friend of hers.
(A gay guy, that she was close friends with at some point)
Obviously me being an emotional, dumb man, I was always a bit worried about him, but she reassured me that it's nothing to worry about & I trust her.

I barely ever bring him up in a ""worried"" way, if ever.
But this morning, I saw him asking something in text that I probably misunderstood.
So I casually asked her ""what did he ask?"" In a rather drowsy state of mind.
She replied: ""Nothing special"" in an annoyed tone, as if saying ""why do I have to bother with replying to this question.""

It obviously hurt a little, and it got me a bit more unsure.
If she had asked me about my texts (which she does sometimes), I would have simply recited the text. I sometimes even give her my phone to go through my texts when she is curious about what I'm writing with someone.

So this obviously felt like.. secrecy? I don't know, I was drowsy, hurt and a tad bit worried. It lingered, these things always linger on my head.
So I waited a bit and asked again;
""You know these things bother me for a while.. what did he ask?""
At which point she freaked out at me & replied; 
""Ugh!! He just saw one of my posts and replied to it!"" In the clear annoyed tone.
I mean.. if she just said that in the first place, I would have been fine with it, but her sudden explosion of attitude just, I don't know, mixed up my negative feelings. Not jealousy, cuz I trust her.
Rather the ""why can't she just answer normally?""

So I got up, made coffee, did the usual morning business, you know.
I tried to be a bit distant until my feelings and mind were a bit more clear, but I can't fake being happy when I'm not. I tend to get numb and I can't control it when I'm upset or sad.
I just sit and doomscroll like a machine with a hollow chest.

She sat out at the balcony and eventually  asked if I'm going to sit out with her, which I did.
But when she noticed that I'm in a bad mood, she commented on it with again, an annoyed tone;
""Are you seriously going to pout now because I'm writing with him??""

I replied: ""I'm not pouting, I'm in a bad mood because I just wanted to know what he asked, and instead of just telling me you were being dismissive and harsh.""

Which lead to an argument.
She basically started saying that I'm causing yet again another argument, and she started to roll back her conversation on her phone so I can ""go through it""

I said I don't want to read her chats, I just wanted to know what he asked, but the one thing that is bothering me is how she talks to me, rude and disrespectful.

To which she replied that I'm ruining our holiday AGAIN, and if I could NOT do it for ONCE.
So I stood up, and went inside to drink my coffee so we both can cool off.
2 minutes later, she followed me to yell at me some more.
""Are you seriously not going to enjoy the balcony with me because you're upset??""

I told her I don't want to be near her when she's like this.
""Like what?""

Just overly hostile, I told her she has a double standard(because I even give her my phone so she's not worried, but she's not even telling me a minor detail when I ask), and that she's the one yelling the whole time.

So she went back to the balcony, and kept saying loudly ""he's doing this shit again, I can't believe this.""
""Another holiday ruined because of his shit.""

Then, 5 minutes later, she dressed up, and left the hotel saying ""Have fun.""
Leaving me inside with the keys.

I guess I could be the asshole, because I'm too sensitive & me shutting down could come off as me being a pouty bitch.
I probably should have just dismissed my sensitive ass feelings and forgot about it, because it's still nonsense.. but I didn't. Instead I let the argument proceed because of my lack of control for my emotions. I also might have given her the impression that I don't trust her?

So Reddit, am I the asshole for ruining my and my girlfriend's holiday?

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man‚Ä¶I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!üòõ

That said‚Ä¶I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play‚Ä¶and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secretü§´

I live in western CT but travel regularly all over CT, western MA and upstate NY for my businessüòâ

I recently started with Nakpro Perform, coffee flavour whey. Once I had it empty stomach with water after workout created a digestive mess and I was bloated and constipated the whole day (farts)

I halfed the intake scoop size and mixed with yogurt+water and had it in morning after couple of bananas. I constantly had the feeling of too full and felt bloated but No Constipation!

Is there a good / better way of having this whey without feeling uncomfortable. Is it the artificial sweetner creating the havoc??

ps : I'm quite sure i'm not Lactose Intolerant and love to have curd + milk but chai obviously creates feeling of bloating.

1g0eph6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1g0eph6/multiple_big_changes_suddenly_after_being_on_the/,Multiple big changes suddenly after being on the same dose for ~8 months. ,"So I first started on 30mg. Day 1 peak anxiety and felt like pure shit. Days 2-4 felt great, felt like it was doing what it should be. Days 5-7 started feeling like it was wearing off before lunch and by day 10 was feeling nothing at all. I was put on to 60mg and since then everything‚Äôs been going great (as long as I don‚Äôt have a coffee after taking it). 

But now suddenly after being on this dose for somewhere around 8 months, even taking it at 8am I can not get to sleep. Iv had nights where I literally get 0 sleep. I took a lot of amphetamines as a late teen/ early 20s recreationally and I know as soon as I lay down and close my eyes whether I‚Äôm going to be able to sleep or not. I‚Äôm also getting the issue again where once it starts to wear off mid afternoon and into the evening, I‚Äôm constantly clenching, licking my lips and inside of my mouth etc. and getting a really bad crash again. and on top of these I‚Äôm depressed af and my anxiety has gone back through the roof.

I‚Äôm above average health wise, gym 5-6 times per week, I drink over 5 litres of water every day. Consume 180g+ of protein every day. I take a multivitamin at night, fish oil morning and night. 

Nothing else has changed in my life, same stressful job that‚Äôs iv had for 4 years, wife and kids still the same. 

Anyone else experienced huge changes like this for no apparent reason or have any idea what the cause of any of this could be? 

My next appointment is in 3 weeks so I will obviously discuss it there. But I‚Äôm thinking about calling and asking to put me on a cancel list to try and get in sooner as I‚Äôm so tired and exhausted all the time. ",3,1728551781.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Is 2 double espresso spread out over the day ok? One in the morning and one afternoon?

1g0eo7r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0eo7r,Transcontinental Race No. 10 // recap // day 3,"I leave my sleeping place at sunrise. Because I've now slept outside for 3 nights in a row, my powerbanks are empty. So I head straight to a bakery to recharge everything. It feels strange to drink a coffee and eat two chocolate croissants in comfort. Am I still in a race? Normally you try to minimize the time at every stop, but now I'm forced to wait for the charged powerbanks. I can't really enjoy it. After 45 minutes, I continue with half-charged batteries.

During the day, I ride through rural areas of Bavaria. The further south I go, the more beautiful it gets. Near Waging am See, I meet a dotwatcher who's really enthusiastic about the race, but he doesn‚Äôt quite seem to know the rules yet. He had offered bars and water to the rider ahead of me and now wants to show me the fastest route around the lake. It‚Äôs tricky to explain to him politely that it‚Äôs not allowed, and I need to stick to my own route.

On day three, I try again to book a hotel for the night, but it's even harder than the day before. I expect to be deep in the Alps by evening, but all I can find are wellness hotels. I make a few calls, but either check-in is only until 18:00 pm, or the rooms are over 200 euros - Both is no option for me. So, I stock up on supplies in Salzburg, thinking I'll figure out somewhere to sleep later. But then another problem is on the horizon: A twinge in my knee that I've had for the past few days has now turned into real pain. I‚Äôm seriously worried.

As the sun sets, I ride into the Alps. It‚Äôs getting lonely, with just a few small villages around. At a gas station, I take a break, and Heike overtakes me. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen her since the start in Roubaix. Suddenly, I realize I‚Äôve forgotten my sunglasses. I ride back down the mountain, and luckily, they are still there.

There are two major passes to cross in the Alps. I decide to cross the Tauern Pass tonight. It‚Äôs over 1500 meters high, but at least the weather‚Äôs good. Riding through the Alps at night feels almost magical. The descent from Obertauern is freezing, and I‚Äôm wearing everything I have. My whole body is cold, and I try to find a place to sleep as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs already a rider at the first bus stop. There‚Äôs enough space for both of us, but I‚Äôm unsure about the rules, so I continue down into the valley.

Around 1:30 am, I find a free bus stop in Mauterndorf. I'm so cold that I just jump into the sleeping bag with everything I've got on. Somehow it's a great and stupid idea at the same time to ride over the Alps at night.

I'm just really sad because all my friends/relatives have stuff going on with them. Just today i met some friends to catch up over coffee and received a nice, beautiful envelope with a wedding invitation inside. My other friend will be visited by her LDR bf next week, another is cohabiting with her bf and everything is so lovely.

My cousin got married last year and he's moving to Singapore with his wife next month. Another cousin is moving in with her bf in the US next January.

Please slap me in the face and tell me I'm just being a jealous b*tch. My LDR bf seems to have no plans on meeting me in the next 2-3 years, he doesn't even have a passport. My tourist visa application was denied so let's say.. i feel like i have tried my shot at it, and I'm waiting for his turn. I locked and secured my V-card but at this point, i don't even want to have kids anymore out of fear of getting pregnant past my prime.  They get pampered and taken out on nice dates, meanwhile i got like 25 bucks on my birthday to spend on whatever. Don't get me wrong, it made me happy and I was very thankful!  But again, when i hear about what other people receive, I get jealous and feel so ugly and undeserving. I know this is very wrong of me. I'm sorry, I'm just human.

I love him and I think he does too, but lately I had to deactivate my social media and refuse meeting  friends because i get jealous of the good things going on for them and I feel inadequate. I have talked to my bf about this but he just gives me reasons like his finances, job stuff, etc.  I just hope he put in more effort I guess, but idk how to tell him.

I'm sorry if I'm asking for a lot, at the end of the day, I just want to meet him. It's almost 5 years. I'm getting older.",2,1728551399.0,LDR,2,1.0,False

Everything else I eat as much as I want, basically. 

A couple of years ago I had intense stomach pain that hurt so, so bad... more than any stomach pain I had in my life. I called the ambulance and honestly they didn't do that much for me at the hospital, but my pain continued for days until I went to the hospital and they gave me medicine for gas. It ended up completely going away after that. I got an endoscopy and the doctor said he didn't see anything at all, my stomach was just irritated/red. I got some medicine and left. 

Ever since then I've had more gas than usual, but this year it's been especially bad, I'd say since about a month or two ago, I've been feeling bloating and gas every other day but no pain. No heart burn or burping much. Usually when I take Gas X it goes away. But I have no idea what it could be and have terrible health anxiety. 

My stools are normal, sometimes they float and sometimes they don't, color is normal. 

I have gallstones? But they're just there, no pain. Not sure if related. 

I guess it could just be me getting older and getting more sensitive to food, but the incident a couple of years was strange and now all this bloating and loss of appetite due to it makes me feel uneasy.

This will be my SECOND visit to NYC, and i am wandering where to stay and what to see next?

Two years ago i stayed in Midtown and did visited lots of sections like Midtown, Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn Park, Upper East/west side, Manhattan ofcourse. I am aware that even if you visit 25 times the same areas you can see more and more things you never seen before.

But i Plan to visit NYC beginning of November and potentially would want to stay and do things in the new part of NYC, where is the next best area to stay ?

About me 
Very active person, like walk a lot, love New York in general, like food, budget flexible don‚Äôt mind cheap but also luxury can do both , like to do non touristy stuff especially find some good local food or hidden bars. Love a good stroll in Nice parks, especially when its autumn. Autumn in new york is beautiful. Like to do some uique experiences every time i visit new town or country. 

Last time I been in New York did lots of things from sipping coffee on the steps of Public Library and watch world go by,visited some movie sets,used underground for entire time like local :D. I Can have pizza on the street and another day go to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen restaurants, seen the basketball game in Maddison square garden and so on.",1,1728550292.0,AskNYC,3,0.67,False

He didn‚Äôt care ‚Äî he said it made him feel like he was dating a little girl (I‚Äôm 25). I thought it was an excuse, but then he kept asking me if I had ‚Äúcome around‚Äù or ‚Äúchanged my mind yet‚Äù.

I hadn‚Äôt been happy in the relationship and I was genuinely relieved when we broke up. But now he‚Äôs dating someone new. Nine months after we broke up. She‚Äôs a mutual friend of ours. I always knew he was sort of into her, but since we were dating and she had a boyfriend I figured they wouldn‚Äôt do anything. 

I‚Äôm so mad. I‚Äôm hurt. I can‚Äôt even fathom dating anyone right now, and he‚Äôs already moved on. He‚Äôs telling our whole friend group how incredible she is. He texted me a few days ago for the first time in months wanting to grab coffee and ‚Äúsee where I‚Äôm at‚Äù. He probably just wants to tell me about his new amazing girlfriend and rub it in my face.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to get more dates while chatting online in Qatar, written in an easy-to-understand way!

# 1. Start with a Fun Opener

When you first message someone, don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù Try something different that catches their attention and makes them smile.

* ""I swiped right for your amazing smile!""
* ""Hey, I like your cute selfie collection.""

This will make them more likely to respond because it‚Äôs fun and unique.

# 2. Build a Fun Vibe

After your opener, it‚Äôs important to build a good vibe. Share things about yourself, ask about her, and even joke about the two of you together.

* **About you:**¬†""I just finished a killer workout, feeling ready for our date.""
* **Ask about her:**¬†""What do you like to do for fun?""
* **Talk about both of you:**¬†""Looks like we have a lot in common, maybe we‚Äôre future besties!""

Keeping things light and fun will make the conversation more enjoyable.

# 3. Tease in a Fun Way

Teasing is like playful joking. You can joke with her while still being kind.

* ""Am I distracting you with my charm?""
* ""You won‚Äôt be able to resist my awesome sense of humor.""

This keeps the conversation interesting and shows that you‚Äôre confident.

# 4. Flirt a Little

Once you‚Äôre getting along well, give a nice compliment and ask more about her.

* ""You have a cute smile, but I bet there‚Äôs more to you than that.""
* ""Tell me, what‚Äôs something fun or cool about you?""

This shows you‚Äôre interested in more than just her looks.

# 5. Suggest a Meet-Up

If things are going well, you can suggest meeting up in a fun and casual way.

* ""There‚Äôs this cool caf√© called \[X\], have you been there?""
* ""Are you up for grabbing a coffee with a cute \[Nationality\] guy?""

This shows that you‚Äôre serious about meeting but keeps it light.

# 6. Move to WhatsApp

Once you‚Äôre ready, ask to continue chatting on WhatsApp, where things feel more personal.

* ""You‚Äôve got a date with a cute guy like me, what‚Äôs your WhatsApp?""

This moves the conversation from the dating app to a more private space, making it easier to set up a date.

# 7. Stay Cool

If she doesn‚Äôt respond right away, don‚Äôt worry! You can say something like:

* ""I‚Äôm enjoying this chat, but I‚Äôm not looking for just a texting buddy. If you‚Äôre serious about meeting up, let‚Äôs make it happen!""

This helps you stay confident without being pushy.

**Remember:**¬†Keep the conversation fun, be confident, and take the lead when it‚Äôs time to plan a date. By following these steps, you‚Äôll have a better chance of getting real dates and making connections!

1g0e9m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/peugeot/comments/1g0e9m3/2024_408_1_month_review/,2024 408 1 month review,"I bought a 2024 408 GT about a month ago, and I thought I'd share my opinions on the car. 

Initially, I was looking for something a bit different, because where I live, it's all crossovers, and I hate those. I also hated on-road SUVS, things like the Santa Fe, because in my twisted views it's either an off-road SUV with a ladder chassis, or a crossover, which I hated. But this is not about my hatred for those, right? :)

Anyway, I thought I'd buy a Kia K5, went as far as having the contracts ready, only physical signature needed. Then I saw the 408 in the showroom (due to the how the dealership system where I live, Kia, Mazda, BMWs, Minis and Peugeots are sold and maintained in the same facilities, not Hyundais tho :p).

I thought that it looked unique, and decided to ask for a test drive. I knew that the salesman was more than happy to let me have a go, because the 408 is quite a bit more than the K5 here, and his bonuses are no dout tied to the values of his sales.

I'll discuss the driving experience later, but let's just say that I was sold. After the paperwork and the administrative stuff were done, I stared at my new car: a grey 2024 408 GT.

After a month, this is what I'd have to say:

# Designs and looks

This is perhaps the party piece of the car in my humble experience. Especially in grey, perhaps there's a little bit of bias going on, but I think that it's more expensive that it really was, which was still a pretty penny. I've a friend in his BMW that costed nearly twice as much that turned less heads than me in that thing. If nothing else, the silhouette is unique. It's kinda Audi A7 on stills, if that's the appropriate description.

Looking closer, the creases make sense to me, and the fangs are a really nice touch.

Oh and the wheels. I haven't decided if I like the look, but it's very unique.

My small complaint is the cat ears and the real section, even though many have told me that it's the bit that they liked most. It's a bit busy for me, and it looked a bit bigger than the head.

Overall tho, a very pretty car, especially considering the price.

# Interior/Tech/Safety features

I was initially not impressed with the materials, I thought that they could be nicer, then I sat in a Merc that my mum's company issued her, and I thought: ""maybe it's better for cheap materials to be made well than for expensive materials to be made bad."" To be honest, even if it's not my car, I'd prefer the 408 materials, given how creaky that (not even a year old) Merc felt.

The design made sense to me, but my father found it confusing, and I thought that it could be quicker. Like, the animation might look nice, but when the computers are heated under the sun (I live in a tropical country), they can get a bit choppy and the animations took time any way. I also don't like the lack of physical buttons for things like air con temps control, but the i-Toggles kinda made up for it. Not quite, but close.

The air con was a bit weak. I'm sensitive to temperature and can't stand the heat, and the air con has been just about enough. Barely. I think something from the Japanese would have much stronger air con.

The gear selector was tolerable. I don't care what's their decision was, I want a level, though I suppose that it could have been all buttons instead of a P or M mode (which is not as bad as I thought, you have to really consciously select park and more importantly Manual)

The seats were nice, I could sit in them for hours, if it wasn't for the driving position.

Ah, yes, the driving position. I don't hate it, per se, but I don't think I can do long distances in it. I have to sit upright to see the dials while driving, which was not ideal. Though that being said, the steering wheel-yolk looks really nice. The buttons on them are nicely damped too, more than the Stop/Start button :).

Perhaps I'm used to driving shit cars with little to no assists, I found the assists annoying, and damn near ran into a lorry swerving into my lane because the system think that I was drifting out of lane and steered me back in. I think I turned everything off after that, though with these electronics, there's always a submenu somewhere.

Because of the way the car is shaped, it's not easy to see out of and get a bearing, but the cameras and sensors more than made it up for it. Sharp and clear, and with night compensation that was adequate so far. If anything, the sensors are a touch sensitive for city drive, but it's better safe than sorry.

Wireless Apple CarPlay is convenient 99% of the time, except for when I had to connect my phone to the third party (recommended by the law) trip camera. But other than that, it's been reliable.

The windscreen wiper system is a bit finicky. The sensor is a bit daft at recognising fog on the windscreen so I had to switch to a manual mode (I know, the horror).

Another ""not so great"" point is the speed limit detector system. From my understanding there's a sensor of sort scanning the road ahead and recognises speed limit signs. It's good when it works, the problem is that signs in the real world can fade, they can be obstructed by trees, or purposefully placed in hard to see locations, in which case it can't detect the speed limits. I thought it's broken and had it serviced, only for the mechanics to tell me that it's piss useless in my country because if the placed signs that are easy to see, then the good policemen won't be making that much money.

Speaking of piss useless, the satnav. Yeah, I use Google Maps on Apple CarPlay and that's arguably the best solution either way, but there's no map data in Peugeot's system of my contry whatsoever. It knows where I am, just don't know anything about the roads and such. I asked them about an update, they laughed and said just use Google Maps. You don't see that in Toyotas. I want the sat nav function because a) it's built in the system and b) you can get directions on the driver's display, which is more convenient than glancing to the centre display.

# Practicality

It should come as to no one's surprised that the front seats received more attention. Apart from cooling seats, it has everything, even different modes of massage.

Storage throughout the car are adequate. Not plenty, but enough. I normally travel with my thick wallet (perhaps due for an upgrade), my keys (duh), and my phone on the charger. Occasionally a cup of coffee, which at the front there're 2 cup holders that's... functional. I don't know what to say about cup holders apart from the they work and you can never have enough of them.

1 complain is that there's no dedicated space for the sunglasses, but I guess it's for the sunroof computer system. I also want a dedicated space for a perfume or wax of sorts.

Moving to the back and the story got grimmer. Literally. The only interior option (and my preference anyway) was black. Couple that with small windows, and the cabin got real dark. Not only that, because of the sloping roofline and slightly higher ground clearance than a typical saloon, not only was head room compromised but from the sitter's point of view, it's darker. The center seat is slightly raised, so if you're taller than me (a not so whopping 175cm, your hair digging into the roof. Shoulder room is also barely enough for 3 adults, definitely not something I'd call comfortable.

That being said, this car is 99% for me and me alone (RIP), so that's less of an issue.

The boot is big, not the biggest that I've seen, and I've heard that there are cars of similar sizes that have bigger boots, but it's enough for me so far. My complain is that the Darth Vader extruding bit at the back meant that I had to lift my luggage further than I would otherwise have to in say its sister car, the Citroen C5X.

It opens electrically, the kick to open function is more reliable than I thought, maybe that might become handy, but for now, it's a gimmick, but it's neat.

# The engine and driving experience

If the looks drew me in, then how it drove made me cough up the cash and bought it.

My understanding that in Europe and some other countries, the 408 is sold with a 1.2 3 cylinder, a 1.6 3 cylinder, and that 1.6 mated with a hybrid system. The most powerful powertrain churns about about 225hp and 360Nm of torque. It's a lot, but the car is too heavy. Here where I live though, we have a 1.6 (probably 3 cylinders) unit that comes with 215hp and 300Nm of torque, no batteries needed. That means that even though the figures are a bit less than in Europe, my car feels positively rapid because it weighs a good 200 and something kg lighter. I understand that journalists in Europe said that the performance doesn't live up to its looks, but here, it does. I can keep up with 3 series, C2XXs as long as I'm as brave as the other driver.

In my test drive, with 4 adults in the car, it got from 40 to 90km/h (which was the speed limit) effortlessly, which is more than enough for me.

The drawback is that it's thirstier than say, a Prius. That being said, it's probably down to my driving style. Which is to say heavy-footed.

The paddle shifter is not a highlight. They work, but they're too small and plasticky. A regular G920 simracing wheel has metal paddles that feel better.

That being said, the car is quite jerky. I don't know what the power curve is like, but I suspect that the turbo is quite substantial. In Sport and Normal mode, the car jumps every time I touched the throttle, which is fun, but quite tiring for passengers. The solution is to switch to Eco mode, but the computer resets every time the car restarts.

The car becomes good at around 50km/h and up. I don't detect any differences in steering heft in any of the drive mode, but at standard it's already intuitive to me. If you're used to Asians cars you can say that it's a tad heavy, but really, you'll get used to it quite fast.

The suspension is a curious case. On paper, it should be horrible, especially given its price, and it has flaws. The front is MacPherson at the front and torsion beam at the rear. That should tell you everything you need to know about how it should perform on paper. On tarmac though I've never felt like the car was anywhere near its limits, and even though it's a bit crashy at the rear more so at the front, it never feels out of place. It's like... not saying that this is the same as a Porsche but 911 RSes only have double wishbones recently, but their multi-link were done so well that it beats out bad to average wishbones. The car feels a bit bumpy, but solid.

It shines the most on the highway, around 90 and up. It doesn't feel wonderous around the bends or anything but the knowledge that it's torsion beams made me think twice about putting my foot down. It's FWD tho so it's not like the rear is gonna step out too dramatically without the front losing grip first.

Steering wise even though it has some helft, it's still not as communicative as its exterior would suggest. I could feel the driving aids when they're active, and I can tell what's the car is doing at a high level, but having tried a hydraulic system, yeah, it's not the same. Again, it's good, but not the best.

Also, I think it's a 3 cylinder because it sounds raspy. It's a nice sound, but has been muted quite a lot to conform to regulations. A shame. There's an option to pump artificial noise to the cabin in Sports mode, but that's cheating, so I turned it off.

# The X Factor

I think this car feels like a human being. I mean it's alive. It doesn't feel like an NPC, it has character. The flaws that I've listed made it feel unique. I know that it sounds like dribble, but I really think that the flaws are what makes the car connects to me, and me to it.

Even how it runs, it feels like a child. Jumpy, excited, energetic, but can be tiring after a while.

Think of it this way, if this was a person, it would do well in some subject, but not so well in others, *like a human being* whereas I feel like most cars, certainly from Asia and in this price range, do everything well-enough, but not really excel at anything. Like, they look inoffensive, but hardly pretty. They run fine, but not gonna set your trousers on fire. They are very reliable and sip through fuel though. That's gonna pay divident in the long run, but not for short term excitement.

# Conclusion

I am happy with the purchase so far. There are things that I can't test, namely reliability, and only applicable to me, such as dealership experience (which was sub par imo), that I won't go too deep into.

I know that Peugeot has had a bad rep, but they have come from making all sorts of things: pepper grinders, bicycles, steels, to reliable cars, to fast cars, to shit cars. I hope that their recent surge of not just the 408, but the rest of their lineup could mean that they're back to making good cars again.

I think I'm still in that honeymoon phase, perhaps in a few months I will think different. But for now, yeah, I feel good about this car. Do let me know if you want an update by then.

1g0e3qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1g0e3qy/harassment_at_starbucks_anna_nagar/,Harassment at Starbucks Anna Nagar ,"Yesterday I reached Starbucks Anna Nagar around 4 approx. I had some work in my laptop and I know I won‚Äôt be there for a long time so I ordered a cafe latte small. I was told I can only order cafe latte small size with some sandwich combination and if I don‚Äôt want any sandwich I should opt for a tall or grande size. 

I‚Äôm not a newbie to Starbucks. I use Starbucks to work pretty often. I was in Bangalore Starbucks even two days back. So I know they are bullshitting me. Anyway I paid for a tall size and then sat down and checked if there‚Äôs any update where I cannot order a small cafe latte. I did not find any update and I was also able to place a small cafe latte order in their app. So I asked for a refund to Mr. Aravind who identified himself as manager in duty. After giving a lot of excuses and hesitating, he finally made me a small cafe latte and refunded the difference amount. 

Now after approximately one and half hours, someone else came to clear my table and asked if I wanted anything else. I said no thanks and got back to my work. He made a remark like ‚Äúyou are here for a long time‚Äù I know one and half hours is not a long time in Starbucks so I did not reply anything to it and got back to work.

After a few short minutes, Mr. Aravind came and told me I need to vacate the premises and I cannot sit here for an entire day after spending such a small amount. I can clearly see his ego was affected when I made him do the refund and now he is taking it back on me. He made the remark in such a way that it was audible to nearby seats. And point to note this was approximately one hour 30 mins after my order and not ‚Äúentire day‚Äù

I asked how come others are allowed to stay longer. Some customers were present before I had come in and were still there. He said it‚Äôs coz they are spending a larger amount. 

Mr. Aravind and Mr. Akshay then proceeded to harass me for ten mins or so until I loudly said I‚Äôm not leaving until my work is completed. They can ask me for a second order but they cannot force me to leave just because I did not place a second order. 

This behaviour is completely unacceptable and so ugly tbh. Being a woman, there are only few places where we can work/ have a coffee in peace alone without any friends or family. I always considered Starbucks to be a safe place, but I‚Äôm not so sure anymore since the employees seem to be extremely unprofessional and petty. 

Edit : I want to point out that I was not rude or disrespectful when asking for a refund of the initial payment I made for tall cafe latte‚Äô. If I was rude, I can understand him trying to be rude back to me. But I was pretty polite.",159,1728548873.0,Chennai,73,0.88,False
1g0e3a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenicheelite/comments/1g0e3a0/ditch_the_plugins_create_responsive_tables_with/,Ditch the Plugins: Create Responsive Tables with Ease Using ChatGPT Canvas,"Ever feel like every plugin you use just adds another headache? 

Whether it‚Äôs another cost or another ‚Äúpro version required‚Äù pop-up, it‚Äôs frustrating. 

Especially when all you want is a functional table.

Enter ChatGPT Canvas: a way to make beautiful, responsive tables in minutes. 

No cost. No coding headaches. 

Just results.

Here‚Äôs the real deal:

Imagine a table that looks amazing on desktop and mobile. One that grabs Google‚Äôs attention and keeps your readers hooked‚Äîall without a single line of code.

I didn‚Äôt invent this tool, but I cracked the code on how to make ChatGPT Canvas work for you. And now I‚Äôm here to share.

**What's in This Guide?**

In this post, you‚Äôll learn how to:

* Create tables that look like you‚Äôve got coding expertise, without ever touching code.
* Make sure your tables are 100% responsive‚Äîthey‚Äôll look great even on a tiny iPhone SE.
* Add awesome features like alternating row colors, tooltips, and make them sortable. Basic tables are outdated.

**Step 1: No More Plugins, No More Fees**

We‚Äôre done with the endless plugin carousel. No more subscriptions, no more ‚Äúlocked features.‚Äù ChatGPT Canvas lets you build incredible tables with none of the nonsense.

I used ChatGPT to see what the top-ranking articles were doing. Then I had ChatGPT generate something even better. A fully responsive, SEO-friendly table that outshines what those big players are using.

**Step 2: The Magic is in the Prompts**

Forget coding tutorials. The only skill you need? Knowing how to prompt ChatGPT.

I fed ChatGPT the right prompts, and it generated a complete, functional table with all the features I was looking for. It‚Äôs that simple: feed it the right nudge, and it does the work for you.

**Step 3: SEO Matters‚ÄîHere‚Äôs How These Tables Help**

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwe all want Google to rank our content. Tables like these aren‚Äôt just about aesthetics; they help with user engagement, readability, and keeping readers on your page longer. And Google loves nothing more than an engaged audience.

These tables are completely readable by Google, which means they‚Äôre a win for SEO. If your competition is using decent tables, you‚Äôll be one step ahead with ChatGPT Canvas.

**Why Should You Care?**

User engagement isn‚Äôt optional. With people skimming articles faster than ever, you need something that stops them from clicking away.

The solution? A table that delivers information clearly, quickly, and beautifully. You‚Äôre not just adding content‚Äîyou‚Äôre adding something that makes your article worth staying for.

**See It in Action**

I documented every step, every prompt, every tweak I made. Want alternating colors? Done. Want it mobile-ready? Absolutely.

I even put together a video showing you how I used ChatGPT Canvas to create these tables‚Äîwithout spending a dime on plugins.

[Watch how to create stunning, responsive tables with ChatGPT Canvas]().

**Wrapping It Up**

Tables might seem trivial, but they can be the difference between a reader staying or bouncing. With ChatGPT Canvas, you can finally stop overpaying for underwhelming plugins.

Want tables that do more than just look good? That actively boost SEO, keep readers engaged, and make your content stand out?

Then grab your coffee, sit back, and watch how ChatGPT makes it all easy.",1,1728548808.0,thenicheelite,0,1.0,False

I currently use a LPP Mk3 with 12 standard and think it is absolutely wonderful. Despite novation‚Äôs clever fader style workaround for device parameter control I find myself missing tweakable knobs.

The quandary is basically Push 2 vs Move. I have always wanted Push 2 (after really enjoying Push 1), but the only thing I really feel it offers beyond the Launchpad is Note repeat and knobs (ok I concede, the amazing screen). But at the price point of Move, I could easily afford a great condition Push 2. 

Whilst the GAS permeates through me, I‚Äôm imagining the Move as an additional controller to fill in the parts I‚Äôm missing on LP (and work in tandem with it), with the added bonus of a portable sketch pad (within the house only - not in the local coffee place or park). 

I have high hopes for the development of move - like somehow managing to add additional tracks. I think it‚Äôs unlikely that they will leave it to languish undeveloped.  Luckily I had zero expectations of this thing. I don‚Äôt see it as a complete solution, but more of a really accomplished addendum to the joy of throwing something together. 

I know that know object is going to spontaneously cause me to become a talented producer, but I absolutely adore the process of learning a new thingamajig.
