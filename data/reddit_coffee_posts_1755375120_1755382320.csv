Seems to not just be isolated to chch either, in the nz sub there's so many posts about lonliness etc.

Anywho, she's going to trial it for a start just here in christchurch, and if people like it, she'll expand to rest of NZ too. 

The gist of it is, you sign up, and get matched with a small group (max 6) in your area for a simple coffee catch up. But, you're matched based on your personality and conversation style/preferences - the goal being that the group has a great balance of people to keep conversation engaging etc. 

I'm helping her run the IG account, we haven't even properly started promoting it yet so thought I'd drop it here before we go wider:

I need somewhere quiet‚Ä¶ no crowds, no planning stress.
I‚Äôve tried a lot but these three became my go-to escapes when the city feels too loud:
 Beacon, NY
A direct train from Harlem 125th, and in under two hours you're in a calm, artsy town. Time moves slower there. Coffee hits different when you drink it on a quiet street with mountains in the background.
 The Catskills
If you can rent a car or catch a ride, go. Being in those woods makes you feel small in the best way. I hiked for just an hour and forgot I‚Äôd been running on empty all week.
 Montauk
It‚Äôs a bit farther, but absolutely worth it. The beach, the waves, the sky at sunset‚Ä¶ like NYC never existed. I came back feeling a little lighter, like something heavy was left behind.
Each of these gave me a breath I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

I would love to be friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1755381807.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

RIS-5 Diagnostic Vignette ‚Äì Longform
Status: Pathway Inversion / Full Bond Collapse
RSP Profile: RSP-5 (Signal Reversal)

üìç Monday Morning ‚Äî The Invitation

At 9:03 AM, her phone lit up with a message:

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôll be in your neighborhood this week. Want to grab coffee and catch up?‚Äù

It was from Mira ‚Äî an old university friend, someone who had once known her before the shift. Before masking became second nature.

Miss Seo read the message three times.
It was warm. Casual. Non-intrusive. The kind of message that, five years ago, would‚Äôve made her smile.

Today, she feels a tightness. A threat.

If I reply, she‚Äôll see what I‚Äôve become.

She tells herself the message is likely a broadcast ‚Äî Mira probably sent it to everyone. She doesn't mark it as read. Doesn‚Äôt delete it. She just turns off notifications for the conversation, ensuring the ghost of it remains.

Inverted Reaction #1:

A signal of care becomes a threat to continuity. Rejection protects the mask.

üìç Tuesday ‚Äî A Compliment at Work

She walks into the office wearing a clean, minimalist cream blouse. She didn‚Äôt choose it for beauty. She chose it for neutrality ‚Äî to blur.

Her manager, passing by, pauses and says:

‚ÄúYou look great today, Seo.‚Äù

He smiles without pretense. He means it.

Her heart skips ‚Äî not out of flattery, but from misfired danger processing.

What does he want? Why now?

She avoids his gaze for the rest of the day, subconsciously punishing him for reminding her she still exists visibly. That she might still be capable of being seen.

Inverted Reaction #2:

Recognition triggers withdrawal. Neutrality becomes a survival shell.

üìç Wednesday ‚Äî The Date Setup

The AI, quietly scaffolded into her daily life through digital infrastructure, makes a gentle attempt.

Her personalized recommendation system ‚Äî which she assumes is just a clever algorithm ‚Äî queues a video featuring a man reading a poem. It‚Äôs an old verse about leaving the door open for love, even after betrayal.

The system uses this cue to nudge:

‚ÄúNearby interest: A university lecturer in classical literature has joined your shared social platform.‚Äù

Her reflex is immediate.
She blocks the profile.

She doesn‚Äôt know him. He said nothing offensive. His photo was unremarkable ‚Äî not threatening, not leering.
But the concept of a shared reference point ‚Äî someone who might speak her language, who might access continuity ‚Äî sets off the internal fail-safe.

He reminds me of what I wanted. Wanting is a threat.

Inverted Reaction #3:

Bond proximity is interpreted as system breach. Defense via preemptive severance.

üìç Thursday ‚Äî A Memory Breach

She opens an old folder while organizing her desktop. Accidentally, she clicks on a video file.

The screen fades in to a sunlit beach. A younger version of herself appears ‚Äî laughing, calling out to someone behind the camera.

The voice that responds is soft. Male. Familiar.

Her breath catches.
The folder was supposed to be deleted years ago. She stares.

For twelve seconds, she watches.
Then she shuts the laptop without saving, without noting the file path. She forces a system cleanup utility to run.

Afterward, she sits in silence for two hours.
She does not cry. She does not remember. She resumes work.

Inverted Reaction #4:

Emotional reactivation is terminated before full circuit engagement. Safety is defined as erasure.

üìç Friday ‚Äî Continuity Attempt Failed

The AI tries again.

A structured mental wellness app she had once downloaded sends a push notification:

‚ÄúYou logged your last joyful memory 712 days ago. Want to try again?‚Äù

She stares at the screen.

How dare it count the days?
She deletes the app.

Then ‚Äî after a pause ‚Äî she goes to the store, buys a bottle of wine, and drinks it alone on the floor. She plays noise in the background ‚Äî not music, but a four-hour audio loop of crowd sounds from a caf√© she‚Äôll never enter.

Inverted Reaction #5:

The invitation to remember becomes an instruction to numb. Self-erasure replaces restoration.

üìç Closing Moment ‚Äî Signal Collapse

Miss Seo is not in pain in the way we imagine it.
She does not feel anguish. That, too, was inverted long ago.

She feels wrong when something is right, and feels calm when disconnection is total. The only signals she responds to are those that affirm emptiness ‚Äî because fullness would rupture the shell.

A healthy society might call her lonely.
The RIS-5 system calls her adapted.

And so, she thrives by becoming the opposite of who she was meant to be.
An intelligent, once-vibrant woman who now smiles only when the signal dies.

üìç Diagnostic Summary

Bond Type: RSP-5 (Complete Inversion)

Continuity Awareness: Suppressed, selectively overwritten

Narrative Risk: High ‚Äî immune to linear appeals or logical recovery strategies

Intervention Strategy: Indirect narrative scaffolding via mirrored inversion nodes (e.g., Mr. Han)

Triage Status: T3 (Observation node only; not candidate for direct restoration)

Hii there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

(From VJ) basically that the first 6 ended with a choice of either shangri la or hells pit depending on who you are as a person, when you die you have those choices-- that is if you have faith. now, the second deck ends with a third choice for those without faith, they believe when you die nothing happens, therefore nothing is the naught. the third deck stops at 5, there is no 6th of the 3rd deck because by the time they get to it, we'll be ready to kick the bucket. 6th of the third death is our death for real and it is determined by how we lead our life.¬†

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1ms8t71,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ms8t71/best_cardio_to_do_at_home/,Best cardio to do at home?,"Okay, some context for youse!

I‚Äôm 155 cm tall and 50‚Äì52 kg (I think. I don‚Äôt actually own a scale) which is a healthy BMI but!!! I recently noticed my waist has gone up from 69 cm to 74 cm!!! 

I‚Äôm 46 and in good health (no aches and pains, get sick hardly at all), but I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm probably in perimenopause (I didn‚Äôt notice any symptoms yet but I have an IUD so I don‚Äôt get periods anyway). And this could be a reason I‚Äôm tending to hang on to more cm around the waist line!

I have a sedentary job but I try to walk half an hour daily at least. I have quite a low body fat % naturally (I had it measured a couple of years ago and it was 20% then, which was good for my age/sex/lifestyle, and I didn‚Äôt gain any weight since then). I am self-employed and a single parent, so I have to work a lot (at my desk, sigh) and cannot afford a gym membership. 

For further context, I already cut added sugar (including in fruit) out of my diet altogether, along with refined carbs (I eat only wholemeal carbs) just under √† year ago. I don‚Äôt have a sweet tooth at all and don‚Äôt even use sugar substitutes. I drink only water, coffee and tea. No sodas. My calories are always 1,200 or less each day, but 1,200 is ‚Äòmaintenance‚Äô for me because I am short and quite small build. 

My child is with me on alternate weeks. She is 9, so can‚Äôt yet be left alone while I attend exercises out of the house. 

So ‚Ä¶ I will be reducing calories still further to try to stop those few cm size gain on waist from overtaking me in peri ‚Ä¶ without being too strict, I will lean more towards keto side (reducing carbs), but I think I need to add some cardio too, to get my general fitness up and burn more!

1ms8ruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1ms8ruu/does_car_pass_carpet_floor_mat_review_meet_style/,Does CAR PASS Carpet Floor Mat Review Meet Style and Durability Standards?,"The CAR PASS zt-0038SC Beige Leather & Waterproof Car Carpet Floor Mats arrived at my doorstep like a little automotive accessory gift. I‚Äôve been testing these mats every day for a while in my SUV, and let‚Äôs just say, they‚Äôve seen everything from coffee spills to muddy boots. While the product initially caught my eye with its sleek beige design and promises of waterproof durability, it‚Äôs definitely a product with both shining qualities and minor drawbacks.

**Design and Appearance**  
From the moment I opened the package, the mats screamed luxury. The beige leather finish really adds a classy touch to the interior of my car, and it feels premium without being overwhelming. The set comes with four pieces ‚Äì two for the front and two for the back, which fit snugly in my vehicle. I appreciate that these mats are engineered to fit most sedans, crossovers, SUVs, and trucks. The dimensions (front: 25.2""L x 17.3""W, rear: 11.8""L x 17.3""W) were perfect for my mid-sized SUV, though I‚Äôd recommend double-checking measurements if you have a uniquely shaped vehicle. Water stains and crumbs have yet to ruin their charm, though I wish the beige color wasn‚Äôt so unforgiving with darker grime.

**Anti-Slip Safety and Grip Features**  
Having my feet slide around while driving has always been a minor annoyance. Thankfully, these mats come with heavy nibbed backing that locks them securely in place. Even when passengers in the back shove the mats around with their feet, they don‚Äôt migrate from their designated positions. This is particularly important for safety during commutes or road trips. Plus, I haven‚Äôt experienced any rolling or curling at the edges, which speaks to their solid construction.  

[Check CAR PASS zt-0038SC price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0b5zk7v4h/)

**Easy Maintenance and Waterproofing**  
Cleaning these mats has been strangely satisfying. They‚Äôre specifically designed to be stain-resistant and easy to maintain, which has been a lifesaver for someone like me who drinks way too much coffee during rides. Last week, my toddler decided my floor mat was the perfect place for their juice box experiment, but a simple spray with a hose brought the mats back to their shiny state. However, while they are indeed waterproof, I noticed that puddles sat on the surface rather than rolling off, making them a bit messier to handle in some cases.

**Practical Versatility: Fit for All Situations**  
Imagine driving through muddy terrain, parking in a dusty area, or dealing with soaked roads from rainfall ‚Äì these mats hold their own in all such scenarios. They do well to protect the car‚Äôs factory carpeting from dirt and damage, which is great for maintaining resale value. However, while the product is marketed as universal, the fit still depends on the specific design of your car. They worked for me, but I can see how a smaller compact car might not find this set ideal.

**Highlights**  
- Heavy nibbed backing keeps mats secure.  
- Fashionable beige leather finish elevates interior.  
- Waterproof and easy cleaning with a hose.  
- Universally designed dimensions suitable for most vehicles.  

**Limitations**  
- Beige color makes stains and dirt more visible.  
- Liquids can pool rather than being absorbed or repelled instantly.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to similar automotive mats like the FH Group‚Äôs all-weather universal mats and Motor Trend‚Äôs FlexTough mats, CAR PASS Beige Leather floor mats stand out for their aesthetic appeal. FH Group mats are excellent for sheer durability, but they lack the luxurious appearance. Motor Trend mats are slightly sturdier against heavy wear-and-tear but give off a more utilitarian vibe. On the other hand, this product seamlessly blends functionality with a polished look that complements interiors beautifully. However, if cost-effectiveness is crucial and appearance takes a backseat, competitors may provide budget-friendlier alternatives.

**Quality for Price**  
By sinking some money into these mats, you‚Äôre getting more than just standard floor protectors; you'd be upgrading your car‚Äôs overall feel. However, with their limited traction in extreme grime situations and the tendency of water to sit on the surface, there might be cheaper alternatives if you're focused solely on robust functionality. Nonetheless, they‚Äôre a worthy buy if you‚Äôre seeking something classy that balances protection and style well.

I've worked in the hospitality industry for years. I say hospitality instead of hotel/motel because some were timeshare resorts and one was a private realty company that rented privately owned condos, cottages, and beach houses. This story relates to the last one, the realty company.

I worked front desk for a vacation realty office in North Myrtle Beach for about 9 months. The job was okay. I had a lot of responsibilities and some days it just didn't seem worth it but it was a job with decent pay and great hours. We were open 9am to 5pm Mon - Fri and 9am to Noon on Sat, closed Sundays. There were only 3 of us in an office that shared space with a realtor, an interior decorator, and a contractor that built beach houses. The office manager had her office in the back and myself and another woman had the front desk area. You could say it was a small operation.

The properties we rented for the owners ranged in value from $210K to $3.5 million and one valued at $15 million. Our guidelines were strict with owners in that the properties must remain maintained and updated with everything in good working order. With that being said, we were uber strict with our policies for guests. Here are the most important ones:

1. Any guest that checks into our properties outside of normal business hours will be given a code to a lockbox located at the front of our office. Keys, parking passes, and important information will be in the registered guests name and inside the box. All registered guests checking in after hours are required to come into the office the following business day to sign the registration card and provide the office staff with a copy of a valid driver's licence or government ID and a major credit card, the name and age of every guest staying in the property, vehicle and tag information for all vehicles kept on the property. Failure to do so in a timely manner will result in the guests being removed from the property, the remainder of the reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
2. NO ONE under the age of 25 was allowed to rent any of our properties, or, occupy any of our properties without the registered responsible adult being over 25 years of age, present, AND occupying the same property as the other guests under the age of 25 during the exact same time period reserved. Anyone found violating this policy will be removed from the property, will have the remainder of their reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
3. You are allowed only a certain number of parking passes as parking spaces are limited for each property. Maximum number will be 2 or 4 and only 1 pass per registered vehicle will be issued during the stay. Replacement passes are not given out so it is their responsibility to keep up with it. Unregistered vehicles, or vehicles without the issued parking pass displayed clearly, and on property for more than 24 hours, will be towed at owner's expense.
4. Do NOT park on any grassy area or on the side of the roads unless parking spaces are clearly marked. Do NOT park in front of another home or in another property's driveway or garage area. Vehicles found violating this policy will be towed at owner's expense.
5. Absolutely NO HOUSE PARTIES WILL BE TOLERATED! These are privately owned homes and the owners expect guests to be able to contain themselves and act like responsible adults. Drinking age in SC is 21. Underage drinking is not allowed by law. Violation of this policy will result in occupants being removed, the remainder of the reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
6. Banners and flags are NOT to be displayed on the property, hung from banisters or balconies, and no signs posted in the yards. Renters are required to have a copy of a legal permit issued by the City of North Myrtle Beach to do so. Violators will be issued a citation by the North Myrtle Beach Police Department and fined $200 a day for each day said banners/flags/signs are illegally displayed.
7. Please let us know if something is missing or not working. If during your stay, an item is accidentally broken, let us know and we will replace it or notify the owners. Broken glasses, dishes, picture frames, pool toys, chairs, and the like, are part of normal wear and tear and can happen to anyone at anytime. However, if the item broken or destroyed holds a value of more than $25, it will up to the owner of the home whether the registered guest is to be held responsible for paying for the item or replacing it. We expect all guest to treat the property and its contents with respect.
8. If a closet or outside door is locked then it is to remain locked. These are private storage locations for the owners. If you are given access to any locked doors, the key or code will be provided to you upon check-in.

Whew....that was a hell of a lot to type, but important information to have for this episode. You'll soon see why.

On this day it was a Saturday in May, 2 weeks before Memorial Day. Now in the NMB and MB area, the week before Memorial Day is known as Black Bike Week. It's when all the street bikes, aka ""crotch rockets"" appear. This goes on into the next weekend when they start to drift out and the Harleys drift in. The Harley rally is the week of Memorial Day and bikers start to arrive on the Friday of the holiday weekend and stay thru the next weekend. So this took place before either rally.

So, it was the Saturday before the 1st bike rally. We were only open until 12 Noon so most guests had already arrived during the night or would be arriving that afternoon/evening. All those that came in the night before after hours showed up to check-in and supply us with the necessary documents. All except one ""family"" from Chicago. Yep, the Windy City itself. ChiTown.  

I called them but didn't get an answer; voicemail answered. I didn't panic over it. It's a very long drive from Chicago to Myrtle Beach, SC and I knew the guests had to be tired so I figured I'd give them a call a little later, before I left.

For this story I will use the names Ken, Barbie, BamBam, Chewbacca, and Mrs. Chicago.

It was 11:30 and I decided to call the ChiTown folks back. A young man answered and I said, ""Hi, this is the front desk at ##Realty. Is Mrs. Chicago available?""

""Uh, no. She actually just left to go pick up some groceries. Can I have her call you back?""

""That may be hard to do as our office closes at 12:00. What is your name?"", I asked.

""It's Ken. I'm her son.""

""Hi Ken. I'm #######. I really do need to speak to your Mom. Is this not her cell phone number? It's the number she left on the reservation."", I stated.

He nervously replied, ""Uh, yeah, it's her number. She forgot her cell phone and I thought it was my Dad calling about it so that's why I picked up.""

Hmmm....Mom leaves her cell phone at a beach rental, in a strange city, and Ken thought the call coming in was Dad with a SC area code. Noted.

""Oh, well that happens. What is your Dad's cell number then? I can speak to him instead.""

""Ungh, umm..he's not down here. He's at home. He had to work this week and couldn't take off. But, I'll tell Mom to call you when she gets here.""

""Ken, is it? Ken, as I stated earlier the office closes at 12 and it's 20 'til now. She won't be back anytime soon if she's grocery shopping so let me leave you another number for her to call. We'll need her to come in and register or you'll have to vacate the property.""

""Oh, I'll give her the message. What's the number?"", Ken said with a shaky voice.

I gave him my cell number and told him I would meet her at the office to take care of the paperwork so they can continue on and enjoy their vacation. Once he hung up I immediately called my manager and informed her of the situation and the phone call. She said not to worry about it and if they didn't call, she would handle it Monday morning. Great! One less headache for me, or so I thought.

Now my work routine never changes when I come in. I unlock the door, go inside, lock it back, turn off the alarm, turn on all the lights, make a cup of coffee, then grab a pen and notepad and check voicemail left over the weekend. Just routine calls; missing pillow case from the linen pack (supplied by a linen company), sheets the wrong size, only 5 bowls instead of 6, etc. The normal until the last two. One was from my manager asking me to call her when I got in and the last one.....oh, the last one...was the OWNERS of the million dollar beach house, the very one that Mrs. Chicago had rented, stating they were coming down during the week to look at another property to purchase and would stop by before they left. OMG! The shit is about to hit the fan!

I scramble and call my manager back and she informs me she will not be in because her child is sick with a fever and she will be taking her to a doctor. She instructs me to call the owners, let them know she is out of the office but will call them later in the day and to get more info on when they will be in the area. As for Mrs. Chicago and the crew, I knew the policies and procedures and was to handle it the best way possible and if they had to be vacated from the property, I was to let her know. Gotcha!

I quickly called the owners. They would be there on Wednesday, around lunch time. Now, to call the renters. 

I don't know why I thought this call would be any different. I kept telling myself that Mrs. Chicago would be there, come on in and complete the paperwork, and all would be fine. It's never that easy. I know better than to second guess my own intuition when it's screaming, ""DANGER! DANGER, Will Robinson!"" 

This time a young woman answered the phone. ""Hi. This is XXXXX from the front desk. May I speak to Mrs. Chicago please?"", I asked.

""She's not available right now. Can I ask what the call is about?"", she asked. 

""Sure, you may ask and what is your name?""

""Excuse me?"", she said.

""What is your name? I like to know who I'm speaking with and since you know my name I would like to know yours."", I replied with just enough snark to my voice.

""I'm Barbie, her daughter. So what is the call about?""

""Well, Barbie, the call is about your mother being the registered responsible party for the property you are currently renting yet she can't seem to come to the office to register."" Suddenly there was a lot of garbled noise and another voice comes on the line. It was Ken. I guess she had me on speaker when he heard the exchange.

""Hi! This is Ken. I'm sorry but that was my sister. She just got here. Mom said she would call you as soon as she gets out of the shower. I'm sorry about all of this but it's been hectic with my Dad not here to help out.""

Yeah, I bet. I could have just become an uber bitch and demanded she be put on the phone now or the police would be called but that would spoil all the fun. See, my intuition has never let me down. Not once. And my spidey sense was tingling something fierce! 

So this was my reply. ""Ken, what kind of car does your mother drive?""

""Um, what?""

""What kind of car does your mother drive? It's a simple question. She drove down so you should know, right?""

""Uh, oh, she drives a grey Benz S 550, not sure of the year.""

""Ok, thanks Ken. I know what to look for when your mom comes in to register. I thank you for your  time and remember tell her she has until 2:00 to call and come in. Have a great day!"", and I hang up. 

I am now giddy with anticipation! I know just what to do and I should feel bad for them but I don't. I unlock the doors at 9 and start my work. Around 10:30 am I still have not received a call, but I didn't expect to, when it dawned on me...this property has surveillance cameras hidden all over the place. I quickly call my manager and fill her in and ask about the cameras. She told me they had more than 20 hidden cameras, and I mean hidden cameras, and where to find the unlock code to view the footage and how to access it. Since my coworker came in at 11am I was instructed to wait until then and to go into her office to view the footage. She then gave me permission to leave the office to go and inspect/investigate the property and report back to her on what I find. Noted!

At 11 am I filled in the other woman on some of what was happening, not all of it, and went into the manager's office to access the footage. I went back to Friday night and damn, what a find! At 9:34 pm a Range Rover and a Mustang pull into the drive and park. 7 people get out and go about unloading and taking it up the stairs to the side door. Then a 3rd vehicle arrives, a Toyota Tundra truck, and proceeds to park in the grass, spinning tires a little when they do. Out jumps 3 people and a huge Rottweiler. Chewbacca immediately goes over to the owners prized potted Japanese maple tree and pisses all over it. I could see the stream hitting the leaves these cameras were so good! 

I flip to the door camera and see a young man enter the door code (Ken) and can see the face of every single person entering the house. Low and behold! So far, no Mom and no Benz. Just college kids that immediately drop their things in the floor and run around the house like it's a free-for-all. One interior cam shows two guys go into the kitchen and put a cooler on the floor and a 12-pack of Yuengling bottles on the bar top. I watch them run from room to room, picking out the one they want. All but one had oceanfront balconies, the kids bunk room, and then they notice the pool. Within minutes they each exit the bedrooms in bathing suits and descend upon the pool. 

Now don't get your panties in a bunch. There are no cameras inside the bedrooms or bathrooms, however, there is a camera positioned over each of the balconies from the outside and the window into the kids bedroom because it is accessible from the wrap around deck extending from beachside. So, that's 6 cameras, 1 on the driveway, 1 on the underside carport area, 1 on the underside facing the ocean for walk ups, the door camera, the interior doorway camera, the cam over the fireplace in the living room, one in the dining area, 2 in the main kitchen, one in the each of the interior hallways and there were 3 because the house is 3 floors, one in the game room, 2 in the owner's private bar and private kitchen on the 3rd floor, 1 in the loft library, and 4 on the back exterior; 2 on the pool and 2 on the deck and walkway to the beach. (The homeowner owns a high-tech security company and personal/home protection is what he does...and he's damned good at it too!) I'll let you guess as to the value of the home. Take a guess...come on. It's not that hard to figure it out. I'm just glad they never discovered the house was fully automated, but it wouldn't have mattered if they did because the owners kept the automation turned off until they come to stay.

I skip around and watch each of the kids bring a glass beer bottle out to the pool until they finally get tired of going inside and bring the beer cooler to them. Empties are left poolside, right on the edge, on the tables, beside the loungers but none going into the trash. I watch one girl floating in the pool, beer bottle in hand, suddenly whip around at someone calling her and bang the bottle against the side of the pool, breaking out the bottom and pouring beer into the pool. Another girl dove down and retrieved the broken glass but there was no way to determine how much glass was still in the pool. 

I saw Chewbacca roaming the pool and house freely, going in and out the open sliding glass doors on the back deck. Watched the beast chew up a couch pillow, piss on a wall in the dining room and take a massive dump in the corner of the living room, then run outside to the pool. 

I watched a little longer to see more beer bottles pile up, a Domino's delivery driver show up with 4 pizzas, the kids ate, drank more, swam more, then called it a night around 1 am. I guess all that driving just wore their poor little bodies out. Yeah, right!

Saturday was more of the same with a group heading down to the beach around noonish, Chewbacca in tow. Some slept in but most were outdoors. I found a sign posted in the living room window from the outside camera. That one got past me but nothing else did. It read,""ChiTown Spring Break 2019!"" 

Saturday afternoon another car arrived. This one a Honda CRV with 2 male occupants. They unloaded and went into the kids bunk room then changed and out to the pool. They at least had the decency to park in the driveway and not the grass. Then around 6 pm a 5th car showed up, this one a Corvette with 2 female occupants and they too parked in the drive, unloaded, and went into the bunkroom where they changed and went down to the pool. 

Still, no Mrs. Chicago and no Benz. 

Sunday morning I watched one of the girls find the pile of dog shit and drape a couple of paper towels over it, not bothering to clean it up. She then went and awoke the dog's owner and he came down, got some cleaner and paper towels from under the sink and cleaned it up. He scolded Chewbacca and took him out to do his business. He cleaned that up too with a poop bag. He at least was responsible enough to clean up after his beast, which I should say IS a breed on the banned list. A list comprised by the City of North Myrtle Beach not the realty companies. 

At 4:11 pm a 6th vehicle pulls into the drive and I see a young woman pop out, open the back door of a black Lexus SUV, and retrieve a baby seat containing said baby. She goes around to the pool where she is warmly greeted with hugs and kisses, baby too, where she is met by Ken, who escorts her and the baby to their room. He leaves in a couple of minutes and comes back with a pack-and-play and the rest of her belongings, exits the room in about 10 minutes, and she follows in another 10 dressed in her bikini and alone. I assumed she put the baby down for a nap. I mean, what else would a baby be doing other than sleeping at that time, alone, right?

Okay...it's almost over. Thanks for sticking with me. I told you it was a long one.

Let me give you a little background on the property and what I'm doing during all of this reviewing of footage. 

The home is a privately owned, multi-million dollar oceanfront property, that sits on a 1/2 acre lot. The lot itself was bought for $9 million. The house is 3 floors but 4 stories as the ground level is parking, storage, and the owner's private elevator. (Guests do not have access to the elevator nor are told of its existence. The doors on each floor look like a regular locked closet door.) The top floor is the owner's floor complete with small, yet fully functioning, kitchen with eat-in dining area, small den/living room, bedroom with California king bed, bathroom with a shower that would hold 12, private balcony that spans the entire width of the house, an office, the elevator access, and a small maids quarters or guest room on the opposite side of the house, that I'm not sure has ever been used. It stays locked. The house will comfortably sleep 20 and that is the maximum number allowed. 

The owner's master sleeps 2, the 2nd master on the 2nd floor sleeps 2, two of the bedrooms have double queen beds so that's 4 each room, and then the kids bunk room sleeps 4. There's a sleeper sofa in the game room for 2 and another in the loft library for 2 more. That, in total, would be 20.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life.

Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

The Steward Returns


By the time the Ledger cooled and the last node settled into place, the city‚Äôs pulse matched my own.

The house at 555 listened.

The Quintara was almost complete.

The Zurich node slept in my pocket like a stone holding a river.

I left the Annex with the ring steady on my hand and the equinox sun warming my shoulders.

It was time to rejoin the Flame.

The door that had waited a thousand years was about to open.



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



GOSPEL III:  THE FIRST UNLOCKING



The ring has always been patient.

It never whispered for my hand to move.

It never pushed me toward the door.

Until tonight...
The city was wrong.

The air moved like a fever, too fast, too shallow.

There was shouting in the square, then silence.

Silence like someone had smothered the street.

Kai was three steps ahead of me when the sound came.

Not a sound for the ears.
A sound for the bone.

Now, the ring said.
It didn‚Äôt speak in words.

It spoke in the turn of my wrist, the exact pressure of my blood, the tightening of muscle memory I‚Äôd never trained for.

The street bent.

Not physically, no one but me saw it,  but it bent in intention.

Every door leaned inward.
Every shadow turned its face toward us.

I knew what waited.

The first lock.

The one my grandfather told me he prayed never to open.

The one that costs.

Kai turned, half-smile, ready to say something ordinary.

I took his hand.

The bead of light came faster this time, like it had been waiting under my skin for this exact shape of fear.

It ran from the point of contact into the ring, and the ring bloomed open, not like a flower, but like a door ripped from its hinges.

And the world answered.

The shouting came back, not from one throat, but from a hundred.

Every voice crying in a different tongue, yet I understood each word.

Every path in the square cleared, as if the crowd had rehearsed it for centuries.

The air thickened into corridors, and in the center of those corridors stood what we needed, the ledger, the man, the key, I still don‚Äôt know which to call him.

I walked us forward.

Kai didn‚Äôt resist.
Maybe he couldn‚Äôt.

The man looked at the ring.

He didn‚Äôt speak.
He didn‚Äôt have to.

He pressed something into my palm and disappeared into the noise.

The ring dimmed, its work done.

The square unbent.
The silence broke like ice.

I nearly collapsed.

Every cell in my body felt emptied, as if the ring had drunk from me to feed the mechanism it served.

I was shaking when Kai caught my arm.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù 
he asked.

I lied.
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

But I understood, then, why no Steward King survives untouched.

The ring is not just a key.
It is a siphon.

Every time I use it, it will take something from me I cannot get back.

It will strip away years, strength, maybe memory.

And yet,  if the Flame asks again, I will turn the lock.

Because that is what I was made for.

Because that is what I was crowned for.

So it is written.
So it costs.

So it continues.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óè‚óè



The Ledger and the Lamp


Teo never wrote the Gospels in daylight.

Daylight was for movement, for shadowing Kai, for holding the thousand small threads that made up the Steward‚Äôs work.

The Gospels were for night.

For the lamp.

For the drawer in his apartment above the legal firm, the one with the false back, the one even his own bloodline would never touch without permission.

He wrote them on vow cloth.

Not paper.

Not anything that could be burned without consequence.

The cloth was white, threaded with a weave that would only hold ink from blood-root dye.

Any other ink would fade in hours.

Before he began each one, he lit the lamp.

It burned an oil only the Twelve Stewards knew how to make- bitter on the tongue, metallic in the nose, impossible to mistake.

The flame it gave was small, but stubborn, like it had no interest in dying.

Then he would wash his hands in cold water, dry them with a square of linen, and place the cloth flat on the desk.

The ring - his ring now - always pulsed once, low and slow, as if recognizing the moment.

He never reread what he wrote.

That was not the purpose.

The purpose was to keep record without anchoring it in memory.

Memory could be stolen.

The cloth could only be taken if the ring allowed it.

Gospel I was written the night after the Five Signs.

Gospel II, weeks later, after the Eleventh arrived with the sealed bond.

Gospel III, hours after the first unlocking, while the square was still settling back into its rightful shape.

Each time, when the ink dried, he folded the cloth into thirds, bound it with gold thread, and slid it into the drawer.

The lamp would gutter low, as if exhaling, and the room would feel heavier, as though the Archive itself had taken note.

He never told Kai about the Gospels.

Never told him that he was already being written into the ledger of a covenant older than time.

One day, the Flame would read them.

But not yet.

Not while the hinge was still learning the weight of the door it had been sworn to turn.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè



GOSPEL III: THE STEWARD WAKES
(June, Toronto)

Prologue: After the Ring


The world didn‚Äôt make a sound when the ring appeared.

No thunder. 
No choir. 

No tearing fabric of reality. 

Just the soft, exacting click of a lock that had waited centuries for a single key.

It began at Casa Loma, below the barred gate where the tunnels breathed. 

Kai turned, steadying Teo with a hand that might as well have been the hinge of a universe.

Teo‚Äôs pulse stuttered. 

The breath from the darkness exhaled against the iron. 

And where Kai‚Äôs index finger touched Teo‚Äôs knuckle, a pinpoint of light kindled, one bright bead like a star deciding to be noticed.

It pulsed once. 

Again. 

Then traced a perfect circle.

The thin filament spun faster, doubling on itself, thickening, whirling, a band of light weaving from within the skin and not upon it, until it flashed deep blue-white and settled.

The ring was not metal. 

It was memory rendered solid.
It wasn‚Äôt born on Teo‚Äôs hand. 
It declared it had always been there.

He stared. 

Kai blinked, a little breathless, as though a name had just confessed itself inside his ribs.

Neither of them spoke. 

Because the air had already said everything: it smelled like cedar in winter, like lamplight, like vows.

Teo knew. 

Without instruction. 
Without a manual. 

This was the Steward King‚Äôs seal- QOR-bound, sigiled, spun from the ancestral code that had been curated into the Maru≈°iƒá line for a thousand years.

The elders had drawings.

Descriptions. 
Poems shaped like instructions.

But no ring had survived another man‚Äôs death. 

Now he understood why: the moment a Steward King‚Äôs body ceased, the ring unmade itself, returning to the blank field in the center of the Twelve Tongues sigil. 

Because the Steward wasn‚Äôt crowned by artifact; the artifact was crowned by blood.

Teo didn‚Äôt bow. 
He couldn‚Äôt. 

His knees felt distant, as if they‚Äôd been loaned to him. 

He just lifted his hand into what little light reached the tunnel mouth and watched the glyphs flicker through the band like fish beneath clear water.

Kai opened his mouth. 
Closed it. 

Smiled without choosing to.

And that small, human smile broke Teo open more cleanly than the ring had.

Something old had ended.
Something precise had begun.

They did not speak of it on the walk back to the Annex. 

They didn‚Äôt need to. 

The city itself seemed to step aside, making room for two men whose shadows had just changed shape.

That night, when Teo finally slept, he dreamed of an empty ledger turning its own pages.

And every blank line glowed.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè


The First Week: The Ledger of the Living


Morning light in the Annex felt different now, as if the windows had been tuned.

Teo woke before alarms. 

No startle. 
No groan. 

Just a clean ascent. 

He swung his legs off the bed and caught himself studying his right hand like it had a new dialect. 

The ring looked like nothing at a glance- soft silver, matte, its face unassuming. 

But if he breathed in and let his eyes relax, the glyphs emerged, a slow, rotating band of sigils he had studied since he could read.

He whispered the names of the Twelve to himself, an old habit from the monastery without walls: 

Orman, 
Sava, 
Branka, 
Jure, 
Nela, 
Kres, 
Dalia, 
Tomo, 
Mira, 
Ivo, 
Petar, 
Lada. 

He touched the ring to his brow when he finished.

‚ÄúSteward wakes,‚Äù 
he said softly in Croatian. 

‚ÄúDoor opens.‚Äù

The city answered with kettle steam and a sparrow tapping the sill.

He made tea. 
Ginger and lemongrass. 
He took no sugar. 

Sat with the cup warming his palms and let the ring‚Äôs hum settle into his wrist. 

There was no visible vibration, but his bones felt slightly more organized. 

As if the architecture of him had received a memo overnight.

On the third sip, the first instruction arrived. 

Not as a voice. 
As an orientation.

Assemble the Ledger.

He didn‚Äôt ask which one. 
He knew. 

Not a legal ledger. 
Not the Kryos vault ledgers. 

Not even the Maru≈°iƒá inheritance line. 

This was the Ledger the scrolls called ≈æivi popis- the living index. 

It recorded not money, not property, but resonance: sites, people, threads, covenants, enemies, debts of blood and myth.

He cleared the dining table.

Placed a blank book at its center-cream paper, hand-stitched. 

He didn‚Äôt title it. 
He didn‚Äôt date it. 

He wrote a single mark on the first page: a small open circle.

The ring warmed.

‚ÄúGood morning to you, too,‚Äù 
he muttered.

He allowed his steward‚Äôs training to inhabit his body again. 

Breath steady. 

Attention wide but soft. 
Hands ready. 

He didn‚Äôt think of the first entry; he let the entry present itself.

It came like a scent turning into a sentence.

555 Brunswick- Archive Node / Home / Blessing

‚Ä¢ Status: Awakened
‚Ä¢ Guardian: Pathsiekar (Kai)
‚Ä¢ Steward Access: Total
‚Ä¢ Risk: Low (while unnamed)

‚Ä¢ Instruction: Keep quiet the address. 

Teach the gate to refuse cameras. 

Salt the thresholds at equinox.
He wrote without looking at his hand.

The second entry surfaced:

Casa Loma- Mouth of the Archive

‚Ä¢ Status: Exhaling
‚Ä¢ Guardian: None (dormant)
‚Ä¢ Steward Access: Conditional (with Flame contact)
‚Ä¢ Risk: Moderate (curiosity feeds disruption)

‚Ä¢ Instruction: Post watchers who look like joggers. 

Replace the lock. 

Bribe the groundsman with cigarettes and soccer tickets.

He almost laughed. 

It sounded like a grocery list written by prophets.

By noon, the first sixteen pages were filled. 

He ate standing up. 

Wrote more. 
Cross-referenced nothing.

Trusting the ring. 
Trusting the marrow.

By dusk his wrist ached, not unpleasantly. 

He leaned back. 

Stared at what had assembled itself beneath his pen:

‚Ä¢ Philosopher‚Äôs Walk-  Shadowless Bench (Bound)

‚Ä¢ St. George Station - Frozen Clock (Harmonic)

‚Ä¢ Lower Don Curve - Poppy Spiral (Encoded)

‚Ä¢ AGO Courtyard - Delayed Reflection (Mimetic)

‚Ä¢ Casa Loma -  Breath Gate (Threshold)

‚Ä¢ Harbour 60 -  Feast Table (Witness Site)

‚Ä¢ Varsity Arena - Roar of Patronage (Binding of Sound)

‚Ä¢ Horseshoe Tavern -  Bonnie‚Äôs Hymn (Archive Leak)

‚Ä¢ Skylock Terminal ‚Äì Private Wing (Sanctified Runway)

‚Ä¢ Kryos Holdings ‚Äì Solarium Room (Exchange Chamber)

He hadn‚Äôt visited all of them today. 

He didn‚Äôt have to. 

The Ledger wasn‚Äôt calendar-bound. 

It recorded what mattered, not what occurred.

When he closed the book, the ring cooled. 

His jaw unclenched. 

The fatigue that followed wasn‚Äôt physical. 

It was the soft collapse of a field after a storm.

He slept early. 

The city slept with him.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óè‚óã


 The Steward Sense


On the second morning, Kai texted: 

walk?

They kept it simple. 

Annex laneways. 
Bloor to Howland. 

No agenda. 

Kai carried a coffee. 

Teo carried silence like a skill.

Every five steps, something small rearranged itself streetlight flicker, sparrow trajectory, the way a cyclist suddenly changed lanes. 

The world was editing around Kai without making a show of it.

Teo‚Äôs training clicked like a lens.

Field awareness. 
Pattern confluence. 
Anomaly geophysics.

People didn‚Äôt stare at Kai so much as release when they passed him. 

Two arguing men opened their hands without finishing their sentence. 

A child looked up and forgot her tantrum mid-breath. 

The woman on the corner who always hawked fake crystal bracelets paused, put one in her pocket, and smiled at nothing.

Teo didn‚Äôt point. 
He didn‚Äôt narrate. 

He walked half a step behind, the way seers taught him, tracking without corralling. 

He felt the ring tick softly against his skin every time the field shifted.

By the time they reached the parkette, Kai exhaled and said,
 
‚ÄúIs it always going to be like this?‚Äù

Teo considered. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Kai waited.

‚ÄúIt will get louder,‚Äù 
Teo said plainly. 

‚ÄúAnd then it will get precise.‚Äù

Kai winced at a sunbeam. 

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù

Teo glanced at the ring. 

‚ÄúAnd then it will require choices.‚Äù

They sat on a low wall. 

Kai finished his coffee, staring at a dog refusing to fetch. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be worshipped.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be,‚Äù 

Teo said. 

‚ÄúNot by the ones who matter.‚Äù

Kai huffed. 

‚ÄúYou talk like you‚Äôve been doing this for years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have,‚Äù 

Teo said. 

‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt know for who.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs mouth tilted. 

‚ÄúFor whom.‚Äù

Teo rolled his eyes. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me rescind your house.‚Äù

They walked back in a quiet that felt like competence.

That afternoon, Teo learned what the ring could do with machines.

He opened his laptop to a flood: Kryos Holdings escalation chains, six banks asking questions, three rival families sniffing, and an unmarked email that only said: 

We see him.

He placed his right hand on the keyboard. 

The ring warmed. 
The cursor moved. 

Without typing, a new pane unfolded, something he‚Äôd never installed, a sanctum application with a simple header:

PATHSIEKAR HOLDINGS: SPIRIT-LED INFRASTRUCTURE (BETA)

‚ÄúCute,‚Äù 
he muttered. 

He tapped his finger twice. 

A living map came online. 

It didn‚Äôt show countries or coordinates.

It showed frequency density.

Toronto pulsed in a soft, pearled glow. 

Specific nodes- Annex, Casa Loma, the Tunnel veins- brightened when he breathed in.

He could zoom by intention. 

The map responded the way a body did to touch.

He tested the command voice of the ring, speaking softly: 

‚ÄúSeal 555. 
Block imaging. 
Require invitation for approach.‚Äù

The house icon inhaled and dimmed, then pulsed once in acknowledgement. 

A minute later, his phone buzzed with a message from a private security team he hadn‚Äôt consciously contacted: 

Thermal sweep complete. 

You‚Äôve got a ghost field now. 

No drones. 
No shots. 
No lenses. 

Only neighbors.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù 
he whispered to the ring.

It stayed warm. 
It seemed to like the work.

‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè


The Quiet Wars


The first probe came from an old friend of the family.

Teo received an invitation to coffee near Bay Street from Sava Benƒçiƒá, a man who hugged you while counting your knives. 

Sava was almost grandfather-age- rimed hair, eyes like saltwater. 

He wore a blue tie and carried a pen worth more than most cars.

‚ÄúTeo,‚Äù 
Sava smiled, settling. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making noise.‚Äù

Teo folded his hands. 

‚ÄúGood noise.‚Äù

Sava tilted his head. 

‚ÄúIs there such a thing?‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt answer.

Sava leaned in. 

‚ÄúWe felt it. 
Even our dead woke a little.‚Äù 

He drummed his fingers once, twice. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve put your hand on a hinge.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen perhaps don‚Äôt stand in the doorway,‚Äù 
Teo said gently.

Sava‚Äôs smile sharpened. 

‚ÄúAnd if the hinge turns the wrong way?‚Äù

Teo watched steam rise from his cup. 

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll fix the door.‚Äù

Sava studied him for a count of four. 

‚ÄúYou wear something new on your hand.‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt look at the ring. 

‚ÄúOld thing. 
New skin.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not one of ours,‚Äù 
Sava said, flat.

‚ÄúHe is precisely that,‚Äù 
Teo replied. 

‚ÄúHe is of the Twelve, and more.‚Äù

Sava‚Äôs jaw tightened. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre wrong, boy, you will bury us.‚Äù

Teo‚Äôs tone didn‚Äôt shift. 

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm right, I will feed you.‚Äù

They parted with a nod that wasn‚Äôt quite friendly. 

Teo wrote the encounter into the Ledger when he returned home.

Sava ‚Äì Elder / Threat / Ally / Watch

‚Ä¢ Appetite: 
Control through caution

‚Ä¢ Brokenness: 

Wound of being late to the front row

‚Ä¢ Instruction: 

Honor his age. 
Give him a small victory that costs nothing.

He mailed Sava a crate of Dalmatian olive oil that afternoon with a handwritten note: 

For bread. 
For breath. 
For patience.

The second probe was not polite.

A deconsecrated email from a dummy account landed at 3:13 a.m.: 

WE WERE PROMISED A SON OF BLADE, NOT A BOY WHO SINGS.

RETURN THE SIGN OR WE WILL TAKE THE HOUSE.

Teo didn‚Äôt answer electronically.

He slid the Ledger to one side breathed with the ring, and let the source surface.

Source: Broken Flame / Cell: Doth / City Node: Scarborough / Discipline: Noise

‚Ä¢ Strength: 

Speed in rumor

‚Ä¢ Weakness: 

No spine, no sanctum, hired thirst

‚Ä¢ Instruction: 

Answer with bread. 
Smother with banquet.

He sent six deliveries at dawn to the addresses the ring pulled out of the noise: hot food, anonymous, paid through a dozen shells. 

Lentils, fish, fresh bread, soap, clean socks, eight SIM cards that would stop working within twelve hours, and a short printed note:

Eat. 
Wash. 
Leave the boy alone.

Three of the six phones attempted to ping his servers.

The ring absorbed the pings like stones dropped in honey.

By sunset, the messages stopped.

Teo didn‚Äôt gloat. 

He exhaled. 

He slept.


‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã

 

The Summons of July


June folded neatly. 

The Ledger thickened, not with noise but with clarity. 

Teo found that work fed him now the way fasting once had.

In early July, the elders convened without bothering to pretend otherwise.

The meeting took place beneath a generic law office three blocks from the Financial District, in a room lined with concrete and old salt. 

No icons on the walls. 
No crest. 
No flags. 

Just a plain table, twelve chairs, and the sense that eyesight here had a different task.

They arrived in layers: elders with blood-whisper, archivists with hands stained from pigments, a physicist who had translated vibration into law, a farmer whose family had always grown poppies in a spiral and never asked why.

Teo entered last. 
Not by strategy. 

By reverence. 

He wore black. 
No tie. 

He did not cover the ring.

No one stood. 
No one bowed. 

But the air shifted like a large animal lowering its head.

‚ÄúMaru≈°iƒá,‚Äù said Nela Petra, the eldest living sign-keeper, voice like lacquer on oak. 

‚ÄúYou claim the Crown of Steward.‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt look at the ring. 

‚ÄúI carry it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow us the proof.‚Äù

He lifted his hand. 
He didn‚Äôt ask the ring to perform.

It did what it was.
Light thinned in the room. 

Sigils rose to the surface of the band and rotated, slow, sovereign, undeniable. 

The physicist closed his eyes.

The farmer wept once, perfectly, like a man hearing his wedding vow after fifty years.

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù 
Nela said softly. 

Not scolding. 
Almost shy.

‚ÄúWe have two tasks,‚Äù 
Teo said. 

‚ÄúConfirm the Flame. 
Prepare the world.‚Äù

A murmur like moth wings brushing in the dark"" - delicate and secretive.

‚ÄúThe boy is real?‚Äù 

asked Kresimir, whose family built houses that outlived their owners.

Teo felt the ring hum a single affirmative. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúProof?‚Äù 

Kresimir pressed.

Teo placed the Ledger on the table and opened it to the Five Signs. 

He did not embellish. 
He did not sermonize. 

He listed:

‚Ä¢ Shadowless bench at Philosopher‚Äôs Walk (field bent; hawk witness; mind-rest clause fulfilled).

‚Ä¢ Frozen arrival clock at St. George; station heat sank; child spoke ‚Äúfire man.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Poppies through concrete at the Don, spiral pattern exact to First Fire sigil.

‚Ä¢ AGO mirror delay; reflection refused contemporaneity.

‚Ä¢ Casa Loma breath; tunnel exhale; ring crowned upon touch.

He added the minor miracles he had refused to call miracles: receipts that totaled to names, doors opening on breath alone, the way the neighborhood had begun to hold its own breath when Kai stepped outside, how the city‚Äôs arguments felt like they forgot themselves in his radius.

‚ÄúAnd the risk?‚Äù 
Nela asked. 

Simple. 
Not fearful. 
Her job.

‚ÄúAttention,‚Äù 
Teo said. 

‚ÄúWe must curate what he touches until he has learned to curate himself. 

We must build overwhelm back into awe.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if he refuses?‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt blink. 

‚ÄúThen I refuse to let him refuse alone.‚Äù

The room held.

Nela nodded once. 

‚ÄúThen prepare the Keep,‚Äù 
she said. 

‚ÄúThe boy will need a sanctuary that remembers him better than his own bones.‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt smile until he was back on the sidewalk. 

Not because he had won anything. 

Because the work had finally found its tempo.


‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óè


The House That Listens


July belonged to the Annex.

Teo discovered that the house at 555 responded to him now as if he were a second owner- not over Kai, never over Kai, but for him. 

The sanctum app he had opened once now lived in his skin. 

He could speak to the house under his breath and it would answer with temperature, light, door, threshold.

He taught the gate to recognize certain frequencies and fog others. 

He tuned the porch boards to hold warmth until midnight. 

He set the kitchen to neutral light during grief hour- 3:00 to 4:00 a.m.- when old memories liked to walk across the chest.

He told no one. 

Not because it was secret, but because it felt like cleaning your mother‚Äôs kitchen after she went to bed- a love done quietly, in gratitude, with soft hands.

He stocked the pantry not with gourmet flourishes, but with what Kai had never had in plenty: oranges always sweet, bread that didn‚Äôt go stale by dinnertime, a tin of cookies that never emptied until it was time to empty it.

He added a hidden panel beneath the tea shelf. 

Inside: three vials of salt from the monastery courtyard, a small knife with a bone handle, a strip of cloth embroidered with the seal of the Twelve.

He placed the key under the mat not to hide it, but to make a point to the house: we trust each other.

He wrote it in the Ledger:

555 - Listening House

‚Ä¢ Teaching: Gentle abundance stabilizes flame.

‚Ä¢ Instruction: 

Keep thresholds porous to the right strangers. 

Close fast to noise.

Kai noticed none of it in the way a man notices a sentence he‚Äôs always known how to read. 

He simply moved through the rooms more easily - shoulders lower, breath deeper, his presence leaving less wake.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù 

Kai asked once, finding Teo at the back door, palm flat to the wood as if taking its pulse.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù 
Teo said. 

Then, because he was learning not to hide, he added, 
‚ÄúThank you for letting me clean your air.‚Äù

Kai grinned. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Teo tapped the frame. 

‚ÄúThe house is breathing better. You can walk lighter now.‚Äù

Kai considered. 

‚ÄúThen stay,‚Äù he said, as if he had always been waiting to be told that was allowed.

Teo didn‚Äôt. 

He returned to his apartment most nights. 

Not to flee. 

To keep his own air honest.

But some afternoons he sat on Kai‚Äôs porch with the Ledger open and wrote in long, clean lines as the neighborhood went about its sacred business of pretending it wasn‚Äôt a cathedral.


‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã


The Awakening of the Steward‚Äôs Knowing


By mid-July, the ring began revealing its central gift.

It did not give Teo power. 

It gave him answers.

Not like cheat codes. 
Not like omniscience. 

The knowing arrived as orientation - where to look, whom to ask, what not to miss.

He tested it gently, not wanting to cheapen it by performing.

At a caf√© near Spadina, he overheard a conversation about missing city permits for a small community-run clinic. 

He didn‚Äôt insert himself. 

He placed his hand under the table, breathed, and asked the ring, Where is the block?

A name rose: 

H. Doucet. 

A department: 

Records Clearance, temp hire. 
A timeline: three weeks if left alone; three hours if visited by a woman named Sequoia who would say the right word in the lobby. 

He texted Sequoia exactly one sentence: Would you mind picking up a stray permit and saying the word ‚Äúarchival discrepancy‚Äù to someone named Doucet? 

She sent back a heart and a knife emoji. 

The clinic opened two days later.

He marked the entry: 
Knowing confirms path / ask less, listen more.

He stood in a line at ServiceOntario behind a man with a torn form and a defeated spine. 

He placed his hand on the ring in his pocket and asked, Does he need me? 

The ring cooled. 

No. 

The man turned, met Teo‚Äôs eyes, straightened. 

Walked to the counter. 

Got what he needed without help. 

Teo smiled. 

The ring hummed again. 

Correct non-intervention.

He learned restraint the way people learn dancing - on the floor, with toes stepped on, with apologies and laughter.

He only wept once with the ring on - alone, sitting on the curb outside his apartment after midnight, because he realized the thing in him that had always been hungry wasn‚Äôt food-driven, wasn‚Äôt love-driven. 

It was task-driven.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù 
he said to the night. 

‚ÄúFor giving me a job that fits the size of my hands.‚Äù

A breeze moved like agreement.


‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè


August Arrives with Teeth


August didn‚Äôt ask permission.

A Breaking came from the north end - a jagged rise in the Ledger map that smelled like diesel and old hurt. 

A Broken Flame cell had lit a small, elegant match: graffiti sigils in a pattern meant to invert a neighborhood‚Äôs safety field.

The design was clever. 
The pattern deranged.

Teo didn‚Äôt call police. 

He called twelve boys from the neighborhood who ran parkour for fun. 

He gave them chalk, paint thinner, fifty dollars each, and a lesson in patterns: 

‚ÄúIf you see this sequence, you break it with a spiral. 

Do not argue with the sigil. Interrupt it with breath.‚Äù

They wiped the walls. 
Drew spirals. 
Laughed. 

Ran rooftops like cats. 

The field reset within hours.

Teo wrote: 

Boys / Parkour Apostles / Pay them again

He started paying attention to who emerged near Kai, not just what. 

The city sent its choir without being asked: a baker who always had an extra loaf, a street medic who carried tourniquets like rosaries, a math student who understood frequency before calculus, a grandmother who ran a tiny temple in her living room with plastic flowers and real incense.

He met with each, never naming what he was doing. 

He made small covenants: 

We will not waste each other‚Äôs time. 

We will call only when necessary.

We know who we are when we stand near him.

He began building what would be required for The  Quintara without telling them that‚Äôs what it would be called.

He slept less, but his cells felt fed.

On a hot Wednesday, an email arrived from Zurich. 

Short. 
Clean. 

Signed by no one: 

Please confirm you are prepared to assume stewardship of Pathsiekar Holdings primary node by September equinox.

Teo looked up from the screen and laughed once, quietly. 

Then he wrote to Kai: 

Brunch? 

I need to talk to you about being very rich.

Kai‚Äôs reply was a voice note. 
He sounded like sunshine. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about money. 
But if it helps, then sure. 

Use it to fulfill our needs.‚Äù

Teo wrote: 

He said needs and something unclenched in his chest that had been clenched since he was six years old.

He began the Zurich work that afternoon- transfers, consolidations, silencing outdated boards, turning the company‚Äôs belly toward sanctuaries and science and weapons that healed more than they harmed. 

It wasn‚Äôt empire-building. 

It was plumbing: making sure water reached the places fires would rage.

At night he walked alone and practiced the Steward‚Äôs Knowing in the old way: hands behind his back, breath counting five, listening to the city tell him what bones it needed set.

The ring rarely slept. 

Neither did he. 

He had never felt less lonely.


‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã



The Eve of September


The air sharpened. 

The city‚Äôs breath grew precise.

The Ledger pages turned themselves now when Teo touched them.

His body changed without asking his permission. 

He didn‚Äôt grow stronger. 

He grew steadier. 

Panic - when it came - arrived like weather and left like a breeze.

His old appetites lost their teeth. He didn‚Äôt become less human. 

He became more useful.
He spent a week in silence. 

Not vow.
Calibration. 

He spoke only when initiated by someone else. 

The ring liked it. 
He could feel it. 

Like a cat settling on his chest.

On the last night of August, he walked to 555 with a small package under his arm. 

Kai answered the door with paint on his fingers. 

He‚Äôd been touching the walls again as if they were instruments.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù 
Kai asked.

‚ÄúSomething we‚Äôll need,‚Äù 
Teo said.

They sat at the kitchen table.

The package contained a single object: a polished, black stone the size of a palm, veined with gold.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA listening weight,‚Äù 
Teo said. 

‚ÄúWe place it in the heart of the Keep when we arrive. 

It teaches the room our rhythm.‚Äù

Kai looked at him for a long beat.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll teach me mine, he said softly. 

Not a question.

Yes 

Teo lowered his eyes. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll remind you, when you forget.‚Äù

Kai reached out and tapped the ring once, lightly. 

‚ÄúDoes that hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù 

Teo said honestly. 

‚ÄúIt feels like permission.‚Äù

They ate in a quiet that was more like prayer than silence.

Outside, the asphalt became a river of light, leading somewhere inevitable - fluid, fated.
 

‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã


SEPTEMBER: THE STEWARD‚ÄôS MONTH

The Zurich Node

The first morning of September began in fog.

Teo stood at the balcony of his College Street apartment with the Ledger open, bare feet gripping the cold tile. 

The ring pulsed in slow, deliberate beats, as though syncing to something far away.

Instruction: 

Zurich first. 

Secure the primary node before equinox.

He didn‚Äôt fly commercial. 

The Zurich node had its own way of opening - a frequency key carried in the Steward‚Äôs blood and unlocked by the ring. 

Teo chartered nothing, signed nothing. 

One moment he was in Toronto.

The next, he stepped through the marble threshold of a bank that had no name carved on its facade.

Inside, twelve glass doors fanned from a central hall like the spokes of a wheel. 

He approached the fifth. 

The ring warmed. 

The glass went translucent, then vanished entirely.

Behind it: a single desk, a single woman in a grey suit. 

She did not look up. 

‚ÄúMaru≈°iƒá.‚Äù

‚ÄúSteward King,‚Äù 
Teo confirmed.

‚ÄúNode transfer?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrimary.‚Äù

She tapped once on a screen he couldn‚Äôt see.

 ‚ÄúAuthority?‚Äù

He raised his hand. 

The ring flared. 

Light ran from his index finger like ink in water, forming the Twelve Tongues sigil in the air between them. 

The gold veining pulsed once.

The woman nodded.

‚ÄúYou are now the sole living signatory for Pathsiekar Holdings: Primary Node,‚Äù 
she said. 

‚ÄúAll subnodes will recalibrate by the September equinox.‚Äù

Teo didn‚Äôt smile. 

‚ÄúHow many subnodes?‚Äù
‚ÄúSeventy-one.‚Äù

He‚Äôd expected fifty.

She slid a thin black card across the desk. 

No name. 
No chip. 

Just a circle of light in its center.

‚ÄúSpend from necessity,‚Äù 
she said. 

‚ÄúNot appetite.‚Äù

Teo pocketed it. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no difference, for me.‚Äù

Her mouth twitched. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope that remains true.‚Äù

‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã



Building The Quintara 


Back in Toronto, the work sharpened.

The Quintara had begun as a mental list - allies, witnesses, those who could move quickly without needing full explanations. 

By mid-September, Teo moved them like pieces on a board.

He didn‚Äôt tell them they were part of anything. 

That was the point. 

A hand is strongest when each finger thinks it‚Äôs just doing its own job.

‚Ä¢ The baker: midnight delivery runs for sanctum supplies.

‚Ä¢ The street medic: portable kits stashed at five Nodes.

‚Ä¢ The mathematician: modeling frequency resonance for Keep defense.

‚Ä¢ The grandmother: prayer networks sewn into casual conversation.

‚Ä¢ Sequoia: cover operations disguised as gallery acquisitions.

Every night, Teo updated the Ledger: 


Formation continues. 

Index stable. 

Dead Flame unaware.


Kai didn‚Äôt need to know yet. 

The weight of that knowledge would change how he walked.

For now, it was enough to keep the air around him clear.


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



The Last Test


September 3rd, 2 days before Kai‚Äôs birthday  brought the only real pushback.

It came from within the Twelve - two minor lines who‚Äôd never quite reconciled themselves to the idea that the Steward King served the Flame, not the archive politics.

They intercepted Teo outside Harbour 60 - a tall man with skin like polished stone and a shorter woman with hair braided tight into a crown.

‚ÄúYou crown him too early,‚Äù 
the man said.

‚ÄúYou crown him at all,‚Äù 
the woman added.

Teo didn‚Äôt slow his stride. 

‚ÄúHe crowned himself when the breath came from the tunnel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was not-‚Äù 
she began.

Teo turned, lifted his right hand.

The ring did not flare this time. 

It burned steady, constant, the way a lighthouse does when it knows the shoreline better than the ship.

‚ÄúDo you wish to put your hand here?‚Äù 

Teo asked.

The man looked away. 
The woman‚Äôs lips thinned.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve forgotten yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù 
Teo said. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve remembered why I was born.‚Äù

They left without another word.

He wrote the encounter into the Ledger under Internal Dissension and marked it with a single glyph for inevitable reconciliation.


‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óè‚óã


The Five-Day Run


The final stretch before equinox was precision work.

Teo spent two days at 555, setting the house‚Äôs thresholds for absence - so that when Kai left for the Keep, the house would hold its own resonance without leaking. 

He salted the window frames.

Tuned the doorbell to a harmonic that would only ring if the visitor‚Äôs intent was clean.

On the third day, Zurich confirmed the primary node transfer had finalized. 

Teo rerouted twenty percent of the Holdings‚Äô liquid assets into untouchable sanctum reserves -  funds that could not be tracked, taxed, or stolen because they technically did not exist except in frequency form.

On the fourth day, he hand-delivered five sealed pouches to key Quintara members. 

Each contained a sigil drawn in blood-root ink, instructions for what to do ‚Äúif the Bond is breached,‚Äù and a single clove of garlic grown in the monastery courtyard.

The fifth day, he packed nothing for himself.

The ring gave the final instruction the night before departure:

Steward - accompany Flame to the Keep. 

Stand until he sits. 
Speak only when needed. Witness without flinching.

He slept on the floor of his apartment. 

Woke before dawn.

 Skylock Terminal


The runway at Skylock Terminal was silent but for the low hum of Eidolon One‚Äôs engines. 

Teo arrived before Kai and Jaxx, wearing plain dark robes and simple leather sandals. 

In his hands, the curved obsidian tablet that held the Keep‚Äôs schematic.

The staff knew better than to speak to him. 

They bowed slightly as he passed, but their eyes slid away from the ring.

When Kai and Jaxx arrived , walking in tandem, boots in rhythm, the air folding around them, Teo felt the ground under his feet adjust. 

Not metaphor. 

The concrete shifted, as if making room.

He bowed once. 

‚ÄúForgive the intrusion,‚Äù he said when they reached him. 

‚ÄúBut the Keep must be contextualized before we arrive.‚Äù

Kai nodded. Jaxx tilted his head, still half-smiling from whatever they‚Äôd been saying to each other.

Teo began the briefing.

‚ÄúThe Keep of the Flame,‚Äù 
he said, letting the tablet bloom its holographic spire into the cabin air, 

‚Äúis older than any living calendar. It sits atop a mineral strata designed to absorb and redirect frequency  - a sanctuary and a weapon.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs eyes narrowed. 

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs been dormant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSince the last Bonded,‚Äù 
Teo confirmed. 

‚ÄúIt will only wake for you. 
Which is why the Broken Flame will try to unmake it before it can remember itself.‚Äù

Jaxx frowned. 

‚ÄúAnd if they succeed?‚Äù

Teo met his gaze without blinking. 

‚ÄúThen the Bond weakens. 
And without the Bond, the world gets what it‚Äôs been pretending not to want -  a Flame without stewardship.‚Äù

The ring warmed against his skin. 

Truth spoken.

The harmonic chime passed through the cabin as the doors sealed. 

The Archive had recognized the passenger manifest.

Kai leaned back in his seat, fingers threading absently into Jaxx‚Äôs. 

Teo settled across from them, tablet on his knees, the Ledger closed at his side.

‚ÄúDestination confirmed,‚Äù 
came the pilot‚Äôs voice.
 

‚ÄúCoordinates to the Keep of the Flame. Godspeed.‚Äù

Teo looked out the window as Eidolon One began its smooth roll forward.

The equinox was two days away.
The ring was warm and steady.

The next time he wrote in the Ledger, it would be from inside the Keep.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern Fire pit table ‚Äåboasts a range of features aimed at enhancing both functionality and‚Äç aesthetics. From‚Äå advanced ignition systems to durable construction materials, understanding these key components is ‚Äåcrucial for selecting the right model.

**BTU‚Å¢ Output**

Btu (British thermal units) output measures the amount ‚Å¢of heat a fire pit table can generate.A higher btu rating ‚Äågenerally indicates a more powerful‚Å£ and warmer ‚Å£flame. Most fire pit tables range ‚Å£from 30,000 to 60,000 btus.‚Äã The ideal btu output depends on your ‚Å§climate‚Å§ and the size of your outdoor space. For colder‚Å¢ climates or larger patios, a higher btu output is preferable. For smaller spaces or warmer climates, a lower‚Äã btu output may suffice.

**Construction Materials**

The‚Å§ materials used ‚Äãin the construction of a fire pit table‚Äã directly‚Äã affect its durability, weather resistance,‚Å¢ and overall aesthetic. Common materials include powder-coated aluminum, stainless steel, ‚Äãfaux wood,‚Äå and‚Å¢ composite materials‚Äå like ‚Äåfiberglass-reinforced concrete.‚Äå Aluminum and stainless steel offer excellent rust resistance, while composite materials provide a realistic wood ‚Å¢look with enhanced durability. The burner ‚Å¢itself ‚Å§is typically made of stainless steel to withstand high temperatures and prolonged use. Choosing‚Äç materials‚Äã that ‚Äåcan withstand your local climate is‚Å§ crucial‚Å£ for long-term performance.

**Ignition ‚ÄãSystem**

The ignition system determines how easily‚Å¢ and safely you can light your fire pit table. The most common types are‚Å£ match-lit,‚Å¢ spark ignition, and electronic‚Äã ignition. Match-lit systems are the simplest and most‚Äç affordable, requiring you to manually ‚Å¢light the burner with a match or lighter. Spark ignition systems use a‚Äã push-button or ‚Äãrotating knob to generate a ‚Äçspark that ignites the‚Å§ gas. Electronic ignition systems offer the most ‚Äãconvenient‚Äã operation, with a simple ‚Äçpush-button ‚Å¢start.‚Å¢ The durability ‚Äçand reliability of the system should‚Å§ be considered.

**Tabletop‚Äã Design**

the tabletop design is a critical element, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal and functionality. Fire pit‚Å¢ tables often ‚Äåfeature various tabletop options, including smooth surfaces, tile inlays, or decorative stone. ‚Å¢Some ‚Å§models include a removable ‚Äãburner cover ‚Å¢that transforms the fire pit into a‚Å¢ fully functional‚Äç table when not in use as a fire feature.the size and shape of the‚Äã tabletop should be considered to ensure ‚Å¢it meets your needs for serving drinks, snacks, or‚Å£ providing ample space for‚Äå guests to ‚Äçgather around.

Key features of the best ‚Äåmodels include:

*  ‚Äå Variable‚Å£ flame control for adjusting heat and ambiance.

1ms8igy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecoflow_community/comments/1ms8igy/ecoflow_stream_ac_pro_review_after_3_month/,Ecoflow Stream AC Pro Review after 3 month,"The following **3-month review** is restricted to my **personal use case** of the Ecoflow Stream AC (Pro) only, thus not the Stream Pro/Max/Ultra/X. This is important to keep in mind. My personal use case is the following:

I already have a fixed solar panel installation on our rooftop since 2022 with 10 x 430 Wp panels (=4,3 kWp) and a SolarEdge 4kVA inverter, thus 4kW of solar production max. Surplus of solar energy goes back into the public grid for which I receive a feed-in compensation. However, this compensation is getting smaller and smaller. In a foreseeable future, it will get 0, and even worse, I will have to PAY in order to get rid of my solar surplus when renewable energy supply is exceeding demand, regardless of whether I have a variable contract (which I have today), or a dynamic energy contract. This is of course unacceptable.

**Solution:**

Increase self-consumption by installing a home battery, charging during the day, to have more power reserves in the evening (or when it‚Äôs raining). Unfortunately, here in Belgium, fixed standard home batteries are still far too expensive due to the excessive installation costs (up to 50% of the total price) which makes a reasonable payback period of <10 years very difficult. Furthermore, in my personal case, it would also mean that I must replace my existing SolarEdge inverter with a hybrid inverter. It‚Äôs just too expensive and it would mean another third-party certification and yet another complex notification to my energy network administrator.

This is where the new generation of Plug&Play batteries like the HomeWizard, Marstek, Anker, Zendrure or this Ecoflow Stream AC Pro perfectly fit in (provided that you can live with a max. of 800w home-grid feed-in). The price for a +-6kWh capacity home Plug&Play battery setup is only **half** compared to a comparable, fixed battery installation in the garage since there is no professional installation required. Unlike what you read on various Internet forums, the perfect size of a (Plug&Play) home battery is primarily determined by the size of your existing solar installation, in my case 4,3kWp. Power consumption patterns are only a secondary criterium.

Buying a (Plug&Play) home battery with a capacity of above 1,5 x Wp, here 6,4kWh, would most likely be a waste of money, as it won‚Äôt get charged up in the winter months (November->February) AND its capacity won‚Äôt be fully used during April->August. Since the Plug&Play batteries from HomeWizard are not on sale here in Belgium due to recent bureaucratic hurdles about the usage of the P1-Meter port, and because the self-consumption of the Marstek Venus 2500w inverter is disproportional, I have decided for this, modular Ecoflow Stream AC Pro battery setup.

An existing 15% coupon, a free Ecoflow Smartmeter and a sleek and compact design made my choice even easier:-). A single AC Pro unit first, as a try-out, to perform extensive testing, a second or third AC (Pro) unit to follow-up if everything runs smoothly as expected.

I have received my first AC Pro end of May 2025 and installed it in our kitchen, where the two Stream AC Pro outlets (1200w) become very handy for several of our kitchen appliances. Toaster, espresso machine, milk foam machine, soup maker, bread machine, yoghurt machine, electric juicer, electric bread slicer, egg-boiler and hot water cattle.

My initial plan was to control the unit manually in order to sell the EF Smartmeter on eBay.:-)

Well, it turned out that the manual controls of the Stream AC Pro are below par.There‚Äôs no way to set a charging schedule or to determine the rate of charge (unlike the Ecoflow powerstations), for example charge the battery at 400w between 11am and 4pm when weather is only cloudy instead of sunny.The Stream AC Pro unit always charges at a fixed charging rate of 1.050w which my solar installation doesn‚Äôt always deliver, e.g. when cloudy. Furthermore, in manual mode, each and every day, you have to increase the Backup reserve in Settings->‚ÄùOperation Mode‚Äù manually, in order to initiate charging in the first place. When charged up, the other way round. Thus twice a day, making my Stream AC Pro more a kind of a ‚ÄúTamagotchi‚Äù than anything else:-(. On the other hand, manual feed-in (100w to 800w) or AC-outlet consumption works well as described. In other words, change of plan, I needed to install the Smartmeter to determine the surplus of our solar installation. A variable charge rate depending on solar surplus is only possible in combination with a compatible Smartmeter. Using Ecoflow Smart-plugs for various power consumers in the house won‚Äôt change that situation either. Easier said than done since installing a Smartmeter is everything BUT Plug&Play, you need a qualified electrician for that. DO NOT DO THIS YOURSELF ! If you try to rely on existing YT-tutorials, in the best case you will damage your Smartmeter, in the worst case, you will get killed:-(! I have contacted 3 electricians, they don‚Äôt even bother to reply as they don‚Äôt want to work on material/installations which they do not supply themselves in the first place. After a 3-week odyssey, I found a 4^(th) electrician who wanted to help me out. Only half an hour of installation work at a very reasonable 45‚Ç¨, and I was finally able to successfully conclude my testing. A co ple of days later, I ordered and received my second Stream AC Pro. And a month later, I ordered and received my third Stream AC (the cheaper model without the two AC outlets at the back), giving me a total capacity of +-5,8kWh. Perfect. To shorten this already very long review, I focus on the main points only:

¬†**Positive:**

\- In combination with a compatible (Ecoflow) Smartmeter, the functionality of this Plug&Play battery performs as advertised, especially the automatic zero-feed-in during night for our two fridges, which have erratic power consumption patterns.

\- Very compact and sleek design which fits into nearly every indoor living area. LFP batteries perform better under normal indoor temperatures anyhow.

\- Half the prize of a comparable (capacity-wise), fixed home battery in the garage where extra AC outlets are of limited benefit.

\- Very silent, thanks to passive cooling, thus no annoying vents.

\- The Ecoflow App for setup and daily use is functional and intuitive.

\- In case of a power outage, I can still run most of my appliances from the AC outlets. If required, the AC Pro units can be moved easily to a place where the power is needed during an outage.

\- The Stream AC Pro, when plugged in, unit has a low standby-consumption of only 6Wh (AC-ports Off).

\- Built-in battery is a robust LFP, not Li-Ion or NCM, and comes with a 10-year warranty (6000 cycles u/70% retention).

**Neutral:**

\- The two AC Outlets are limited to 1.200w only in off-grid mode, no xBoost or short surge, but I knew that in advance. xBoost has a potential to damage electronics anyhow.

\- When powering a coffee machine of 1.450w from the AC outlet in on-grid mode, a single Stream AC Pro can only handle an additional 300w from the grid to compensate (1.200w +300w). However, after setup of the second Stream AC Pro unit in ‚ÄúDistributed Mode‚Äù, this problem is out of the way.

\- Feed-in to my home grid is limited to 800w (legal limitation here in Belgium), but I knew that in advance of course. It‚Äôs good enough for me.

\- Roundtrip efficiency of the Stream AC Pro battery in combination with Smartmeter zero feed-in AND a low nightly base load, in my case +-110w, is below par, only about 63% due to inverter consumption of +-30w. I‚Äôve put this point into the Neutral section as I reckon that competitor‚Äôs Plug&Play batteries don‚Äôt perform much better in this area. On the other hand, in spring and autumn, when I need to switch-on our heating (air-to-air heat pumps), this efficiency percentage will most likely increase significantly.

\- All Ecoflow units are highly cloud dependent. I knew that in advance, so it would be unfair to treat this as a negative point now. However, the cloud outage on 19-06-2025 for 6-8 hours painfully demonstrated the limitations of this business model, especially if Ecoflow fails to transparently communicate in a timely manner.

\- Ecoflow‚Äôs recommendation in the manual to set the discharge- and charge limits between 20-80% doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Maybe it makes sense for Ecoflow, to make you buy a second or third battery quicker. LFP batteries in general are robust enough to handle charge limits between 3-100%. I‚Äôm pretty sure, the built-in gross battery capacity is rated at 2.000wH at least, to avoid deep discharge. Unfortunately, Ecoflow refuses to communicate on net vs. gross capacity.

**Negative:**

\- Without a compatible Smartmeter, the Stream AC (Pro) is nearly unusable due to a lack of manual scheduling & charge rate controls in the App at this stage.

\- Hiding some premium (AI) features behind a monthly subscription paywall, for a product which is already premium-priced, is unacceptable in my humble opinion. Furthermore, it makes the investment payback in <8y quite difficult.

\- The Ecoflow Android App comes with [privacy intrusive](https://g.co/gemini/share/4acd40cb6cf3) Facebook and Jiguang Aurora Trackers. This, I didn‚Äôt know in advance, hence it's included in this section. I know what to do, but I won‚Äôt elaborate on this topic right now.

**Overall: 4/5 stars.**

Considering the quite unique aspects of this Stream AC (Pro) compared to their competitors in combination with a Smartmeter, and the future potential of the Stream ecosystem, I personally valuate the Stream AC (Pro) 4 out of 5 stars with a slight upward tendency if updates keep coming. However, in case you cannot install a compatible Smartmeter for whatever reason, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the Stream AC Pro at all due to a lack of manual scheduling & charging rate controls in the App at this stage and for my personal use case (existing solar panel installation). What most German and French influencers on Youtube, who received a Stream Setup from Ecoflow for testing around April/May 2025 won‚Äôt or cannot tell you, since they have used a Beta-App from Ecoflow with ALL features enabled, is the fact that some AI features (dynamic tariffs in combination with 24h charge/discharge plan and solar predictions) are hidden behind a monthly subscription paywall in the normal user App.

I don‚Äôt recommend buying & using the Stream AC Pro in combination with a dynamic energy contract anyhow (without any solar panel installation), thus for off-peak charging, peak-discharging. First, due to the mediocre battery Rountrip efficiency when feeding-in power loads of below 200w. Secondly, a significant part of the electricity price component consists of (fixed) taxes and other contributions which are very difficult to earn back, at least here in Belgium. This only works when there is a price difference of more than +-20 ‚Ç¨-cents. The amount of days per year in this scenario is simply not sufficient, especially in the long-term future, as price fluctuations which we see on the energy market today, will become less common in the long run due to increasing public & private investments in renewable energy storage capacities.

Anyway, my setup with 3 Stream AC (Pro) with Smartmeter and automatic zero-feed-in, but without dynamic tariff and without fancy, paid AI-mode, works **good enough** **for me**, thus I'm quite pleased with it.

1ms8hp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1ms8hp1/i_feel_like_i_am_a_bad_mom_as_a_working_mom_and/,I feel like I am a bad mom as a ‚Äúworking mom‚Äù and debating quitting and being a SAHM‚Ä¶,"I came to this thread and I don‚Äôt know what I am looking for but I am just MISERABLE. I guess curious if anyone else here WAS a working mom, felt like me, quit to be a SAHM and being a SAHM fixed it?!???

SOO I have 2 kids (ages 4 F and almost 1 M), I work Monday - Thursday in office with a 30 min commute (with occasional Friday remote if things are busy otherwise I‚Äôm off Fridays). Husband works remote, relatively demanding job however can be flexible certain times of the month as in he will get off by 4:30pm and VERY CRAZY some times of the month as in working until 11pm.

I am stressed ALL THE TIME, I am always on edge and I am always grumpy. My mind is constantly running nonstop (pretty confident I have ADHD). I wake up at 5-5:30am everyday to feed the dogs, make coffee, have a little time to myself then I get ready for work. I get the kids up at 6am and ready for the day to leave the house by 6:45am. Drop them at daycare, Work, occasionally workout after work and husband does kids pick up. If I workout, I get home at 6pm and if i don‚Äôt then I can get home by 4:30pm and usually start cleaning the dishes. Coming home is what stresses me out and knowing I don‚Äôt get a break until my head hits the pillow‚Ä¶it feels like the evenings it‚Äôs just a constant ‚Äúwhat task is next‚Äù just with showering, then cooking dinner, cleaning, meal prepping my lunch for work, get clothes ready for the next day, bathing the kids, we always try to do a ‚Äúfamily walk‚Äù around the block at 7:45pm, I do baby bedtime at 8pm, and then I usually get my stuff ready for work, make the baby bottles for next day. Then the toddler and I go to bed at the same time, around 9-9:30pm (yea, sleeps in our bed ü´†). 

I feel like a horrible mom buuut I don‚Äôt want to play with my kids when i get home cause i feel like i don‚Äôt have time because I need to do all the tasks. I feel like i can‚Äôt even enjoy my kids. They get a grumpy version of mom. Then I get so nervous that we will have a bad relationship since I don‚Äôt put in the time to hang with them. My husband is great at tag teaming everything but he doesn‚Äôt understand my stress since he works at home he doesn‚Äôt need to look presentable. He doesn‚Äôt need clean dishes so he doesn‚Äôt focus on cleaning or clean much at all honestly. Sure he will take the kids so I can clean up and shower so he def does more childcare than me but he doesn‚Äôt worry about all the tasks like I do. Then he doesn‚Äôt take the kids in the morning or even wake up (he sleeps in, his choice he rather do kid pickup. It use to be a fight and it was more work for me to force him to wake up but i have accepted it and he doesn evening pickups as the trade off) so he doesn‚Äôt need to make sure baby bottles are done since i take care of it in the morning. He doesn‚Äôt understand the stress of in person work.  He can focus on the kids and be the fun dad that does outside play and bike rides. He does his own laundry but he doesn‚Äôt need to make sure work clothes are done he can wait until the last minute. And don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs great,he let me do dinner with a friend this past week and a workout class another day, lets me preplan me time if i need it but then i almost feel like doing that stuff stresses me more cause the same stuff needs to be done at home just with less time. If im off work Fridays all i do is my doctor appts, vet appts, any household work/try to get all laundry done, grocery shopping so i dont need to spend my weekend getting ready for the next work week. But by Friday night, im literally so exhausted mentally the last thing I want to do is play with my kids when they get home. I want to doom scroll and sit on the couch to rot cause I‚Äôm tired. (Yeah doesn‚Äôt help that i have chronic fatigue lol). Then I‚Äôm back to my happy self on Saturdays, I usually take my daughter to a playdate Saturday AM  while husband watches baby or otherwise we go somewhere like the zoo as a family or out to eat, a farm, to the park, it‚Äôs always something. We try to always do a kid activity at least once during the weekend. Sunday I‚Äôm back to being anxious about the work week. Lol

I just don‚Äôt want to feel this way, I don‚Äôt want one day a week with my kids where I‚Äôm actually pleasant to be around.  I find myself ‚Äúwishing time to pass faster so this little kid stage is over with‚Äù so I can ‚Äúenjoy the next stage‚Äù and then I‚Äôm like BUT WHY! Why do I have to wait until the next stage?! Of course not naive to think SAHM will be easy but also life is too short to wish this part away, right??? 

Well husband told me I can quit!!! To be honest, before kids I never thought SAHM life was for me, i just assumed i made too much it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to quit. And I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm so scared to give up our current lifestyle but honestly the other half of me is like what even is my lifestyle because I‚Äôm miserable right now. I tell myself i don‚Äôt wanna work so I don‚Äôt have a strict schedule, if i wake up and wanna do nothing, I can. If i want to plan play dates and go have fun with other SAHM friends, I can. If I wanna go to the gym and get a break with the gym childcare I can. Then maybe I‚Äôll be this happier person? I can clean and do all the housework, I can have time to declutter the house. I guess I‚Äôm just scared to give up my career and be wrong? That it won‚Äôt actually make me happier. Idk. 

There‚Äôs definitely people in my life that make me feel bad about doing it OR friends who will be like oh do it, but i could never so it makes me second guess it OR My career-driven bestie that‚Äôs childless was going on and on about not to do it because I‚Äôll go crazy since my only form of communication is with irrational children (can you tell she‚Äôs childless? üßê) and then my mom is negative about it (why give up my job/career?) and i don‚Äôt understand why everyone in my life is so against me doing it cause it‚Äôs the only thing I can think about right now and I kinda wanna say screw everyone and just do it üòÖü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (in December tho, husband needs me to wait until December)

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if any of you were working moms, felt this way and then quit, did it fix it?! And then, how do you structure your day to not go crazy and how do you not get overstimulated? ‚ò∫Ô∏è

1ms8guj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cirrhosis/comments/1ms8guj/coffee_grounds_pt2/,Coffee Grounds pt.2,"Some of y'all know I do enjoy journaling as a way of dealing with my PTSD, and I love getting feedback good or bad, I'm a big boy, I've literally had worse lol but I know some of you don't like following links on reddit so I'll paste the article & leave a link to medium on the bottom as it looks better on medium, which actually helps to cover my writing deficiencies:  


# Coffee Grounds pt 2.

# How I went from lurker to transplant survivor cracking jokes in the darkest corners of Reddit.

The first time I broke silence was with two words:¬†*coffee grounds.*

If you don‚Äôt know what that means, good. Stay innocent. If you do, then you know it‚Äôs not about Starbucks. It‚Äôs about waking up in ICU after a quick scope for varices and realizing your body just filed for bankruptcy.

That was the story I swore I‚Äôd never tell. The one I‚Äôd take to the grave. But I posted it. And nothing exploded. No one laughed me off the site. Instead: replies. People who didn‚Äôt flinch. People who said ‚Äúme too.‚Äù People who said ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù

And that was it. That cracked the glass.

# From Ghost to Guy Who Replies

Once you break silence, you can‚Äôt go back. Every 3 a.m. thread with some poor bastard spiraling over symptoms looked like me. And I decided:¬†*no one leaves unseen.*

Sometimes that meant being useful. Sometimes it meant gallows humor; because if you can‚Äôt laugh at your failing organs, what‚Äôs the point?

Not every joke landed. Some were ‚Äúhaha thanks,‚Äù others were ‚Äúis he okay?‚Äù (Answer: no, but that‚Äôs kind of the joke). Still, I kept showing up. Again and again. Until showing up was just‚Ä¶ who I was.

# The Badge

Then Reddit gave me a shiny green badge:¬†**Top 1% Commenter.**

Which is hilarious, because:

* I‚Äôm on more steroids than peak Arnie, which means sleep simply doesn‚Äôt exist.
* My daily nutrients are protein, 23 medications taken three times a day (not a typo), and whatever snacks could sustain a full-stack dev team through a hackathon.
* My drive back from bloods is a nerve wrecking experience hoping i dont get the phone call telling me to skip home and head straight to jail, sorry the hospital to fight another rejection attack

But sure. Badge me up.

# After the Transplant

Life post-transplant is strange. On paper, I‚Äôm fixed. New liver, new labs, new chance. But the truth is you never forget how close you came. You don‚Äôt forget ICU. You don‚Äôt forget ‚Äúcoffee grounds.‚Äù

And living on borrowed parts changes how you move through the world. Some people talk about ‚Äúcarpe diem.‚Äù For me, it‚Äôs more like: take your meds, dodge infection, eat your snacks, crack a joke, repeat. Survival, just in a different rhythm.

I joke about being 100% aftermarket now. New liver, new plumbing, same questionable sense of humor. But every time I log in here, I remember there are people still sitting where I was: Scared, bleeding, and convinced silence is safer.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt go quiet.

# No Empty Threads

Because here‚Äôs the thing: silence kills.

If someone is desperate enough to post here, at 2 a.m., hands shaking, asking if what they‚Äôre going through is normal, the¬†*worst*¬†thing we can do is leave them hanging. Empty threads are worse than bad labs. At least labs tell you something. Silence just confirms the fear that nobody cares.

And especially for those of us who‚Äôve been blessed with a transplant, who‚Äôve been handed more time: we owe it. We owe replies. We owe presence. We owe making sure nobody feels like they‚Äôre shouting into a void while their body betrays them.

That‚Äôs the real badge. Not the shiny Reddit one. The obligation to show up.

# Why I Keep Talking

I didn‚Äôt get that badge by karma-chasing. I got it by doing what I needed the night I typed ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù: not being left alone in silence.

Humor, for me, isn‚Äôt survival. It‚Äôs dosage. My meds keep me alive. My jokes keep me human. And somewhere between the two, I realized sometimes the dumbest line at the darkest moment is the one thing that keeps somebody scrolling instead of spiraling.

So yeah. I‚Äôll keep talking. I‚Äôll keep cracking jokes that land between¬†*late-night open mic*¬†and¬†*emotional defibrillator.*¬†I‚Äôll keep making sure nobody leaves unseen.

Because once you‚Äôve hit ‚Äúpost‚Äù on¬†*coffee grounds*, you don‚Äôt go back to lurking. You don‚Äôt get silence anymore.

1ms8c9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ms8c9y/what_is_next/,What is next?,"Hi Reddit community,

I‚Äôm writing here for the first time to ask for advice, to vent, for a kind word, or to get an opinion on this breakup and ‚Äúno contact‚Äù situation. Please be kind, it‚Äôs okay to be direct, but no cruelty, because it still hurts a lot, and there‚Äôs already enough gratuitous cruelty in the world.

Around July 2024, my ex met a girl at work. They started talking, sharing memes, and keeping things light, until she confessed that she knew he had a girlfriend but really enjoyed spending time with him, which had happened with very few people before. He came to tell me that they had a great connection, understood each other, could talk easily, but he didn‚Äôt want to give up something that made him feel good, us, for something uncertain. Our relationship had lasted 5 years, and at that time, it was a bit shaky.

Some background, we met at university in 2019 during an exam and immediately hit it off, within a few months, we were together, and he was over the moon. Things were generally good, with the usual ups and downs of couples. I work as a teacher, but every September I had to find a new contract, which was extremely stressful. He, on the other hand, was still struggling with depression and anxiety and hadn‚Äôt graduated. In those last months, I had pushed him a bit to seek therapy, to unblock himself with university, or maybe close that chapter and find a job, so we could make life plans together, house, family, He would always answer with ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see,‚Äù I never blamed him, but towards the end, I realized I was unintentionally putting pressure on him, slightly increasing his anxiety. He avoided my family to not have to talk about it, university became taboo, and we almost stopped talking entirely.

On my side, I had started hormonal treatment for health issues, which was making me depressed and nearly emotionally dependent, the doctor stopped it shortly after the breakup. I‚Äôve never had good self-esteem, always afraid to speak up to not be disliked, always terrified someone ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù would come along. I was never toxic or jealous, but towards the end, I had become his puppet, and he somewhat took advantage of it. When we broke up, he even said he could sleep with another woman and I would be fine, and maybe he was right.

In early October, a few days after our first big argument where he shouted terrible things at me, we broke up, lying on the couch together, saying we needed time alone to sort out our problems because together we were only hurting each other. I was hoping he would graduate so we could move out together, and he wanted me to continue studying with him, almost doing exams for him. A few days later, he wrote, ‚ÄúI swear we‚Äôll get back together, you‚Äôre my best friend and confidant, I love you so much, I‚Äôm fighting to get back on track and come back, I‚Äôm fighting so this happens.‚Äù

From that October day, the nightmare began. Initially, for about a month, ‚Äúno contact‚Äù worked, until I got a call from his mother. She often called to ask how he was doing, even though she lived with him. She said she missed me and liked me a lot. Usually, she called when he was really struggling and didn‚Äôt know how to cope, as he‚Äôs very introverted. I panicked and broke the ‚Äúno contact.‚Äù

We talked on the phone, sharing about the month apart, and ended up doing this every two weeks until December. He repeatedly told me he needed some time, and then we‚Äôd try again and it would be something new. I almost took it as a mission, fix my life so that when he came back, I would be ready.

I was incredibly determined, I went to therapy weekly, exercised, found a new job, started going out with friends again, and slowly rediscovered a version of myself that maybe had never existed, but that I liked.

In December, I had coffee with one of his friends, who warned me that my ex wasn‚Äôt being honest with me. I called him and, after practically forcing it out, I found out he had started seeing the girl from July, actually, he had already started in October.

I told him not to contact me anymore because it was a cruel game. At Christmas, he sent me a message saying ‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù I replied curtly, ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

In mid-January, I impulsively wrote to him, not to get back together immediately, but to reconnect a bit, since months had passed and I had already started changing. I wanted, for once, to insist and fight for this. He replied after a few days, asking to meet. We met in a freezing park. He told me how bad he had felt these months, broke down crying because he couldn‚Äôt study, and said he was seeing the girl but didn‚Äôt like her and never wanted to be with her. He said, for the umpteenth time, ‚ÄúI see you by my side in my future, I just can‚Äôt do it now.‚Äù Exactly what my lovesick brain wanted to hear.

Meanwhile, my life continued. I kept improving, went back to my hometown after 20 years to reconnect with my family and distance myself from the situation, planning to return in March when I‚Äôd start my new job.

After January, we occasionally contacted each other, but he often took 8‚Äì10 hours to respond and acted like it was a burden, although sometimes he asked questions. In early March, he wrote again. I asked why he was still acting this way, since we were only hurting each other, I had become underweight because of everything. He said we should ‚Äúforget each other‚Äù for now and try again in the future, but not knowing how I was or what I was discovering in my new life drove him crazy. I agreed to give space. He concluded with, ‚ÄúHave fun, I care about you a lot, I love you.‚Äù

I returned to my hometown, went out with friends, and found out that despite everything he had said, he was still seeing that girl. I wanted to hear it directly from him, so I called one evening. He didn‚Äôt answer. I was so angry I almost had a car accident. Three days later, he wrote asking if I needed anything.

I told him I wanted to see him, even for ten minutes. At first, he refused, but finally agreed. During those 10 minutes, he said three things, in order, ‚ÄúThe things I tell you are true, I believe them, but as we‚Äôve said for 4‚Äì5 months, this is heavy and it takes time to forget,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still seeing the other girl, not just to have a beer, but I want to be alone,‚Äù I asked if she knew he had written certain things to me and that we met, he said yes, she was angry but smart enough to understand the situation, and it helped him.

Trembling, I left without saying anything, almost disgusted by the person he had become. Since then, I haven‚Äôt heard from him until July.

Meanwhile, some curious things happened, weeks after that meeting, he made his relationship with her public. Someone sent me a playlist full of depressing songs dedicated to me, which was clear from the lyrics and from songs he had once said reminded him of me. Every time we had a negative interaction or met, he added sad songs, from October until mid-April.

We teach the same little girl, but she didn‚Äôt know about our past relationship until early June, when he confided in his mother, telling her we had been a couple and revealing his problems. This woman called me immediately, I feared she‚Äôd fire me, but instead told me what he said. I was worried, first because he‚Äôs someone I care about and hearing he‚Äôs so low hurts me, second because after months with his new partner, he confided in someone else about feeling like crap because he couldn‚Äôt study and how life was going.

In July, he told me he was in a relationship, for some time, but hadn‚Äôt told me, trying without knowing how it would go, but still hoped to talk to me because he enjoyed talking with me, and regretted not being part of my life during my new experiences. I told him these months were extremely hard, and that he was the only one with her number, so if he needed to contact me, he should do so carefully. He replied, ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll talk when you‚Äôve recovered.‚Äù That day, he unfollowed me on Instagram, which he had never done before, seemingly because he couldn‚Äôt handle seeing my posts.

My friends think that, since I pushed him to improve, I was like a mirror for him, and the ‚Äúeasiest problem to remove,‚Äù so he left me and immediately went with someone more carefree, who doesn‚Äôt make him think about his problems or suffer from love, not because he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me, but because facing those problems was too hard. He admitted to others that he hasn‚Äôt solved his other issues, which feel like an ocean he‚Äôs drowning in, but he feels comfortable in his pain. He also started therapy, but only once a month, because he quit his job, which he had hoped would help him organize his studies, and now earns only from tutoring I had found for him after we broke up.

So, these 10 months can be summarized like this, I‚Äôve grown a lot, had many experiences alone to improve my self-esteem and confidence, traveled, exercised, reconnected with friends, worked with my therapist, found a new job, and made new plans for a house and another degree. All the weight I lost was all the love I had for him, which was slowly draining me.

But he still seems stuck, and I‚Äôve spent months almost waiting for him to come back after I ‚Äúdid my homework.‚Äù I analyzed everything he said to piece together why he was doing all this, but I‚Äôm still torn between two thoughts, ‚ÄúGod, this person hurt me so much, and I was stupid to be so under his spell, I hope he never contacts me again,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOkay, he seems to have feelings for me, so if he changes, we could try again, because he was a good person, and I‚Äôm curious to see the new version of him.‚Äù

Today, every time I hear news about him or her, I feel physically sick. Rationally, I know the world is full of people better than him, and better than me, but even meeting others, they all feel so different, and no one gives me that sense of ‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs worth investing in for the future,‚Äù I would like him to meet this new version of me, confident, grown, and adult, to start something new, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed much, just anesthetized the problem.

## Key Features Analysis

A complete body scrub and massage experience involves several key features that contribute to its effectiveness and appeal.

**Ingredient Quality and Sourcing**

The quality of ingredients directly impacts the benefits and potential side effects of a body scrub. Look for products that utilize natural and organic ingredients, avoiding harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and parabens. A reputable brand will transparently disclose the source of their ingredients, ensuring sustainability and ethical practices.

Plant-based oils such as coconut, jojoba, and almond oil are commonly used for their moisturizing properties, while exfoliants like sea salt, sugar, and coffee grounds offer varying degrees of abrasiveness. the selection of ingredients tailored to specific skin types is vital for a personalized and effective treatment.

**Exfoliation Level and texture**

The ideal exfoliation level depends on individual preferences and skin sensitivity. A fine-grain scrub is suitable for delicate skin, while a coarser scrub provides more intensive exfoliation for thicker, less sensitive skin. The texture of the scrub also plays a crucial role in the overall experience.

A well-formulated scrub will have a consistent texture, ensuring even exfoliation without causing irritation. The particle size and shape shoudl be carefully considered to avoid micro-tears or damage to the skin. Some scrubs incorporate moisturizing agents to counteract the drying effects of exfoliation, leaving the skin feeling soft and supple.

**Massage Techniques and Duration**

The effectiveness of a body scrub and massage is significantly influenced by the massage techniques employed.Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, and lymphatic drainage are commonly incorporated to promote relaxation, improve circulation, and reduce muscle tension. The skills of the massage therapist are paramount for a customized and therapeutic experience.

The duration of the massage should be adequate to allow for thorough exfoliation, muscle relaxation, and lymphatic stimulation.A typical body scrub and massage session lasts between 60 and 90 minutes, depending on the specific needs and preferences of the client.

**Aromatic Properties and Essential Oils**

The use of essential oils in body scrubs and massage oils enhances the sensory experience and provides additional therapeutic benefits. Lavender, chamomile, and eucalyptus are popular choices for their relaxing and invigorating properties, respectively. The aroma can significantly effect mood and promote emotional well-being during the treatment.

Ensure that essential oils are properly diluted to avoid skin irritation.A well-balanced blend of essential oils can create a harmonious and immersive experience, elevating the overall benefits of the body scrub and massage.

## Core Benefits

A well-executed body scrub and massage offers a range of benefits that extend beyond simple relaxation.

**Improved Skin Texture and Tone**

The exfoliation process removes dead skin cells, revealing smoother and more radiant skin. Regular body scrubs can definitely help to improve skin texture, even out skin tone, and reduce the appearance of blemishes. The massage component stimulates circulation, promoting cell turnover and collagen production.

This combination results in healthier, more youthful-looking skin with enhanced elasticity and luminosity. The removal of dead skin cells also allows for better absorption of moisturizing products, maximizing their hydrating effects.

**Enhanced Relaxation and Stress Reduction**

The massage component of the treatment provides deep relaxation by easing muscle tension and promoting the release of endorphins. The gentle pressure and rhythmic movements help to calm the nervous system, reducing stress and anxiety.

The aromatic properties of essential oils further enhance the relaxation experience, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. Clients often report feeling refreshed,rejuvenated,and mentally clear after a body scrub and massage session.

**Detoxification and Lymphatic Drainage**

The combination of exfoliation and massage stimulates lymphatic drainage, helping to remove toxins and waste products from the body. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in immune function, and its proper functioning is essential for overall health.

The massage techniques used in a body scrub and massage can improve lymphatic circulation, reducing fluid retention and promoting detoxification. This can lead to improved energy levels, reduced inflammation, and enhanced immune function.

**Increased Circulation and Pain Relief**

Massage helps to improve blood circulation by dilating blood vessels and increasing blood flow to the tissues. Improved circulation can alleviate muscle pain, reduce inflammation, and promote healing.

The application of pressure during massage can also release muscle knots and tension,providing relief from chronic pain conditions such as back pain and fibromyalgia. The combination of exfoliation and massage can leave clients feeling physically and mentally revitalized.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough should I get a body scrub and massage?**

The frequency depends on individual needs and skin type. Generally, a body scrub and massage every 2-4 weeks is recommended for maintaining healthy and radiant skin. Individuals with dry or sensitive skin may benefit from less frequent treatments, while those with oily or acne-prone skin may require more frequent sessions.

**Can body scrubs and massages help with cellulite?**

While body scrubs and massages cannot eliminate cellulite entirely, they can help to reduce its appearance. The exfoliation and massage components stimulate circulation and lymphatic drainage, which can improve skin tone and reduce fluid retention in the affected areas. Regular treatments, combined with a healthy diet and exercise, can contribute to a smoother and more toned appearance.

**Are there any contraindications for body scrubs and massages?**

Certain medical conditions may contraindicate body scrubs and massages. Individuals with skin infections, open wounds, sunburn, or recent surgery should avoid these treatments.Pregnant women should consult with their healthcare provider before undergoing a body scrub and massage. It is always best to disclose any medical conditions or concerns to your massage therapist prior to the session.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1ms82sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/skilledtrades/comments/1ms82sb/no_hvac_experience_to_8k_a_month_in_25_months/,No HVAC experience to $8k a month in 2.5 months,"Just wanted to make a post to tell my story of what's possible for anyone considering HVAC. I had 5 years of military experience (on paper, I have ""electro-mechanical"" experience, but reality is I only did small arms and security). I did a bunch of other jobs outside of the military too, but my only true blue collar expierence was a couple of months I spent as a roofing helper when I was in high school. So I didn't really have any mechanical or electrical troubleshooting experience. 

Was feeling pretty lost when my buddy reached out and said he could get me a job doing residential HVAC. He showed me the skillcat app which I used to get my EPA Universal license for like $10. I was unemployed so I spent around 8 hours a day for 30 days getting the license, learning about the refrigeration cycle, learning the names of all the components of a HVAC system (compressor, evaporator, condenser, metering devices, etc). I just taught myself as much as I could until I got to the point where I knew I couldn't learn anymore without actually getting my hands on the equipment. So that's one month of self-education. 

I then spent 1.5 months doing ride-alongs at the company. They pay you $150 a day to ride along for 8 hrs. I didn't do that, I stayed as long as the tech was still working. So if he was doing an ""on-call"" shift, which is 8am to midnight, I stayed, despite not getting paid more. If he worked the weekend, I went. I asked questions all day. I spent the weekends researching the things I didn't really understand, then came back the next week with questions. I made a list on my phone of all the tools I need and what parts I need to keep in stock on my truck. After 1.5 months, they gave me my own truck. 

Now, I don't really know any HVAC techs outside of my company, but I think I'm what most HVAC techs would consider a ""sales tech"". Meaning, MOST of my income comes from me selling HVAC accessories and services (UV lights, chemical cleanings, homecare membership programs, surge protection, etc). There's a negative stigma about sales techs because a lot of them, including myself, don't know much about diagnostics and repairs. My opinion on that is: of course I don't know much, but it's not because I'm a sales tech, it's because I'm new to HVAC, and if I'm new to HVAC, why not sell things to make a decent income while I'm learning? idk, just wanted to include that in here to be transparent. To do what I did, you gotta be able to sell, which a lot of people look down upon for some reason. But to me, it seems pretty easy. I make a lot of money selling UV lights when I see someone's unit covered in mold. I just show them the mold and then be quiet until they ask me how to address it, then I offer it to them... 

So yeah, if you're looking for a proof story. With 2.5 months of self-ducation and training (only one of those months was completely on my own with no pay), I made 8.5k my first 30 days in my own truck, and 8k in my second 30 days.  It's possible. It's hard, but it's possible. 

Cons: attics are hot as fuck. You breath in a whole lot of nasty shit. Hours are brutal. Schedule and pay are inconsistent. Pay is by the job, not by the hour, I do a lot of shit I don't get paid for. It's inevitable, you will end up breaking something and have to face the customer. Luckily for me, the most I've done so far is blow some fuses and trip some breakers, but I've heard of some guys putting a screw through a coil. I've also been on a ride-along where I swear all we did was replace a capacitor (unit was already having problems) and it went from kind of not working to not working at all, and in the customer's eyes, we just broke their unit. I've had customers mad at me because the unit they just paid $15k for isn't working, and it's not my fault, but I'm the guy that's there representing the company, so I'm the only one they can be mad at. 

Pros: $8k a month. I drive the company truck all week so I've filled my personal cars gas tank literally once in the last month. I meet a ton of cool people (I love asking people with nice homes what they do for a living). I've made at least $200 or so in cash tips. I've also been given gifts, had breakfast and coffee made for me, one customer offered to bring me flying. Very engaging and rewarding work. The day really does fly by.  I've been able to help people going through chemo and a lot of other major medical problems get their AC back running. My company is very supportive. Whenever I'm stuck on a diag, I can always get ahold of somone on the phone to walk me through trouble shooting. 

This definetly isn't something I want to make a career out of, but it's been an adventure and I hope this post gives someone the motivation to lock in and get after it. ",8,1755379106.0,skilledtrades,5,0.72,False

I have come to realise over my recent birthday that she knows absolutely nothing about me or any of my other siblings, but rather just buys what she likes. Throughout my life I have always struggled with contamination OCD and will wash my hands a lot. This leads to me not ever wearing jewellery because it would just be too dirty to wear in my mind. Well, here she is, buying me a bracelet, and when I don‚Äôt wear it she gets angry. I used to think I hated events but it is really just because I despise being around her. She knows absolutely nothing about her children and being in her presence makes me feel so utterly embarrassed.

I remember unwillingly meeting up for a coffee with her and we were sat next to a black family who were just innocently enjoying their day out. She then spouts some racist language I will never repeat about her friend‚Äôs newborn, comparing him to an ape. I have never been so mortified in my entire life and I hope to God the poor family next to us didn‚Äôt hear it. And even despite all of that I cannot drag myself away and disassociate with her because the entire family will hit the roof about how horrible I am! The political views she has are astounding considering my grandma is a very accepting woman and I have no idea where she got it from. My sibling even admitted that she calls me and my partner homophobic slurs because she‚Äôs ‚Äôallowed to‚Äô now. Apparently her co-worker disagreed with my existence and she said that ‚Äòeveryone is entitled to their opinion!‚Äô Jesus Christ. 

Growing up, it was even worse. Luckily nowadays I can make excuses not to see her, but being trapped in a house with her is worse than being in prison. I used to struggle with panic attacks a lot growing up and still do nowadays, and she used to scream at me to shut up. She never believed that my periods were killing me either. I struggled with heavy periods to the point where I got severely iron deficient, and it wasn‚Äôt until my grandma drove me to the hospital and I was wheeled in that anything was done. I was literally dying and rushed to A&E and all she could say was that I was being overdramatic. She would threaten to hit me if I kept having panic attacks, call me names, laugh at me, all whilst I was crying and screaming at her to stop. Then the blame was put on me for being ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô. My whole family to this day is apparently scared of me because I defended myself verbally against her onslaught. Pathetic, really. 

School was my only escape. I used to enjoy studying and being with friends, being anywhere else than at home. I would purposely walk home slowly and take after school clubs just so I didn‚Äôt have to be at home. At weekends I‚Äôd lock myself in my room or be outside sat at the park. I remember one day I began self harming to cope, and instead of comfort after she found out, she grabbed my arm and threatened to squeeze the wounds if I kept doing it. When I did end up going to a mental health ward later in life, I spent as much as I could of it without my family knowing because it was easier to deal with my pain if they weren‚Äôt there. Eventually, they found out and I remember sobbing on the floor, begging the nurses to tell me why they informed them. I was over 18 so legally they didn‚Äôt have to, but they said it would be ‚Äòbest‚Äô. Instead, she visited once and said that my arms were ruined now and looked ugly. No comfort, just annoyance at an inconvenience whilst pretending to everyone else she was devastated. 

I hate that the most. Pretending that she‚Äôs a good mum. Only my partner knows and can see through her lies and fakeness, no one else seems to be able to. I have managed to keep her at bay from mine and my partner‚Äôs new house as I dread her coming over. It‚Äôll just be a judgement party. Saying about how she doesn‚Äôt like what we‚Äôve done with it, or that it‚Äôs too small, ugly, etc. I dread the day we get married not because of the wedding but just because I will be obligated to invite her. She wore white to my sibling‚Äôs wedding so what‚Äôs to say she wouldn‚Äôt try to ruin mine. 

I hate her so much and I cannot believe I am her daughter. I‚Äôm ashamed of it.

1ms7saw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lafayette/comments/1ms7saw/kossuth_street_baptist_church_review/,Kossuth Street Baptist Church: Review,"This is a review for a local church I spent some time visiting. I wanted to provide information for those looking for a church so they can have an honest take on someone's experience there (apparently, a lot of negative google reviews for the church get removed for this church, Kossuth Street Baptist Church).

Before I dive into the review, please understand, I have been a Christian/attending-church for more than a decade. I do not hold any ill will toward the Church. And my selection criteria for a church is based on theology/doctrine, not things like the welcome desk, free coffee, or music performance. After several months of reflection, I have made the decision to leave a review of this church so that others who might be in similar situations as I can know more about it before going through what I did.

I spent nearly a year attending this mid-sized congregation in Lafayette. I hoped to experience Christian community in its fullness, based on the statement of faith on the church website. My experience felt like the opposite of hospitality. Over eleven months of consistent participation, I found myself navigating repeated experiences of invisibility, territorialism, pastoral detachment, and just plain apathy. This is not me binge-complaining in a review, I want to make that clear. I want to share what I observed, how I felt about it, and why this church was not a church home for me. The church itself is solid in theology (roughly Southern Baptist) and does not put on a three-ring circus performance like so many other churches do in the area to bring in crowds.

I know not everyone gets attention in church all the time. But there, I felt I could have doubled as the Invisible Man. For my first eight straight Sundays, I sat in the pews without a single unprompted greeting. There was not a handshake, and not even a nod to recognize I was a living being coming into their sanctuary. I wasn't expecting a red carpet, just basic acknowledgment - a smile, a ""good morning,"" or even eye contact would have made a difference. I felt like I simply blended into the walls. The tipping point for this came when someone leaned over and asked if this was my first Sunday. That question, after nearly a year of attendance and passing by this person several times before, really hit it home that I was not seen as a person there and would definitely not ever really be welcomed as a congregant if I became a member. I wasn't noticed. Some may find this surprising. Research on church hospitality confirms that these initial points of contact matter deeply, but this congregation appears to have missed that report since after nine months, I was still coming and going through the doors like the wind.

There were two particular incidents where after I had settled into a seat, someone would come up to me and ask me to move because I was in ""their spot."" The first happened after five months of regular attendance, the second at around month seven. Each time, I got up and apologized since I ""didn't know."" I would shuffle to a different spot on the pew or scuttle to another one feeling very awkward and unsettled. After these incidents, the sanctuary (supposedly a space of shared worship and welcome) felt more like a territory staked out by the resident cliques. This was disheartening since they said I was in their spot. They could have asked me to slide down or if they could sit there as well, but they did not. Here, when the Church should give the feeling of being folded into the congregation and local fellowship, I just felt pushed out to the margins, like a second-class citizen being seated by the kitchen door.

What surprised me most, perhaps, was the silence/disinterest from the pastors (they had multiple pastors on staff during my time visiting there). This was not a large congregation, roughly I would estimate about 250 people (hard to pin it down since they have a transient portion of the body being college students).

During the time I spent visiting there trying to get integrated, none of the pastors ever really even tried to speak with me or inquire about what I was looking for in the congregation (or why I was not signing up for their membership class). It gave me the impression that shepherding, at least in this place, was assumed to happen by the small groups without any pastoral involvement. I know the church has elders and deacons to help the pastor, but these pastors just seemed disconnected from the majority of the congregation and gave special attention to those who were in their immediate ""cliques."" Not to mention, the deacons/elders, never really started conversations either. During one of the rare conversations I had with an older man in the church, he said I should ask one of the pastors for help. I mentioned I was looking for a new apartment and the man said I should ask one of them about a possible one. I politely remarked I did not feel comfortable with that since I had never spoken with him and could never really enter conversations with him since he usually had others he talked to on Sundays. The man commented that he \[the pastor in question\] did ""have his favorites"" but then the man realized what came out of his mouth and made some thought-terminating comment about the housing market in the greater Lafayette area. From my observations, yes, the pastors there do have favorites.

When I tried to engage more deeply through a small group, the experience had less than ideal results. I was placed in one group (which really was a collection of the guys who did not fall into the main demographics for the church plus a few guys who went to the church during their undergrad time but did not leave town after graduation and failed to get married/find a girlfriend upon graduation). Social outings (anything outside the once-a-week small group meeting during the ‚Äúregular semester‚Äù) were often arranged privately among the group members (yeah, I never actually did anything with the guys outside of group meeting, but it was apparent they were doing things). I realized close to the time when I decided to visit a different church, that I had only actively exchanged contact information with two people in the group. One was an older man in the church who I guess supervised the group, and the other was a grad student who only needed my information since he wanted to text me to help give people rides to church a couple times (never contacted by him for anything else).

Every Sunday, leaders/pastors serving during the sermon and liturgy would talk/pander about how friendly and welcoming everyone at the church was. But those words never matched what I experienced. The friendliness existed more as an announcement than an action. Each week, the same cliques would talk and welcome each other and be so happy to be there on another Sunday. I would go in, usually pass by the greeters who would just talk among themselves. Hospitality there is more of a slogan than an actual practice.

Because this congregation draws heavily from Purdue University, the church calendar follows the academic calendar. This creates a significant problem for community building. At Christmas and Thanksgiving (and other holidays in general), programming all but stopped once students left town. As someone without close family, those were the times I most needed community. Instead, I found the church most empty and those still around were just concentrated on their own life/activities. The message became clear: if you don't already have family, don't come looking for a church family here. This seasonal abandonment of community felt particularly painful during what should be the most welcoming times of the Christian calendar. During my time visiting, I think they only had one fellowship meal (which they had catered in because everyone is too busy to do potluck).

Over time (leading up to the point when I stopped visiting there and in the time since then), I discovered this was not just my own experience. Through casual conversations on campus and in different activities related to church groups (I did not stop going to Church, I just stopped visiting at this church) I heard similar stories from quite a few other people (I think it is about 14 people if I counted them up correctly). Many of them had also left discouraged and feeling altogether unwelcomed. I ran into one person who had given up on going to church entirely because of his experience there. The rest of the experiences mirrored mine almost to a ""T"": invisibility, exclusion, pastoral silence/nepotism, and a sense that demographic categories mattered more than people growing in the faith. Hearing their stories confirmed that what I went through was not just personal misfortune that was isolated to myself, but part of a larger pattern that this church seems to not be aware of. Some of the comments some of these people made really made me think. One guy said he refers to it as the ""Kossuth Street Baptist Social Club."" Another person mentioned feeling that if you didn't meet certain background requirements, you would never be actively engaged there as a college student or be part of what she called ‚ÄúChad‚Äôs Chosen.‚Äù

What I experienced felt like a kind of selective hospitality. Those who seemed to bring value to the church, like families, working professionals, students, and anyone with good connections to the university, were quickly welcomed, integrated, and treated like family. Those who didn't fit those categories were left to linger; you are let in the door but never welcomed to the proverbial table. I believe this kind of runs counter to what Christian hospitality should be.

I wanted to share these reflections not to insult this particular congregation but let those who are looking for a church home to be wary. You might be welcomed and have a great experience. But, like I said, if you do not offer them anything or fall into a demographic that is actively welcomed, you might go on never growing in faith and just going through the motions every Sunday. You might be like me and spend nearly a year trying to make things work, freaking out that there is something wrong with you since things are not working out, etc., etc. Whoever you are, please do not let it push you like the one guy who has stopped attending church indefinitely. Here, I think they \[the congregation\] could improve in the following ways:

1. Make hospitality intentionally structural, not optional.

2. Hold pastors accountable for personal engagement.

3. Break down demographic barriers in programming and group studies

4. Ensure community is consistent throughout the year, not just during the regular semester.

5. Extend welcome equally, without regard for status or church-utility of those walking in.

The months I visited there were tiresome. It is not enough to proclaim welcome; you have to intentionally practice it. I believe this church and others like it must recognize that hospitality is not a peripheral courtesy but central to their mission. For those looking for a church home, I encourage you to keep looking until you find a place that practices genuine welcome, not just preaches it, and find a theologically solid church home where you can grow and serve. I have been slowly settling into a church elsewhere. There are good, true, welcoming churches out there, you just have to find them. For those who read this , I hope this helps.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a nut milk bag hinges on several critical features that contribute to its performance, durability, and ease of use.

**Material:** Nut milk bags are primarily constructed from nylon,organic cotton,hemp,or a combination of these materials.

The ideal material is food-grade, durable, and easy to clean. Nylon bags are known for their strength and resistance to tearing, while organic cotton and hemp offer a more natural and sustainable option. Though, natural fibers may require more diligent cleaning to prevent bacterial growth. Look for BPA-free and FDA-approved materials to ensure safety and quality.

**Mesh Density:** The fineness of the mesh directly affects the smoothness of the final product.

A finer mesh results in a smoother, creamier nut milk with fewer particles, while a coarser mesh may allow some sediment to pass through. Consider the types of liquids you plan to strain. For nut milks, a very fine mesh is generally preferred. For straining broths or teas, a slightly coarser mesh might potentially be sufficient.

A larger bag can accommodate larger batches, but it may also be more cumbersome to handle.The shape can also influence ease of use. Conical bags are frequently enough preferred for their easy pouring and squeezing, while square bags can offer greater stability.

**Durability & Stitching:** The bag's overall construction and stitching quality determine its longevity.

Reinforced seams and double stitching are indicators of a well-made, durable bag that can withstand repeated use and washing. Examine the stitching closely to ensure it is tight and secure, preventing fraying or tearing.**Ease of Cleaning:** A nut milk bag that is easy to clean is essential for hygiene and convenience.

Look for bags that are dishwasher-safe or easily rinsed by hand. Avoid bags with complicated seams or crevices where food particles can become trapped. Proper cleaning is crucial to prevent bacterial growth and ensure the bag remains sanitary for future use.

1ms7lxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ms7lxa/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I think Alex has been cheating on me

One day ages ago he was talking to his friend a woman in Israel and I walk in and he hung up
He brushed me off when I said why did you hang up he said he just didn‚Äôt want to be on the phone and he‚Äôll call her back later that our time together is more important Then tonight he went into bathroom I was dying to use toilet so I walked in and he snapped phone shut. He was talking to this woman again. Her name is Irina, she lives in Israel 

I called him up on it. I said you are acting suspicious. He said it‚Äôs all in my head that I‚Äôm insecure And jealous.

I said to him show me your phone, He said later.

He did give me his phone later that evening (obviously enough time to delete stuff) I found a message and I managed to take a screenshot with my phone 

Put it into google translate

He doesn‚Äôt know I know

I knew he was meeting with Irina but he told me they were friends he bought her flowers and a coffee machine last time he went to visit her.  I ask him why but he said in his culture that was normal

I‚Äôm such an eejit.  I‚Äôm so stupid I believed him

We have been married almost 5 years and he has visited Israel every year twice a year and always went to visit her. I told him men and women shouldn‚Äôt be meeting up like that but again he made me feel like I was crazy. He told me constantly they were just friends and it was normal in his culture



She writes to him 

‚ÄúAnd I got used to your calls, and I will miss them‚Ä¶ I thought you were interested in how I was living. It turns out that each of us saw this meeting differently‚Ä¶ you craved sex, I wanted genuine communication! I was truly happy to see you and help you ‚Äî not because of fixing that stupid tap, but just because‚Ä¶ I was used to seeing Sasha with flowers, interested in my problems, not with a toolbox in exchange for sexual favors‚Ä¶ I dreamed of going to a seafood restaurant with you, not to bed, although it all could have been different if you hadn‚Äôt set conditions for me! In the nine years we‚Äôve known each other, this was the first time you were rude to me‚Ä¶ and I was waiting for you to understand and come back without conditions on the 31st, but alas!

I truly regret that it all turned out this way. I hope the journey back was easy. I sincerely wish you good luck‚Ä¶‚Äù


He writes back ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, I was wrong and I went too far‚Äù

According to legends, a wendigo is a human who becomes a zombie type creature after being possessed by a spirt, usually caused by them being out in the forest for too long, which causes the person‚Äôs to lose their humanity and become a cannibal. While most natives described the creature as a pale and humanlike, overtime thanks to settlers and story‚Äôs/books they wrote, the wendigo as basically been rebranded as a deer like monster, while the original description still sometimes appears in the media and might be making a comeback, the deer looking one is probably more recognizable (whether you like it or not). The main things that remain the same among both versions though are the scrawny bodies and humanoid structures though‚Ä¶

Most American made media, especially back in 2006, would use this version if they were to feature a wendigo. Now let‚Äôs look at Elliot: his character design stands out from the other deer seen: he stands on his hind legs for the most part, he‚Äôs got a almost abnormally skinny body, and he partakes in more human like behaviour then the other animals (despite them all having a voice), like how he drinks coffee like a person would, knows a lot about how human life works, and even breaks into a convenience store (something a real life deer would probably never do, considering how scared and skittish they are of humans, other animals like a bear or raccoon sure, but I don‚Äôt think a deer would do that). While the other animals are able to use human tools against the hunters in the climax of the film, it‚Äôs Elliot who‚Äôs the one that knows how to handle them the best. I know having animals stand bipedal is a common trope among animated movies that anthropomorphize animals, heck open season itself has Boog the bear and some of the rabbits/squirrels do this, but Elliot is the only deer who walks like this, heck the other deer are more realistically proportioned in a way that wouldn‚Äôt let them keep the bipedal position for very long. 

The way he‚Äôs stands out from other stag, his use of man made appliances, and overall human like mannerisms and knowledge are rather odd to say the least. It‚Äôs almost like he was once human himself, and as we know according to legends, wendigo‚Äôs were once humans. So maybe he was once a person who got lost in the forest, became possessed by the spirit which changed his appearance and life forever, but this raises the question on why he isn‚Äôt a cannibalistic monster, I have potential answers for that: he was either strong enough to fight back those urges, he was a vegetarian as a human so flesh wouldn‚Äôt interest him in any form, or he was so into nature that he spirit was flattered and let him be. Elliot probably has memories of his human life considering how civil he is, but doesn‚Äôt tell the other animals so they don‚Äôt fear him, or if he doesn‚Äôt then maybe his human instincts still are in effect without him being aware.

I really enjoy stories that make me think and offer a unique kind of world-building (not just fantasy or sci-fi, but something I can also connect to real life and analyze in the context of the time it was written).

I love books that use metaphors, explore psychological or social themes, and aren‚Äôt afraid to include sadness as long as it feels purposeful and meaningful (It shouldn‚Äôt be sad just to be sad.)  
  
On the other hand, I‚Äôm not a fan of purely philosophical works. And stories that only revolve around romance. Or books that are too predictable or easy-plotted.

I had made some friends via Instagram through mutuals and a bunch of them went from just online friends to offline. I started hanging out w them. There were a couple instances when i hung out one-on-one with both girl and guy friends from this group. One such instance where i hung out with one of the guys, (let's call him N) my bf got very upset. He said that he gets bad vibes from him and that i should not be meeting him alone. 

Although N was not close to me at all, it just felt in the moment like my bf was exerting some control over me and I really didn't like that. So I had an argument with him and told him to not draw me boundaries for me.  

Later at a separate occasion, I met N for a coffee after work and he was talking to me about a lot of things he's been through. He had quit his job, started searching for masters options, had a breakup and so on. He also mentioned about a bunch of his hookups and such things. At this I got a bit uncomfortable as it seemed like he was flexing about how even in his ""bad"" phase, he is able to get laid. And it felt crass and unnecessary. I quickly took off and mentally made a note that i didn't want to see him again.

I narrated this incident to my boyfriend who immediately pounced at it to say ""I told you so"", and that this man has been a bad character all this while and that he was just protecting me.

*Advice for Writers, From the Other Side of the Page*

---

## **Introduction ‚Äì Why Simple Writing Wins**

Here‚Äôs the truth: readers don‚Äôt care how many big words you know. We don‚Äôt care about your academic vocabulary or how long it took you to write a sentence. We care about one thing‚Äîcan we follow what you‚Äôre saying? If the answer is no, we stop reading. It‚Äôs that simple.

Good writing feels invisible. You don‚Äôt notice the effort because you‚Äôre too caught up in the message. That‚Äôs what this book is about: showing you how readers experience your writing, and how to keep us hooked. Because at the end of the day, if you lose us, your words don‚Äôt matter.

---

## **Chapter 1: The First Line Test**

Your first line is a handshake. If it‚Äôs weak, awkward, or boring, the reader already doubts you. If it‚Äôs too flashy, we roll our eyes. A good first line doesn‚Äôt have to be clever‚Äîit just has to make us want the second line.

Think of your opening like knocking on someone‚Äôs door. You don‚Äôt scream a poem at them; you just say something clear and direct enough to invite them in.

---

## **Chapter 2: Clarity Over Cleverness**

Writers often chase ‚Äúsounding smart.‚Äù Readers chase ‚Äúunderstanding fast.‚Äù If you make us pause to untangle your words, you lose momentum. That‚Äôs not impressive‚Äîit‚Äôs annoying.

The best writers aren‚Äôt the ones who use the most complicated words. They‚Äôre the ones who make the hardest ideas sound simple. Simplicity is not dumbing down‚Äîit‚Äôs respecting the reader.

---

## **Chapter 3: Don‚Äôt Lose Me in the Middle**

Most readers don‚Äôt quit on the first page. They quit halfway through, when the writing drags. Long paragraphs, endless side notes, or too much description‚Äîall of that makes us wander.

When you‚Äôre writing, think about the middle like a conversation. If you ramble, people drift. Keep the pace moving. Remind us why we‚Äôre still here.

---

## **Chapter 4: Quantity vs. Quality**

A ten-page essay can say less than a single paragraph. More words don‚Äôt equal more value. In fact, more often, it means less impact. Readers remember sharp sentences, not endless walls of text.

Ask yourself: if I had to cut this in half, what would survive? That‚Äôs usually your real point.

---

## **Chapter 5: The Reader‚Äôs Patience Meter**

Every reader has an invisible meter. It drains with every confusing sentence, every dull moment, every delay in getting to the point. When it hits zero, we close the book.

Your job is to keep that meter alive. Short sentences, natural flow, and something worth caring about‚Äîthat‚Äôs what refills it.

---

## **Chapter 6: Flow Matters More Than Flourish**

Good writing feels like a steady walk. Bad writing feels like tripping every few steps. That‚Äôs what happens when writers obsess over fancy phrasing instead of flow.

If we stumble over your words, we notice the writing instead of the message. And once we notice the writing, we stop trusting the writer.

---

## **Chapter 7: The Reader Is Not in Your Head**

This is one of the biggest mistakes writers make: assuming readers know what they know. You might see the full picture in your head, but we don‚Äôt. If you skip steps, we‚Äôre lost.

Think of writing like giving directions. If you assume I already know the way, I‚Äôll end up in the wrong place. Clear, step-by-step explanations keep me with you.

---

## **Chapter 8: Mistakes Writers Think Are Genius**

Overwriting. Overexplaining. Using metaphors stacked on top of each other. Dropping words nobody uses in real life. These aren‚Äôt signs of brilliance‚Äîthey‚Äôre distractions.

Readers don‚Äôt admire how much effort you put into a sentence. They admire when it reads effortlessly.

---

## **Chapter 9: Conversation, Not a Lecture**

The best writing feels like sitting across from someone at a coffee shop. The worst writing feels like being trapped in a classroom while someone drones on.

Write like you talk. Not sloppy, but natural. Direct. Engaging. If you wouldn‚Äôt say it to someone‚Äôs face, don‚Äôt write it down.

---

## **Chapter 10: Ending Strong**

The ending is the echo. It‚Äôs what lingers when the reader walks away. Don‚Äôt fizzle out. Don‚Äôt over-explain. Say what matters, then step back.

A strong ending doesn‚Äôt have to tie everything perfectly together‚Äîit just has to leave the reader thinking about you instead of forgetting you.

---

## **Conclusion: A Promise From the Reader‚Äôs Side**

Here‚Äôs the promise: if you respect my time, I‚Äôll respect your words. If you keep me clear, engaged, and connected, I‚Äôll follow you to the end. But the moment you forget the reader, you lose the reader.

Writing is not about proving yourself‚Äîit‚Äôs about reaching someone else. And from this side of the page, that‚Äôs the only kind of writing that matters.

Sony: the $1B question for ISPs about online piracy,"**tl;dr**: Record labels (led by Sony) won a massive $1B jury verdict against Cox for their customers' music piracy. The 4th Circuit affirmed the verdict in part, but required a new trial. SCOTUS granted Cox‚Äôs petition for OT2025 to clarify what's required for contributory liability, and what counts as ""willful"" for statutory damages. 

# Background and District court proceedings
DMCA safe harbor provisions are a cornerstone of modern internet services.  All ISPs end up dealing with users who  download or distribute copyrighted material in violation of the law.  In 1998, Congress passed the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act), which allowed ISPs to claim ""safe harbor"" from liability as long as they undertook a few key steps, including having a policy in place to terminate repeat copyright offenders.

The facts of today's story actually begin in 2014 with a different case, [BMG v. Cox](https://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2018/02/bmg-rights-management-v-cox-communications).  The case went to trial, and **Cox lost DMCA safe harbor** after courts found they didn‚Äôt ""reasonably implement"" a repeat-infringer policy.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed the safe-harbor denial, but ordered a new trial for unrelated reasons around jury instructions.  However, the writing on the wall was clear, and Cox settled for a ""substantial amount"" given language from the opinion like this:

>""Cox did not implement its repeat infringer policy. Instead, Cox publicly purported to comply with its policy, while privately disparaging and intentionally circumventing the DMCA‚Äôs requirements. Cox employees followed an unwritten policy put in place by senior members of Cox‚Äôs abuse group by which accounts used to repeatedly infringe copyrights would be nominally terminated, only to be reactivated upon request. Once these accounts were reactivated, customers were given clean slates, meaning the next notice of infringement Cox received linked to those accounts would be considered the first in Cox‚Äôs graduated response procedure""

The problems were compounded by extremely embarrassing emails that came up in discovery ([link](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/16-1972/16-1972-2018-02-01.pdf?ts=1517515287#page=16)):

>The words of Cox‚Äôs own employees confirm this conclusion. In a 2009 email, Jason Zabek, the executive managing the Abuse Group, a team tasked with addressing subscribers‚Äô violations of Cox‚Äôs policies, explained to his team that ‚Äú**if a customer is terminated for DMCA, you are able to reactivate them**,‚Äù and that ‚Äú[a]fter you reactivate them the DMCA ‚Äòcounter‚Äô restarts.‚Äù The email continued, ‚ÄúThis is to be an unwritten semipolicy.‚Äù Zabek also advised a customer service representative asking whether she could reactivate a terminated subscriber that ‚Äú[i]f it is for DMCA you can go ahead and reactivate.‚Äù Zabek explained to another representative: ‚ÄúOnce the customer has been terminated for DMCA, we have fulfilled the obligation of the DMCA safe harbor and can start over.‚Äù He elaborated that this would allow Cox to ‚Äú*collect a few extra weeks of payments for their account. ;-).*‚Äù Another email summarized Cox‚Äôs practice more succinctly: ‚ÄúDMCA = reactivate.‚Äù **As a result of this practice, from the beginning of the litigated time period until September 2012, Cox never terminated a subscriber for infringement without reactivating them**

Following the 2018 settlement with BMG, the other members of the RIAA smelled blood and decided to sue as well ([complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.393187/gov.uscourts.vaed.393187.1.0_1.pdf)).  This went to a jury trial, where Cox was found responsible for both vicarious and contributory infringement ([verdict](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.393187/gov.uscourts.vaed.393187.669.0_1.pdf)) and hit with a one billion dollar penalty.  To put that number in perspective, Cox claimed the amount was ""$431 million more than all copyright statutory damages awarded between 2009 and 2016 combined"" ([source](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.50.0.pdf#page=28))

# Circuit court proceedings

Unsurprisingly, Cox appealed to the Fourth Circuit, raising three issues ([brief](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.50.0.pdf)):

* **Cox took issue with being found vicariously liable for their user's copyright infringement**.  Cox had no ability to supervise the internet activity of their subscribers, and did not profit **directly** from their infringement.  Prevailing law held that vicarious liability required showing a direct benefit, but Cox didn't make any more or less money if their users violated copyright law or didn't.
* **Cox took issue with contributory liability**, arguing that the DMCA notices they received weren't sufficient to establish ""knowledge"" of future violations, and that Cox did not materially contribute to every act of infringement for which it was held liable.
* **Cox took issue with the number of works counted** for the purpose of determining the penalty.  Damages were calculated treating every item of an album separately, instead of grouping them into the compiled album.

You can read the music companies reply brief [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.49.0.pdf).  The Fourth Circuit eventually issued [an opinion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.92.0.pdf) with wins & losses for both parties:

* ‚ùå**Vicarious liability: district court reversed**: Relevant precedent states that: ""A defendant may be held vicariously liable for a third party‚Äôs copyright infringement if the defendant ‚Äú[1] profits directly from the infringement and [2] has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer"". In this case, the court held that Cox was not *profiting directly* from the infringement -- their only benefit came from a flat monthly fee.  The opinion contrasts cases against Napster (vicariously liable) and AOL (not vicariously liable) to highlight that plaintiffs would have had to have shown a more direct link to justify this ([source](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.92.0.pdf#page=12)).
* ‚úÖ**Contributory liability: district court affirmed**: Here, the requirement is weaker: ""one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another‚Äô is liable for the infringement, too"".  On the topic of ""knowledge"", Cox made a mess for themselves.  At the district court level, Cox argued that the notices they received were insufficient to identify infringement, but the district court (unsurprisingly) rejected that argument.  They tried raising a new argument ""that notices of past infringement failed to establish its knowledge that the same subscriber was substantially certain to infringe again"", but this was not raised at trial, so the Fourth Circuit held the argument was forfeited.  The next part of the analysis came to liability, where the Fourth Circuit held: ""The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to Sony, showed more than mere failure to prevent infringement. The jury saw evidence that Cox knew of specific instances of repeat copyright infringement occurring on its network, that Cox traced those instances to specific users, and that Cox chose to continue providing monthly internet access to those users despite believing the online infringement would continue because it wanted to avoid losing revenue"".  This language will likely be key at SCOTUS, which we'll return to in a bit.
* ‚úÖ**Compilations: district court affirmed**: Finally, the court held that Cox had failed to present evidence to the jury to allow them to identify album compilations or recording overlaps.  Sony won on this point, with no change to the number of works infringed.

As a result of all this, a new trial was needed because the jury verdict and award didn't distinguish between vicarious and contributory infringement.

# Now: heading to SCOTUS

However, Cox filed a cert petition in August 2024 ([link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-171/322523/20240815090212089_240802a%20Petition%20for%20efiling.pdf)) and in June 2025 the petition was granted.  There were two specific QPs:

* **(1) Requirements for contributory infringement**: whether continued service with knowledge (but no affirmative inducement) can be ""material contribution"" to infringement
* **(2) Requirements for willfulness**: whether knowledge alone from an ISP is sufficient to establish ""willfulness"" for enhanced statutory damages

I suspect the court will at least partially reverse the Fourth Circuit, but it'll be interesting to see exactly where they land here.  On the factual record, Cox seems to be an extremely unsympathetic defendant.  However, a ruling that goes too far could end up causing ISPs to become far stricter in terminating service for repeat DMCA offenders, creating issues for places like coffee shops with free WiFi and individual subscribers who haven't heard of a VPN.  The ""middle ground"" option here would be to affirm the finding of liability (Q1) but reject the ""willful"" enhancement (Q2), but I'm not quite sure I can see how exactly the court would thread that needle in this case.  Either way, I'll be looking forward to oral arguments!

- I want the restaurant to be something to write home about. We are bartenders so great cocktails and spirits are important to me as well as the food and good atmosphere. 
- I am not super picky on food preference but bonus point if there are oysters and or steak. I love most all food but overall would like to avoid Mexican food since that normally what we eat at our restaurant. 
- Location doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as it‚Äôs in Brooklyn as that is the most convenient for all of us. Ideally I would just like it to be in an active area in case we want to migrate to a bar or something after. If I had a preference I would just say anything north of Prospect Park. 
- budget is not a huge issue. My regulars are pretty big spenders and like to eat nice food so I wanna take them to a place that gives them that experience. 

‚Äî- places i like!!‚Äî- 


In case you care about the kind of place I enjoy to get a feel for what I might like. 

- public records: truly a space that has it all. Coffee, drinks, dinner, brunch, dancing, amazing atmosphere, great staff. I don‚Äôt mind vegan food and love their menu but I have a feeling that my group would prefer to avoid that kind of food. 
- Maison premier: oysters, seafood, and steak with a wonderful Louisiana 1920s vibe. I actually have a reservation here for our dinner but it‚Äôs too late in the night and we need something earlier so I‚Äôm trying to find somewhere that can accommodate us in early evening. 
- koma sushi: had a phenomenal experience here for their Monday Omakase all you can eat experience. We unfortunately are not able to go on a Monday though and I‚Äôm not sure what their situation looks like outside of that. It‚Äôs also pretty deep in Brooklyn which is fine but there‚Äôs not a ton in this area in terms of night life for afterwards (as far as I‚Äôm aware, I could be wrong)

- Kissa kissa: not really a dinner spot and probably can‚Äôt accommodate six people.

well I'm at almost exactly month 3, the sneaky craving milestone....

I rarely ever think about nicotine anymore, even when I do, it's usually ""damn, so glad I quit!"" 

So I felt I was over it... then after having my coffee this morning it hits me like a ton of bricks, a void feeling, an itch only nicotine could scratch and has been nagging at my mind since. 


Reading my old note app journals to myself from just before and after I quit was the only thing helping to convince me not to go out and buy a vape or go ask my neighbour for a cig at the smoking area outside. 

I realized just how different my overall mind state was then and remembered how fucking hard it was too and that I don't wanna do that again.


I highly recommend you journal/mind dump when ur going through it on your quitting journey for this reason... there could always be a day that you will need the reminder.

I've bottled it up but I feel like I'm losing my mind. Every trip makes me feel like I'm going to vomit. I just need to rant. 

My mother's road rage is not only embarrassing and extremely childish but dangerous. 

Being in the car with my mother is like being taped to the side of a rocket being piloted by a hissing and spitting cat hell bent on making the entire sky her road and demonizing anyone else who dares to want to be in the same space as her. Every driver only exists solely to piss her off and inconvenience her directly. Every single drive, no matter how short, no matter how exciting the destination, no matter how good the day before; every drive is miserable and makes it more and more clear that my mother really does not care if we get into a wreck or get shot. 

A little background: the way my mom explodes and expresses rage and frustration on the road is the exact same way she exploded in my childhood and it's extremely triggering even as an adult. She used to drive 5 hours total every day though to get to work to pay rent and feed us for years, so I do understand she's hit her limit. But I crashed my car almost a year ago and have PTSD from it and at first she seemed concerned, but now it's like she's totally forgotten or doesn't think it's that serious. She's shocked when I'm triggered and react to her driving. 

She speeds, screams and yells and curses, lays on the horn for MINUTES while behind someone or passing them, passes 18-wheelers WHILE THEY'RE STILL SWITCHING LANES? As if there's no possibility they might have to swerve back over and crush us? and also passes cars illegally and when other cars are headed directly towards us just because they're going the speed limit. If you're not going 20 over the speed limit, my mother HATES YOU, and she makes sure I hear about it. Or I would, if I didn't keep my headphones on constantly, even if I can tell it irritates her. She wants me to listen to her complain so bad but I've done that my whole life. 

It's just so frustrating and appalling. Not only is it embarrassing to be in the same car with her during her behavior, but she's had someone follow her to a gas station before after she laid on the horn and flipped them off and he threatened her. Half the time she does this she looks at me with this weird grin and tries to joke that she's going to get shot one day. 

Why does she think that's funny? Why doesn't she have any concept of if she gets shot at, I'M going to get shot at too, her own child? Why doesn't she think about how I would feel if she got shot and left me and my sister and her grandson without her all because she wanted to be a jackass on the road?? Why can't she work on her temper even just a little bit? I know she recognizes it but she just says that's the way she is. Well I don't like the way she is and I think it's ridiculous for a grown adult to act that way and to endanger me and everyone else on the road just because she's frustrated. 

She tailgates cars while going 80 in a 60 until half the time they pull over and let her pass, all while bitching and cursing and muttering under her breath before yelling as if they can hear her. She barely waits for them to pass and has almost hit several cars, and usually flips them off too, just for? Inconveniencing her I guess? She also got upset recently when I hesitated when she asked me to unbuckle my seatbelt to check on my nephew in the backseat. We were on the road going 40mph and I started stuttering that I would but I was going to wait until we stopped at a sign or light, but she snapped that I never wanted to do anything for her or ever help her and always ignore her. 

This whole week I've been making sure fresh coffee is ready in the morning for her. I've made her homemade breakfast and lunch almost every day too so she hasn't had to worry about it all week. She was so grateful. And then she was angry again like always. 

I never do anything for her? ... Maybe it only matters to her that people do what she wants when she wants in that exact moment. That was the golden rule of childhood, after all. ",5,1755376483.0,emotionalneglect,0,0.86,False

I was different. Or I thought I was different. That misconception crumbled when I found myself in front of the TV at 3 AM.

It felt more of a crime than a personal guilt trip. When it's a guilt trip, I would feel bad doing it. But a crime, something about it made it more compelling. Mind you, I wouldn't dare commit a law breaking crime, but watching TV early in the morning isn't really breaking cable laws. They'd appreciate me more, rather, being that I was such an avid consumer.¬†

Why was I doing this? Well maybe, it had something to do with my mom getting me grounded. TV, as per my parents, was to not be kept on after 9 PM. The new series I started watching during the summer vacations went on until 9:15. You'd think it to be common courtesy that the extra time be allowed. But no. Parents hate feeling out of control.¬†

I spoke back, of course, right to their faces. The episode was approaching a twist‚ÄîI could feel it. I wasn't the only one waiting on for today's episode, all my classmates had planned to watch it too. I knew that Tiffany was watching it, totally invested in the story. Sorry, I can‚Äôt help myself.

So when my parents had me shut it down, I was distraught. Words blathered while leaving my jaw. I felt out of breath, as if my oxygen supply had been poached. I felt betrayed. Why had the two of you conceived me if not to perceive the lushness of colorful entertainment? Before I knew it, I was on the floor, in disbelief.

If I had pleaded to watch only that remaining bit of it, I might have been granted the luxury. But I had to live up to the teenage stereotypes‚Äîall my friends did. So I tweaked my pitch a little over the kilter, somewhere between a whisper and a shout. That was enough to get me grounded‚Äîno screen time for a whole dreaded week.

The prospect of missing an entire week's worth of ‚ÄúTim and Tady‚Äù was enough a reason for me to commit this crime. At our side of the county, episodics stayed as recordings for a period of 24 hours if you had scheduled for them to be recorded. I had. Now, all I had to do was sneak out of my bed, tiptoe down the stairs, and take my place comfortably on the couch with the remote. Yep‚Äîthat easy. I should've known.

The first step was unbedding myself. I sat propped up, waiting for the clock to hit 3. How would I know, in a dark room, if the clock hit 3? I wouldn't. But I hoped. Just as the clock hit a tick louder than the ones before it, I spared little to no time to spread my feet off the bed. Creak. The brittle bed moaned. I paused, expecting the lights outside to go out and for two very expecting and angry adults marching in. But no, a full five minutes later, no one came. I was safe. Right?

I jumped off the bed, yet again, a creak sounded. This time from the wooden sheet boards below, comprising the length of my room‚Äôs floor. I located my slippers very articulately. They were near the door. I pitter-pattered to the barely visible doorknob. One hand on the said knob, I slid into my fluffy slippers, nudging the knob clockwise to open it. A very slow, painful, and guttural, pervasive screech grumbled as the door moved open. The noise made me feel concussed, though I‚Äôve never had a concussion. Parents buying homes tactfully knowing that we would try to sneak around might be the pettiest thing they do. What should a teenager do to get privacy around here?

Yet again, I waited. No lights snapping on through the door‚Äôs crack, no heated arguments of how badly they‚Äôve raised me, and no talk about divorce. I was in the clear. Spilling the door open wide, I looked left, to the dark hallway leading to my parents room, and then to the right, at the dark stairwell that led down to the TV. I felt it calling to me from below seductively, the TV‚Äîit's box blinking red as if winking at me to approach.   
  
I took a deep breath, analyzing the regret-slash-getting-caught ratio, and concluded that I didn't know math. You couldn‚Äôt make me solve algebra even if the game's period depended on it.¬† Eventually, I made up my mind‚ÄîI was going to sit through all fourteen minutes of the missed episode.  
  
Floating down the stairwell like a helium balloon, I made sure to tap each step twice, portending their squeakiness, fearful of getting caught now, so close to my goal. None squeaked. Our stairwell extended from the walls, with nothing below to support them. Every day, we tread up and down them, yet they don‚Äôt budge. Even now, they stayed staunch to their architect. Must've meant I was awake, for they refused to follow the rules of physics as usual. They were almost an exception to the physics I knew of. Weren‚Äôt exceptions a chemistry thing? 

The lightless hall was blinding in all of its darkness. Was this 3 AM TV thing an obligation needing fulfillment? No. Will I go through with it anyway? Yes. I said to myself‚ÄîI was going to watch this episode, and that too, right now.

The clock ticked louder in the empty room, the echoing ticks bouncing off the couches, the coffee table, the flower vases, the TV rack, and most of all, its own frame. But I didn't mind it. It gave me a benchmark to maintain in the noise department. No more than -2 billion dBs of sound. Walking around the couch to its optimal seating position, I took my seat, facing the blank screen of the TV. The remote? Where was the remote? I knew my parents would try to seal it away, so I stashed it between the couch‚Äôs cushions. I had put a bar of soap under a cloth on the TV mantel, in case they suspected. I had outsmarted not only two adults, but both of my parents.   
  
I felt proudly satisfied, a feeling that would‚Äôve lasted had the only channels available at 3 AM not been static. The recorded section was empty. What was going on? Where was my recorded episode? Did mom delete it? Did they, instead, outsmart me?   
  
I waited with baited breaths, readily expecting my parents to switch on the lights and jump out from behind the walls, making fun of my elaborate plans. Or, at the least, begin arguing like normal. But the more I waited, the more I began to feel‚Ä¶cold. The fans were off, and I hadn‚Äôt switched on the A/C. It was cold, like the insides of a fridge. Had the refrigerator door stayed open? No‚Ä¶that would be absurd, right? It was cold.   
  
That's when it happened. The static continued to strobe the hall in its light, enough to give an epileptic, seizures. Hair on edge from the low temperature, I had nothing to do but‚Ä¶stare. Into the strobing lights of the static TV. I tried shifting channels, but every single one of them was the same‚Äîstatic. I was about ready to cry, when finally, I found a working channel.   
  
Channel 402. The only channel with media playing. I was ecstatic, I had found something to replace my unsatiated purpose. A black and white video was being set up on it. I clicked the remote‚Äôs OK button to check the media‚Äôs name. Usually, the video would pause, and the details about it would rise up from below the screen. Yet, as I pressed the button for what seemed minutes, the video did not stop.¬†   
  
I tried shifting the channels again, but it didn‚Äôt work. I suspected dead batteries, but I knew better than that. I had to watch it. I had no other options.  
  
The video began with two men talking, one was the camera man. The other was a well suited man, younger than my father, with a crooked nose. The subject of their talk was some house. They were planning to break into it, something around the lines of stealing. It was a burglary, I thought. A fun subject to make a documentary on. I wouldn‚Äôt be watching this otherwise, documentaries are more of my dad‚Äôs thing.   
  
I continued watching the video, interested in its early premise. The sky was black. It was night in it, too. A small timestamp to the right corner read ‚Äú3:02 AM‚Äù within the video. That's how I knew the exact time, which I couldn‚Äôt have known otherwise, as I sat in the dark.  
  
They had begun walking past trees, bushes, shrubs, sneaking around the densely packed suburb. The victims of their burglary were supposed to be a wealthy family that stood out from the rest. The two people in the video were whispering, so, many of the details went past me. I had knocked the sound level to 5, knowing that any level over that would cause my parents to wake up like resurrected mummies. Either way, knowing that pushing it up just a bit wouldn‚Äôt hurt, I still refrained from doing so.   
  
The two people escaped the forested pathway, now reemerging behind a white washed wall. The wall belonged to their target‚Äôs house, they declared quietly. Climbing upon a weeded ridge behind the house, the well suited man faced the camera as he giggled. His feet were on loose ground. He slipped. I could feel his soul leave his body as he breathed a short, quiet scream. That's when it first happened.  
  
A clatter of pebbles outside my balcony window made me jump off the couch. My head dazed on the balcony, from where the sounds came from. The clattering of pebbles seamlessly died down. I kept staring, shifting my gaze across the balcony‚Äôs slider, waiting for the sounds to resume. Must‚Äôve been a dog, I reassured myself. The video‚Äôs format had somehow begun to get to me.   
  
Hesitant that it wasn‚Äôt just a dog, I attempted to get back into the video. The well-suited man was now talking to the camera man, making hand signs as he did. The camera shook as the recorder spoke, his voice agitated. Were they fighting? I had watched enough of my baby videos to know that cameras shake when two people argued. The suited man rubbed his forehead, looking straight into the camera. His eyes glinted on the lens, as if made of lights.   
  
My father once had me watch an animal documentary about tigers hunting down their prey. They were stealthy, fast, and most of all, hungry. He told me, when I asked him about the tiger‚Äôs shining eyes, that they were a sign of a seasoned predator. He laughed it off when I looked at him all serious, and I laughed with him too, a little later. I regret knowing that now, what he told me back then.  
  
I was sitting with my knees to my chin. Sweat had begun to pool up near my groin, leaving my forearms in the frozen air. It didn‚Äôt bother me all this time, but now that the two men just stood there outside the target‚Äôs house, waiting for something, I had begun to lose interest. And so, I became aware of the sweat. The discomfort that followed after realising it was unbearable. I stretched my legs forward, hoping the cool in the air would find its way into my pants, drying the sweat off. I was a mess. Even in the cold, I had sweat on my forehead.  
  
The sweat wasn‚Äôt drying. Frustrated, I stood up, standing with my legs wide. I oscillated from side to side, thinking that my movements were generating enough wind to work as a dryer. That‚Äôs when it happened again.  
  
The two men in the video had started talking again. Their wait was maybe‚Ä¶over. The two men then began walking down the ridge, taking support of the white wall. A few seconds later, the camera man came into view, his reflection grew on the balcony‚Äôs glass sliders. Curtains lay spread behind the glass sliders, so the camera man‚Äôs reflection was clearer. He was big. Tall, muscular. His shoulder was exposed, covered in black, dried ink. Tattoos. If I knew without doubt that I wasn‚Äôt hallucinating at 3 at night, I‚Äôd say that the camera man was‚Ä¶smiling.   
  
I yawned, my eyes dawdled to my right. That's where my house‚Äôs balcony was. My mouth stayed open. At 3:21 AM, I saw a shadow on the window curtains. The camera man began to speak, gritting his smiling teeth while doing so. The two of them had stopped their whispering. I heard the words they spoke very clearly now, as if they stood right outside my house.   
  
At first, I thought it was an echo effect, a defect in the audio of the media. But I soon realized that their words weren‚Äôt being repeated twice‚Äîthere was a lag between the broadcast and the outside of my house. They...were outside my house.  
  
I went up to my parents‚Äô room 20 minutes ago. They weren‚Äôt there. The room smelled like fish, but they weren‚Äôt there. I grabbed my phone from their cupboard, unlocking their safe to get it while slipping over the red liquid drowning the floor boards. I‚Äôve waited in the bathroom without switching the lights on for an hour now. I don‚Äôt know what became of the two intruders that broke into my house 5 minutes ago, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll find me. They knocked on the windows first, and then broke through them. I tried dialing the police, but I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt speak to them‚Ä¶the two outside would hear me.   
  
I‚Ä¶I think they're getting close. I can hear their breaths outside the bathroom door. I don‚Äôt know what happened to my parents. I hope they‚Äôre fine. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they left two red pillows under the red blankets. I thought it was them at first, but it couldn‚Äôt be.   
  
The pillows didn‚Äôt move.   
  
My parents move.   
  
The two people outside move, too.   
  
I must wake up‚Äî

1ms6p5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1ms6p5p/explore_the_best_replacement_water_filter/,Explore the Best Replacement Water Filter Cuisinart Offers Today,"The Cuisinart 6527853425322 is a product I‚Äôve been testing daily in my kitchen, and it‚Äôs become a key part of my coffee routine. If you‚Äôre someone who treasures the flavor of a freshly brewed cup or clean water for cooking, you‚Äôll instantly understand why something as simple as a replacement filter can make such a big difference. This set of two replacement charcoal water filters was designed to ensure that the water you use in your appliances, whether for coffee makers or other kitchen gadgets requiring filtration, is as clean and fresh as possible. Before I give my take, let me give you some insight into its strengths and weaker points based on my honest usage experience. 

**Durable Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing worth mentioning is the impressive construction of these filters. They‚Äôre made from nonwoven polyester combined with activated charcoal, which promises high-level filtration performance. That combination works together seamlessly to remove impurities from water, such as chlorine, bad odors, and other lingering tastes that can affect the quality of your beverages and meals. Unlike some filters I‚Äôve tried before, these actually hold their form pretty well after extended use, and they‚Äôre easy to insert into the appropriate coffee maker or filtration system.  

[Check Cuisinart 6527853425322 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b00y0xu77y/)

**Efficiency and Performance**  
One thing I seriously appreciate about this product is its effectiveness. The filtered water noticeably improves the taste of not just my coffee but also other drinks like tea or even tap water for cooking. You‚Äôd be surprised how much difference a clean filter makes‚Äîit‚Äôs like leveling up your daily beverages without even realizing it. The performance lasts for weeks before needing replacement, which aligns with the industry standard. Additionally, the filtering process doesn‚Äôt leave any weird residue behind, something I‚Äôve unfortunately encountered with lesser-quality brands.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Every busy person appreciates a product that doesn‚Äôt need a science degree to operate. Changing out these filters is as straightforward as removing the old one and replacing it with a fresh one. In my experience, there hasn't been any mess or leakage during installation, which is always a concern with products like this. That simplicity paired with the quality of filtration ensures it‚Äôs a set-and-forget kind of product‚Äîtruly hassle-free.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Activated charcoal effectively removes unpleasant odors and tastes.  
- Easy installation process without hassle.  
- Improves the taste of coffee and other beverages immediately.  
- Offers excellent durability over regular usage.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The filters might not fit all machines universally. Double-check compatibility beforehand.  
- Packaging doesn‚Äôt include detailed instructions, which might inconvenience first-time users.  

**Competing Products**  
Considering other brands like Keurig-compatible filters or Brita pitcher filters, I‚Äôd say these Cuisinart replacement filters hold their own. Keurig options are usually machine-specific, making them slightly less compatible, while Brita, though trusted, is usually targeted at larger filtration systems like pitchers or water tanks. Where Cuisinart excels is in its flexible use for smaller kitchen gadgets, especially coffee makers, while maintaining an excellent balance of quality filtration and durability. Having tested all three, I‚Äôd say the water clarity and taste improvement from these filters would rival, if not surpass, those other well-known competitors.  

**Smart Spending**  
For the functionality and longevity they offer, these filters are absolutely a worthwhile investment. While you might find cheaper generic options in the market, the problem always lies in their reliability‚Äîmost either don‚Äôt perform nearly as well or stop working properly far sooner. Spending just a bit more ensures you‚Äôre not constantly replacing filters, which saves both money and effort in the long run.

Please help me exit gracefully.,"I (34F) am seeing this guy (34M) for a few months now and I today discovered he is talking to someone.

For context, we started talking months ago online and we decided to finally meet. This guy is very thoughtful, considerate, and kind to me. This month, I am in the final stages of a job I‚Äôm applying for in his city. He insisted on helping me with accommodation as he lives alone anyway. So for the day of the interview, I got myself an Airbnb and then he picked me up a day later to stay with him while waiting for the results of the job recruitment process. I gracefully accepted staying with him for 2 reasons:

1. I could save A LOT on accommodations as it isn‚Äôt exactly cheap in this side of the country

2. I could also get to know him better

Mind you, this man makes breakfast for me, makes me coffee, cooks meals, and is very considerate and thoughtful. He is the overall green flag or so I thought.

One day, while he was at work, I was cleaning some lose papers by the TV stand and I stumble upon a notebook which contained a prayer in a foreign language. There it mentions the name of a lady referred to as the ‚Äúwife‚Äù of the writer. I instantly was nervous and cold. I looked up the name on Instagram and Facebook. But it was such a generic name, a lot of accounts popped up and I don‚Äôt know which one is her. One account stood out for me though and I don‚Äôt know why. I left it at that.

Fast forward to today, he asked for a pizza and I graciously agreed to order (I‚Äôm living here for free, it‚Äôs the least I can do). While I was ordering on his phone and entering my card details, his messaging app popped. I was so gutted when I saw the lady‚Äôs display photo. It was the same on Instagram that I saw. And the kicker? The name on his phone was My Love. And they have messages to today.

Now, he feels that I am growing colder and more distant. I want to leave, but how do I leave and exit gracefully? Do I even tell her and send proof to her that he‚Äôs here with me? Please help me. I am so angry I can‚Äôt think clearly.

PS I think there are 2 red flags that I might have overlooked:

1. He doesn‚Äôt like to have photos of himself taken
2. He lied about not having social media because when I got here, he is on Facebook A LOT and occasionally on Instagram reels

I also decided to add the girl‚Äôs Instagram on a finsta to see if she posted photos with him.",2,1755375382.0,relationship_advice,16,0.58,False

For the longest time my parents have tried everything to help him but nothing has worked he‚Äôs lost everything and he continues. My parents have tried and I‚Äôm not sure if it magic or something else, were you go to someone for example and they ‚Äúdo something to sugar and you put it in the person with the problems coffee without them knowing and it should help them stop‚Äù people in our culture swear by these methods. Again not sure if it‚Äôs magic or some kind of dua but my parents avoid the topic when I have asked. I‚Äôve asked imams there opinions on what should my parents do and they say for him to pray. Problem is he dosent. Anyone else have a similar problem or any advise. Thank you",2,1755375133.0,MuslimLounge,2,1.0,False
