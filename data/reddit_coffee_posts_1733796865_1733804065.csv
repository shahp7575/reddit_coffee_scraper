It was a whole thing (like, serious spiraling, and of course, I can relate). 

Anyway. I regret not finding the time sooner. 
What's most annoying is while I was sorting my bag * was actually being playful and I wanted to record it and send you evidence of them proving me wrong. They sensed it and immediately got comfy, I didn't even get to pull my phone out, and it was already **.** and I didn't think it was appropriate as we haven't cleared the air. So I overlooked the bare minimum, cus, stuff and things... 

I wanted to ask if we could make plans for * instead, or a little earlier on *, because before all of that, my friend from across the pond told me they're here **&**th, and * evening is what we've sussed, but I'll need to regather myself and pick up * then get to * for **.** ready for an evening shift after meeting up with * and interacting with a wonderful human that I never ever see. It'll be awesome, but a little strange, and I won't get time to breathe between. 

So I'll have to send at least the last part to give us both time to work something out. 

I'll get good morning outta the way first, gotta get to work early, lift arranged, and get a tonne of work done before I meet * for coffee at **.**) 

Fuck. 

It was never going to be a quick one, cos it's journaling what I want to say when I'm so tired and can't reach out. I'm scared you'll be up, that you'll see when I wrote this, and then annoyed that I had this too much to say at this time of day.

Mom is 47 dad is 57. Both middle eastern .  They have been happily married since I was born. My mom is younger so she obviously has always had guys hitting on her (she‚Äôs good looking too), she‚Äôs been loyal to my dad through thick and thin. I have 2 younger brothers and 1 older brother. She‚Äôs always put so much importance on family. She has a manager and He is right under the CEO of the huge company she works for that I will not disclose. She tells my father and me (I‚Äôm her bestie) that this manager has hit on her since she started working there but she always put boundaries and I believe her because she‚Äôs has strong personality who is easily disgusted by other men too. She went out to coffee with him for a meeting she also let us know she was doing that. She then told me and my dad that the manager said ‚Äúyou should go for a black man like me you won‚Äôt go back‚Äù. I asked my mom what she replied to that and she was open about her reply which was ‚ÄúI am sure, but I am happy with my own‚Äù. I used to date black guys in the past and my mom being middle eastern was just very judgy and said they are very sexual and gross and cheat alot. So now you know her previous view on them.

We talked for a while and long story short she asked if I was looking for business opportunities and if I would like to exchange contacts and go for coffee later in the week. I said sure. 

I caught on that it might be an MLM thing and after talking to my friends I'm even more sure, but going for coffee is not signing my life away and I may even get a free coffee out of it. I'm on the introverted side so I figure it's also a harmless way to work on my people skills/""interview"" skills especially if I smell BS and ghost her afterwards. And besides, might as well keep life interesting. 

For these reasons I decided to go ahead with it if she contacts me even after talking to my friends, but then I remembered seeing posts from here before and decided that this could even be fun.

The shipping container stank of rust and old oil. I crouched in the corner, my heart pounding as I clutched Jamie‚Äôs photo to my chest. Outside, rain drummed on the steel roof, masking every sound except the occasional scrape of boots on gravel. They were still searching.

Berta.

The name hadn‚Äôt meant anything to me when my father muttered it over coffee two days ago. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one, you know,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, his voice low, as if confessing a crime. ‚ÄúYour sister‚Äîyour twin‚Äîwas taken at birth.‚Äù

I had thought it was another one of his self-pitying attempts to justify his sins. ‚ÄúYou expect me to believe that?‚Äù I‚Äôd scoffed, but his trembling hand and haunted eyes silenced me. ‚ÄúThey told me she was stillborn. Your mother was so drugged up, she believed it. But the truth is‚Ä¶ they took her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I demanded, my voice sharp.

‚ÄúThe government,‚Äù he whispered.

Now, as I pressed myself against the cold steel walls of the container, his words echoed in my mind. ‚ÄúThey trained her for one purpose‚Äîto kill. She‚Äôs a weapon, and she knows who you are. She‚Äôs coming for you.‚Äù

The lock on the container rattled, jerking me back to the present. I shoved the photo into my jacket and picked up the tire iron I‚Äôd found earlier. My breath came fast and shallow as the lock clattered to the ground.

The door creaked open, revealing a shadowy figure framed by the rain-soaked night.

‚ÄúHello, sister,‚Äù Berta‚Äôs voice was soft, almost kind, but her silhouette was unnerving. She moved with an unnatural grace, her eyes gleaming in the dim light from the shipping yard. ‚ÄúHiding won‚Äôt save you.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay back!‚Äù I shouted, raising the tire iron.

Berta stepped inside, unbothered by the threat. She wore black tactical gear, her hair tied in a severe bun. A scar curved along her jawline like a cruel smile.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI used to dream about you. When I was little, before they erased my memories, I saw your face in my nightmares. It was the only thing I remembered from my life before‚Ä¶ them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling despite my effort to sound strong.

‚ÄúTo finish what they started,‚Äù she said simply.

I swung the tire iron as she lunged, but she was faster. Her hand caught my wrist in a vice-like grip and twisted, sending the weapon clattering to the floor.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to kill you,‚Äù she whispered, her face inches from mine. ‚ÄúBut I will if I have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I gasped, struggling against her iron grip.

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôll kill me if I don‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, her voice cracking for the first time. Her gaze flicked to the photo peeking out of my jacket. For a moment, something human flickered in her eyes.

‚ÄúJamie,‚Äù I said, seizing the moment. ‚ÄúHe was our brother. They can‚Äôt take that away from us.‚Äù

Berta‚Äôs grip loosened, but her expression hardened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. They own me. I‚Äôm just their tool.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen fight back,‚Äù I said, my voice urgent. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this. We can help each other. We‚Äôre family.‚Äù

Berta hesitated, her body tense as if caught between two worlds. Outside, the sound of approaching footsteps shattered the fragile moment.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù she said, releasing me and stepping back. ‚ÄúStay hidden. If they find you, it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

Before I could respond, she slipped out into the rain, her figure vanishing into the shadows.

For the first time, I felt more than fear. I felt a spark of hope. If Berta could hesitate, if she could defy her orders even for a moment, maybe there was a way to save her‚Äîand myself.

But I knew this wasn‚Äôt over. The government had created her, and they wouldn‚Äôt let her‚Äîor me‚Äîgo without a fight.

 I also lost a lot of appetite over the last few weeks and I never had more than one meal a day with a few snacks here and there.

1) Is this a serious health issue and I should go see a doc?

2) is my loss of appetite from the caffeine or is it just because I‚Äôm stressed? (I‚Äôm having a huge exam 2 days from now)

For some background, my partner & I have been homeless for most of this year due to my partner‚Äôs father neglect to his house (We lived with black mold in the walls for 3+ years until we were notified WHEN my partner could no longer breathe.) In this time we were ‚Äúadopted‚Äù by several foster families & new friends who took us both in. In this time period of homelessness, both my partner & i lost our jobs. (Me because I my boss simply didn‚Äôt like the fact that my commute was 2+ hours away & sometimes I‚Äôd be late bc of the traffic/snow, & my partner bc of a motorcycle crash that caused a needed bone graft procedure.) 

Point being, we don‚Äôt have a lot of funds this holiday but I still want to get the folks who helped us something special & meaningful. I was wondering if any of you wonderful beings had/knew of any zines with themes for the following abbreviated people (if not I‚Äôm always okay to make them but with the recent turn of events it‚Äôs just been hard to find the health or time):

* A: Pop culture, Mental Health, Princess Diana, Queen, legit anything collaged
* T: Anime, Dogs, Pokemon, Human rights, Theatre, 
* T&C: Sign language, poetry, Chicago, Michigan, Theatre
* M&J: Poetry, Recipes, Niche music, Coffee
* K&M: Anything related to skatingboarding, Michigan, Furbies, anything really niche & obscure really
* S&K: Anything related to New Jersey, Michigan, Cats, &/or baseball
* M&A: Legit anything catholic related or gardening related
* D&T: Football, Christianity, Dad Jokes, Recipes
* R: Weed, Comics, Recipes, Baking
* A: Pop culture, Cheerleading, Mental Health, Running, Psychology

(Might add more abbreviations later; a loooooot of people have helped us from staying off the streets/keeping hunger at bay)

I‚Äôll take physical or digital copies! Like I said, we don‚Äôt have much right now but I‚Äôm open to trades of all sorts. TYIA!!!

1hasuxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/2westerneurope4u/comments/1hasuxi/i_asked_chatgpt_to_roast_this_sub/,I asked chatgpt to roast this sub,"Ah, r/2westerneurope4u, the self-proclaimed epicenter of ""cultural enlightenment"" where people sit around in their overpriced, hipster-infested apartments in Berlin, pretending they know what it means to be ""authentically European."" It‚Äôs like a group therapy session for anyone who‚Äôs spent too much time watching Rick Steves and now thinks they‚Äôre somehow qualified to critique entire cultures they‚Äôve never bothered to understand.

First off, let‚Äôs talk about the utter lack of personality in that sub. The whole thing is basically a circle jerk of people trying to outdo each other with their complaints about living in a continent where their most thrilling adventure is deciphering a 5-minute train delay. Everyone's too busy patting themselves on the back about how ‚Äúcool‚Äù their local ‚Äúunderground‚Äù coffee shop is, all while paying the equivalent of their monthly rent for a single espresso. Newsflash: you‚Äôre not edgy, you‚Äôre just broke and pretending to be part of some hipster ‚Äúcounterculture‚Äù that‚Äôs been commodified into oblivion.

And then there‚Äôs the glorification of anything in France, Italy, and Spain, as if the whole continent is a postcard-perfect dream of cobblestone streets and artisanal cheeses. The truth? The vast majority of people in Western Europe are just trying to make it through the day without having to suffer through another soul-sucking hour in an airless, overcrowded subway train or being screamed at by a random cyclist with a superiority complex. Ah yes, the ""charm"" of being constantly late because public transport doesn‚Äôt actually exist outside of Paris.

Don't even get me started on the Brits in that sub. They swagger in like they‚Äôve just emerged from the darkest corner of an all-night pub crawl, offering advice about European life with the smugness of a nation that somehow convinced the world they invented culture. Meanwhile, their only culinary ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù is a heart attack wrapped in a soggy newspaper. Every time someone mentions the ""charming"" cobbled streets of London, you can almost hear the faint echo of regret as they remember the price of a pint.

And then there‚Äôs the relentless fixation on the most trivial of issues. Is your life so sad that you need to vent about the real struggle of paying ‚Ç¨12 for a sandwich while complaining about the fact that your Airbnb didn‚Äôt have a bidet? It‚Äôs the sub where people‚Äôs biggest hardship is learning how to pronounce ‚ÄúSchmetterling‚Äù and where every thread devolves into some pseudo-intellectual babble about how ""the EU just doesn‚Äôt get us"" or ""the world is so much better in my corner of Europe.‚Äù Sure, buddy, sure.

It‚Äôs a place where self-awareness is an alien concept and everyone‚Äôs obsessed with calling themselves ""citizens of the world"" while they‚Äôre living in an echo chamber of the most privileged complaints imaginable. Every post reeks of a desperation to feel more European than thou. Yet, they all miss the glaring truth: no one outside of their tiny circle cares, and they‚Äôll still be stuck in their overpriced shoebox apartments wishing they were as cool as their Instagram feed suggests.

I scanned the room and quickly spotted my target among the guests: Andrew Williams, ""heir"" to Crest Group. Twenty-five, freshly returned from studying at England.

He also happened to be the fianc√© of my father‚Äôs eldest daughter, Bella Baldwin. Apparently, the two families had been close for generations, with strong business ties. Andrew and Bella were basically grew up together.

I grabbed a cocktail from a passing tray and approached Andrew from behind, slipping into his blind spot and positioning myself by his side.

He had an air of refined intelligence‚Äîpolished, poised, and far too reserved to match the image of a successor. If anything, he looked more like a freshly graduated college student.

At the moment, he was deep in conversation, his expression attentive as he nodded and smiled occasionally.

Maybe sensing my presence, he glanced at me out of the corner of his eye and, almost instinctively, rested a hand around my waist.

I let out a soft, startled, ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù

He froze at the sound, quickly turning to face me. His eyes widened, and his face flushed as he pulled his arm away. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm so sorry! I thought you were‚Äî‚Äù

Before he could finish, a woman stormed over, her expression thunderous. Without missing a beat, she looped her arm around his as though claiming her territory. It was none other than Bella‚Äîmy father‚Äôs eldest daughter, my half-sister, and Andrew‚Äôs fianc√©e. Until now, I‚Äôd only ever seen her in photos.

I gave Andrew a casual smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Then, glancing at Bella, I offered a polite nod before strolling away.

Bella‚Äôs lips tightened as she adjusted her burgundy Gucci wrap dress, clearly uneasy.

Yes, we were wearing the same dress.

I knew Bella loved Gucci, so I‚Äôd done some research, found out she had bought this exact seasonal piece, and rented the same one. Though she bought hers outright‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt afford to. It cost six figures. Even renting it had set me back an entire month‚Äôs salary, not to mention the matching heels and clutch. I‚Äôd gone all in for this.

The same dress can look completely different on two people. On Bella, with her fuller figure, it was bold and striking, emphasizing her curves.

On me, thanks to regular running and workouts, it highlighted a toned, slender silhouette. My waist, by comparison, was impossibly small.

Bella had paired the dress with a diamond hairpin, a necklace, earrings, and a bracelet‚Äîbeautiful, but a bit overdone.

I wore no jewelry at all. My loose, jet-black hair and red lipstick gave me a simple, natural elegance, making my skin look even fairer.

Bella leaned in to whisper something to Andrew before disappearing toward the lounge. If I had to guess, she‚Äôd gone to change. Women like her didn‚Äôt show up to events without a backup dress.

I was helping myself to some fruit at the buffet when Andrew approached, picking up a few slices of pineapple. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry about earlier,‚Äù he said.

I turned to him with a bright smile. ‚ÄúHonestly, being hugged by a stranger was less awkward than wearing the same dress as someone else.‚Äù I tilted my head and gave him a teasing wink. ‚ÄúDo you think women are too dramatic about these things?‚Äù

He laughed, his boyish smile lighting up his face. ‚ÄúMaybe a little,‚Äù he admitted.

‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù I added, popping a piece of fruit into my mouth. ‚ÄúI came over on purpose to get close to you.‚Äù

His face turned bright red, and he looked completely flustered. ‚ÄúOh, uh‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt get the wrong idea!‚Äù I interrupted with a mock scolding tone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an employee at a venture capital firm, and I heard your group has a big project in the works. I just wanted to chat.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I see!‚Äù He exhaled, visibly relieved. ‚ÄúBut that project‚Äôs already been assigned to LB Investment, one of Nova Group‚Äôs subsidiaries.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that works out perfectly,‚Äù I replied with a mischievous grin. ‚ÄúI work for LB. What do you think? Want to talk business now? Consider it a head start.‚Äù

He raised his eyebrows, amused. ‚ÄúSure. Tomorrow morning, my office‚ÄîI‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù

At that moment, Bella returned, now wearing a pale pink dress. Deciding it was too soon for a direct clash with her, I made my exit. My mission was accomplished.

‚ÄúSee you tomorrow,‚Äù I said to Andrew, flashing him a confident smile.

Before leaving, I picked up a glass of red wine from a nearby table and handed it to him. ‚ÄúThis is a Bordeaux from Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild. It‚Äôs a famous winery, but their wines can be hit or miss‚Äîsometimes amazing, sometimes average. Personally, I don‚Äôt like the coffee notes in the flavor. But paired with pineapple, it might surprise you.‚Äù

Andrew took the glass, pausing for a moment before calling after me, ‚ÄúWait! I didn‚Äôt catch your name.‚Äù

I waved without turning back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you tomorrow.‚Äù

As I exited the banquet hall, I felt someone‚Äôs gaze burning into my back. I turned and spotted the man who had helped me sneak in earlier. He raised his glass to me, a knowing smile on his lips, as though he‚Äôd just enjoyed a great show.

I smiled back, raised a long distance toast in return, then set my glass on a passing tray and walked out without a second glance.",8,1733802280.0,stories,7,1.0,False

I kept tabs on him and spoke with the fellow volunteer who runs a rescue because she was pulling him. I was unsure about adopting but at the very least wanted to foster this lil guy. We just felt meant to be, even if temporary. 
I‚Äôve had dogs and other pets my whole life.
But a year ago, my husband said he wanted a divorce. I reluctantly moved out.. his mother lived upstairs so it made sense for me to be the one who left. I left behind 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 parrots. I took one cat with me because she has special needs, and as I suspected, she now THRIVES as an only child. Those animals were my source of joy. I grieved for months, and volunteering with rescues helped me work through that grief. 
ANYWAY, I didn‚Äôt think a dog fit into my life right now- I live alone with my cat in a small but cute city apartment. 
I‚Äôve been shocked by how easy this dog is. I‚Äôve only ever had larger dogs. This guy is 12lbs and all he wants to do is sleep on my lap. I have to wake him up when it‚Äôs walk time.
I work in a dog friendly office, and he‚Äôs gotten an enormous amount of attention there, and one perfect candidate to adopt him.
The first week, I was certain that I needed to adopt him. It was the first time in a year that I felt warmth and joy again and he and I were having so much fun together‚Ä¶. But my cat is now living her life under my bed. 
He doesn‚Äôt interact with her, but she‚Äôs still upset that he‚Äôs here. She‚Äôs been my #1 this past year and we are very connected so she needs to be prioritized.
She‚Äôs shown no signs of coming around, and I can‚Äôt have her regress to hiding all the time. 
We are now on our 2nd week together and I‚Äôm realizing I CAN let go of this dog. I know it will leave a void, but he has an amazing lady interested in adopting him. And then my cat can have her house back again. 
I‚Äôm not sure what to expect‚Ä¶ how long I‚Äôll miss his presence, or if I‚Äôll immediately think I made the wrong choice and want him back.. 
I won‚Äôt be able to foster another dog, because I don‚Äôt expect to get this lucky with a dog that completely ignores my cat. 
He‚Äôs very fixated on me, which I‚Äôm sure is normal coming from a shelter. If I let a coworker sit with him while I grab a coffee, he cries. So I know I need to get him acclimated to more people so that he thrives with a new owner once we are apart. I‚Äôve loved every shelter dog I‚Äôve ever worked with, but not like this. This guy has cracked my cold heart open. A part of me has been praying that my cat starts to relax and I can adopt this guy.. but cats can take a long time to adapt, and I don‚Äôt think I should prolong the foster period if it‚Äôs all in vain.

1hasred,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hasred/living_with_gastiritis_is_like_playing_a_game/,Living with Gastiritis is like playing a game (life) on the hardest mode,"Two years ago, after COVID‚Äîand I‚Äôm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist here‚Äîbut after getting the vaccine, I developed this crazy heartburn.

I‚Äôve always lived a very healthy lifestyle, so having constant burping and inflammation was very strange. I will admit that during the lockdown, I gained weight and went off my strict diet, which could have contributed to my condition. As an amateur boxer fighting at 70 kilos, I always maintained a healthy weight. However, during COVID, I had a baby and gained almost 15 kilos, which led to depression.

I had an endoscopy and an H. pylori test, both of which came back normal, except for mild gastritis. On paper, it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad, but my life has completely changed. I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore. I‚Äôm currently on a carnivore diet, which has helped relieve some of the symptoms. I start my mornings with bone broth, and for supplements, I take glutamine. I try to avoid PPIs, but some days are unbearable, and I end up taking one.

I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on PPIs. I‚Äôve quit coffee, bread, and anything that causes inflammation. Being into fitness, following a strict diet isn‚Äôt hard for me. However, I live with constant stress because, at night, I often experience pain in my upper abdomen. I‚Äôve had two endoscopies now, and they both show the same results.

I don‚Äôt know if this will ever get better.

I‚Äôm planning to try cabbage juice and cabbage stew with lean meat to see if it helps. However, my mood is always terrible, and every day feels like a struggle. I have brain fog, and I have to push myself just to get to the gym. I‚Äôve heard that PPIs can weaken your bones, and one doctor told me this could be stress-induced gastritis.

But honestly, my life is fine overall‚ÄîI can‚Äôt complain. So why am I so stressed? What can I do to help this naturally? I‚Äôve always had anxiety. Call this a rant or whatever, but I just want to know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to fix this naturally.",1,1733802085.0,Gastritis,2,0.6,False

tl;dr: i am stuck in a loop of substance abuse and ignoring my responsibilities like college and my health even though it matters to me a lot. can't seem to get out of these patterns despite being self aware (at least i think i am).  would appreciate any words of wisdom/encouragement. :) (username checks out, i know üò≠)

i (22F) was an extremely awkward and introverted person during my school years, mostly because of regular ~ teenage girl ~ insecurities and because i felt like i wasn't capable of fitting in. despite knowing that i objectively didn't put in a lot of effort in school, i still somehow got excellent grades and stayed in the top students in my batch. i was proud of myself for pulling that off, but mostly used to credit the same to my luck and good fortune. i was fully prepared to disappoint the people who considered my performance as my standard when it came to being accepted in college, especially because my country has entrance exams for the course i wanted to pursue. but somehow, i managed to secure a good rank and got into one of the top unis in my country for that profession. entering college, i experienced the same loop (not studying enough, freaking out, but still getting by decently). it was literally like i was experiencing school once again, except my confidence in myself had become almost non-existent. i was sure that it was a fluke and my casual attitude will catch up to me when it's time to graduate and i won't have a job, but i was proven wrong earlier this year when i was one of the few people to get placed thankfully. now, i've grown up with education and academic success always taking the highest priority, and considering that i have fared fairly well in that regard, i should feel satisfied with myself.

but it seems like i'm hellbent on ruining whatever i have managed to achieve so far. even when it comes to academics, i have a year left before i graduate and am presently in my second last semester. saying that i did not attend a single class for some of the courses i was enrolled in would not be an exaggeration. i missed most deadlines for submissions and have a research paper due in a couple hours and i haven't even started. i can't understand why i would consciously avoid doing something that is absolutely necessary for me to do in order for me to complete my degree.

and it isn't really just about academics. i always thought that my household was not the best and most positive it could be, but i think i only realised how that's impacted me since i moved out for college. both my parents love their children to death and would do anything for us, but i feel like they weren't equipped to be the most mature and responsible parents, more so my dad than my mom. they would fight, a LOT, and my elder sister and i were active participants, usually as mediators or adjudicators, in the same; it all used to happen in front of us, including the few months they fought because my dad was having an affair, and there are some pretty bad memories that are stuck in my brain from those rimes. my dad has serious substance issues, he was (and still is) an alcoholic and smoker and i've grown up seeing him drink every night till 1-2 am and go to his office the next day. mind you, in his 30+ years working in his position, he hasn't ever had a complaint with respect to his work performance. up until 6-7 years ago, he used to openly smoke in the house and in his room (my mom doesn't sleep with him but with me) and it made the house reek of smoke, until my mom set a very strict boundary. i've seen burnt mattresses, burnt bedsheets, him peeing on the floor of his room because he was too drunk, him passing out half naked while changing.it took me about 4 years, just a few weeks ago actually, to realise how i'd inculcated this behaviour of his (of the substance consumption, I mean) and had began drinking every night as well (both socially and alone). i also picked up the habit of smoking in my first year, funnily enough by taking a cig from my dad's old pack, and it's got pretty out of hand. i don't think i have taken a break from smoking for more than a few days in the last 4 years, and that's only when it was when it was not possible for me to do so. while i did phase out drinking every night for the majority of the time duration (but only because i preferred smoking up lol) this habit made a comeback sometime this year and kinda comes and goes? to summarise, if you couldn't tell, i seem to have raging issues with sustance abuse and consumption.

i just constantly feel like im in a shitty state and that makes me freeze in one spot to the point where i don't tend to a single one of my responsibilities. like, why the fuck am i ranting on reddit right now instead of writing my FINAL paper??? i have been living in a different country for the last few months and will be going back in 2 weeks now because i was doing an exchange semester. that's something i DREAMT of doing as a kid, and it was such an exciting proposition that some part of me thought it was to amazing to be a real possibility. and when i finally got that opportunity, what did i do? stay inside my room 95% of the time (not exaggerating), not attend most classes, make zero friends here, and not explore most of the places that i know for a fact i would love to go to. i just can't seem to understand what the fuck it is that i need for me to feel okay, or even motivated to make myself feel okay.
i know a huge thing that can help is creating a routine; i tried doing that by starting out small and have successfully managed to ensure that i brush my teeth and make coffee afterwards every morning (bare minimum, i know). but then i kind of got comfortabke in this routine and have not made any progress since then lol. 

i think being a bit unorganised when it comes to personal lives, my entire family struggles to some extent. although none of us have been diagnosed, i also do strongly feel that both my parents have neurodivergent traits and can observe them in me and my sister as well. this makes me feel extremely frustrated, because on one hand i want to turn to them to guide me and help me (because i do trust them a lot) but on the other it's like all of the traits i don't want in myself are highlighted in them. my teenage years were spent in the self-loathing, self-pity spiral but now that im in my 20s, it feels slime shirking off responsibility for my own life. there are worse things to happen to people and there are better ways of dealing with them. but despite knowing all that and being consciously aware of how i'm fucking up various different facets of my life, i can't seem to stop. any advice?",1,1733801912.0,self,0,1.0,False

1hasnb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedHealthIsEvil/comments/1hasnb7/my_experience_as_a_provider_services_rep/,My experience as a Provider Services Rep Specialist for UHC - its long but hardly unique or one of a kind,"I was hired in a large group hire in and around 2013. We spent 3 months in training to learn how to provide benefit information, prior authorizations and deal with claims issues with doctors and other health care providers. At this time, some accounts (hospitals, etc) actually had in their contracts that all this would be done by a stateside team only (this is important later).   
I did really well - over the next few years I got assigned to better and better accounts, I earned EVERY quarterly bonus. I was on several special teams - the ICD10 changeover - answering questions on the new diagnosis codes, and procedure codes. Trouble shooting claims. My work was recognized and I ended up on Special Needs team - we were one of the only Provider Services teams that could liason between the actual providers, claims, and families. And this is where I got to see the evils....2018 was the year it all started going south.   
Special Needs families got their own teams because of ""High Utilization"" of their health plans and UHC didn't like it. And the high claims errors were what I spent most of my days dealing with. See, these were processed ""first pass"" thru a computer, then kicked to an off shore claims team that processed in bulk, then it often came to us, to find the errors, make the suggestions for corrections and it went to an on-shore claims team that handled the claims one at a time. It quickly became apparent that the off-shore teams could process CODES but had little to absolutely no idea what the code referenced (""how long with the patient have autism?"" was an actual question).   
Families would have DME (durable medical equipment) requests denied. If they got the mobility device, etc - they would have to fight for repairs, or replacements when it wore out or the child's size/weight indicated they needed a larger or different item. Children grow, you can't expect a specially molded chair seat to work 3-5 years down the line. Doesn't matter how long the code says that item should last. Leg braces, prosthetics, etc. need to be made to fit the new growing person. But every time it would be a huge battle of denied Prior Authorizations, denied claims and incorrect payments if they DID approve the services.    
We won't talk about the issues around ""nutritional needs"" - ie. feeding tubes and formulas....  
If the child requited OT, PT or on going Speech Therapies - PER NATIONAL LAW - those services cannot be capped per year for certain diagnoses. Yes, if you have an injury - 10 visits per year may be fine. But if a child has a chronic debilitating condition - they need year round therapy and any gap can cause that child to stop progress or regress in their abilities. I had 1 family with multiple special needs kids that required multiple therapies per child - the therapists were awesome in providing services even when they had been unpaid for TEN MONTHS - this resulted in 100s of claims incorrectly denied and the family facing a financial crisis (remember Deductibles and Out of Pocket were not being met due to us not paying out and denying claims, so they were paying for thousands of $$ for medications, etc.). I remember getting spreadsheets from their office and having to sort them, track down appeals, records and such over 3 days, and trying to talk the provider down from filing a ""lawsuit"" and reporting UHC. (They've had this happen MANY times and even class action suits, etc.)  
When this happened, it was towards the end of my tenure with UHC. When I started, we had training, were given time off phones to complete work and such. But our team was now being put ""on the phones"" for clients and providers we didn't service (back in the general queue). Suddenly I was given NO time off the phones to complete paperwork, complete required training (from the FED level), etc. My team kept getting smaller, no promotions and no new hires are coming in. I'm often missing my breaks or late for lunch because the phones are ringing non-stop and providers are complaining about long hold times.   
I was getting off shore companies that process claims for big hospitals inquiring on literally dozens of claims (because they didn't have access to the provider's ""portal"" with UHC). Basic claims, but having to repeat claim numbers, procedure codes, payments, over and over. And we were told we couldn't end the call. I remember fearing I would literally have an accident because I had to go so bad, waiting for the end of the call and try to put myself ""off calls"" fast enough to avoid the next one so I could run to the bathroom.   
And then get a text via interoffice system asking why I couldn't wait til my break or lunch some hour or more away.   
I was also working from home. It was a ""priviledge"" to be allowed to work remote. But you should have seen the antiquated equipment they sent us home with. A laptop with non-working battery, two square heavy HP monitors and a phone / headset from the stone age. The first thing all of us did was swap out for a modern headseat to be more comfortable. They did not provide any chair or desk - but we could buy a chair (to the tune of $400-500). I bought a used one for $250 and a versadesk. I remember some days praying for one of the ever increasing tech connectivity issues (at UHC's end) because I lived just far enough, that to drive in would mean trying to find a desk in an ever increasingly empty building would take longer than waiting for UHC to come back online. And the office itsself was near abandoned/empty by 2018. They removed the cafeteria service (no hot food, only 7-11 style stuff), they took out most of the microwaves and fridges and removed all the coffee machines.   
Constantly standing or sitting - it aggravated a back issue. I ended up with migraines from the monitor's flickering. When still working IN office - the building had mold and sewer gas issues and I had several asthma attacks bad enough to have to go to the urgent care at the end of the site's parking lot. This seemed to be very common among teammates working the same building. Everyone wanted to go ""home"".   
2019 comes around. ... I hadn't been able to get approval for a vacation in 3 years. I had used up almost all my PTO on medical appointments. Most days I went to my break 30 minutes late, lunch up to 2 hours late. Of course you get in trouble with Workforce for ""not sticking to your schedule"". Yet at the same time getting messages saying the call volumes are too high and all breaks are delayed, all hands on deck. Even if my supervisor approved time off phones - I'd get IMs from folks I didn't even know, wanting to know why I 'wasn't taking calls' - while dealing with our claims adjusters or a provider offline.   
Then the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend, we are ALL taken off the phones for an important Zoom meeting. The CEO tells us that with the new UHC Portal (a convoluted behemouth of a website), providers don't need to call us to initiate prior authorizations or get benefits, etc. and all claims will be processed thru Optum's OFF SHORE team. Without saying we had 60 days, it was our 60 days notice. We could apply for jobs in other departments but we were ""redundant"" in our current floor. I was referred and recommened for a job in on-shore claims, I attended a job-shadowing mentorship - which the person never wanted to share anything pertinant to the job and finally at the end of the week admitted they had been on a hiring freeze for TWO YEARS at that point.   
Mind you I was doing well - great reviews, all those quarterly bonuses they kept making harder - was still getting them. I have on recording (yes, they record every single phone call) several job offers (jokingly) from providers to come work for them.   
I had put in for a vacation 3 months before this announcement, I was told I was golden. They wouldn't get rid of Special Needs team - we were ""special"" - well we were a pet project of the old CEO and the new one decided it had to go. Our team started shrinking. More and more we were put into the general call queues - East Coast, West Coast - I would lose track of what ""time zone"" I was in on calls. My vacation wasn't gonna happen. I was in contant pain from being tied to a desk literally by a 6ft cable to my headset. I was using meal replacement shakes as my calorie content between calls rather than eating meals - meals that I never knew when I would get to take. I developed Gastiris - like the kind that my doctor says will eventually lead to Gastroperisis. The stress was literally killing me. I quit.   
When I went to turn in my equipment, I had to make an appointment with the supervisor in charge of the site for an exit interview. I sat in at the receptionist desk with a heavy box of stuff and waited an hour. He never came out to see me. Mind you I had an appointment. Finally, I was told to leave the laptop, monitors and security badge at the reception desk and go home. No one from UHC (other than my immediate supervisor who I was in good with) ever bothered to ask or spoke to me.   
I was informed via email that I quit and therefore ineligible to work for UHC or any affiliates for a year minimum. I was not allowed to go to Cigna or Anthem due to ""non-compete clause"" either. ",1,1733801712.0,UnitedHealthIsEvil,0,1.0,False

Musty socks and baking cookies

Our food with burn, and we will panic as alarms go

We turn, and laugh, and smile.



A rumble of conversation and a clatter in the kitchen

Cinnamon and vanilla and incense and cologne

His laptop, my notepad, your pens will stay scattered

The air will be heady with the love we hold



Ill catch your gaze, and it will be so different from the day we met

Who could have known we would end up here

We huff over lighters, catch the dying waves of the sun

Music will drift from inside



Heartbreaks and deadlines and libraries and passion

Socked feet in laps, falling asleep on the sofa

Creaky floorboards and curling smoke

We will be messy and loud and write ourselves into the walls



The future pulses with familiarity,

Burns with comfort.

Cigarettes and laughter and flowing rum¬†

¬†We will smoke the dying ember of our teenage years.



It wont last forever, but for a moment we will spark

Like fireworks that shower the sky with light

A simple moment, my life will be coloured forever

Burnt, marked, scarred by you.



It wont be a clinic

It wont be a grieving husk of a place

It wont be cold

The glow of home will curl across the sofa



Itl be superhero movies and microwave popcorn¬†

And stinky shoes and occupied bathrooms

And stupid jokes and banging on doors

Cigarettes and candles and incense and stoves



Coffees abandoned from late night talks, clothes drying around the house,

Breakfast, lunch, dinner

Mugcakes made under the glow of the stove light

The promise of the future glows.

We've custom-ordered one with an MSRP of $81,875. The dealer gave us an 8.5% discount (including a $2,000 BMW rebate) and a 1.99% interest rate. The initial deposit is refundable. We added rear window shades worth $250 as part of custom build.

Another dealer has the same car and is offering an additional $2,400 off, totaling a 9.5% discount (plus the $2,000 rebate) and the same 1.99% interest rate. The only difference is it has a trailer hitch instead of rear window shades. This pre-built SUV will be at the dealership in two days.

We were counting on the rear window shades as we're expecting a baby in 2025 and thought they'd be helpful.

Should we go for the additional $2,400 off and the trailer hitch, or stick with our original custom order that has got rear window shades?",1,1733801583.0,BMWX5,2,1.0,False

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. in my hotel room, feeling parched. The air from the AC was warm and dry, and my throat was scratchy. I‚Äôd already finished the water from the small black refrigerator, so I decided to drive to a nearby convenience store, about six or seven blocks away, to buy a gallon of water.

When I pulled into the store‚Äôs parking lot, I noticed a man experiencing homelessness sitting on the sidewalk. He had a backpack, a cup of coffee from the store, and a donut resting on the lid. Not wanting to disturb him, I turned off my headlights before parking. For context, I volunteer part-time as a social worker for individuals experiencing homelessness and families with low incomes, so I‚Äôm especially aware of how people in his situation are often treated.

As I approached the store, I saw the door was locked, even though I‚Äôd checked earlier and knew this location was supposed to be open. The man calmly said, ‚ÄúThey locked the door; they‚Äôll open it for you.‚Äù I nodded and said, ‚ÄúOh, thanks.‚Äù Moments later, the clerk appeared, unlocked the door, and opened it.

Before I could step inside, she started yelling at the man, berating him in a degrading tone, and telling him to move. I told her, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not bothering anyone. This is a public space, and he has every right to be here.‚Äù

That set her off. She turned her anger toward me, shouting with even more intensity. I could feel my heart racing and my blood boiling, but I took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I was just sharing my opinion. It seems it doesn‚Äôt matter to you, and I don‚Äôt want to argue. If I‚Äôve offended you, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I bought the water and left. When I stepped back outside, the man was already gone.

It breaks my heart how often people mistreat and misunderstand those experiencing homelessness. Many of them work regular jobs but simply can‚Äôt afford to live in cities with skyrocketing costs. I just wanted to share this moment and remind everyone to show a little compassion.
Thus situation angers me and I am learning to be stoic when I face these situations which I encounter almost everyday.

Maybe we can camp and stare at the milky way together one day.  Or kung tamarin, tara marathon ng kdrama/netflix/true crime docu  
\- Been single since 2018 -so mag 7 years na!- Why? because I had to immigrate to the US and focus on work pero I did date a few times inbetween, wala lang talagang naging solid connection/chemistry.  
\- Follow up answer:¬†>!I have dated and been in a relationship with western girls in the past and yes oo magaganda man sila pero from experience iba pa din talaga kapag pinay.

\- Bonus if you love **one piece**. I'm not huge into anime anymore, pero since 2008 until now, One Piece has been a constant to my weekly routine so it would be amazing to have someone who shares that or at least is willing to give it a try!  
\- Pls be single. I don't mind dating single moms pero if it is messy (the dad is sometimes in the picture sometimes not, or coparenting, etc.) I'd like to avoid it. I've dated single moms before and I don't think people realize that minsan masakit din para sa amin kapag di nag wowork yung relationship, pati yung anak na sa isip mo parang anak mo na din eh mawawala din.

\- Inuna ko yung mga non-physical traits kasi I think I'm at the stage where kailangan mas okay ang chemistry natin kesa sa outward looks PERO I'm lying if I say na wala akong preference:

We‚Äôve been together five years total with a 10 month break in the middle. This month has been rough as we‚Äôve been fighting over everything and this week more so. It‚Äôs taking its toll but we‚Äôve been trying and not giving up. We fought yesterday and today, mostly over dumb things. 
A week ago my ex gf reached out to me. Apparently her bf and her broke up a little while ago and she‚Äôs been having a hard time. She‚Äôs been going to a therapist (really proud of her) and the therapist encouraged her to make amends/get some closure. Her text was simple and a little mercurial. She simply asked how we were, hoped we‚Äôre doing well, stated she was just sending good vibes our way. I asked if she was doing okay and she said she was fine. I told her to take care and if she ever needed help, I‚Äôd do my best. I could tell that something was up and asked around, finding out that her and her ex had separated. Two days after she messaged, I had a surgical operation and have been recovering since. Between the fights and surgery, I haven‚Äôt had it in me to broach this with my fianc√©. I wanted to discuss it with her and just let her know I was concerned and to explain preemptively if I felt the need to check on my ex. My fianc√© has a temper and she doesn‚Äôt have a really healthy fighting style.  We‚Äôre working on things. So this afternoon I worked from a coffee shop and then picked up some food close by. The restaurant incidentally was by my ex‚Äôs house. I messaged a mutual friend of my ex (her best friend) and asked how she was doing. While waiting for a response, I drove by my ex‚Äôs house to see if her lights were on (6:30pm) and they were. I felt a huge since of relief and continued on home. Stopping at the stop sign to check my phone, the friend had texted and said she had been worried about her but things have been better the last few weeks. Feeling better I continued on home and my fianc√© called. She was asking why I was stopped in a neighborhood(she has my location) and I said was texting and am headed home. She kept pushing and I finally asked if it was because my ex lives in the neighborhood. She didn‚Äôt know that and then flew off the handle. I came home and she started yelling and trying to breakup. I sat down and explained everything in this message to her. That I was concerned about someone committing self harm, that things have been awful and so busy the last week that I haven‚Äôt mustered the energy to start another fight. She didn‚Äôt believe me and called my ex and asked what‚Äôs going on. My ex told the truth, explained we had not been conversing but that she had reached out for self growth. That nothing was going on and that she hopes we are happy together. My fianc√© got off the phone and continued berating me, telling me she wants nothing to do with me. I hate that I didn‚Äôt bring it up sooner but honestly, there hasn‚Äôt been a good time and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted at this point. I also hate that I wasn‚Äôt transparent about why I was in the neighborhood. It wasn‚Äôt out of the way on the way home and there was no way to broach it at that point. I mean for fucks sake, I was worried about someone killing themselves. 

Backstory regarding my ex: We were together 6 years and had a tumultuous relationship but ultimately have always maintained a level of care for one another and even a friendship at times. We let go of that friendship due to our significant others but we want each other to be happy. She‚Äôs a good person, we made mistakes. I‚Äôm proud of how we handled things overall.

She is currently seeking the Conservative nomination for the open Parliament seat in the Prairies region. She is a newcomer to politics who is currently serving as a list MP for the Conservative Party.

Our first question, MP Polka, is why are you qualified to serve as MP of the Prairies, considering you are so new to politics?

**Polka:** Well firstly, thank you for having me here today. I wish I could have gained more experience as an MP prior to this election, but unfortunately the Liberal-NDP coalition has been so unstable that since the day after I joined Parliament, Parliament has been either prorogued or adjourned and thus I have had limited opportunities to get anything done. I will note I did participate in the debate of one motion shortly after joining Parliament before the Speaker‚Äôs sudden resignation and have been active in participating in the few votes that have occurred. In addition, I would also like to note that my opponent, MP Jordology, is also a relative newcomer to politics so I do not believe that this should be a major issue in this race.

**Interviewer:** Why are you seeking this nomination?

**Polka:** I am seeking this nomination for many reasons. The first is a genuine care and concern for the Canadian people. I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the chaos and ineffectiveness of my Liberal-NDP coalition colleagues since joining government, and I believe a Conservative majority is needed  in order to actually get anything accomplished for the Canadian people.

I also respect and admire the people of the Prairies. This is a region that is rich in farming and hard-workers, and our government takes them for granted. I want to be their representative to fight for issues important to them and combat the stagnation that has unfortunately befallen Parliament under the coalition.

**Interviewer:** Why do you think you would be a better representative for the Prairies than a member of the Liberal or New Democratic Parties?

**Polka:** Well first let me say I have great respect for my colleague and likely opponent MP Jordology and I genuinely believe we both want what‚Äôs best for the people of the Prairies. However, the last few months have taught us what Liberal-NDP leadership looks like. Chaos, resignations, an absent Parliament, missing Cabinet members, and a nonexistent and delayed budget. Therefore, I hope to help the Conservatives eventually achieve a majority in Parliament so we can actually get to work, working of course with our Liberal and NDP friends, to actually get things done.

**Interviewer:** Now, let‚Äôs do some more interesting questions. What‚Äôs your favorite Canadian food?

**Polka:** I know this is basic, but it has to be poutine. It‚Äôs such a great dish and is such a great example of an iconic Canadian dish that is known worldwide.

**Interviewer:** Coffee or tea?

**Polka:** Tea.

**Interviewer:** Cats or dogs?

They moved in and have the whole living room completely furnished with their stuff. Down to the legend of Zelda book on the coffee table. All decorated to their liking. We have talked to them about moving some of the stuff out or potentially but the girl says it‚Äôs too late and she can‚Äôt move any of the stuff nor move their TV in their room. (We thought this was a good way to make the living room more neutral since our TV is in our room) The TV is understandable but I literally cannot fit any furniture in the living room, not even a 2x2 drawer would fit anywhere.

We are one couple and we live with another. We both split rent.

Since we already talked about it and the girl refused to move any of the stuff. Part of me wants to just get fully mad and say, ‚Äúwe pay half, either move out some of your stuff or we‚Äôre gonna split the living room in half then you‚Äôll have to move A LOT of your stuff out.‚Äù But obviously I don‚Äôt want to stir anything up. But they are not being very cooperative saying they‚Äôre too busy to further discuss it.


They have the couch, TV coffee table, drawer, candles, paintings, shoe rack, poof to sit down when you put on your shoes, Books, Huge circular chairs, 2 chair dinner table, ALL THE FURNITURE IN THE LIVING ROOM IS THERES. We have not so much a single drawer or table. The only thing we have are paintings on the wall.

What do we do?

Edit: I‚Äôm not asking for 50%. I‚Äôm asking for any space so I can make the living room feel more like my house instead of someone else‚Äôs house. More of my furniture such as a display drawer or lazy boy.",2,1733801063.0,roommateproblems,10,1.0,False

anyway! i started a phd in london this past september - it's been great. i've really enjoyed the work, have a really strong relationship with my supervisor, etc etc. i'm a bit younger (i came directly from my BA) and i'm also very new to the city (i moved from ireland) and i think because of those two things, and the fact that i'm generally very quiet and reserved, means that my supervisor has been very ""pastoral"" towards me. he checks in very regularly, has given me his number in case i'm ever in an emergency (he said to call him if i get lost or stuck somewhere üò≠) and has been super proactive in helping me to find academic organisations relevant to my relatively niche field of study and in putting me forward for conferences and other opportunities. he's told me that he does worry about me and he's always checking in to make sure that mentally i'm doing okay.

so i'm set to see him for our final meeting of the year on wednesday and i'm wondering if it'd be weird to get him a Christmas gift? i mean like a fancy box of biscuits and a card lol, not anything insane. i don't really know the etiquette ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è back home our relationships w supervisors were a lot more formal (i guess my uni had a reputation for that tho) whereas here i feel like we've got a more casual relationship - like we just sit and have a chat sometimes and it's nothing to do with work lol. we're meeting for coffee on wednesday. other phds i know at the uni are all a lot more ""experienced"" than i am (they've all come from MA courses, a few have done conferences, are looking at publication etc) and i think maybe don't seem to have the same kind of relationship with their supervisors.

  
i just don't want it to be weird. and in case this comes off like creepy/inappropriate -- it is definitely NOT anything like that lol. but i guess because he's a guy i might be overthinking it, even if he's old enough to be my (relatively young ig?) dad

1. Take Note of Your Triggers - Something I‚Äôve noticed with POTS is that everyone seems to have their own triggers. For me, caffeine is a BIG ONE, probably the biggest one besides alcohol - though it pains me so much to say so. Maybe write down when you notice you‚Äôre having a flare up ‚Äì did you drink an extra coffee that day? Have you been stressed, not sleeping well? Are you about to start your period? Have you drank alcohol? Knowing your triggers is so empowering in that it gives you the ability to prepare for and mitigate a flair up. I try to avoid alcohol, but when I do drink, I drink a glass of tomato juice in between drinks because I think it tastes good and it helps me to replenish the salt and minerals that I‚Äôm losing by drinking.

1. Do exercise that works for you - Obviously, many of us have exercise intolerance because of our symptoms, but we need exercise to condition our cardiovascular system. Swimming is supposed to be great for POTS, but it made me feel horrible, like I was going to pass out whenever I got out of the pool. It was too much for me, but it might be right for you. Pilates is my exercise of choice because it helps me strengthen my muscles and glutes AND most of it is done lying down. Developing the posterior chain is really helpful in mitigating symptoms.

When I am dehydrated and don‚Äôt have enough sodium in my blood, I look like DEATH. My lips shrivel up, get covered in dead skin, and are literally blue and purple around the edges of my mouth. The whites of my eyes turn grey, my nail beds get pale and purplish. Compare to when I‚Äôm hydrated with adequate salt levels,¬†

1. Take Note of Your Triggers - Something I‚Äôve noticed with POTS is that everyone seems to have their own triggers. For me, caffeine is a BIG ONE, probably the biggest one besides alcohol - though it pains me so much to say so. Maybe write down when you notice you‚Äôre having a flare up ‚Äì did you drink an extra coffee that day? Have you been stressed, not sleeping well? Are you about to start your period? Have you drunk alcohol? Knowing your triggers is so empowering in that it gives you the ability to prepare for and mitigate a flair up. I try to avoid alcohol, but when I do drink, I drink a glass of tomato juice in between drinks because I think it tastes good and it helps me to replenish the salt and minerals that I‚Äôm losing by drinking.

1. Do exercise that works for you - Obviously, many of us have exercise intolerance because of our symptoms, but we need exercise to condition our cardiovascular system. Swimming is supposed to be great for POTS, but it made me feel horrible, like I was going to pass out whenever I got out of the pool. It was too much for me, but it might be right for you. Pilates is my exercise of choice because it helps me strengthen my muscles and glutes AND most of it is done lying down. Developing the posterior chain is really helpful in mitigating symptoms.



Anyone else got some tips they‚Äôd like to share? Thanks so much!¬†

1has583,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1has583/need_advice_on_my_boyfriends_enmeshed_familyhis/,Need advice on my boyfriends enmeshed family/his immaturity ,"My boyfriend (M26) and I (F23) have been together for a year and I‚Äôm having some serious doubts about him..

First and foremost, the relationship he has with his family/mother is extremely enmeshed and strange. They seem to have a happy and normal family as an outsider looking in but the reality is much more complex. His mother and father are married but obviously separated. They sleep in separate bed rooms, never go to family outings together and you can just tell they dislike one another. As a result, my boyfriend‚Äôs mother holds on to her adult children in a very unhealthy way. 

My boyfriend still lives at home and sleeps on his parent‚Äôs couch, which isn‚Äôt super attractive to me. He had plans of renting a room off of his older brother/fianc√© but keeps pushing it off and coming up with excuses. His mother wakes him up in the morning, makes him coffee, scratches his back and she‚Äôll even start his car for him when it‚Äôs cold outside. My boyfriend thinks this shit is normal and I can‚Äôt help but get the ick. I‚Äôm extremely independent, live alone, own my house, pay my own bills etc. Ya know, basic adulting stuff. 

He has a good job and makes good money but why would he even try to be an adult if his mother will do anything and everything for him forever? She is extremely attached to him and I can tell she‚Äôs jealous of me, I know she was jealous of his ex as well. I know I‚Äôm villainized behind closed doors for ‚Äútaking him away‚Äù somehow. We can‚Äôt hang out for more than a day or two without his mother calling and checking up on him. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm dating a 16 year old boy. Also, I invite his sister to stuff with my friends sometimes and their mother/whole family ends up coming without an invitation.

I dread the holidays because I know he‚Äôll be there all day whether I come or not. He told me that he‚Äôs opening up Christmas gifts there in the morning and I can come so I won‚Äôt be alone on Christmas. I appreciate it but I‚Äôd much rather go to his parents house for a few hours as a couple rather then opening presents in the morning like children waiting for Santa. 

I love him deeply and he‚Äôs genuinely a great guy but I can‚Äôt stand this strange dynamic and his flat out laziness. We‚Äôve talked about living together at some point but I can‚Äôt commit to that until I see him living on his own and being independent for a while. It‚Äôs kind of a bummer because I see a future with him but not if this continues. I want to start a family and have an equally motivated and mature partner. 

It‚Äôs obvious that our maturity levels are much different and it‚Äôs really weighing on the way I feel about him as a partner. He talks a good game but when it comes down to it, I truly feel that he‚Äôs comfortable getting his bedtime back scratches from mommy before bed and having the luxury of 0 responsibility. I‚Äôve communicated bits and pieces of this to him. It‚Äôs especially hard for me to bring up his mom or his over all laziness, I fear hurting his feelings.

1has53d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1has53d/my_friend_death/,My Friend Death,"I had a very realistic feeling dream last year about possibly my future death..  
  
This dream started with me waking up in what I assumed was my apartment. I appeared to be 4 years older (25 but in real life I was 21 at the time of this dream), And apparently, I was attending an art school like I've always wanted to near the apartment I was staying in. The apartment building had similar buildings it around like a college campus with a courtyard in the middle. (Now I'll say in real life I've never been or seen any of these places other than in this dream)   
  
I walked outside my apartment after getting ready for class and walked across the street where a sign for a bus stop and a lamppost stood. I waited and hopped onto the crowded bus once it pulled up, there was a empty seat that was in the back by the window, so I sat there because I liked spacing out while watching out the window. I went to my classes and then road the bus back home at the end of the day.   
  
For days and for weeks I had the same routine until one cold dark morning when I waited at the bus stop, I noticed a man wearing a brown Irish cap in a dark coat, scarf and sweater standing a foot away from me. He was holding a cup of coffee and looked to be waiting for the bus as well as I, but when I looked at his face I was surprised. This man had no flesh he was just bone...  
  
The man noticed me staring at him and so he started up a conversation with me. ""I'm terribly sorry if my looks frighten you, as you can see looking like this tends to scare people."" He spoke. But strangely I wasn't frightened by his looks I was honestly just thrown off by it. ""I'm so sorry! I didn't mean anything by it I was just curious."" I replied and he let out a small chuckle. ""Do you mind if accompanied you?"" He asked, I was confused but I said that it was fine anyways.   
  
We sat by each other in my usual seat on the bus and just talked until i reached my stop. I was surprised to see that he too was getting off at the same stop, I asked him if he too went to this art school, and he nodded. It turned out he was a new student in my class, so we stuck together for most of the day and chatted some more.   
  
I actually had a blast being around him and so I asked if he wanted to be my friend, he joyfully agreed and we went out to a dinner for some coffee after school. It was dark out by the time we got off at the usual bus stop, and before we parted our ways, he told me as he waved ""I'll see you tomorrow!"" And I replied with a ""I'll see you then!"" And walked back into my apartment to go to bed.  
  
I did see the strange man the next day, and the day after that and the day after that until we had our own routine going. Every morning he'd greet me at the bus stop, ride the bus together, go to class together and hangout (like having movie nights and going out for coffee) after school and then say our goodbyes at the bus stop. I hadn't realized until I met him that he was my only friend at the time and then only person I knew for miles since my family and previous friends lived out of state. I hadn't realized how alone I was without him. Strangely he was the only person I hadn't pushed away or lost contact with, so his presence felt comforting.   
  
This went on for a month until one day something was off. The day started off normal, meet at the bus stop, bus ride together, school, hangout at the dinner for coffee but on the bus ride home he was strangely silent. I felt like something was wrong with him, but I didn't want to bother him because I thought he was probably just tired after a long day..  
  
As we got off at our usual stop, I was about to say my goodbyes, but he interrupted me saying ""I'm very sorry but I'm afraid this is going to be our last goodbye.."". I replied with confusion and worry, ""w-what?.. what are you talking abou-"" But i didn't finish my sentence. He tried to gently grab my hands but I quickly took a few steps away. I was scared.. I was scared but not because I was worried about our friendship I was scared because in that moment I finally realized after all this time we spent together who he really was. He was Death.. The grim reaper himself.  
  
I knew that if his hands came into contact with my flesh I would die in that very moment. ""I'm..IM NOT READY!!"" I yelled running away to the other side of the street. Something in my chest started to hurt causing me to lose all my stamina before I could even make it to the sidewalk. I felt like I was about to collapse but thankfully i saw a lady walking her dog on one of the paths right outside the apartments, so I used what little strength I had to walk towards her calling for help. My cries for help were too quiet for her to hear since she had earbuds in, but fortunately her dog stopped her in her tracks when it heard me fall on my knees onto the concrete pavement.  
  
The woman's dog yanked the leash out from her hand and ran right up to me nudging their nose at me and started giving me kisses. The woman ran over after her dog but before she could make it to me, I started to gently pet her dog because it reminded me of my childhood dog growing up and suddenly, I felt less afraid.. After I was done petting the dog I had noticed there was a hand on mine. It was a cold boney hand..  
  
""I'm glad to have been your friend.."" Death said holding my hands as I took one last teary look at him before collapsing causing me to jolt awake in real life. I woke up with my pillow wet and tears streaming down my face. The poor woman who found my body hadn't a clue of what just happened. After all I was the only who could see him this whole time..",2,1733800094.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

The king of crypto is struggling to find momentum as its price dances between $98K and $100K‚Äîa far cry from its $103.9K all-time high. Is this a calm before the storm or a sign of bearish fatigue? Let‚Äôs break it down!

The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) is flashing warning signs. With the SSR spiking to 18.29, it‚Äôs becoming clear that stablecoin liquidity, which often fuels upward price moves, isn‚Äôt being converted to $BTC. Translation: Bulls are on coffee break while bears tighten their grip. 

Adding to this, the Bulls vs. Bears indicator isn‚Äôt offering much hope either. Both sides have called a truce, with neither making big moves over the last week. If the bulls don‚Äôt wake up soon, we could see $BTC continue consolidating‚Äîor worse, head downward. 

Even the technicals don‚Äôt look good, folks. The MACD indicator has entered bearish territory, signaling weak momentum. If no significant buying pressure appears, $BTC might drop to around $90.6K. A push past $103.5K will require some serious bullish intervention.

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of what this new game expansion would look like:

SETTING OVERVIEW

The game takes place on O ªahu, the third-largest Hawaiian island, known for its urban centers, beaches, and rural areas. The events occur one week after the initial Knox infection. The island is in chaos as survivors scramble for resources and the infected population grows. With limited outside intervention, communication is cut off, and the infection spreads.

NEW LOCATIONS

Towns and Villages
	1.	Haleiwa (North Shore)
	‚Ä¢	A small surfer town with coastal shacks, seafood restaurants, surf shops, and a marina.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: fishing gear, surfboards (for lightweight melee weapons or barricades), and local crafts.
	‚Ä¢	Unique threat: infected surfers still carrying surfboards.
	2.	Laie
	‚Ä¢	Home to a small college and the Polynesian Cultural Center.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: historical melee weapons (clubs, spears), textbooks, and cultural items.
	‚Ä¢	Unique feature: cultural costumes for roleplay and distraction mechanics.

Cities
	1.	Honolulu (Urban Hub)
	‚Ä¢	The largest city, including Waikƒ´kƒ´ Beach, Ala Moana Mall, and high-rise apartments.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: luxury items, firearms from police stations, and tourist gear like snorkels (used for looting in shallow water).
	‚Ä¢	Challenges: High zombie density in resorts and shopping malls.
	2.	Pearl City (Military Presence)
	‚Ä¢	Centered around the Pearl Harbor naval base.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: military-grade weapons, ration packs, and tactical gear.
	‚Ä¢	Unique feature: Military zombies are tougher, wearing body armor that players can loot.

Other Locations
	‚Ä¢	Diamond Head Crater
	‚Ä¢	A scenic hiking location turned quarantine zone.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: survival backpacks, first-aid kits, and improvised weapons.
	‚Ä¢	Threat: Infected hikers in camouflage.
	‚Ä¢	Kualoa Ranch
	‚Ä¢	A sprawling farmland and tourist attraction.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: farm tools, horses (rideable and rare), and seeds for crops.
	‚Ä¢	Abandoned Airport (Dillingham Airfield)
	‚Ä¢	Small planes that could be converted into makeshift shelters.
	‚Ä¢	Key loot: aviation fuel, pilot uniforms, and flares.
	‚Ä¢	Remote Islands (Accessible by Boat)
	‚Ä¢	Small islands like Moku Nui offer secluded survival zones.
	‚Ä¢	Limited resources but safer from zombies.

NEW ITEMS

Guns

Since Hawaii has restrictive firearm laws, civilian firearms are limited to what‚Äôs locally available.
	‚Ä¢	Ruger Mini-14 (.223) ‚Äì Common hunting rifle.
	‚Ä¢	Smith & Wesson Model 10 (.38 Special) ‚Äì Popular revolver.
	‚Ä¢	Remington 870 (12-Gauge) ‚Äì Standard civilian shotgun.
	‚Ä¢	Colt M1911 (.45 ACP) ‚Äì Classic handgun, often kept by military retirees.
	‚Ä¢	Colt AR-15 (.223) ‚Äì Found in police stations and the military base.

Melee Weapons
	‚Ä¢	Spearfishing Gun ‚Äì Can be used as a ranged weapon, slow reload.
	‚Ä¢	Laua ªe Club ‚Äì Traditional Hawaiian weapon.
	‚Ä¢	Machete ‚Äì Found in farming areas, excellent against foliage and zombies.
	‚Ä¢	Ukulele ‚Äì Weak but funny melee weapon.

Survival Tools
	‚Ä¢	Snorkel and Fins ‚Äì Allows faster swimming and underwater looting in shallow areas.
	‚Ä¢	Fishing Nets ‚Äì New fishing mechanic for catching multiple fish.
	‚Ä¢	Portable Solar Panel ‚Äì Rare, but powers small electronic devices.

NEW GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

Tropical Weather
	‚Ä¢	Intense rainstorms and frequent flooding.
	‚Ä¢	Heat and humidity increase the need for hydration and lightweight clothing.

Water Navigation
	‚Ä¢	Boats are now drivable and essential for exploring smaller islands.
	‚Ä¢	Sharks: New predator in deep water, requiring players to stick to shallow zones.

Unique Zombie Types
	‚Ä¢	Lava Zombies: Burned, tougher zombies near volcanic regions like Diamond Head.
	‚Ä¢	Tourist Zombies: Found in Hawaiian shirts, often holding random tourist items.

Infection Isolation
	‚Ä¢	O ªahu‚Äôs geographic isolation creates opportunities for controlling the spread of infection by clearing bridges and key access points.

STORYLINE HOOKS
	‚Ä¢	Radio Broadcasts: Early in the game, survivors hear fragmented broadcasts from the mainland about the infection spreading across the Pacific.
	‚Ä¢	Survivor Groups:
	‚Ä¢	The Island Guard: A militia at Pearl Harbor trying to establish order.
	‚Ä¢	The Surfers: A group scavenging with makeshift surfboard weapons.
	‚Ä¢	The Locals: Resistant to outsiders, heavily relying on traditional survival skills.

Let‚Äôs face it, nobody wants to be the person with bad breath. It‚Äôs awkward, embarrassing, and can seriously dent your confidence. And if you‚Äôre an Invisalign wearer, you might be particularly concerned about the possibility of your aligners contributing to the problem. You're not alone! Many Invisalign users experience a temporary increase in bad breath, often referred to as ‚ÄúInvisalign breath‚Äù. This article will delve into the nitty-gritty of why this happens, how to combat it, and how to keep your breath minty fresh throughout your Invisalign journey. We'll explore everything from proper cleaning techniques to dietary adjustments, leaving no stone unturned in the quest for a confident, sparkling smile. So, buckle up and let‚Äôs dive in!

Bad Breath Invisalign: Understanding the Culprit
------------------------------------------------

Before we jump into solutions, it‚Äôs crucial to understand why Invisalign can sometimes lead to bad breath. Think of your aligners like a cozy little home for bacteria. They provide a warm, moist environment ‚Äì perfect for these microscopic critters to thrive and multiply. These bacteria, as they feast on food particles and plaque, release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). And guess what? VSCs are the primary culprits behind that unpleasant odor. Add to that the fact that Invisalign can slightly restrict saliva flow, which naturally helps cleanse the mouth, and you have a recipe for ‚Äúdragon breath.‚Äù

### The Science Behind Invisalign Breath

Let's break down the science a bit further. Saliva isn't just some random fluid in your mouth; it's like a superhero fighting against bad breath! It contains enzymes that break down food particles and washes away debris, keeping your mouth clean and your breath fresh. When you wear Invisalign, the aligners can impede this natural cleansing process, allowing bacteria to linger and proliferate. Imagine trying to rinse a dish with a lid on it ‚Äì you‚Äôre not going to get it very clean, are you? Similarly, the aligners can trap food particles and bacteria against your teeth, creating a breeding ground for bad breath.

### Common Causes of Bad Breath with Invisalign

Beyond the basic mechanics of bacteria and saliva, several other factors can contribute to bad breath while wearing Invisalign:

- **Poor oral hygiene:** This one‚Äôs a no-brainer. If you're not brushing and flossing regularly, especially after meals, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for bad breath, Invisalign or not.
- **Dehydration:** Remember how saliva is your breath's best friend? Well, dehydration can reduce saliva production, making you more susceptible to bad breath.
- **Certain foods:** Garlic, onions, and coffee are notorious for causing bad breath. These foods contain compounds that can linger in your breath for hours, even with diligent brushing.
- **Dry mouth:** Certain medications and medical conditions can cause dry mouth, exacerbating the bad breath issue.
- **Improper aligner cleaning:** Just like your teeth, your aligners need regular cleaning. Neglecting this crucial step can lead to a buildup of bacteria and, you guessed it, bad breath.

Bad Breath Invisalign: Taming the Beast
---------------------------------------

Now that we‚Äôve identified the enemy, let‚Äôs talk strategy. Thankfully, combating ‚ÄúInvisalign breath‚Äù is entirely possible with a few simple tweaks to your routine.

### Essential Tips for Fresh Breath with Invisalign

Here are some tried-and-true methods for maintaining fresh breath throughout your Invisalign treatment:

1. **Brush and floss after every meal:** This might seem like overkill, but it's the single most effective way to prevent bad breath. Imagine your aligners as a sponge; they can absorb odors and bacteria if your teeth aren't clean.
2. **Clean your aligners regularly:** Rinse your aligners every time you remove them and soak them in a cleaning solution as directed by your orthodontist. Avoid hot water, as it can warp the aligners.
3. **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps stimulate saliva production, washing away bacteria and keeping your mouth fresh.
4. **Watch your diet:** Limit your intake of odor-causing foods, especially during your Invisalign treatment. Think of it as a temporary sacrifice for a long-term gain ‚Äì a beautiful, straight smile!
5. **Use a tongue scraper:** Your tongue can harbor a surprising amount of bacteria. Gently scraping your tongue daily can significantly reduce bad breath.
6. **Chew sugar-free gum:** Chewing gum stimulates saliva flow, helping to wash away food particles and neutralize odors. Opt for sugar-free varieties to avoid cavities.
7. **See your dentist regularly:** Regular dental checkups are essential for maintaining good oral health and identifying any underlying issues that could be contributing to bad breath.

Bad Breath Invisalign: Choosing the Right Tools
-----------------------------------------------

Just like a knight needs his trusty sword, you need the right tools to fight the battle against bad breath.

### Best Products for Combating Invisalign Breath

- **Aligner cleaning tablets:** These effervescent tablets are specifically designed to clean your aligners, removing bacteria and plaque buildup.
- **Antibacterial mouthwash:** Choose an alcohol-free mouthwash to rinse your mouth after brushing and flossing.
- **Interdental brushes:** These tiny brushes can help you clean those hard-to-reach areas between your teeth and aligners.
- **Water flosser:** A water flosser can be a game-changer for removing food particles and bacteria from around your aligners and braces.

Bad Breath Invisalign: Addressing Persistent Problems
-----------------------------------------------------

What if you've diligently followed all the advice and still struggle with bad breath? Don't despair! There are still options.

### When to Consult Your Dentist or Orthodontist

If you experience persistent bad breath despite maintaining good oral hygiene and following the tips above, it‚Äôs crucial to consult with your dentist or orthodontist. They can help identify any underlying issues, such as gum disease or cavities, that could be contributing to the problem. They can also recommend more specialized treatments if needed. Don't suffer in silence; seeking professional help can make a world of difference.

Bad Breath Invisalign: Maintaining Freshness Beyond Treatment
-------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations, you‚Äôve completed your Invisalign treatment and achieved a dazzling smile! But your journey to fresh breath doesn't end there. Maintaining good oral hygiene practices is crucial for keeping your breath fresh and your smile healthy for years to come.

### Long-Term Strategies for Fresh Breath

- **Continue brushing and flossing twice daily:** This is the cornerstone of good oral hygiene, regardless of whether you're wearing aligners.
- **Regular dental checkups and cleanings:** Professional cleanings help remove plaque and tartar buildup that you can‚Äôt remove at home.
- **Stay hydrated:** Water is essential for overall health, including oral health.
- **Maintain a healthy diet:** A balanced diet contributes to a healthy mouth and fresh breath.

Bad Breath Invisalign: Embracing Confidence
-------------------------------------------

Bad breath can be a real confidence killer. But, with the right knowledge and tools, you can conquer ""Invisalign breath"" and enjoy the journey to a straighter, healthier smile. Remember, you‚Äôre not alone in this! Many Invisalign wearers experience this temporary side effect, and it‚Äôs entirely manageable with a proactive approach.

Construction worker
Not scared of much 

I thought this might be a possibility down the road but brushed it off until last night. 

I found myself running and hiding on the edge of some wooded area near a small road at night. A very evil and twisted background music was playing. This Nightmare had ITS OWN SOUNDTRACK!!! Now that‚Äôs a first.
It was very dark, super dark with a street lamp or something. Just enough to see. I was absolutely petrified and knew exactly what I should be scared of. The demon monsters from FROMVILLE‚Ä¶

And I didn‚Äôt have to wait long before I turned around a group were smiling at me. One had a cowboy hat on and another was a lady dressed old fashioned but I didn‚Äôt recognize any from the show. I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about the show or I would have found this amusing instead of terrifying.

Soon more and more slowly walked towards me and just stared and smiled. Suddenly I had the bright idea that they will only attack if I talk to them or say something. I don‚Äôt know where this came from but I carefully walked past them trying to be quiet. 

Out of nowhere, an entire parade of old fashioned but young ladies with red and white dresses, fancy hats and holding candles began running very fast up the road. They were perhaps celebrating or singing. They were on a mission like a parade or something. Like 20 of them flew right past me and I thought wow that was close until the last one grabbed me!! Then I woke up at 4:30 am with a terrible feeling of impending doom and terror. I made coffee and just stayed up until work at 8 am.

It was definitely in my top 10 worst nightmares of all times.

At **Alive Church** in Pooler, GA, we host a **family game night** on the first Friday of each month. It‚Äôs a wonderful opportunity for fellowship, snacks, and board games with friends and family. As a veteran gamer, I love introducing new players to a variety of games, and this event is perfect for sharing my passion.

While I enjoy competitive wargames, our game night caters to everyone, from casual board gamers to fans of classic parlor games‚Äîor those who simply want to socialize over coffee. This month, we had **three tables of games in action**, each offering something unique.

**Games Played This Month**

**1. Catan: Majorca**

https://preview.redd.it/kwanxiq2qx5e1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14af47bc4d68008dd6bdd571198a0a150d63892f

  
This version of the classic *Settlers of Catan* is played on a historical map of Majorca, a beautiful Spanish island. According to Board Game Geek (BGG):

""This map represents one of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca (or Majorca)... Rules apply like normal Catan, and like Catan Geographies: √ñsterreich the map can be played with up to 6 people.""

If you haven‚Äôt tried *Catan Geographies*, I highly recommend it for a fun twist on the classic game!

**2. Yahtzee**

https://preview.redd.it/0tuo27hgqx5e1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8803dceb93d985a132edb9a8eb4838756eed416

  
The timeless parlor game was another hit this month. First published in 1956, *Yahtzee* remains a fan favorite for its simplicity and luck-based thrills. BGG describes it as:

""A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.""

This game is perfect for players who prefer quick, straightforward gameplay.

**3. Flash Point: Fire Rescue**

https://preview.redd.it/1pz5yprkqx5e1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88517f66d5f2bdf620b70a5160d07c8f20938064

  
This cooperative game is always a crowd-pleaser. In *Flash Point*, players work together to rescue victims from a burning building. From BGG:

""Flash Point: Fire Rescue has two versions of play: basic and expert. In both, players aim to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging fire.""

The two players at this table had a blast and are already looking forward to next month‚Äôs game night.

Please help me understand what I'm doing wrong. I'm trying to clarify broth for a clear matzo ball soup. Here are my steps:

1. Make a stock. I've been putting a whole chicken in my instant pot with water, celery, onion, and garlic.

2. Strain the stock.

3. Let the stock cool. I've let it sit for up to an hour. It's not getting cold, but warm. Maybe ~130F.

4. Beat 3 egg whites until foamy. I'm not getting them to peaks, just foamy.

5. Mix egg whites into stock. I barely do this. 1 small swirl of the spoon.

6. Heat over medium heat. I've done this for 10-20 minutes.

At this point, I've been told a ""raft"" will form that can be scooped off. Well, every time I do it I do get egg whites at the top. I also get them stuck to the bottom of the pot. And the sides of the pot. And much worse - I get a TON of fine bits of scrambled egg whites that are just floating in my stock. If I turn off the heat and wait a lot of them will settle near the bottom, but they are still suspended in the liquid. And I absolutely cannot get them out. If I strain the liquid with a fine mesh strainer, the fine scrambled egg whites just flow right through. If I use a folded cheesecloth then the stock trickles through so slowly that it would seriously take 4+ hours to strain. If I use a coffee filter it's even worse, it slows to less than a steady drip.

So now, instead of clean broth, I have broth that is filled with scrambled eggs. Tonight was supposed to be matzo ball soup, and instead we had McDonald's üò≠ Please help me, what on earth am I doing wrong!?",3,1733799483.0,Cooking,3,1.0,False

1harxc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPS/comments/1harxc7/reporting_daughters_daycare_to_cps/,Reporting daughters daycare to CPS,"Hello,

My wife and I recently pulled our infant daughter from daycare due to a troubling complaint inspection. 

A former employee of the in-home daycare (who was since fired) complained with our state regarding the owner/provider regarding something we are unsure of at this time.
The inspector came, and before the inspector arrived, the owner/provider instructed an unreported and unapproved adult to remove an infant from the daycare to hide from the inspector because there were too many infants. My wife and I have an infant daughter and we IMMEDIATELY pulled her from daycare upon reading this. We fear she was the one who was removed from the daycare in the providers attempt to deceive the state inspector. We are grateful the inspector caught her.

We have called the state and regional offices to try and find out more. Unfortunately, they can‚Äôt reveal anymore than what they have in the report. We have since been able to get in contact with the employee who lodged the complaint that got fired to see if she knows if it was our infant daughter who was removed. We are meeting her for coffee tomorrow to find out what more she knows.

My question: do we have any case to report the provider to CPS? Or would that only be a case if we got confirmation that it was our daughter who was removed from the daycare. Our blood has been boiling, we‚Äôve lost sleep, and our anxiety is through the roof over this. Plus the added stress of finding a new daycare in the middle of winter for infants is very difficult, and of course, we are dealing with the fallout of being ghosted by the provider since we believe we are entitled to our 4 week security deposit.

And the thing is is that even if he says all of that, not a lot of people are going to believe him.I know a lot of people haven't been watching them, but some of the livers have said the exact throughout this past year. But of course, nobody believes them.

And why is that?

Well obviously it's because trust has been lost on both the company and even some of the livers.

We've seen in the past whenever the livers would say certain things about the company, they would then get contradicted by either ex-livers or other pieces of information.

""We can just fucking ask for our play button""

There's not been a case of that actually happening, plus Michi's story showed us how much of an iron grip Nijisanji has on those play buttons.

""Selen had our personal information on some documents""

They were legal documents. A court of law isn't going to refer to you by your stage name of course.

""Selen asked for permissions on the Last Cup of Coffee MV way too late""

That's not true as it was confirmed by both Lilypichu and her producer that they signed those legal documents a couple months beforehand. Plus it was actually all for the strange and petty reason of asking permission on having to use characters the company themselves own.

""Management is very supportive in our endeavors""

Doki, Mint, Michi, Kuro, Mata, Sayu, Reza, have all said otherwise.

Plus you have the very disingenuous way some livers have handled their PR statements during the previous termination events. Armchair in his videos talking about them said it the best:

Don't harass anyone. Selen recorded me behind my back for a year.

Don't harass anyone. Zaion gaslit Finana and fought with Xsoleil.

Don't harass anyone. Selen was going to dox us.

All of which has led to massive harassment campaigns against the both of them, one of which was actually doxed and nearly driven to suicide because of it.

In the end these PR statements, whether intentional or not, all became calls for harassment under the guise of 

""Don't harass anyone""

It all has just come across (at least to me) that Nijisanji EN is only a family, until it's not.

So with all that said, that explains why some people may not at all be that confident in what the livers have to say. So I ask, what do you think both the livers and the company can do to bring back public trust again? Is this just a mission that only the company can accomplish if they tried? What could the livers themselves do to earn back your trust?",33,1733799288.0,kurosanji,42,0.8,False

‚ÄòMaybe one day you‚Äôll figure out what I actually want,‚Äô Sally says and finds her bra underneath the bed. ‚ÄòYou do know what a clitoris is, right?‚Äô

‚ÄòI‚Äôm not stupid.‚Äô Stubborn to the end, George lights an incense stick and dabs the match out between his fingers. ‚ÄòIt sounds like an exotic Italian savoury dish.‚Äô

They met a few years ago at Bombay Rock, a popular venue located in Brunswick. It was Retro Night and Sally spotted him near the bar dancing to Depeche Mode‚Äôs I Just Can't Get Enough. In tight jeans and a denim jacket, his charming smile persuaded Sally to catch the No.19 tram back to his flat. Indeed a sliding doors moment.

‚ÄòFor your information, it‚Äôs not a fucking Italian dish.‚Äô Bored by the usual outcome, Sally slips her bra back on and laments the bad sex. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm starting to question the future of our inglorious relationship.‚Äô

‚ÄòHello Earth calling Mars, remember our vows.‚Äô George shrugs his shoulders and lights a cigarette. ‚ÄòFor richer, for poorer, and until death do us part. You get the gist of it.‚Äô

‚ÄòThe only ring I‚Äôve gotten from you is suffer-RING.‚Äô Sally replies and watches George push his luck. ‚ÄòI still don‚Äôt see a diamond on my finger.‚Äô

In a perpetual rut, George hasn‚Äôt worked a day since he nearly bankrupted the Department of Finance. An extra zero in front of the decimal point ruined his career. An accountant with fat fingers, he‚Äôs made one too many monumental errors, and now a tarnished reputation precedes him. Mud sticks and nobody wants to employ the dickhead.

 ‚ÄòCan you hear the noise? They‚Äôre coming to take you away.‚Äô George puts his jeans on as a police car siren blares in the distance. ‚ÄòExcessive nagging ought to be a criminal offence and punishable with imprisonment.‚Äô

‚ÄòHave you got rocks in your head?‚Äô Sally replies and storms out of the bedroom. ‚ÄòPerhaps, your sexual performance has been flagged for an involuntary Section Ten intervention.‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äô a quick response adds to George‚Äôs indefensible guilt. ‚ÄòI am the Italian stallion.‚Äô

Shattered dreams in the boulevard of broken promises has Sally and George residing in a one-bedroom rental flat on Munro Street. A sign of the times and indicative of their socio-economic reality. Meters from the living room locals mingle while they wait for the No.512 bus and the rowdiness keeps George on his toes. An all too normal scenario and nobody seems bothered.

‚ÄòIf they try and break-in, I‚Äôll knock their blocks off.‚Äô Unconcerned, George grasps tight onto the baseball bat that he keeps beside the front door. ‚ÄòThe Neanderthals are literally at the gate.‚Äô

‚ÄòYou couldn‚Äôt kill a fly,‚Äô Sally states the truth as she separates the dirty clothes into loads.

Vindictive at heart, she pours triple the recommended amount of fabric softener into the washing machine. Her desire for soft clothes takes precedence, and George‚Äôs adverse reaction to the chemicals does not matter. Domestic bliss in modern-day suburbia has him scratching the itch.

The instant relief draws blood and for a moment, life ain‚Äôt so bad. He plonks himself into the armchair, kicks his feet onto the coffee table, and cracks open a cold Melbourne Bitter. The beer has no fish bones in it, and he‚Äôs got nothing to complain about.

‚ÄòDon‚Äôt forget to hang the washing,‚Äô Sally swings her handbag over her shoulder and grabs the house keys from the kitchen table. ‚ÄòDid you hear what I said?‚Äô

‚ÄòHang the washing.‚Äô George repeats and watches Sally walk out the front door. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not deaf and while you are out, buy me a packet of chips.‚Äô

‚ÄòThose two long things attached to your body are called legs.‚Äô Sally replies and slams the door shut. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre made for walking.‚Äô

Sally gives the rowdy idiots a piece of her mind and steps onto the No.512. A brave move and the thought of escaping the madness crosses her mind. She flicks through countless Instagram reels and the algorithm bombards her with an alternative fantastical reality. 

One step to the left on Retro Night and Sally for better or worse, would be living a different life today. Anything is preferable to her underwhelming life and to feel alive in a dead world, she fare evades her way to work. A minor victory and the Melbourne pastime continues unabated.

A few years older than her work colleagues Sally is labelled a relic by the Gen Zedders. She loathes the new generation and to keep the peace tolerates the rhetoric. Their youthful enthusiasm rekindles her desire to rewind the clock, yet she spends hours churning through George‚Äôs endless flaws.

‚ÄòNo fucking way,‚Äô George squirms at the image and cracks open another beer. ‚ÄòI would never have guessed.‚Äô

Once known, it cannot be unknown and the perennial cockys tounge stars him in the face. Unsure exactly what he‚Äôs looking at, George closes the webpage and lets denial work its magic. Better to believe it‚Äôs an Italian dish and one after another the beers go down. Why drink one beer when he can have ten?

The No.512 bus carries Sally away from the chaos of Munro Street and an uncertain future awaits. Familiar Coburg landmarks fade into the distance and she rides the bus into the sunset. There‚Äôs no chance she‚Äôs buying George a packet of chips, let alone returning home, and with a smile on her face forgoes work. A better life awaits on the other side of the Yarra.

The End.

My work includes a hierarchy of power where you have to act a certain way to get where you want (promotions and progressing up the ladder). Make yourself look good and show off the improvements you‚Äôve made for the sake of the business/corporation.

I‚Äôve been working hard showing my worth and will soon be promoted but I‚Äôm so sick of being around these people. I have nothing in common with them. I feel myself caring less and less about this promotion and unknown to them, don‚Äôt intend on staying in the company all my life.

Now the people themselves are toxic. From treating anyone below them like sh*t, to using their position in the company to do less and less. They like to have digs at me since I‚Äôm in fairly good shape and am quite extreme with my diet (10 eggs a day, loads of red meat, no cheat meals). Meanwhile they chuck down a full pack of donuts with their sandwich and coffee full of sugar. 

I used to be close with the other managers on my team, however when I like to make every minute count and keep myself working they don‚Äôt mind standing around doing f*** all. They don‚Äôt mind giving me the harder jobs either as they know I‚Äôll get it done.

I also treat everyone with the same respect, from the cleaners to the big bosses, which is almost frowned on when managing. I know some company to work for right. 

Guess I‚Äôm trying to see if anyone feels like I do in which the more disciplined I become with physical and mental training, diet/nutrition and work ethic, the more I‚Äôm struggling with being at that place and around those people.

It might just be me going crazy and I don‚Äôt want to make myself sound like the perfect person. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm damn better than I was years ago however and am proud of my progress but obviously still have a lot to learn and more adversity lined up in the future. (I‚Äôm 23 btw).

On top of this there was an extra $320 dollars changed for gratuity. is this normal? I tipped the gentlemen who cleaned our room $100 the day we left the ship because we was very friendly and would always open our cabin door when he saw me carrying one of my kids.

It it normal for Carnival Cruises to tax an extra $80 per person at the end of your trip? I wouldn't have cared if they were up front about it or just included it in our ticket price but to charge it two days after we returned was pretty sleezy",0,1733799103.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,29,0.44,False

Room was large and spacious. Breakfast that came with it was good. My problem has to do with the cleanliness of the room.

The bathroom toilet seat had hair and yellow urine spots from the previous guest. Called the front desk and asked them to send housekeeping. 30 minutes pass and nobody showed up. Girlfriend went to the desk to say something again. They showed up this time 5 minutes later and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù the bathroom in a few seconds. After going back to the toilet, the very hair and urine stain we complained about were still there. We had them come back and had to basically point it out. Girlfriend ended up taking some of the cleaning solution and paper towel so we can do our own cleaning.

This led to us looking a little more carefully than we normally do. Hair was in the sink. Hair on the lotion bottle hanging on the wall, soap bar marks on the soap holder, soap stains on the floor. Drops of coffee or something on the floor near the kitchen. 

I have pictures of all of this that can be submitted with the complaint as well. Just not of the toilet seat as I didn‚Äôt think of it until after the fact. 

Question is basically in the title. Who is the best to reach out to for this type of complaint? The stay is over and they didn‚Äôt have any other rooms available to switch us out. ",3,1733798494.0,Hilton,4,0.8,False

1hark64,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hark64/struggling_with_jealousy_i_guess_in_my/,Struggling with jealousy (I guess?) in my bestfriendship,"Hi All!
I (early 20s F) am having a problem involving my relationship with my best friend (also early 20s F). We have been friends for over 5 years and currently live together.
My issue is I struggle with jealousy in regards to our upbringing, and living with her has made it worse.

To make a VERY long story short, my entire family sucks, and I have next to no support system, I never have. My family has sucked since long before I was born, and something about me makes them act worse. My family has always been upper low class/VERY low middle class. I grew up very poor, sharing 1 bedroom with my 2 opposite sex siblings, my mom was single and worked 2 jobs, pantry was always next to empty, etc. I had a very rough go of it due to my financial limitations and my family's views and beliefs of what made a good kid.

My best friend on the other hand, has almost never dealt with anything like that in her life. When she was extremely young, her mother was single and not doing well financially, but they quickly found their footing and have been more than financially stable for well over a decade. Her general family is also extremely well off. She spent most of her childhood VERY high middle class/ lower high class. Her family is very bonded to each other, and they go very far out of their way to care and love each other. 
It is SUCH a foreign concept to me... 

Ever since moving in together, its painfully obvious how different our financial circumstances were. I moved in with a dining table and coffee table I purchased from FB marketplace that were falling apart, and any and all of my kitchen gear I thrifted. The same goes for all of my clothes, all of my bedroom furniture, my decor, I purchased it all myself. I've also done nothing but work full time since I began senior year.

She on the other hand, purchased next to nothing to prepare for move in. Her family gave her anything and everything she may need. Real wood antique furniture sets, armoires, boxes and boxes of kitchen supplies, large mirrors and paintings. Almost all of the furniture in the shared spaces is hers, and she still has additional furniture and boxes in her grandparents storage unit. She was able to go to school, and worked on and off part time until very recently, when she dropped out of school, got a certificate, and now works full time.

With the holidays rolling around, it's been especially hard to try to stifle my jealousy(?). She came home with 3 full boxes of just Christmas ornaments and decorations she and her family have collected over the years. Expensive glass baubles with intricate designs, ceramic scenes, and every ornament she made as a kid. I have nothing. I don't have a single ornament I made as a kid, I don't have a single piece of decor. nothing.

I have VERY severe anxiety, so I'm usually overly critical as a person. I don't mean to be, but that is how I show my love as that is how I was shown love when I was young. It's very hard for me to be excited about Christmas, a holiday focused almost entirely on family. She loves christmas, and her family has so many traditions and things they do for the holidays. And whenever she shows me her trips or the new advent calander they purchased her, it's so incredibly hard for me to be excited or happy, because it just reminds me I will never have photos like that. 

I fully recognize this is an issue within myself and I do what I can to silence that critical part of myself but, I just wish she would try to keep in mind that myself and my fiance (who is also living with us) have very, very poor associations with the holidays. For us, the holidays are a reminder of all that we never had as kids and all that we'll never have as adults. It really really sucks, but at this stage in life, we're both still very much processing and unblocking those traumas. 

I don't really know my exact reason for posting, maybe just to feel heard. Apologies for this being vague, trying to maintain privacy. Please leave any advice you may have.

Thank you!

1harg8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1harg8b/new_to_the_gym_need_advice_feel_like_im_not/,"New to the gym - need advice, feel like I'm not making progress","I'm 34yo, 5'3 and was not an average gym-goer for basically my whole life. I was 115-125 my whole adult life, until I was 28 and started an antidepressant that caused weight gain and got up to 150-155 in the span of 3-4 months. I quit the antidepressant, but gained more weight during Covid and was up to 175lbs when I moved to NYC in June of 2022. The walking lifestyle helped a lot, and I got down to 160 without much effort in the first year (April 2023). 

Then, I had a manic episode last summer where I was drinking a lot but eating very little, and got down to 145 by August 2023. I cut way back on drinking and maintained this weight until I started an antipsychotic  that causes weight gain in December 2023 (I have bi-polar type 2). 

I then broke + sprained my ankle badly and couldn't walk for 6 weeks in January 2024, had a major depressive episode in the spring, and started drinking more again until August 2024, when I took a break from drinking entirely for a few months. I didn't weigh myself for basically all of 2024, but I'm pretty sure I definitely got back to 160 by the end of August, if not higher.

THEN - I started a dedicated fitness journey Nov. 17th of this year (not quite a month ago). I began going to the gym every day (except a few when I traveled for a weekend and was sick for a couple days) and getting in 8-10k steps/day. 

Since I'm new to working out, I've been doing a simple routine - started with 15, then 30, and now 40 min of cardio (cycle, elliptical, or treadmill), and pretty basic strength training:

* Shoulder press, (start 10lbs, now 20lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Abdominal crunch, (start 30lbs, now 50lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Seated leg press, (start 60lbs, now 85lbs), 3 sets of 15
* Bicep curls, 10lbs, 3 sets of 10
* Lat pull-downs, 30lbs, 3 sets of 10

I didn't weigh myself before I started, unfortunately - if I did I might realize I actually made some small progress. I weighed in Dec. 3rd at 159lbs, and then today Dec. 9th - still at 159lbs...

I use MFP and have a goal of 1200cal. If I exercise, it says I'm allowed an additional 180-300 cal depending on the day. I try not to eat back all of this, but I do 2-3x week. I no longer have a drink every day, and on the days I do (3 days a week max), it's 1-2 instead of 3-5+. 

I typically don't eat until 1pm aside from coffee w/oat milk, have a 500-600 cal lunch, a 200cal protein bar as a snack, and a smaller dinner (usually 300-400 cal), or honestly sometimes skip dinner and have maybe a few saltines if I'm not very hungry. I count any alcohol calories I consume.

Anyway, there have definitely been some days where I've eaten back all of my exercise calories plus 100-200 more, and I've had 2-3 cheat days since starting this, but still never consumed more than 1800 calories on those days. I also quit the meds causing weight gain (planned with my doctor), started tapering Nov. 10th and have been completely off of them since Nov. 25.

I can definitely tell I'm getting stronger, I'm able to lift more and spend more time doing cardio, and feel better overall, so this is progress I'm happy about. 

I know I'm not perfect, BUT-- I would think I would have seen more than 1-2 lbs of weight loss by now, almost a month later. Well, it's been 3 weeks I guess, so maybe I'm expecting too much. My body doesn't look much different than when I began. I also could have been closer 163-165lbs when I started but my scale didn't have batteries until recently, so who knows, haha.

This subreddit has been so inspiring, and I would just love some advice/reassurance - am I starting off on the right foot? Am I building a little muscle, which weighs more than fat so maybe this is why I'm not shedding pounds? Am I expecting too much too soon? Do I probably need more time for the medication to exit my system and stop affecting my metabolism? I lost weight so quickly last summer, but I was basically starving myself and I also wasn't on the weight-gain antipsychotic. 

I'm trying to do things the right way this time! I'm so proud of myself for starting the gym habit, but while I'm nearly positive I'm not going to give up, I feel a little at risk of getting discouraged and stopping, or not going nearly as frequently. Any tips on gym routine or eating habits are so very much appreciated. Thank you for reading!",2,1733797941.0,PetiteFitness,1,1.0,False

I was too busy admiring the way the Filipino sunrise painted the mountains in shades of purple and gold, too distracted by how beautiful she looked preparing breakfast on the veranda of her family's colonial home. When she kissed me on the cheek and watched me drink, her amber eyes seemed to glow with an intensity I attributed to love.

I should have known something was wrong weeks before, when she first invited me to meet her family in the Philippines. Two years of long-distance dating, and she'd only ever agreed to video chat at dawn or dusk, Manila time. The nightmares started immediately after I booked my flight ‚Äì vivid dreams of flesh tearing like wet paper, of wings unfurling from human backs, of hearts still beating in open air. I blamed travel anxiety, even when I woke up tasting copper.

The village outside Quezon City was exactly as she'd described it ‚Äì lush, humid, with houses nestled between banana trees and birds of paradise. What she hadn't mentioned was the emptiness. No children playing in the streets, no neighbors chatting across fences. Even the stray dogs kept their distance from the family home, though I swore I could hear them howling at night, their cries cutting off abruptly mid-wail.

Her mother, Elena, greeted me with an embrace that made my skin prickle. She held me too long, her nose tracing a line from my collar to my ear, inhaling deeply. I felt like a wine being sampled, assessed for its bouquet.

""Welcome, James,"" she said, her accent thick but her English perfect. ""We've heard so much about you."" Behind her stood Susannah's grandmother and two aunts, all of them tall and elegant like my girlfriend, with the same high cheekbones and unusual amber eyes. They watched me with an intensity that made my skin crawl, like cats tracking a wounded bird. Later, I would understand they were watching to see if the change had begun.

Those first few days, I noticed my sense of smell growing sharper. Every morning and evening, they prepared elaborate meals ‚Äì always insisting on serving me themselves, always watching me eat with those predatory smiles. The meat had a strange, gamey flavor I couldn't place, and sometimes I could swear it was still warm, as if it had been alive moments before reaching my plate. Each bite made me feel stranger, more alert, more... hungry.

My gums started to ache. My back itched constantly, especially at night. When I looked in the mirror, my own eyes seemed different ‚Äì darker, with flecks of amber starting to bloom in the irises. I blamed it on jet lag, on the unfamiliar food, on anything but what it really was.

The house itself seemed alive at night. The locked cellar door that no one would discuss. The way the local villagers crossed themselves when we passed by. The strange, coppery smell that permeated the halls after sunset, like old pennies or fresh blood. And the sounds ‚Äì God, the sounds. Wet, slithering noises in the walls, scratching above the ceiling, and sometimes, what sounded like distant screaming. My new heightened senses made it all unbearable.

It was on the fifth night that my own transformation began. I was following Susannah, my curiosity finally overwhelming my growing dread. The moon was full, casting everything in a sickly white light. From my window, I watched her walk into the banana grove behind the house, her white nightgown ghostly against the dark foliage. She stopped in a clearing and began to twitch.

The sight should have horrified me. Instead, I felt a deep resonance, as if my own body was remembering something ancient and terrible. I watched, transfixed, as a wet, tearing sound split the night ‚Äì like someone ripping apart raw chicken. Susannah's torso separated from her waist, intestines dangling like obscene ribbons, glistening in the moonlight. Wings erupted from her back in a spray of dark fluid, unfurling like some hellish butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. When she turned, her face was no longer human. Her jaw had distended, filled with rows of needle-sharp teeth, and her eyes glowed like hot coals in a dead fire.

My own spine cracked audibly as I watched. The itching in my back had become unbearable, and I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pressing outward. I stumbled backward, knocking over a vase, and the crash brought instant silence, then the sound of wings.

Susannah floated through my window, her intestines swaying gently like seaweed in a current. Behind her, three more figures rose into view ‚Äì her mother, grandmother, and aunt, all in the same horrific state of bifurcation. Their lower halves stood like empty clothes in the clearing, while their torsos floated on massive, leathery wings. The air filled with that chittering laughter I'd been hearing in my dreams ‚Äì the same sound that had been building in my own throat.

""The change is already starting,"" she said, her voice a raspy version of its usual melody. ""We've been feeding you our essence for days. In our saliva, in our food, in every kiss. We're mananangal, aswang, the hungry ones. It runs in the family, passed from mother to daughter... and sometimes, to those we choose to keep.""

Through the window, I could see her family members floating in the yard, their eyes burning in the darkness. Elena called out, ""The final transformation must be shared through a ritual as old as these islands. Not all survive it, of course, but Susannah thinks you're strong enough. The fact that you're still alive after drinking our essence proves it.""

""I don't want to lose you,"" Susannah whispered, her inhuman face inches from mine. ""And I don't want to have to kill you. Please don't make me choose. You're already halfway there ‚Äì can't you feel it?""

I could. My teeth were lengthening, pushing outward. The skin along my spine was splitting, and I could feel something wet and membranous trying to spread. I looked at her clawed hand, then at her face ‚Äì that strange mixture of the woman I loved and something ancient and horrifying. Two years of love and trust warred with primal terror. But then I remembered all the little things that now made sense: her strange hours, her intense protectiveness, the way she always seemed to know when danger was near. The way small animals disappeared whenever she visited me in the States.

Something moved in the cellar window ‚Äì a pale face pressed against the glass, mouth open in a silent scream. I thought of the missing villagers, the strange meat at dinner, the screams in the night. Yet even that knowledge didn't repulse me anymore. Instead, I felt a new hunger stirring.

""What happens now?"" I asked, my voice changing even as I spoke, becoming something inhuman.

She smiled, revealing rows of teeth that went far too far back into her head. ""Now we complete what we started. The ritual requires... preparation. And I'm sure you must be very hungry by now.""

As she led me outside to her waiting family, my skin began to split along my waist. Had I made a terrible mistake? Or was I about to become something magnificent and terrible? Either way, as Susannah's family circled above me like vultures, their wings blotting out the stars, I realized it was far too late to change my mind.

In the distance, a rooster crowed, but dawn seemed impossibly far away. Susannah's grandmother descended, carrying something that writhed in her clawed hands. The smell of fresh meat made my new teeth ache with anticipation.

""Let's begin,"" she said, her voice thick with hunger. ""And remember, dear James ‚Äì try to scream quietly. We wouldn't want to wake the neighbors. Though soon enough, you'll be the one doing the hunting.""

As they closed in around me, their shadows merging into one, I couldn't tell if the pounding I heard was my heart or drums from the village ‚Äì a death knell or a celebration. Perhaps both. Susannah's eyes met mine, filled with equal parts love and predatory anticipation, and I realized that sometimes love means not just accepting all parts of someone, but becoming something entirely new yourself.

The transformation was already burning through my body like acid in my veins. Whether this rebirth would be my salvation or destruction remained to be seen. But as my spine began to split and wings pushed through my shoulders, I found myself smiling with teeth that were no longer my own.",10,1733797347.0,nosleep,3,0.92,False

I tried keto before and it melted my weight in just 2 weeks, reached my goal in two weeks time. Really not fat back then just trying to slim down.

Now 6 years later at 30, at 177.5 pounds with hormonal imbalance, probably insulin resistance. I tried everything that used to work when I was younger, and all is not working this time. From portion control, fasting, walking for an hour, cardio, weights, lowering down my cortisol & making sure I sleep 8-9 hours. 

My weight just wont drop, not even 1 kilo. My waist will fluctuate between 35-36 inch but that's it. This has been going on for 3 years since I had hormonal imbalance. The thing is I can easily go up but never down. üòû 

So my last hope is keto but it's not working the same. Back then I'll be in ketosis by the third day, and will lose 2-3 kilos a few days in.

 It's now day 6 and I have not experienced keto flu yet, have not lost even a pound, even my measurements are the same if not more. Have not experienced water loss either, which seems everyone of you have experience.

I do exactly what I did back then, no processed food, or keto treats. Just meat, chicken, eggs. I will have black coffee with full cream, a teaspoon of coconut oil and one gram of equal gold. I might have a cucumber, or a tomato every other day but that's just it. This is my diet on repeat. I'm a little dirty keto, like the first time I did it but  I'm sure I don't go over 20g of carbs a day.

My supposed to be intake is 1450 calories but I'm quite sure I'm not even reaching that because I'm not hungry. I only it twice with 1-2 coffees a day, no snacks. I naturally fast more than 12 hours.

I don't know what's happening I'm panicking now. Keto is my last resort. If keto will not work I don't know what else will. I'm very frustrated right now.",3,1733797140.0,xxketo,2,1.0,False
1har6bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/healingspirit/comments/1har6bb/navigating_loss_how_grief_changes_relationships/,Navigating Loss: How Grief Changes Relationships and Seven Ways to Rebuild Connections,"Introduction:
 When a partner dies, or a marriage ends in divorce, the changes in our relationships often extend far beyond the immediate absence of that person. Friendships can take on new forms, as some people might not know how to support you or might feel uncomfortable confronting the rawness of your grief. Others may unexpectedly step forward, offering a depth of understanding and empathy you didn‚Äôt anticipate. These shifts can feel destabilizing, as the loss you‚Äôre experiencing isn‚Äôt limited to your partner but ripples out into the network of connections that once surrounded you. How you relate to others, and even yourself, can feel unfamiliar and sometimes isolating.
Family relationships, too, can undergo significant change during these times. For some, family may become a critical source of comfort and stability, stepping in to fill emotional and practical voids. However, for others, family dynamics may grow strained as differing perspectives on grief, divorce, or the responsibilities that come with loss emerge. You might find yourself questioning the roles you once played in your family or feeling the weight of expectations that don‚Äôt align with your healing process. Navigating these complexities requires patience with others and a commitment to honoring your needs as you rebuild your life.
One of the most profound shifts occurs in your relationship with yourself. Losing a partner through death or divorce often challenges your sense of identity, leaving you to reevaluate who you are without the defining presence of that person in your life. Questions about your future, priorities, and even your sense of self-worth can arise in ways you may not have anticipated. This daunting and transformative journey allows you to rediscover parts of yourself that may have been overshadowed. While the path can feel overwhelming, it also holds the promise of resilience and renewal, allowing you to forge old and new relationships on a foundation of authenticity and mutual understanding.

 
1. Shifting Priorities in Friendships
Think about your closest friends before your loss. Were they the ones you laughed with over shared memories, who knew every part of your daily life? Now, you might notice a gap‚Äîa silence where there was once constant chatter. After losing a partner, your priorities naturally change. Conversations or gatherings that once brought joy might now feel hollow, and some friendships may drift.
But here‚Äôs the thing: friendships can be rekindled. I remember a friend telling me how she hesitated to call her closest confidant after her husband‚Äôs passing. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù she admitted. Yet when she finally picked up the phone, her friend confessed, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if you wanted to talk to me.‚Äù That simple moment of honesty healed months of misunderstanding.
What can you do? Start small. Send a text saying, ‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù or invite them for coffee. Open up about how your priorities have shifted and ask for their patience. Sometimes, friends need guidance on how to be there for you.
 
2. Family Roles and Expectations Evolve
Family. They‚Äôre the ones we expect to be there no matter what. But grief can complicate even these bonds. Maybe your sister calls more often, expecting you to open up while you feel drained and unable to share. Or perhaps a cousin you barely spoke to now wants to step in as your primary support system, leaving you overwhelmed.
I remember one woman I spoke with whose family insisted she host the next holiday gathering, as her late husband always did. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of filling his shoes.‚Äù In moments like these, it‚Äôs okay to draw boundaries. Grief changes what you‚Äôre capable of, and families must adjust, too.
What worked for her? She talked to her family, explaining what she could and couldn‚Äôt do. Instead of hosting the gathering, she suggested they all meet at a restaurant. She honored her limits and their desire to stay connected by proposing an alternative.
 
3. Strained Romantic Relationships
If you‚Äôve begun exploring new romantic relationships after loss, you might have discovered how complicated this path can be. There‚Äôs no roadmap for loving again while carrying the weight of grief. For some, new relationships bring guilt‚Äî""Am I moving on too quickly?‚Äù Others find it hard to open up to a partner who didn‚Äôt know their late spouse.
A dear friend once shared her struggle with this. She met someone wonderful years after her husband‚Äôs death but found herself hesitating to talk about her grief. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want him to feel like he was competing with a ghost,‚Äù she said. Yet when she finally shared her feelings, her partner surprised her by saying, ‚ÄúI want to know every part of you, even the hard parts.‚Äù
The lesson here? Vulnerability can strengthen new love. If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, consider counseling to navigate these emotions together. Love doesn‚Äôt replace grief‚Äîit grows alongside it.
 
4. Isolation from Social Circles
Grief has a way of pulling us inward. It‚Äôs as if the world keeps spinning while you‚Äôre frozen, struggling to catch your breath. I‚Äôve heard countless people say, ‚ÄúI feel like my friends have forgotten me.‚Äù And while that may feel true, often the reality is different: they‚Äôre unsure how to help or fear saying the wrong thing.
I know someone who sent a simple message to her friends: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm struggling, and I‚Äôd love your company. Could we have dinner together next week?‚Äù That gesture brought her friends back into her life, and she realized they had been waiting for her signal.
Reconnecting takes courage, but it‚Äôs worth it. Reach out with a specific invitation or suggestion, like a movie night or a walk. Your friends want to support you‚Äîthey need to know how.
 
5. Navigating Work Relationships
Returning to work after a loss can feel like stepping into another world. Colleagues might avoid you, unsure of what to say, or worse, bombard you with questions that feel invasive. It‚Äôs common to feel like your grief has become an unspoken elephant in the room.
One man I knew shared how his boss‚Äôs casual comment‚Äî""You‚Äôre back now, so everything‚Äôs okay, right?‚Äù‚Äîleft him reeling. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to respond,‚Äù he admitted. Eventually, he found his voice, explaining to his manager, ‚ÄúGrief doesn‚Äôt end‚Äîit evolves. I‚Äôm here, but I‚Äôm still healing.‚Äù That honest conversation reshaped their dynamic.
If you‚Äôre navigating work relationships, remember that you set the tone. Share what you‚Äôre comfortable with and keep professional boundaries intact. At the same time, don‚Äôt hesitate to lean on colleagues who offer genuine support.
 
6. Spiritual Relationships May Deepen or Shift
Loss has a way of shaking our spiritual foundations. Some people find solace in their faith, while others question everything they once believed. A woman I met at a grief support group described how she had stopped attending church after her husband‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúI felt betrayed by God,‚Äù she said. Yet she found a new sense of spirituality over time through meditation and quiet reflection.
Your spiritual journey is yours alone. If traditional practices no longer resonate, explore alternative paths‚Äîyoga, mindfulness, or joining a different faith community. And if you find comfort in your beliefs, lean into them with others who share your perspective.
 
7. Developing a New Sense of Independence
Finally, grief often forces us to grow in ways we never anticipated. You may find yourself handling tasks your partner once took care of, from managing finances to fixing a leaky faucet. This newfound independence can be empowering but isolating, as it changes how you relate to others.
One widow I spoke with described feeling proud and lonely after learning to handle her household independently. ‚ÄúI miss having someone to share the load with,‚Äù she confessed. Her solution? Joining a volunteer group, she met others who understood her journey and appreciated her skills.
Independence doesn‚Äôt mean going it alone. Surround yourself with supportive people who celebrate your growth while offering companionship.
 
Conclusion:
 
Grief reshapes how we interact with the world, not just with the person we‚Äôve lost but with everyone around us. In moments of profound loss, it‚Äôs easy to feel like life is happening to you, as though you‚Äôre a passive participant in the shifting tides of relationships. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that you can take control of these changes. While others may not always know how to treat you in your new circumstances, you can help guide them by being honest about your needs and boundaries. Even when it feels vulnerable, communication can pave the way for understanding and connection.
Taking small, intentional steps can make all the difference in nurturing your relationships during this time. Reach out to those who matter most to you, even if it feels awkward or unfamiliar. Invite a friend for coffee or join a support group where people understand the emotions you‚Äôre navigating. These gestures may seem small, but they are potent acts of reclaiming your agency and building a community that aligns with the person you are becoming. At the same time, permit yourself to let go of relationships that no longer serve you, recognizing that not every connection will survive the transformations brought on by grief.
Healing is not a solo journey‚Äîit‚Äôs a shared process that thrives in the presence of understanding and support. By fostering open communication and intentional reconnection, you rebuild relationships and discover new depths of resilience within yourself. People may not always get it right when approaching you during this vulnerable time, but by showing grace and guiding them honestly, you create space for mutual growth. Your grief may have altered your relationships, but it‚Äôs also an opportunity to deepen and redefine them to honor who you are now.

A Prayer for the Newly Single and Their Community of Support.

 Loving God, We come to You with hearts full of trust and hope, knowing that You see the brokenness and loneliness that often accompanies those newly single. Lord, You know their hearts, their struggles, and the burdens they carry. We ask that You wrap them in Your boundless love and comfort, reminding them they are never truly alone, for You walk with them through every season of life.
Heavenly God, grant them guidance as they navigate this new chapter. Help them to see Your hand in every step they take, leading them toward healing, growth, and the blessings You have prepared for their future. Teach them to lean on You for strength and to trust in Your plan, even when the path ahead feels uncertain or overwhelming.
Lord, we also pray for the friends and family of those who are newly single. Stir within them a spirit of compassion and unwavering support. Help them to see the needs of their loved ones, to listen with open hearts, and to show kindness in both small and significant ways. May they become a reflection of Your love, offering encouragement and companionship to those who need it most.
Father, remind us all of the power of community, the beauty of friendship, and the sacred responsibility we have to care for one another. May those who feel alone find solace in the relationships You have placed in their lives, and may those around them be vessels of Your grace and mercy.
We lift this prayer to You, trusting Your divine wisdom and infinite care. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

1har61a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Owala/comments/1har61a/smoothsip_for_commuters/,SmoothSip for Commuters,"Hi! I‚Äôve been interested in getting a coffee cup for the new year, hopefully to cut down on the amount I spend on coffees daily @ school^^ 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of great reviews of the owala smoothsip slider, and was curious how people felt about the temperature retention & how leakproof it is - because I would like to use it for both iced & hot coffee, and because my commute to uni is a little over an hour, I‚Äôd like it to be able to withstand not spilling in my backpack when I walk to/from the station.

Thanks! :)",3,1733797068.0,Owala,3,1.0,False

1har55y,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1har55y/cant_stop_attracting_annoying_men/,Can‚Äôt stop attracting annoying men ,"I don‚Äôt necessarily mean attracting in a sexual/romantic way btw. Anyway I went to a meet up 2 weeks ago at a cafe. It was mostly ppl I already knew, some I didn‚Äôt. This guy I hadn‚Äôt met was there named Justin. He was talking to another girl about a Facebook witch group and I asked him to add me to it. He couldn‚Äôt find me on fb (I have it locked down) so I was like no prob, I‚Äôll add you. Big mistake. As the evening went on, it became more and more obvious that this guy was extremely annoying (wouldn‚Äôt shut up, poor social skills, oversharing, an obvious desperation for closeness, making fun of me for how I talk). So he messaged me later about this event I mentioned to him and I sent it to him thinking that would be the end of it. Then he replied and I didn‚Äôt open the message, in fact I just deleted it. Then he messaged me again and I saw something about ‚Äúdont want to make assumptions‚Äù so I opened it. It was something like ‚Äú?. I don‚Äôt want to make assumptions, maybe you‚Äôre just busy and couldn‚Äôt respond to my last message.‚Äù The message was gone and I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about so I just left him on read. Then today he sends me some thing about how we‚Äôre adults, I shouldn‚Äôt leave him on read, he thought that the coffee meet up was for making friends and I was making him feel like he was being weird. It pissed me off so I said ‚Äúyou are being weird lol, I‚Äôm a busy adult. Blocking you, bye‚Äù and followed suit. 
I probably should‚Äôve just replied the first or second time he messaged me, but I really hate this sense of entitlement with basically strangers to reply right away. It really sets me off when I don‚Äôt know someone and it‚Äôs always guys who do this shit.  I thought I had made my peace with the annoying ppl in the group or knew where to avoid them, now I need to avoid another place lol. ",5,1733796996.0,rs_x,7,0.69,False
1har52v,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1har52v/would_you_be_ok_if_influencerscustomers_took/,Would you be ok if influencers/customers took videos and pictures of you at work?,"I got a barista position at a trendy Japanese coffee/matcha chain. A new store just opened and they invited an influx of influencers to the store opening to make promotional content. However, I'm seeing a lot of stories and posts featuring barista's faces at work, or of them pouring latte art.

Call me sensitive, woke and ugly, but I find it incredibly offensive that a million dollar corporation would do this as a marketing campaign ‚Äî featuring it's minimum wage workers online without permission, or at least giving them free food or paying them extra (they are not). This chain rarely does photoshoots or promotions, and instead relies on user generated content. 

I don't know why it's so normalized to take photos of anyone for social media content, especially if the content will be online for a very long time or if permission is not granted. Would y'all be okay with this, would someone have to ask you first? ",16,1733796988.0,barista,13,0.95,False
