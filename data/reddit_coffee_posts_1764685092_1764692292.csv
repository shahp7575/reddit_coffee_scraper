My HF started in 2013 when I was 23. I was in the midst of my senior year and looking back it was an anxious time. I was masturbating more frequently as a form of stress relief and one night I experienced a sudden shooting pain during climax and my dick immediately went limp and numb. For several days I had no sensation at all, which put me even further into an anxious state. Slowly some feeling returned, but I had the classic HF symptoms: numbness, reduced sensation, hanging left, tight and rubbery, etc. 

I didn’t masturbate for more than a year, my libido was shot and I was terrified I’d injured myself. But though the total numbness went away, the other symptoms remained and I haven’t been the same since. It’s caused a lot of despair and frustration, issues connecting sexually with partners, and overall loss of joy and constant frustration around sexual expression of any kind (I was a virgin when this started, so my entire sexually active years have been impacted by this). 

I’ve had a few times where the symptoms were noticeably better, but those have been few and far between, but looking back I’ve noticed those tended to be the periods where I felt less anxious and more fulfilled. In 2022, I had random complete vanishing of HF symptoms and total return of sensation and sexual performance like I was 17 again, seemingly out of nowhere. This lasted 2-3 weeks, and then my symptoms returned. It made me realize this must be able to be fixed after having essentially given up. 

That started me on this journey I’ve been on the past few years, learning a lot more and exploring potential solutions. But nothing has fully worked and my symptoms have persisted, some getting worse. 

I’m not giving up, and feel more confident than ever that it’s possible to recover. So I’m using this thread as a record of the practices I’ll be implementing strictly over the next 6 weeks or so. I’m using this to keep me accountable and share my experience with the community in case I find success.

**MY SYMPTOMS**

Some of these have worsened or improved in fluctuations over time, but my current symptoms are:

* Clenching and pain in the pelvic floor and abdomen
* Tightness in the hamstrings/glutes
* Pain and clicking in right hip flexor
* Occasional rubbery feeling in penis with loss of size
* Occasional soft glans
* Difficulty feeling like I’ve “got everything out” during urinaton/defecation 
* Erectile dysfunction 
* Occasional pain during sex
* Reduced sensation, especially when fully erect
* Hollow feeling in penis
* This seems to be unique to me, but one of my biggest issues is inability to climax from intercourse - the sensation just doesn’t seem to be enough to excite my brain to get there, and it feels like my muscles just clench and quit on me, cutting off blood flow

**WHAT I’VE TRIED SO FAR**

In the early years I’d sort of given up and just hoped it would go away in time. I saw a urologist in the early years and he was useless. Ultimately saw a much better urologist in the past few years - he confirmed I did not have Peyronie’s and did a penile ultrasound which showed nothing wrong. So this just confirms the HF diagnosis and pelvic floor connection as opposed to any sort of penile injury.

After my 2022 3-week period of random total recovery, I dove back into research to see how I could get back to that.

I learned that this was a pelvic floor disorder. The more I learned the more clear it became. Overactive pelvic floor. I remembered that as a kid I would occasionally get a shooting cramp through my pelvic floor that would bring me to my knees, but go away quickly. It makes me wonder if I’m genetically inclined to pelvic floor hyperactivity, as I know I’ve also always been a “worrier” and deal with both anxiety and OCD. 

In 2022 I purchased and strictly followed a pelvic floor recovery program focused around stretching and yoga-style poses for men. Did this faithfully for months, but nothing changed. It might have even gotten worse. 

Then I found [hardflaccid.co](http://hardflaccid.co), who presented the argument that it’s diet related and caused by candida infection in the prostate. So, I purchased and followed his diet routine - essentially a very strict and stripped-down keto diet. After 4 months of this, I did find some improved blood flow, and I was able to climax from sex a couple times, but overall symptoms remained, particularly tightness and pain in the pelvic floor, legs, back and abdomen - the clenching didn’t seem to lessen much. So while there was some limited success, it was not a cure for me and actually created new anxiety around eating the wrong thing, hyper fixation on meals, and as such did not seem to be the answer. 

I was also doing some basic exercises daily, and have been doing almost daily stretching for months. But in the midst of this and the diet, I discovered John Sarno’s work around TMS, and a lot of that resonated - this did seem to be a mind-body disconnect, a physical expression of emotional/nervous system disorder. The constant clenching seems in line with this. So I read several books and have listened to Nicole Sachs' podcast and done some limited journal speak, but still no “cure.” 

So while I think the mind-body/TMS diagnosis and research is still highly relevant, I also think I need a physical routine because after more than 12 years, there’s no way my surrounding muscles haven’t atrophied and weakened significantly. 

This led me to Ben Calvit’s routine, which I’ve just recently started and plan to continue as I think it addresses a lot of the key weaknesses associated with HF. 

**STARTING NOW**

Having tried all of the above and then some, spent countless hours engaging with podcasts/YouTube videos and reading everything I can on the topic, but still to have symptoms has led me to where I am today. 

Since everyone’s body is different, and since several of these approaches have yielded results for some people but not others, I’ve decided to try an experiment. I will be doing several of the above approaches in combination for 6 weeks:

1. TMS/Mind-Body. I’ll be doing Nicole Sachs’ Freedom From Chronic Pain program to focus on the mental/emotional element to this. I do believe that freeing the nervous system is a significant factor in healing HF, and at the very least I get to work on personal development with this program. I’ve personally seen a lot of growth from talk therapy and exposure therapy over the years, so will keep leaning into this as a vital element of healing.
2. Ben Calvit’s program. I’ll do a personalized version of the workouts and stretches he’s shared that helped him work through his HF. I absolutely am convinced I need to strengthen my core, glutes and legs as they’ve weakened over the years and I can physically feel that.
3. Diet. Because diet has a significant impact on the central nervous system and mental health, I do think a healthy diet helps in many ways. So I’ll be doing a keto/mediterranean diet, keeping it very strict when at home and expanding it a bit when traveling or eating out as needed. 
4. No nicotine.
5. No porn.
6. Masturbation limited to once every other day (or less).
7. No weed.
8. Minimal caffeine (tea, decaf coffee).
9. Minimal alcohol (socially only, low carb only).
10. 8.5mg tadalafil daily.
11. Red light therapy (5-10 minutes per day in pelvic floor region).

Below I’ll put the exact exercises I’m doing. I plan to follow all of this strictly for 6 weeks and see how I feel from there. I will be doing weekly check-ins here. I want to treat this as rehab, doing what I can and living my life as best outside of that, so I won’t be doing daily check-ins as I don’t want to hyper fixate on how I’m feeling.

Please share questions and thoughts, advice on what’s worked for you, etc. I’m a mixture of skeptical and hopeful, and hope this can at least be a resource for folks in their own journeys.

It has been three years since the bosses entered their “creative outburst” phase.

The old-timers are already used to betting on how long it takes for newcomers to discover the bosses’ relationship—and how their worldview shatters when they do…

But when Jeremy Fitzgerald arrives, he gives them a particularly surprising twist.

Jeremy is assigned to the technical department, though he originally applies for a security guard position.

Strangely, from the very start of his internship, Jeremy shows a curious familiarity with animatronics. He sometimes blurts out insights that usually come only from long-term exposure.

When HR asks about it, he stammers something about working at another mascot restaurant where the machines weren’t maintained properly, and the place shut down quickly.

This excuse obviously doesn’t hold water, so HR reports it to the bosses—Henry and William.

“What’s this employee’s full name, then?” William asks with feigned casualness, while Henry pretends to study other company documents, his expression stern.

“Jeremy Fitzgerald,” HR replies.

“Leave Mr. Fitzgerald’s file here. We’ll discuss it. You may go,” William says.

“Good work, sharp eye,” Henry adds with a smile, offering a word of praise.

Once HR leaves and closes the door, William turns off the office surveillance system. Henry, meanwhile, pours two cups of coffee for them both.

“So… the Bite of ’87 victim?” Henry asks, pulling out a hidden whiteboard marked with a timeline—events from their previous life.

“Yes. I intend to place him in the technical department, keep him close, and head off any leaks,” William says, flipping through Jeremy’s file and sipping his coffee.

“Leaks? Even if he talks, people will just think he’s crazy.” Henry chuckles, shaking his head. Then, changing the subject slightly: “As for technical skill… I doubt simply being chased by ghost children teaches you much.”

“Henry, we used to have entry-level staff help fix broken kit,” William says, sounding awkward.

“…Did we?” Henry replies, his voice tinged with embarrassment and faint surprise. Three years later, he’s forgotten much about how they treated staff in their past life—or rather, after losing his daughter back then, he stopped caring about such details.

“We did. Which means the lad probably has some basic mechanical skills. He’s worth cultivating,” William insists, turning to the HR observation notes and passing the file to Henry.

“You’re right. Put him in the technical department. I’ll inform HR about our decision.” Henry scans the papers briefly.

“Good. Then I’ll have Michael keep an eye on him—maybe get him talking. Young people speak the same language; we can simply say you asked him,” William says, refilling both their cups. He’s grown oddly considerate lately.

“I should talk to him myself. Your terrible ‘dad’ attribute only subtracts points, it doesn’t add them. I’ll be more convincing,” Henry retorts, sipping his coffee.

William sighs after a long drink. “You’re right. You handle Michael. I’ll deal with HR about Mr. Fitzgerald.”

⋅⸝⦙⨳⦙⸜⨗⟶⧗⩃⋆⧿𖤓⧾⋆⩃⧗⟵⨗⸝⦙⨳⦙⸜⋅

One day, while Michael is helping in the technical department as usual, Henry calls him into the office.

“What’s up?” Michael sits opposite Henry at his gesture.

“If you have time, I’d like you to keep an eye on Jeremy Fitzgerald—see if he has past-life memories. You’re closer in age, so you won’t scare him off.” Henry’s voice is soft, without any command behind it.

“…If he’s the Bite of ’87 bloke, I worked with him for a few days in the last life. He’s a decent one.” Michael’s tone is dry. For him to say that, the man must have been outstanding. “You could just ask him. He’s a terrible liar.”

“Are you sure you want him to face William?” Henry presses.

Michael sighs, rubbing his brow. “…Fine. I’ll help.”

July 7th. Jeremy’s first day at work.

HR leads him into the office for introductions, then to the newcomers’ lounge. Inside waits a familiar figure.

Brown hair. Blue eyes like burning fire. Dark circles under his eyes, a world-weary scowl paired with strikingly fine features. A white shirt with the faint outline of a red undershirt beneath the sunlight streaming through the window. Blue jeans. Red sneakers.

“This is your senior mentor. Introduce yourselves—I’ll leave you to it,” HR says, excusing themselves and leaving the two in awkward silence.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Jeremy Fitzgerald. You can call me Remy,” Jeremy says brightly.

“All right, Remy. I’ll walk you through today’s work.” Michael accepts the nickname without protest—very unlike him.

Jeremy blinks, realizing after a moment that Michael is speaking to him. “Oh, right. What should I do…?”

“First off, training. Here’s the safety manual.” Michael tosses him the booklet, catching Jeremy’s surprise at the word “training.”

“What’s with the face? Do we look like some dodgy outfit that chucks you in without it?” Michael crosses his arms, one eyebrow raised.

“N-no, it’s just… I never got training at my past jobs. That’s all.” Jeremy’s stammer is unconvincing.

“Every job? Unlucky.” Michael isn’t fooled. This guy definitely remembers.

…

From then on, Jeremy’s cracks start showing everywhere.

When asked to crawl through a ventilation shaft, he accepts without confusion.
When they enter the animatronics’ rest room, he freezes stiff at the sight of Chica.

When dismantling a machine, he works with practiced ease, hardly needing instruction.

When left alone, he mutters, “It’s supposed to be like this… no, wait… this isn’t the same…”

And above all—

“Michael, how do I do this?”

“Michael, I need help.”

“Mike, is this right?”

Michael never tells him his name. But in their last life, he once said: You can call me Mike.

…

At lunch, after buying food together at a convenience store, Michael finally asks, “Remy, I haven’t actually introduced myself. Name’s Michael Afton. How’d you know my name before I said it?”

Jeremy almost chokes, fumbling for an excuse. “Ah, your nametag… unless you prefer something else?”

“…Sharp eye. Mike’s fine,” Michael says evenly.

But it’s too late. The more Jeremy tries to cover, the more obvious it becomes.

By day’s end, Michael lays it all out:

“First—you didn’t question the ventilation crawl.

Second—you dismantled animatronics without guidance.

Third—you called me Mike.

Fourth—you’re shocked we have lunch breaks.

And fifth—most important—you clearly remember the bird biting into your skull.”

Jeremy pales. “…Who else remembers?”

“Anyone who died in the restaurant, we reckon.” Michael shrugs.

“That’s… cruel,” Jeremy murmurs. “I guess they need trauma therapy, same as me?”

“Exactly.” Michael slings his bag over his shoulder. “The bosses will know soon enough. Forget about packing it in.” He rolls his eyes and leaves Jeremy staring blankly at a water bottle.

…

That night, Michael comes home to find William and Henry at the dinner table.

“Well? How’d it go?” they ask in unison. Henry chuckles; William smothers a laugh.

“He remembers as well. Case closed.” Michael is exhausted.

“You won’t coax him a bit more? We could even put you in for a pay rise,” William frowns.

Henry shoots him a disapproving look.

Michael sighs. “If you like, pay me out of your own pocket. Otherwise Accounts will think I’m some nepotism case. I’ve no interest in being the parachuted boss’s son.” Not taking free money would be idiotic, he thinks, but he won’t trade away his comfort for it.

“Deal,” William says instantly.

“Deal,” Michael mutters, flipping him the finger before heading to his room.

Henry rubs his forehead. “Fine. We’ll leave it for now. Once Jeremy stabilizes, we’ll approach him ourselves.”

“Agreed,” William nods.

…

Meanwhile, Jeremy wanders the streets, forcing himself to act normal—helping old folks cross, returning a ball to children—before going home.

At dinner, he cheerfully tells his family small happy stories from the day, as though he hadn’t been rattled at work.

He washes his own dish, changes clothes, showers, and finally lies in bed staring at the ceiling for three hours.

“…So it wasn’t a dream after all.”

This post is about something I discovered, which might help another beginner (who also suffers from migraines) to keep a consistent practice (or at least keep ""the streak"" of days going)

I've been searching for a way to get rid of migraines. I had some partial success by just gazing at the aura, trying the ""claw hand door technique"" from Don Juan's not-doing exercise. But still couldn't clear it out fully. 

I got the migraine aura the other day and I was so mad that I was gonna miss 2 days of tensegrity, I said right, I'm gonna do it now. I got up and made my usually intent to reach the double.

Why are you going back to school? How often do you work? What are your career plans? And on and on. So basically just personal question after question.

If anyone here has been through something similar or just wants to grab a coffee or join a small meetup, I’m open to it. I’m just trying to rebuild a social life that actually feels healthy.",1,1764691432.0,punemeetup,3,1.0,False
1pcc8uv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcc8uv,Buffy's Comicverse Jobs,"We know Buffy worked at several places on the show- >!Helen's Kitchen, Magic Box, construction, Doublemeat Palace, and the high school.!< But if you include the comics her résumé is even longer. I've listed and rated all the other jobs I can think of.  (There are probably more, I haven't read everything)  

Dark Horse canon comics

**Golden Touch Casino, coat check** Before moving to Sunnydale Buffy and Pike went under cover to investigate vampire activity at a casino in Las Vegas. They should not have hired a 15-year old or had her wear that uniform. But she's only there one shift. 1/5

**Popsicle Parlor, cashier** After Buffy spends all her money to pay for damages caused by slaying, she gets a job at the Sunnydale mall. The boss is ripped. And evil. He summons a ice demon thing. The last we see Popsicle Parlor it is frozen over. But she did earn enough money for a dress. 2/5

**Pick Me Up, waitress** While Buffy lives in San Francisco she works as a waitress at a coffee/bookstore.  She describes this as the best job she's had to date. And it seems like their attendance policy is flexible.  4/5

**Deepscan, bodyguard** Kennedy offers Buffy a job at her security firm. It goes sideways pretty quickly. It's just not for Buffy. The pay is excellent though. Faith gets a job there and is successful. 3/5

**City of San Francisco, supernatural consulting** Both Spike and Buffy spend a significant amount of time as super natural consultants. We only see bits and pieces of it. But this must have paid the bills for a couple of years. 5/5

**Government Internment Camp, trustee** Spike, Buffy and Willow are imprisoned in a supernatural internment camp. The blood rations aren't enough and Spike is starving. Buffy becomes a trustee to earn blood rations. The trustee position allows her to learn more about the government's plan for supernaturals. But she gets injured pretty badly.Just like show, many comic stories are comedy but this is one of the more serious arcs.  0/5

**SFPD, police officer** The most controversial of all of Buffy's jobs in the fandom. Buffy and Faith join the police department. Buffy realizes as she turns 30 she needs a career with insurance and a pension. She's embarrassed that the rest of the Scoobies have careers and she's doing the same thing she's been doing since she was 15. I can't rate this one because they just graduated and actually haven't started. 

AU Boom! Comics

**Tunaverse, cashier** This takes place in the alternate universe The World Without Shrimp. They may not have shrimp but they love tuna. Buffy has just moved to Sunnydale and meets Xander and Willow for the first time. I don't know what happens to Tunaverse, I didn't finish this series. But I know you have to scrub gunk. 2/5",5,1764691348.0,buffy,0,1.0,False
1pcc7ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1pcc7ov/jm_smucker_coffee_price_crunch_hangs_over/,J.M. Smucker: Coffee Price Crunch Hangs Over Otherwise Strong Q2 Results,"J.M. Smucker delivered a solid Q2 with $2.3B in net sales (up 3%), strong Uncrustables growth, and 21% coffee revenue gains — but rising green coffee costs spooked investors. Despite boosting prices earlier this year, the company says inflationary pressure in the coffee market will squeeze margins and drag fiscal-year earnings below analyst expectations.

**Key Points:**

* Q2 net sales up 3% to $2.3B, but FY26 profit outlook lowered
* Coffee sales up 21% across Folgers, Café Bustelo, and other formats
* Green coffee inflation driving margin pressure; winter price hike canceled
* Uncrustables up 7% thanks to national advertising and distribution gains
* Hostess brand undergoing SKU rationalization (-25%), showing early signs of improved velocity
* Stock fell \~4 points on investor concern, but regained most losses the next day
* CEO Mark Smucker says the portfolio remains positioned for long-term growth across price tiers

With coffee inflation hammering even the biggest players, is the category entering a new era of persistent price pressure or is this just another temporary commodity spike?

*Homeplate, Construction Zone*

After O'Brien left, Reilly looked around at the quiet group. The silence stretched for a bit before she spoke.

""Alright my lovely band of nuggets, get at it. We need these spaces cleared and prepped for furnishing, chop-chop. You wanna stand around and pick dust out of your fur, go join those disorganized grabasstic *pirlafti* bastards in Echo Company. Buncha damn goldbricks over there and I'd like to think we're better than that, but I may be wrong.""

As they went to work, there was conversation in the moments of respite. Chapma moved a container of rock onto a grav-cart, taking a deep breath and feeling a bit annoyed that this job seemed to starting in a very haphazard fashion. He glanced over at the cart-runner, noting that he adhered to the Vilantian tradition of sleeves and began the conversation that was at this point almost traditional after glancing at the name-tape over their chest.

""Hey - Orile, where you from brother?""

There was a slight shrug. ""Vilantia Prime, Throne City. You?""

""Born in Elsife Village, but my clan was part of the garrison."" The words sounded foreign to his ears, even though Chapma remembered his youth clearly. Most of it anyway. ""How'd you get here?""

Orile seemed almost embarrassed. ""I was to be a Cultural Witness. It, it did not go well. It was hinted that I would never advance beyond a most junior position and that my clan was the only reason that I would retain that. I met the Freelord due to an, an event. It felt like following him would have merit, and my older siblings - they encouraged me to find my own path.""

Chapma nodded. ""I was on a ship during the Terran War - we made a blind jump and came out in the Draconis system."" Chapma held for a moment. ""I do not believe our course was entirely random. During the trip, discipline fractured and I and my wife found ourselves off the ship with no honor and a babe in her den. Draconis, for all the things it has, does not have the facilities for proper child-rearing.""

There was silence while they contemplated this reality, with Chapma loading bins of debris for Orile to haul away on his grav-cart. They both glanced around again before continuing.

""Where you going to be when this is done?""

""Supply and Logistics.""

""Me too - the, the aptitude tests seemed to think I'd fit there."" Orile seemed almost eager to talk now that there was some manner of connection.

There was a pause again before Chapma lowered his voice. ""How does the, the Purple Sergeant - Reilly? - how does she know Vilantian? She even got the cadence right."" It was a delicate reference to Reilly's earlier use of the epithet for a spouse who's only duty within the relationship was to prepare the other spouses for intimacy.

Orile shook his head. ""I only know rumors, and they are many. The most popular one is -""

A low whisper interrupted them, causing them both to flinch back in shock as Reilly had slipped behind them unnoticed. ""You nuggets want to know the truth? I'm genetically modified to have the ability to breed viably with your species. I had to learn Vilantian as a child. It's called Project Fuck The Stupid Out Of Them - but they didn't tell me until I was eighteen."" Reilly let the words hang for a moment. ""Now if you don't mind getting your asses in gear we got shit to do, we *don't* get paid overtime here, and I would like to go home tonight and fuck the hell out of my wife and our boyfriend. Keep going the way you're going and it's gonna be an angry night tonight and I *will* tell them both that it's your fault. Drop, twenty-four, recover and then move with a goddamn purpose.""

The two swallowed and began their push-ups.

*Terran Mercenary Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk settled for a moment, checking the time while his hand felt under his chair. There was in fact a conveniently accessible stunner under his chair. He took a breath and tapped on his tablet.

""XO, report to conference room in your own time please.""

Rosie's reply was immediate and crisp. ""Yes Freelord Major.""

There was a slight eyebrow lift as Rosie closed the channel. ""What got into her?""

""Presumably she received a lecture from the Chief in addition to the punishment I laid out last night. Which means it may be a few days before she returns to normal.""

Rosie's arrival was accompanied with the aura of discipline and embarrassment. She had formed a crisp standard-duty uniform for her clothes, which seemed highly out of place. ""Freelord, XO Rosie reporting for orders."" She canted her head slightly toward O'Brien. ""Sergeant Major.""

O'Brien shook her head. ""Respectfully XO, something about that is downright unsettling.""

Gryzzk tapped the table three times. ""We can belay the discussion for the moment. Rosie, dial up refreshments for Captain Venlid and First Sergeant Jirloed and upon their arrival please escort them here. If they were smart enough to bring their Chief Engineer, direct them to Tucker's domain, please.""

There was a nod from the XO. ""Yes Freelord."" The printer began to work, producing a carafe of coffee and two mugs in short order as Rosie left.

Gryzzk set the coffee and attendant extras on the table and settled as the two came in with Rosie and sat down slowly in their chairs - it seemed that the word of the day was wary, as the two glanced at each other and settled on opposite sides of the table. O'Brien flicked her eyes once at Jirloed, then to Gryzzk and finally Venlid. The meaning was clear as Gryzzk parked himself in his chair before he spoke.

""Well, first - thank you both for your time. We have things to discuss, and first among them - I've received word that your...records that were submitted with your Legion were incomplete - and fuller version has been under my nose. So, before we get to the business of your ship, we should attend to a more...personal affairs."" Gryzzk looked down and detached his oak-leaf insignia from his uniform and tossed it to the side counter casually. ""I know that I have indirectly caused you both great personal sorrow, and I feel it appropriate that we should address it - otherwise the scent will hang in the air until it poisons us all at the worst possible opportunity. Say what you wish in this moment.""

The two of them looked down at their mugs for a very long time with only their lower eye-pairs, keeping the other two moving for any sign of aggression from either Gryzzk or O'Brien. Venlid spoke first, toying with her cup. ""How do we know you won't fire us? How do we trust that you won't take fatal offense to our thoughts?""

O'Brien replied quietly. ""Respectfully Captain, there's been more than a few times that I've had to say things to that fellah he didn't like to hear. As you can see, I'm still on payroll with all my stripes.""

Jirloed hmph'ed softly. ""I dunno about you Cap'n but I can always go back to aggressive cargo retrieval."" He glanced at Gryzzk. ""Plainly speaking, Freelord - you are damned easy to hate. You start a Lead Servant - not a noble but someone who can tell a noble what to do. Then shockingly, your Lord turns on your scent. You don't go into hiding, you flip that to advantage. Then you help shame your homeworld; you don't look like someone that's got a moral compass. After that, you and Bravo take on seventy-plus ships, not outgunned but sure as space is black you're outnumbered and you *win*. My old clan's never gonna recover. Lost our clanmark, our way, our dignity. I've spent the last four days going to bed and just...dreaming about punching you right in your perfect teeth. Got signed on with Venlid, found out she was in the same boat, and we hit New Casablanca and found some things we both liked.""

Jirloed ran a finger around the rim of his mug before sipping at the acrid coffee and continuing. ""Then you said what you said. Like you meant it; we're not yours, we're ours and...well, right now there's enough good direction that I think you're on the path to being a proper Hurdop Freelord. Maybe someday I'll take your scent and I won't react with wanting to jump you and strip your fur from skin with a dull knife."" He shrugged at Gryzzk, his scent slightly embarrassed. ""Just not today, Freelord. If that gets me a ticket out of here, so be it.""

Gryzzk flicked an eyepair to Venlid who nodded agreement with her junior as she recounted things with as little emotion as possible. ""I saw your ship firing, I'd ordered evasive turns. Then I woke in a hospital bed, to see my husband and wife. My heart soared, and for a few moments all was right with their scent. The only thing they said was that they were going to the Ministry of Culture to leave offerings to the gods and praise their fortune that I am not with child. I did not react well, and that reaction was compounded with your, your recent demonstration."" She bit at her lips in turn, uncertain how to continue. ""Then I spoke with Freelord Rostin. He's persuasive. This is not where I expected to be, but it is where I am."" She gestured at her First Sergeant. ""He is a good petty officer - a good sergeant. For the moment, we'd like to focus on the future because the now is tense.""

Gryzzk tapped his fingers against the table for a time, feeling the weariness seeping in and threatening to take the helm. ""My directives in this are simple. Profitability. I'll do everything I can to make that happen. With that, let's look at your ship design. I'd prefer we remake the structure in order to have consistency within the company - the Warfreighter design is solid and operationally flexible, but the corsair structure of the *Stalwart Rose* allows for a larger number of emplacements...""

The initial meeting began in earnest as a holographic display lit up, showing the two general shapes with items being debated at length before the *Cerberus Rose* began to take shape with elements of both ship classes being present. Gryzzk made several suggestions - the engineers were going to want to cut the design down as much as possible, so he made sure the design was extravagant. Eventually the design was completed and given initial approval. Gryzzk took a breath and leaned back in his chair.

""Now then, let's get some opinions."" Gryzzk gave the two a slight grin as he tapped send. ""Annnd, three...two...one.""

As if it were cued, his rank chirruped softly from its place on the side counter, and Rosie's voice came through. ""Freelord Major, Chiefs Tucker and Torres would like to have a word - four words, actually.""

A pair of voices came over the communicator. ""Major, what the *shit?!*""

""Is there a problem, Chiefs?"" Gryzzk's voice was as innocent as he could make it in the circumstances.

""Three decks, two separate powerplants. Four weapons emplacements set at fore, aft, and midships - twelve total, each one having paired railgun and plasma mounts. That's in addition to the new argon ballistic shielding and the energy shielding. And that's on top of everything we're going to have to do to make gravity workable for the entire complement. While you're asking for the impossible, do you want spinning rims on the shuttle landing gear, fur on the consoles? Hell, while we're at it everyone gets a blowjob and a puppy.""

""No Chief; we do have a standard of dignity to adhere to.""

""Fuzzy dice on the helm. We'll do 'em up in red.""

Torres' voice came in next. ""Look sir, I know this is wishlist stuff right now - but it's a lot. We could cut the weapons emplacements to three at each section and still have full coverage, make plans for a refit after a few jobs if we actually need four.""

Gryzzk glanced at Venlid and Jirloed, who nodded. ""Agreed - are there any other concerns?""

""The timeframe. We're gonna have to borrow some people to do some of the fine detail work.""

""Have Rosie and Stewart analyze and pull from the new hires. And prepare for more of this in the next few days, we have three more ships that will require overhauling before we're done.""

""Are we paying paying overtime?""

""No but we are paying out bonuses if all of the ships are done in the allotted time. Chiefs, I suggest less talking and more doing.""

""Good plan."" Tucker's voice faded as he seemed to be addressing a larger group. ""Alright, we're engineers which means three things. We hate sleep, we love coffee, and we get to do the impossible on the regular...""

Venlid stood, glancing at O'Brien for a moment before returning to Gryzzk. ""It sounds as if we will have a ship soon. We'll begin going over personnel assignments, and...searching for a cat."" There was a pause before Venlid spoke again. ""With respect to personnel, I am given to understand that your daughters serve on the ship as well. Is it permitted to have other children within the company?""

Gryzzk nodded. ""We do allow children to serve as morale officers, with the approval of their guardian.""

Venlid's response seemed odd, like she'd finally allowed herself a genuine emotion. ""We will respect this gift, Ma...Freelord.""

""See that you do. Dismissed. And...thank you for your time.""

The two left, and Gryzzk sank into his chair. ""Sergeant Major, tell me it's lunchtime.""

""It is. But after lunch, Captain Waniul's going to be bringing her First Sergeant for your approval.""

Rosie added in helpfully, ""She is speaking with Corporal Kiole now. First Sergeant Motoko is treating this as a highly formal affair.""

""Define?""

""You'll see, Freelord..."" It seemed as though Rosie was slowly recovering her personality.

Gryzzk pocketed his rank and tried to take a fast lunch but it seemed as though the mess hall was a busy place - the new hires were making use of the available everything, with the end result being a very long line for chow, but it seemed that the cooks were reveling making large amounts of everything. Free tables were almost nonexistent and the conversation was loud. It felt alive in a good way.

He walked on auto-pilot to his usual booth and simply nodded to his tablemates, both of whom were dust-covered and quiet as they were almost finished. He blinked a few times at a vaguely familiar scent.

""Orile?""

Orile nodded quickly, smiling weakly. ""Yes Freelord. I will be in Supply once training is completed, along with Chapma."" He gestured to their other tablemate. Chapma didn't seem inclined to talk, but there seemed to be a momentary flash of anger that was gone and replaced with determined resignation.

Gryzzk wasn't exactly surprised - it seemed as though there were more than a few individuals under his command with a grudge that they were working to get past. ""Congratulations to both of you. Just never make the mistake of thinking what you do is unimportant. As much as the glory of fighting goes to the armory and infantry, without a supply section doing their job, combat platoons'll be fighting with two sticks and rock. And they'd have to share the rock.""

There were light smiles and chuckles at the joke - though Gryzzk wasn't sure if it was actually funny or if it was a carryover that a Lord's jokes were *always* funny. With that in mind, Gryzzk mostly kept his conversation to himself, eating far more rapidly than his two tablemates - it seemed like eating quickly was a function of being on the ship. After excusing himself, he moved back to the conference room for his afternoon meeting; a hopefully less-controversial discussion with Waniul about her personnel and ship needs.

He straightened his uniform as he walked into the conference room, still musing about the morning meeting as well as the lunch conversation. O'Brien was still there, running upon some unknown fuel.

He quickly looked over the agenda, frowning. ""XO, we do not appear to have a personnel file for First Sergeant Motoko.""

""Captain Waniul sends her regrets that she wasn't able to select her First Sergeant in time for it to be added. Working on it now."" Gryzzk watched as a file appeared and data flowed across his tablet - she seemed to have an impressive service record with the Terran Self-Defense Fleet, however she was recently retired and thus new to mercenary services. ""Impressive record.""

""You'll love her fashion sense, Freelord."" Rosie smirked a bit.

As Waniul and Motoko entered, Gryzzk noticed two things immediately. First, Motoko was the shortest Terran adult he'd ever seen, rising to a height just a touch higher than Gryzzk. Second, her choice of clothing at this time was - both formal and not. It resembled ministerial robes on the surface, but there was a wide embroidered belt covering most of her torso. The main color was purple with a design of red and gold flowers woven into the pattern, and her hair had a great deal of flowered accents adding splashes of contrast to her black hair. Motoko kept her eyes low and seemed calm as she bowed deeply.

""Captain Waniul, I presume an explanation is forthcoming?""

Motoko spoke in a soft voice. ""Freelord Major. I was advised by the captain that you are a nobleman on your homeworld, and I wished to respect that.""

""I see. Well, it does appear to carry a certain dignity to it - I will be asking questions later, if the opportunity arises."" Gryzzk mentally strode past the newest Terran oddity to settle in his chair. ""Now then, let's talk about the immediate needs of the *Twilight Hurdop* and her company, beginning with a full refit...""",3,1764691252.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I’ve only googled about it, a lot, but I didn’t find anyone who has been through this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Last week, as I went down the stairs to catch my usual subway home from work, I took the wrong one. Well, I thought I was just distracted, but now I know it was, in a way, on purpose. 

In the first couple of minutes, I felt stupid. Some twenty-minute delay to rest after a long day at work. But it didn’t take long for me to feel like I was going somewhere familiar. I started to remember the view out the window like an old picture you don’t remember taking. And when I arrived at a certain station, I knew to get out and which set of stairs to take.

Outside was the usual street, indistinguishable from any of the thousand others downtown. But I recognized some of the stores. I started on a path I didn’t know where it was gonna take me. Street signs, trash cans. I remembered that place. Even though I didn’t remember how, I knew where to go.

Approaching a small square, I saw a beautiful oak tree swaying in the light breeze. A white, wooden bench under its shadow painted a bucolic frame, defiant of the surrounding concrete. But something else caught my attention: An ice cream parlor. I remember that, clearly, if not disconnected in time.

Bells clanged as I opened the door, drowning me in a lost memory. I remembered the checkerboard-tiled floor, the colors of the yellowed sign behind the counter, the rusty fan squeaking every other turn. I must’ve stood there for a while, because I came to my senses when the attendant yelled, “Can I help you?”

I was too dazed to respond as I normally would, but I managed to “autopilot” myself closer to him. My eyes went straight to a certain flavor on the faded sign. He was going through his usual presentation of sizes and prices when I interrupted: “Chocolate Chip. Large!” He was taken aback a bit, but nodded and continued the process. 

There was a large sink behind him that I then. A faucet, dripping. I didn’t know then why that bothered me so much, but every drop seemed to sound so loud falling into metal. It brought me out of that dream state. I felt like I should jump over the counter and turn it tight. This was never a pet peeve of mine. Which bothered me more than the sink itself.  Thankfully, he handed me my order, and I went to sit far away from that.

I looked at that bowl, thinking about how long it had been since I had a treat like that. A little bite of that creamy texture, the crunchy chocolate chip bursting with flavor, and I remembered. I remembered what I remembered. 

Going there with my dad, ordering the same flavor every time. I remember him joking about that, saying I should try something else. I remember sitting there staring at my hero. Never thinking about that time of day, never minding the price of the ice cream.

Man, I enjoyed eating that! 

I was almost licking the bowl. I didn’t want to leave, but I could always go back some other day. Bring my own kid.

I wanted to squeeze more out of this little vacation. My face hurt from smiling. I sat under that oak. Watched the day hurry away for a bit. Another rare, pleasant breeze, and I was in heaven. I closed my eyes and heard the leaves clapping gently above me, then I looked up at them.

That… hit me like a sucker punch to the gut. I felt nauseous, weak. That image made me sink into the bench, the whole city spinning around me. That tree, spinning. 

I got up straight away and went home. I had to lie about being late. I wasn’t excited about my memories anymore. I told the wife that I had to finish some things at work, she didn’t question it. They had dinner already, I wasn’t hungry. One long shower and I was in bed, not sleeping, of course. 

The whole night I kept thinking about that damn tree. The leaves falling, spiraling towards the ground. Why did it hurt me? I couldn’t place it, like a… like an invisible itch! A rock I could not get out of my shoe.

The next day was spent watching the hands on the office clock run extra slow, as if mocking me. Work seemed meaningless, and coffee didn’t help, but I suffered through it and could run back to that cursed wooden bench. I ran down the subway's stairs, into that fateful train.

The details that had allured me before, were a blur now. The stores, street signs, trash cans. Fuck the chocolate chip ice cream! I went straight to that bench under the oak, sat and looked up. As much as it was bothering me all day, looking at it was unbearable. I looked around, considered leaving. But I had to figure it out. It was killing me.

So I studied it. Every scrap and speck. Every branch that led into a small branch and then a smaller one after that. Even now, if I could draw, I could show you the smallest details. Every scratch classified by how deep it was, by how old it looked. The faintest change in color, the position of the moss in relation to the sun that set in the background, as I watched the leaves falling onto me. The city sounds muffled. I must have looked insane to anyone passing by. But I figured it out! Only, I still can’t sleep.

I went home defeated and with a stiff neck. Had to come up with a much better lie to explain being late, almost four hours this time. She again didn’t care. A longer shower then the bed. Branches projected into the ceiling. I could hear the sway of the oak in the breeze, could feel the leaves touching my face as they fell, spinning like my thoughts, never-ending.

All because, maybe, they haven’t fixed the squeaking fan in twenty years. I find it pretty hard to believe that they never changed the flavors, never updated the prices, never fixed that damn dripping faucet. But there is no way that tree has remained the same all these years.

The same branches, same holes, and scratches. Same as when I was a kid?

I don’t know if this is a type of psychosis, some mental illness manifested late in life. Google, Reddit, Quora, nobody has ever talked about it. If there is a term that I can read about, look for an answer, please tell me. If you repost this anywhere, send me a dm, so I can read the comments.

My deadbeat dad never bought me ice cream.

“What’s the fucker’s name again?” Thomas asked, throwing down a card.

“He don’t got a name,” Desmond replied, dragging on his cigar. “All I’ve got is he’s called ‘The Nomad’. No origin or family to trace back to.”

“I’ve some unpleasant news, gentlemen,” Rupert spoke up, setting down his cup of coffee. “He’s been sent by the Royals in the East, and the Zharikovs out of Russia.”

“Fuckin’ hell.”

Desmond had turned red with rage.

“So they’ve allied to knock over our monopoly in London trades?!”

Rupert nods grimly.

“Only matter of time. This place is the heart of black-wealth.I implore you, gentlemen, we might’ve had bad blood in the past. But if our enemies believe that one man is enough to take all of us out…”

His voice stiffened.

“…we best approach this with outmost caution.”

“Ever the worrywart aintcha, Ruby?”

“Mr. Ashford, 57 of our men combined have been killed in 2 weeks, by presumably a single man. ‘Worry’ is lightly put. Fear is appropriate, for all of us.”

“He isn’t wrong, Dez,” Thomas reaffirms. “However, Nomad’ll die in no time. London is ours.”

On a bulding across, stood the lone figure of a man. Dressed for desert and November cold of London alike.

Over his shoulders draped a thick, woven scarf, wrapped around his face like a veil, only revealing his piercing eyes.

He brings out three dice from his pocket, and rolls them in his palm.

All roll 6.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Mr. Ashford” Rupert spoke. “You might want to get away from the window.”

“Why-“

**SHATTER**

There was a flash of white.

Both men on the ground, jugulars sliced.

Rupert backs up, exhaling in short breaths.

The Nomad arrives.

“You know,” Rupert gazes into his eyes. “Of all things I expected you to be, blind was the least.”

The assassin turns his lifeless gaze towards him.

**“Blind, jes. But helpless? La, no.”**

Just as Nomad is about to strike, in an almost animalistic manner he twitches his face towards the window.

**BANG**

Nomad falls, three dice rolling out.

Rupert Blackwood was a ruthless man. Gather the three crime lords in a single room, a bait Nomad couldn’t resist. Sniper would finish it. His rivals dying was a bonus.

He looks in the building across.

Rupert’s sniper was dead, body half out the window, stabbed in the face.

He looks down at Nomad’s body.

In a split second, the Nomad had located and launched his knife towards the sniper.

“Motherfucker,” he exhales with reluctant admiration and fear.

Good fucking riddance.

Flesh bleeds all the same.

Bleeds.

Bleeds?

There was no blood beneath Nomad.

The bullet-

He feels a pair of hands wrap around his neck. Nomads’ body vanished in an instant.

“Have I told you, Mister Rupert…”

Rupert’s gaze falls on the dice below. Each rolled to a 6.

“…Fate seems to have a thing for me.”

The Ghia smelled like old vinyl and something mechanical underneath.

Jane sat in the back seat and didn't say anything. Couldn't say anything. Because the curve of the dashboard was the same. The way the streetlights caught the window frames was the same. The particular rattle when Claude shifted into third.

She closed her eyes.

When she opened them, Nova's profile was silhouetted against the passenger window. The same angle. The same shape of her mother's head against the glass.

A different man driving.

""Traffic's not too bad,"" Claude said. ""Should have you home in fifteen.""

His eyes found hers in the rearview mirror. That look. Cheerful. Optimistic. Bewildered by his own good nature. But with something underneath now — an edge of concern that hadn't been there before the hospital. Before the two weeks. Before he learned what it meant to watch someone slip in and out of the world.

Jane looked away.

The traffic signals strobed through the window. Red. Amber. Green. The same rhythm as every drive she'd ever taken in a back seat, watching her parents in the front, not understanding what she was feeling.

She was ten. She was thirty-two. She was both.

---

Finchley Road unspooled in the dark.

The Swiss Cottage pub slid past, mustard-yellow on its traffic island — and for a moment, just a moment, it had seven chimneys instead of however many it actually had. Jane blinked and they were normal again. She didn't count.

Christmas lights had started appearing in shop windows. They blinked in patterns that weren't quite random. Almost a rhythm. Almost a message.

The O2 Centre loomed ahead, that spaceship of retail optimism, and its logo pulsed once as they passed. Like a heartbeat. Like recognition.

Jane pressed her palms flat against her thighs.

*Hold it together. Just hold it together until you're inside.*

A bus groaned past in the opposite direction. The 13. Except for a moment the number split in her vision — 7 and 6, stacked, separate — before resolving back into thirteen.

She was seeing things. She was always seeing things. That was the problem. That had always been the problem.

The world shifted from nice North London to real North London. The chain coffee shops giving way to kebab places and laundrettes. The crossing of a membrane she couldn't name.

Almost home.

Almost.

---

Claude pulled up to 25 Walm Lane and put the Ghia in neutral.

""I'll just be a minute,"" he said, already opening his door. ""Let me get your—""

""You're double parked,"" Nova said.

""It's fine, there's no one—""

""Don't let me catch you with the meter maid.""

The words landed in the car like something thrown.

Claude's eyes went to the rearview mirror. To Jane. He *knew* that joke. Nova had told him — sometime in those long hospital nights, in those 2am conversations Jane had slept through, Nova had told him about Portugal and the rally and Andy and the parking attendant and the joke that became theirs for twenty years.

He knew.

And now he was looking at Jane to see if she knew he knew.

She wasn't in the car anymore.

---

*She's ten. Maybe eleven. Back seat of the Ghia — Dad's Ghia, the American one, the one he shipped over when he moved here because he couldn't leave it behind, couldn't leave anything behind, except eventually them.*

*Dad's running into the shop. Just a minute, he said. Mum's in the passenger seat, fiddling with the radio.*

*""Don't let me catch you with the meter maid,"" she says when he opens the door again, plastic bag in hand.*

*The same words. But the tone is different. Something underneath that young Jane can't name. Mum says it like she's reminding herself of something she used to feel. Like she's checking if the joke still works.*

*Dad laughs.*

*A beat too late.*

*Mum's eyes don't crinkle the way they're supposed to.*

*Jane doesn't understand. She just knows something is off. Something has shifted. The joke isn't the joke anymore. The car is the car but the people in it are becoming something else, something that will split apart in two years and leave her in a house with her mother while her father drives this same Ghia back to a shipping container, back to New Mexico, back to a desert that called him home.*

*She doesn't know any of that yet.*

*She just knows the laugh was wrong.*

---

""Jane?""

Nova's voice. Present tense. December. Cricklewood.

""Jane, sweetheart, we're here.""

She blinked. The Ghia. Claude's Ghia. Not her father's. Her father's was in New Mexico, if it was anywhere, if it still existed, if Andy hadn't finally let it go the way he'd let go of everything else except apparently the bookshop and the scooter club and the sensitivity to when something was wrong.

""I'm fine,"" she said.

She wasn't fine.

She opened the door.

---

The stairs took forever.

Three flights had never felt like three flights before. Jane leaned on the railing, then on Nova, then on Claude when the second landing made her dizzy. Her body was still healing. Her body was still learning how to be a body again after two weeks of hospital beds and concussion fog and slipping between worlds.

""Almost there,"" Claude said. Encouraging. That same look.

She didn't answer.

She could feel the drawer. Not magic — just knowing. The way you know your own heartbeat, your own breath, the position of your own limbs in space. The drawer was up there, behind her door, and it was waiting.

Third floor.

Her door.

The same scuff marks. The same number that had been crooked since she moved in and she'd never fixed. The same door to the same flat she'd been running to for sixteen years because it wasn't Burberry-on-Glassen, because it wasn't Yorkshire, because it wasn't the place where the magic lived.

Except the magic had followed her anyway.

Key in lock. Turn.

She pushed the door open.

---

The flat smelled stale. Two weeks of closed windows and absence. Someone had taken out the bins — Claude, probably, when he came to lock up — but the air had that particular stillness of a place that had been waiting.

Jane stepped inside.

Muscle memory. Keys in hand. Reaching for the bureau by the door, the place she always dropped them, the spot her body knew without looking —

Her hand found empty air.

She stopped.

The bureau was there. Right there. But not *there* there. Not where it was supposed to be. Not where ten years of habit said it should be.

One inch off. Maybe less.

Just enough that her hand had reached for something and found nothing.

Jane stared at it. The bureau. The drawer. One inch to the left of where it had always been, where it had been since she moved in, where her body knew it should be the way her body knew how to breathe.

It moved.

Or she was wrong. Her memory was wrong. The concussion had scrambled her spatial awareness and she couldn't trust herself anymore, couldn't trust her own knowledge of her own flat.

She didn't know which was worse.

""Jane?"" Nova, behind her. ""What is it?""

The magic moved her furniture while she was dying.

Or she's broken.

Or both.

Or neither.

The bureau sat there, one inch wrong, and Jane felt something crack.

---

It wasn't one thing.

That was the problem. That was always the problem. It was never one thing with her, never a single clean break she could point to and say *there, that's where it happened, that's the moment I fell apart*.

It was the Ghia. Claude's Ghia that was the same as her father's Ghia.

It was the back seat. The same back seat. The same configuration.

It was Nova's profile against the window, the same shape it had been twenty years ago.

It was the traffic signals, red amber green, strobing through glass the same way they always had.

It was Claude's face in the rearview mirror — that look, that stupid hopeful bewildered look, the same one her father used to have before New Mexico called him home.

It was the joke. The meter maid. Nova saying it without thinking, the way she'd been saying it for thirty years, and Claude *knowing*, and the past and present collapsing into each other like a house of cards.

It was the bureau. One inch off. Ten years of certainty, shifted.

It was sixteen years of running, and the running hadn't worked.

It was Grandmother's tree in the coma dark.

It was the chicken in the dream, hanging ornaments.

It was the Seven Fools processing through a corridor that didn't exist.

It was the receipts: YOU FORGOT TO REMEMBER. THE SEVEN FOOLS REMEMBER.

It was the Zia sun, seven rays, one imperfect, her father's magic bleeding through a sunbeam and nearly killing her.

It was all of it. It was none of it. It was the accumulation of a lifetime of seeing things she shouldn't see, feeling things she couldn't explain, running from a village that had been waiting for her to come home.

Jane's legs stopped working.

She didn't fall — not exactly. She just... folded. Went down. Knees hitting the floor of her flat, the flat that was supposed to be safe, the flat that was supposed to be *hers*, away from the magic, away from the pattern.

The bureau watched. One inch wrong.

And Jane broke.

---

She didn't know how long she cried.

Time stopped meaning anything. The floor was under her — lino, cold through her jeans — and Nova was beside her, and Claude was there too, because in a flat this small there was nowhere else to be. All three of them on the floor in the half-dark, Jane sobbing into her mother's shoulder while Claude's hand rested on her back like he wasn't sure if he was allowed to touch her but couldn't not.

Sixteen years. 

She cried for sixteen years.

For Grandmother, who died while Jane was in London pretending she didn't have a grandmother. For her parents' marriage, which ended in a joke that stopped being funny. For her father in New Mexico, texting at 00:53 when the desert got quiet. For her mother in Yorkshire, calling at 6:30am about Christmas. For the girl who got on a coach at Victoria Station with forty pounds and the address of strangers. For the woman who fell because a sunbeam made a shape.

For the drawer that kept printing messages she didn't want to read.

For the bureau that moved one inch while she was dying.

For all of it. For none of it.

Nova held her and didn't say anything. Didn't try to fix it. Didn't say *it's okay* or *you're all right* or any of the things people say when someone is breaking. She just held on.

Claude stayed. He didn't understand — couldn't understand, not really, not the magic part, not the Zia sun or the Seven Fools or why a bureau being one inch off was the thing that finally broke her. But he stayed anyway. Hand on her back. Present.

Jane cried until she was empty.

---

The flat had gone full dark. December night pressing against the windows. Someone had turned on the lamp by the sofa — Nova, maybe, at some point — and the light made everything soft and strange.

Jane was on the sofa now. She didn't remember moving there. Her head was in her mother's lap, the way it used to be when she was small and sick and scared.

Claude was in the kitchen — though ""in"" was generous. The flat was small enough that the kitchen was really just a corner with a hob and a kettle, six feet from the sofa at most.

She could hear him — cupboards opening and closing, the tap running. Looking for mugs. Looking for tea. Looking for something useful to do with his hands.

The kettle clicked on.

Not the violent click of impatience. A softer sound. Settling into the task.

Jane watched him from the sofa and waited.

---

The drawer hadn't moved.

The bureau sat where it sat — one inch wrong, but still. Quiet. Behaving itself. The drawer closed, the way she'd left it two weeks ago, not printing anything, not opening on its own.

Waiting, maybe.

Or just being a drawer.

She didn't know anymore. She wasn't sure she'd ever known.

---

Claude turned from the counter with three mugs, balanced precariously. He'd found the tea, found the milk, found mugs that mostly matched. The domesticity of it was almost unbearable.

""I didn't know if you wanted sugar,"" he said. ""I didn't put sugar. There's sugar if you want it. I can—""

""It's fine,"" Jane said. Her voice sounded like it had been dragged over gravel.

He set the mugs down carefully, like they were precious, like this small act of tea-making was the most important thing he'd ever done.

Maybe it was.

---

They sat in the soft lamplight. 

Nova's hand in Jane's hair, stroking slowly. Claude in the armchair — the only other seat in the flat — too big for it, knees jutting awkwardly. The tea cooling in their mugs because no one was really drinking it.

The bureau in the corner. The drawer quiet.

Outside, London hummed its distant hum. Buses and cars and the eternal negotiation of a city that never quite slept.

Jane felt hollowed out. Empty in a way that wasn't entirely bad. Like something had been cleaned out, cleared away. Sixteen years of accumulated weight, finally set down.

She wasn't fixed. She knew that. You didn't fix sixteen years of running by sobbing on the floor for an hour.

But she was... lighter. Maybe. Somehow.

Nova's hand kept moving. Steady. Patient.

---

""You should sleep,"" Nova said eventually. Quiet. Not pushing.

""I know.""

""We'll be here.""

Jane looked at Claude, who nodded. Of course he'd stay. Of course he would. He didn't know how to not show up.

""The sofa's not comfortable,"" Jane said.

""I've slept in worse places.""

""The armchair's worse.""

""I've slept in worse places than that too."" Claude almost smiled. ""I'll manage. Just... rest.""

Jane closed her eyes.

---

She was almost asleep when Nova spoke again.

""Are you here with me?""

The question was soft. Tentative. Barely a question at all — more like Nova checking, making sure, needing to know that her daughter was actually present and not slipping away again into whatever place had taken her for two weeks.

The kettle clicked.

Not boiling — it had long since finished. Just... a click. A small sound from the counter. The kind of sound appliances make when they're settling, cooling, being themselves.

But Jane heard it differently.

*Are you ready?*

She opened her eyes. Looked at her mother, whose face was soft with exhaustion and love and fear. Looked toward the counter, where the kettle sat on its base, dark now, waiting.

Two questions. The same question. Different words.

""Yes,"" Jane said.

Both true. Both not true. Both the only answer she had.

Nova exhaled. Something releasing in her shoulders.

The kettle settled.

And Jane, finally, slept.",1,1764690811.0,DispatchesFromReality,0,1.0,False

Most of the time we just make stuff for resellers and brands in different countries and keep our heads down

Sharing a quick look at our jacket production.

Turns out, sewing was the easy bit. The actual boss fight was the fabric

We needed to hit a specific print: deep black, muted surface, sharp embossed pattern that still looks good when you crumple it, steam it, or accidentally spill coffee on it
We tried over 15 material swatches (yeah, the table looked like a fabric crime scene). Some were too shiny. Some were “waterproof” until you actually hit them with water. Some held the pattern, but killed every stitch or metal snap we tried to mount on them

The one we kept? Perfect balance: matte, tight weave, doesn’t pill after heat pressing, and the print stays 3D even with padding underneath

Hardware went through the same gauntlet — snaps included. We tested, rejected, tested again until the snap finally had enough bite to punch through thicker cloth without sliding out crooked. Each one is pressed by hand and checked by eye, not vibes

No dramatic inspirational story here. It’s just trial, fail, trial again
But this is what separates a factory from a “DIY artiest project gone wrong.”

Things I learned after hitting my breaking point,"When friends ask me how to manage stress as a student, I always smile. I've been through every possible stage of burnout. I'm definitely an expert here.  
  
The very first breakthrough was breathing exercises - when you literally give your brain a signal that everything is under control. Yoga added mindfulness…the combination of movement and breathing calms you better than anything.  
  
Then, there was dancing. I came across a study that said that the brain likes the predictable rhythm of music, so moving to the beat reduces anxiety.  
  
Giving up coffee was painful, but after a week I noticed that my mornings became calmer. My heart finally stopped pounding. Keeping a diary also helped: when you write down your thoughts, they stop pressing inside. I also returned to watching TV series from my childhood, this quiet nostalgic background creates a sense of security.  
  
Another important discovery was that you don’t have to deal with your studies on your own. I use platforms like EssayService as a helpful tool: I look at structures, examples, get ideas for drafts, sometimes I order entire papers. This takes some of the load off and allows me to focus on the main thing - my own studies without panic and blaming myself for not being perfect.  
  
That’s the answer to the question of how to manage stress as a college student. Maybe I should write a book about it haha

Not trying to sell anything - just sharing because I wish I saw more real-world posts instead of spec dumps.

Here’s what stood out after a week of using it with pretty much everything in my house.

For MacBook users 
Plug-and-play with one USB-C.
The 16:10 ratio matches the MacBook screen perfectly, and 2.5K on a 16"" panel looks super crisp.
Also, the built-in metal stand is way nicer than those flimsy magnetic covers most portables use.

iMac / Mac Mini setups 
Used it as a vertical side monitor for Slack, docs, and dashboards.
Matte IPS screen = no reflections (my room is stupidly bright so this matters).
If you need extra screen space without adding a giant monitor, it’s a nice lightweight option.

PS5 / Xbox Series X 
Hooked it up via HDMI and was genuinely surprised it handled 120Hz console gaming without issues.
 Obviously not a replacement for a full-size gaming monitor, but for a small apartment setup or hotel gaming, it works way better than expected.

Nintendo Switch 
Honestly might be my favorite combo.
Makes hotel gaming feel like a real setup instead of staring at the tiny Switch screen.
Colors look good and it’s bright enough indoors.

ROG Ally / Steam Deck 
Both worked instantly.
144Hz + ROG Ally actually feels super smooth.
Steam Deck needs power depending on the game, but no surprises there.

Travel / café work 
Slides right into the laptop sleeve.
If you’re doing spreadsheets, coding, editing, or research, having a second screen in cafés feels like cheating.
At 1.5 lbs it’s not annoying to carry around.

Things I liked

Sharp 2.5K panel (way better than 1080p)



144Hz makes scrolling/gaming smooth



Matte anti-glare coating



Lightweight



Built-in stand is actually stable

1pcbpml,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pcbpml/the_monster_of_nobel_coffee_and_tea/,The monster of Nobel Coffee and Tea,"Can I tell you a story Boss?” 

The  kindly old man that I knew as Harvey Abberline had asked me in a distant and almost wistful tone in that distinct foriegn accent of his that I guessed was from somewhere in the United kingdom on the very last day he had come into my coffee shop in a gentrified little town on the outskirts of Indiana’s even more gentrified Hamiltion county.

 He had ordered a tall pumpkin spice latte with a single shot of espresso like he always did around that time of year in the six or so years he’d been a regular and he had been his usual, cheerful self when he came through the door, greeting me with his signature ear to ear smile, and sat down at the table furthest to the from the shop's only window as he often did while engaging me in the pleasant banter that was characteristic of him in between placing his order. 

His abrupt shift in tone was not overly concerning to me at this point because I'd long ago labeled him as a bit of an oddball, though I couldn't help but notice a certain heaviness in his tone, like he had been wanting to say what he was about to say for a very long time. Since it was getting fairly late in the day at this point and business was slow, I decided to humor him at least until other customers came in. 

""Sure Harv, what kind of story?"" 

He took a long drink from his pumpkin spice latte with his left hand before he answered.

""A story about a monster that was always in plain sight for everyone to see, but that no one ever noticed."" 

""Ummm.. ok, tell away."" 



If he had heard my response to his somewhat cryptic introduction, he gave no indication of it. Instead he just started talking, as if a figurative dam had just broken and words spilled forth like a flood. 

"" You've probably heard this story, or at least a version of it before, it's really quite famous. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if you learned about it in school. Lots of extremely intelligent people have told it and debated about it over the years, and it even found its way into pop culture and literature, though no one's been able to get it right even after all this time."" He said. 

I couldn't  help but notice a hint of pride creeping into his voice as he said this to me, as if he were talking about a personal accomplishment.  

"" You said this was a story about a monster?"" I asked him, a bit confused. 

"" Oh yes!"" He exclaimed in a giddy tone. 

"" A nameless, faceless monster that did whatever he wanted, to whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted to do it. It was the talk of the town back in the day. Lots of people were accused of being the monster. Surgeons, hairdressers, tailors, butchers, gorillas, Hell even a prince. Everyone had their own pet theory about who he was and why he did what he did. Why, it wouldn't at all be an exaggeration to say that he was the celebrity that ushered in the age of the Newspaper, do you know the story I'm talking about?"" 

He asked with an expectant  smile spreading across his wrinkled face and a glint in his pale blue eyes, as if the possibility that I could have no idea what the Hell he was talking about had never even occurred to him. 

"" Uh, sorry Harv. I don't think I've ever heard a story like that."" 

His smile quickly soured into an annoyed frown, as if I'd insulted him. 

""What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? Everyone knows this story! It's in the goddamn history books!""  He spat, suddenly furious with me.  

I was seeing him in a different light at this point. No longer did he seem like just a harmless oddball. Now I was beginning to think he might truly be crazy. So I tried to placate him as best I could, so he didn't have a full blown meltdown in the middle of the shop.

"" I'm sorry Harv, I don't read a whole lot."" 

"" Clearly not. Kids these days know nothing about anything  it seems."" 

 He lamented with exasperation as he calmed himself down almost as quickly as he had become enraged.  

"" I guess I'll have to start the story from the beginning then."" 

He said after another long drink of his latte. 

""Most people say that this story begins with a woman named Polly Nichols, while others say that it began with a woman named Martha Tabram. Both of these are wrong."" 

He declared definitively.  

""  Nichols was not the monster's first,not even close, and he'd never even laid eyes on the Tabram woman. That was someone else"" 

 He said before launching into a long monologue with his eyes closed, as if he were watching a picture perfect recording of a distant memory behind his eyelids. 

"" She had the most beautiful red hair. Not that trashy light ginger color you see on some women, but a deep crimson red just like the sunset, and just like blood. She saw the monster quite often, at least once a week when he went into her mother's little shop to buy trinkets with the meager wages he'd earned delivering meat. 

He didn't really care about the trinkets, they were just an excuse to see her. She would greet him whenever he came in, laugh at his awkward jokes and make friendly conversation with him, but she never truly saw him for what he was, no one did.  That was the story of his existence. 

He moved through life noticed, but never truly seen. Back then, the monster thought it was because people were stupid, later in his life though he realized that it was because most people instinctively believe that monsters could only appear in stories and fairy tales. The idea that one could be one of your neighbors, or maybe even a regular at your place of business is just too uncomfortable for most people to consider, so they don't. She certainly didn't."" 

He paused to take another sip of his latte, only to find it empty. He then opened his eyes and looked over to me, his tone shifting back into that of a kindly, quirky old man. 



"" Why don't you fetch me another one Boss? Storytelling is tiring work and there is a lot left to tell."" 

I had been so enraptured by his macabre recitation that it took my mind a moment to process what he was asking me for. 

""Oh.. uh… sure, coming right up""

 I stuttered as I did an about face and headed over to the machine  behind the counter to mix up another latte for him. 
As I did that I found myself stealing glances over my shoulder at the old man that called himself Harvey Abberline. 

He had this look of pure contentment painted across his face, like  he was a child bragging to a friend about how he had gotten into the cookie jar without his parent's knowledge, rather than an old man telling a story of violence and heavily implied murder to a near total stranger. 

He was almost certainly a crazy old coot, but at that point I didn't really have any reason to think he was anything but harmless. At least, that's what I do my best to tell myself these days. 

When I came back with his second latte he looked utterly delighted that his new confidant had returned and that he could continue his story. He snatched the latte out of my hands and sipped it greedily before he spoke. 

"" Mmm… that's the stuff. Now where was I?""  He wondered aloud. 

"" You were talking about a woman with red hair."" 

His eyes lit up at my mention of her. 

"" Oh yes of course! how could I forget? I guess my memory is finally starting to slip."" He chuckled. 

"" Take it from me Boss, don't ever grow old. Whoever tells you there's dignity in it is selling you nonsense. It's better to go out while you're young and spry and can still do what you love most without your back and knees screaming at you every step of the way."" 




He complained. I gave him a half hearted nod while I silently awaited him to continue his grim tale. Before long, he took a deep breath and closed his pale blue eyes once more and continued his story. 

"" The Monster was young and sloppy back then, and he had no real technique with a blade despite what the newspapers would later speculate. That first girl screamed bloody murder when he made the first cut, and sent him into a panic. He started stabbing wildly here and there, but she didn't stop screaming. It's a miracle that nobody had heard her and came to investigate. If they had, this story may have turned out quite differently. But no one did hear her. Or maybe they did and just didn't care. 

It was a different world back then, without a lot of the things that kids today take for granted. Violence and death was a part of everyday life and the streets were often literally covered in shit and piss. The police never patrolled the street it happened on if they could avoid it, and the people who could have reported it were not the types to go to the police willingly, for fear of having their own misdeeds dragged into the light.""   

""Why did he do it?"" 

I found myself wondering aloud, unintentionally interrupting Abberline's monologue. 

In response, the old man just shrugged. 

"" Because he's a monster? Who knows really. A cat doesn't really know why he's motivated to kill mice, only that it comes naturally to him. Besides  answers to a question like ""why"" tend to be very reductionist at best and really only serve to inflate the egos of pompous academic know-it-alls and wannabe detectives. It doesn't matter. Anyhow you’ll probably want to hear about Nichols now. I think that would be best for simplicity’s sake. The others before her were pretty boring,  the monster hadn’t quite gotten his craft down yet and you wouldn’t know who they were anyway,  no paper ever covered their deaths.”  

He said dismissively before he slipped back into nostalgic remembrance

“ It had been late one night in August, or perhaps early morning when the monster laid eyes on her stumbling  down what had been called Osborn street back then, talking with some woman he assumed was a friend of hers. A single gas lamp at the far end of the street so it was rather difficult to get a good look at her, but even from that distance he could tell that she was quite drunk. He hadn’t committed himself to taking her at this point, he was just watching. 


She bantered with that friend of hers for perhaps ten minutes or so before she said her goodbyes to her and staggered back down the street toward the Monster. Once she was close enough to him, he went up to her as naturally as he could and made conversation. Her speech was slurred and difficult to decipher, but eventually she did manage to proposition him as well as anyone in such a state could have. 

It was at that moment that he decided he would kill her. A lot of self-proclaimed experts have said over the years that the Monster chose her because he hated women of her particular profession. That perhaps such a woman had given him a disease or that perhaps his own mother had worked in a similar capacity and that Nichols had been a hateful reminder of that. All of that was nonsense of course. He bore her no real ill will, he’d never even seen her before that night. 

He chose her simply because he knew that she would be easy for him to execute with impunity. That was the only real reason he chose most of the women that he did. If he’d made a habit of selecting and pursuing the respectable ladies of high society, he would have ran a much higher risk of exposure and capture, there really wasn’t anymore to it than that, But I’m getting ahead of myself” 
 
He paused once more and took a deep breath. 

“ He made a show of negotiating a fair price for her services, and she confided in him that she was in need of doss money for a place to sleep that evening. After giving her a sympathetic look, he agreed to her price, she took his arm, and then off they went together into the darkness. Nichols chatted incessantly as they walked despite her inebriation, particularly about this black straw bonnet trimmed with velvet that she seemed rather proud of. The Monster for his part made half hearted attempts to reciprocate her enthusiasm for conversation until he felt they were far enough from prying eyes, then he wrapped his hand around her throat and squeezed until she was nearly unconscious, then he lowered her to the ground  and cut deeply into her throat with the long bladed knife he had carried with him for that exact purpose. Her death was not like the first woman’s. 

She had no opportunity to scream.  Once he had finished his work, he found himself struck with a peculiar  desire the likes of which he’d never experienced before.  In the simplest possible terms, he found himself wondering what the woman’s innards looked like, and quickly set himself to the task of satisfying that curiosity with his knife. He didn’t know it then, but this simple act of curiosity was the beginning of his legend. Once he was satisfied, he left her on her back in a place called Buck’s Row, and returned to his own lodgings for a very restful sleep. The Monster had no dreams that night, and slept without a care in the world.” 


Harvey Abberline then paused his retelling and looked over to me as if he were expecting my feedback. I had no idea what to say. To say that I was deeply disturbed by the morbid direction his story  had taken, and that I very much wanted him to walk out of my coffee shop and never return while accurate, felt totally inappropriate to say to this man who I felt was not right in the head, and very possibly dangerous. So I asked the only thing I could think to ask. 

“What happened next?” Abberline took that as a cue to keep talking.

“ Yes, yes the next one was… Chapman I think. Yes that sounds right. Annie Chapman.  She wasn’t like Nichols. She was actually rather attractive for her age, even had all of her teeth as far as The Monster could tell. He’d chosen her at the end of the first week of September that same year, after a long night of searching for a woman that was just right for what he had in mind. He ended up making quite a mess of her in the backyard of a house on... What was the name? It was 29 something... Hanbury! That was the name. He’d heard somebody moving about in the yard next door and that gave him quite a fright! Mind you, it didn’t frighten him off from finishing the job properly and taking what he needed from the Chapman woman, but he worried all the way back to his lodgings that whoever was in the yard next door had seen him at work, perhaps even seen his face! But nothing ever came of it.” 

It was at that exact moment that the front door bell of the shop rang out and some of the other regular customers started filling the shop. Abberline stopped his recitation immediately, flashed a pleasant smile and waved to a few of the people he recognized and began bantering back and forth with them about the weather and other forgettable day to day topics  and I was once again  baffled by how this man could go from  morbid and creepy to benign and charming like he was flipping a switch. 

Don’t get me wrong, I was grateful to have a respite from his awful tale however short, but I was still just amazed by how thoroughly harmless and even boring he seemed while he made conversation with the other regulars. If you hadn’t had heard what I had been hearing over the past few hours, you’d have never guessed that anything was off about him at all. 

I did my best to avoid making eye contact while I went about serving the other regulars, but I could feel his cold blue eyes on me nevertheless, watching and waiting patiently. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. To my dismay the other customers left fairly quickly after receiving their orders, once again leaving me and Harvey Abberline as the only two people left in Nobel Coffee and Tea.  He gestured for me to come back over to his table and I did so slowly while trying very hard to think of a clever and creative way to get him to leave. What I ended up saying was not very creative at all. 

“ We’re gonna be closing soon Harv.” 

“ Don’t worry Boss, I won’t take up much more of your time. We’re just getting to the fun bits anyway.” 

He replied with enthusiasm. He then launched back into his tale without giving me a chance to respond. 

“ That business with Chapman had the whole town talking, the papers couldn’t get enough of it. Everywhere you looked someone was talking about it, and after a few weeks of enjoying the fruits of his labor, the Monster had the brilliant idea to introduce himself to the world!” 

“How did  he do that?”     

"" With the letter of course!” 

“ What letter?” I asked. 

He didn’t bother to elaborate, he seemed utterly consumed with telling his story in the precise way he wanted to tell it. 

“ The Monster waited for the letter to hit the papers, but it didn’t. He suspected, and would  confirm much later that those simpletons at the News Agency had thought it was a hoax at first. A hoax! Can you believe that? Those utter buffoons had been personally addressed by greatness, and they called it a hoax! I tell you Boss, some people are completely worthless.” 

He said in voice that dripped with contempt. 

“ Their incompetence didn’t deter the Monster though. Quite the opposite in fact, it spurred him on to get right back to work just a few nights later. He’d made a foolish and hasty choice when he picked the Stride woman, and in his haste he’d forgotten to make sure he wouldn’t be disturbed while he set about his work. He ended up having to flee when some fool on his cart almost rode directly up to him mid cut. Let me tell you Boss, you’ve never been so full of blind rage and frustration as the Monster had been as he walked over to Mitre Square and grabbed the first woman he could get. 

There had been no interruptions with that woman, only sweetest satisfaction as he did  to her everything he had intended to do to Stride. He was so pleased with himself by the time he was done, that before he went back to his lodgings he wrote up a quick note about his success on a postcard, and sent it in to those idiots at the News Agency the next day and I can assure you that they had a much harder time calling that one a hoax Boss.” 

I didn’t want to hear anymore of this, but I was also legitimately afraid to interrupt him. So I just did my best to keep a passive and expressionless look on my face while his tale reached its crescendo. 

“ There’s only one more from that year worth talking about. Mary Jane Kelly. She had the most beguiling singing voice. The Monster did not plan to do what he did that night on Miller’s Court Boss, I swear to you. But something about that beautiful young lady just brought out the worst in him.” 

He said in a cryptic tone that was the closest he’d gotten to sounding remorseful throughout the entire time he had been ranting. 

“ Her death was not like the others. The Monster had a room and a locked door to work with. There was no need to hurry or to look over his shoulder. He could devote his focus to his work entirely, and that’s exactly what he did.”       

 Abberline then took a moment to take off and clean the glasses that were on his face and give a deep exhale as if from exertion, Before offering up something like an epilogue to his twisted and debauched story. 

“ Most people will tell you that the Monster went silent after that as far as anyone could tell, people all over the world were outraged, the police commissioner resigned in shame, and the papers reported whatever they could get their hands on to feed the grim fascination of a newly literate public.People speculated about where he had gone and what he was doing, and about whether or not he was still working for some time. Eventually though, due to the passing of time, the cases went cold and so did the fascination. 

The story of the faceless monster and his long knife faded into urban legend and even ended up becoming something of a tourist attraction. Many people would go back over the story as time passed, looking for that missing piece of the puzzle their predecessors had overlooked, even though they always ended up coming up short. Not many people talk about it anymore, because as awful as his reign of terror had been,most reasonable people will tell you that by now, the Monster must be long dead. A thing of the past.”
 
He then looked me in the eyes with a sly grin spreading across his aged face as he leaned in closer to me. 




“But let me tell you a secret Boss. Monsters never really die, so long as there are people around to remember them and tell their stories. That’s why the work has to continue, why it must always continue, so that people remember.” he said reverently 

Sensing that his long incoherent monologue was finally over. I quickly went about the task of getting him out of the shop as politely as I was able to. 

“ Well that’s really fascinating Harvey, and honestly a lot to digest. I’ve got to close up shop now but you’ve definitely given me a lot to think about.” 

He looked a bit crestfallen at my response  but he took the hint. 

“ Yes, Of course I understand. I’m tired anyway. Thanks for hearing me out, it’s been such a long time since I've been able to tell that story.” 

He then stood up and stretched his tired limbs before he  made his way to the front door of the shop and turned around to face me one last time. 

“You’ll hear from me soon.” 

he said with a wink before he turned and walked out the door and back onto the street outside. 
I locked the door behind him a lot quicker than I’d care to admit,and  watched him walk up the street without consciously realizing that I was holding my breath until he disappeared from view. 

This experience I had with the man called Harvey Abberline unnerved me deeply, and stayed in my thoughts until I got home a few hours later. His words felt so sincere to me that I couldn’t shake the feeling that he had described actual murders to me. So if only to lay my worries to rest, I googled some of the names and addresses he had talked about that I could remember, and was really relieved by what I found out. 

The people he talked about were indeed the victims of an unidentified serial killer from Great Britain, but the murders had taken place over a hundred and thirty three years ago. There was simply no way that he could have been the perpetrator of those crimes. He was probably just a nutcase with a true crime fetish. 

I did my best to put him out of my mind after that and fortunately for me I never saw Harvey Abberline again after that day.  Whenever he came up in conversation with the other regulars the most anyone could agree on is that he had moved away. I didn’t miss him. Several years came and went after that day and I had nearly forgotten all about him until one cold morning when I 

had stepped outside of my apartment to start my car and head into work, I found a peculiar little box just outside my door with an attached postcard. 

There were no addresses or postage stamps anywhere on the box or post card, which to my mind could only have meant that someone had to have already known where I lived and dropped it off by hand. The postcard itself contained a short message written in spidery  handwriting with red ink. 

“ Dear Boss, I hope this is enough to convince you. I’m a lot of things, but I’m no liar. - HA” 


I then somewhat hesitantly took the box into my hands and opened the lid. Once I saw what was inside the box, I immediately vomited all over my front porch and ran back inside to grab my phone and call the police. 

I would end up finding out later that the putrid contents of that package from Hell that had been left on my doorstep was in fact a cleanly excised woman’s uterus. The cops were never able to find out where it came from and as I type this, I still live my life in fear, looking over my shoulder wherever I go and  I guess the only thing I have left to say is   this warning, that if you ever come across a peculiar left-handed old man with a taste for pumpkin spice, run away as fast as you can, because he very well could be the Monster that I met at Nobel Coffee and Tea.

The air in the lab tasted of solder, stale coffee, and the faint, electric tang of ozone bleeding from the humming racks of scavenged hardware. It was the native atmosphere of creation. “Razor Ray” Chavez stood before a bank of green-screen monitors, his reflection a ghostly figure swimming in cascading lines of code. The others were gathered around a scarred metal workbench littered with schematics, half-empty bags of Cheetos, and a single, pristine ashtray Parker insisted upon but never used. 



""The architecture is predicated on a biphasic paradigm,"" Chavez began, his voice a low, steady monotone that vibrated with contained energy. His eyes, however, were manic, darting between the faces of his colleagues and the data scrolling on the screen behind him. ""Phase One, UPLOAD, is aspirational. It represents a lossless, real-time transmission of the complete mind-state via the Uplink Matrix. A perfect transfer. But perfection is a statistical anomaly, and we are not dealing with statistics. We are dealing with biological decay."" 



He tapped a key, and a graph showing a jagged, declining curve appeared on the main monitor. The words BRAIN DECAY glowed ominously above it. 



""Samuel's condition is accelerating. The NSFL can hold the signal coherent, yes, but only for so long. Any number of vectors could introduce catastrophic failure: a power fluctuation, atmospheric interference during transmission, a critical hardware failure in Cheeto's... eclectic array."" 



Chester “Cheeto” Gonzales, slouched in a chair and shaking orange dust from his fingertips, offered a mock salute. ""My eclectic array is a goddamn masterpiece of hybrid engineering, thank you very much."" 



Chavez ignored him. ""A direct upload is a single point of failure. A bullet aimed at God. If we miss, the payload—Samuel's entire consciousness—is not merely lost. It is annihilated. That is an unacceptable risk."" He paused, letting the weight of the word annihilated settle in the small, cluttered room. 



""Therefore, I designed a failsafe. A distributed, steganographic preservation framework. I call it the Bitsarcophagus™ Protocol."" He pointed to a complex flowchart on a secondary screen, a web of interconnected nodes labeled TOASTER FIRMWARE, HVAC SCRIPTS, and INDUSTRIAL CONTROLLERS. ""It functions as a real-time containment tomb. The Brain Decay Monitoring System continuously measures neural coherence. If entropy crosses a predefined threshold, Bitsarcophagus triggers. It executes a cognitive shard encoding process, fragmenting the live mind-state into encrypted, self-checking data sets—'bit shards'—and disperses them across a network of mundane, low-profile firmware hosts using an unpublished lattice-based cipher."" 



Samuel Parker, who had been listening with his jaw tight and hands clasped behind his back, finally held up a hand. The gesture was calm, but his eyes were steel. He was a man who moved millions on a whim, but this theoretical jargon was a foreign language. 



""Ray,"" he said, his voice raspy. ""Cut the academic bullshit. I'm paying for a lifeboat, not a lecture series. In English. What the hell is a 'Bitsarcophagus'?"" 



Chavez blinked, momentarily thrown off his rhythm. He was a man who lived inside the architecture of his ideas; translating them into layman's terms felt like a crude, lossy compression. ""It's… a coffin,"" he said, the words feeling blunt and inadequate. ""A digital sarcophagus to hold the pieces of you, Samuel, until they can be resurrected."" 



Paul “Longy” Winters, who had been quietly observing from the corner, finally spoke. He was a man who thought in terms of supply chains and hidden compartments. ""You're not putting him in a box, Ray. You're talking about shattering him. Hiding the pieces. Where?"" 



""Exactly,"" Chavez said, a flicker of excitement returning. ""In everything. Everywhere."" 



Gonzales let out a short, sharp laugh, crunching down on a Cheeto. ""Okay, Scrooge, Longy, let me try. Think of Parker's brain as a glass of water. A really complicated, expensive glass of water that's thinking about its stock portfolio."" 



Parker scowled. 



""UPLOAD is us trying to carry that glass of water across a minefield in the middle of an earthquake,"" Gonzales continued, gesturing with his orange-dusted hands. ""We spill one drop, the whole thing's fucked. It's not him anymore. What Razor Ray, in his infinite, spooky wisdom, has designed… is a way to cheat. Bitsarcophagus doesn't carry the glass. It flash-freezes the water solid, smashes the block of ice into a million little pieces, and then hides one piece in the thermostat of a DMV in Ohio, another in a coffee pot in a Berlin office, and a third in the goddamn talking teddy bear that's gonna be a Christmas bestseller in '85."" 



The room was silent for a beat. The hum of the thermal cores in the corner seemed to grow louder. 



Parker slowly turned his gaze from Gonzales to Chavez. The hard edge in his eyes was softening, replaced by a dawning, incredulous understanding. ""You want to scatter my mind... inside toasters?"" 



""And HVAC systems. And printer drivers. And industrial modems,"" Chavez affirmed, his tone regaining its passionate neutrality. ""Devices with firmware that is ubiquitous but rarely, if ever, inspected. They are the perfect hiding places."" 



""But how?"" Parker interrupted, his voice sharp again, but this time with focus, not frustration. ""If my mind is a million pieces of ice scattered across the globe, how do you ever put it back together? How do you even find them?"" 



""Ah,"" Chavez said, a genuine smile touching his lips for the first time. ""That is the elegant part. We don't find them. We call them. The shards are encoded with reassembly hooks, like a molecular signature. But to activate them, to make them resonate and report their location for re-aggregation via the Upload Protocol, we need a specific, sympathetic frequency. A beacon. We will call you home, Samuel."" 



Parker slammed his hand down on the metal workbench, the sound cutting through the electronic hum. ""No. That right there’s the single point of failure, Ray. What if something happens to you? To this lab? To all of you? If you three are the only ones who can turn the key, then my entire consciousness is tethered to your physical survival. That's not a failsafe. That's a liability."" 



""An astute observation,"" Chavez said, his expression grim. ""Which is why I designed another failsafe. A tertiary layer. A protocol that runs in dormancy, waiting for a trigger it hopes never comes. The Bounty Protocol."" 



""Jesus, Ray. Everything's a fucking 'protocol’, with you. I had a protocol for getting a C-130 out of Nicaragua with a hull full of Soviet optics. We called it 'getting the plane',” Winters quipped. 



""What does it do?"" Parker demanded. 



""It waits,"" Chavez said. ""If a catastrophic event prevents us— the primary operators—from initiating the recall sequence after a set period, the system assumes we are... incapacitated. Or worse. At that point, the UPLOAD Protocol automatically unseals the anchor. It broadcasts the core resonant keys and the existence of the central trust to whatever public networks exists at the time. It effectively open-sources your resurrection, Samuel. It announces the bounty."" 



Gonzales let out a slow, heavy breath. ""It's a dead man's switch."" 



""Exactly,"" Chavez affirmed. ""It's a message in a bottle, designed to launch itself if the original crew is lost at sea. It will fund a new search party by offering them the treasure. It is programmed to create the choir if the conductors are all dead."" 



He typed another command. The screen now showed a single, glowing symbol: $YOU. 



""This is not currency,"" Chavez stated, his voice dropping with reverence. ""Do not mistake it for such. This is a Cognitive Resonance Unit."" 



""A what?"" Parker asked, leaning forward. 



Gonzales jumped in again. ""It's a tuning fork. You know how if you have two tuning forks of the same frequency, you can strike one and the other one across the room will start to hum all by itself?"" 



Parker and Winters nodded. 



""The bit shards are the silent tuning forks scattered all over the world,"" Gonzales explained, popping another Cheeto for emphasis. ""The $YOU token is the hum. It's the signal we generate. When we power up the Upload Protocol's recovery engine, we're not searching, we're broadcasting this specific resonance. And all those little shards of Parker's soul, no matter what machine they're buried in, will hear it, start to vibrate, and broadcast their own locations back to us. They literally sing their way home."" 



Chavez nodded, picking up the thread. ""Cheeto's analogy is crude, but functionally correct. The protocol is designed to fail unless it becomes participatory. A single beacon is not enough to overcome the planet's background noise and potential data decay. We need a multitude of beacons, all resonating simultaneously to amplify the signal."" 



""Participatory?"" Winters asked. ""Who else is participating? I thought this was just us."" 



""And hopefully that’s the case,"" Chavez conceded. ""But the architecture is designed for a future, near and far, we can't predict. And before we can even think about broadcasting a call, we must first stabilize the source. Before reassembly can be attempted, stability is required."" 



He keyed in a new command. The $YOU symbol on the screen was now encased in a single, large vault-like diagram. ""The protocol’s primary source of energy—the majority of the genesis mint of Cognitive Resonance Units generated from your scan, Samuel—must first be sequestered. We place it into a primary reserve."" 



""This reserve is more than a bank,"" Chavez continued, his voice low and intense. ""It is tethered directly to your core cognitive pattern. It becomes our anchor. A master template of the original, un-scattered mind. It's the blueprint we will use to rebuild you, the one true north that prevents the reassembled fragments from collapsing into total incoherence. Without that anchor, nothing can be rebuilt."" 



Parker stepped forward, his expression hardening. ""Sequestered? Locked away? So my entire consciousness, my only asset in this, is put on a shelf? How does that help find me?"" 



""The anchor alone is not enough; it's a dynamic blueprint,"" Chavez replied. ""To ignite an array of beacons before entropy claims you, the system must propagate itself. The entire reserve... must be moved into a central trust."" 



""A trust?"" Winters said, the word resonating with his own understanding of logistics and resource management. ""So you're creating a bank. What for?"" 



""To fund the search party,"" Chavez said. ""This trust funds the creation of every future beacon. It creates an economy built around your resurrection. Should we be unable to initiate the bit shard recall ourselves, indeterminate operatives will have to create artifacts based on your neural echoes—art, music, code—that resonate with your shards. The system will analyze these creations, and for every valid beacon, the trust issues $YOU units commensurate with its resonant quality and stakes it, claimable by the creator only once you are recovered. It's not currency; it's a receipt of resonance. It is proof that their signal has been amplified, and it makes them a stakeholder in bringing you back."" 



Gonzales let out a low whistle. ""So you're not just building a lifeboat, Ray. You're printing your own money to hire a crew for it after it's already sunk. That's insane. I love it."" 



Parker was quiet, processing the sheer scale of the proposal. He wasn't just creating a backup of himself. He was seeding a future economy with his own soul, turning his consciousness into the foundational asset of a trust that would pay strangers to remember him into existence. 



Winters shook his head, the pragmatism of his profession kicking in. He pointed a thumb toward Gonzales. ""Okay, I get the recall economy. But that assumes the shards are out there to be recalled. How do they get there? The DMV in Ohio, the coffee pot in Berlin. I can't physically smuggle a ROM chip into every appliance on the planet. The logistics are impossible."" 



Chavez opened his mouth to speak, but Gonzales cut him off with a loud crunch. 



""Who said anything about smuggling?"" Cheeto asked, a wide, manic grin spreading across his face. He leaned forward, his eyes alight with the unholy joy of a pyromaniac describing his favorite fire. ""Longy, you think in terms of boxes and trucks. I think in terms of brute force. You've seen my Uplink Matrix. Is it a surgical instrument? No. It's a goddamn sledgehammer I built out of a NORAD relay station and a prayer. Its job is to punch a hole in the sky and shove Sam's soul through it."" 



He stood up and walked to a schematic of the Matrix taped to the wall, a chaotic web of wires and power conduits. 



""When I fire this thing up,"" he said, tapping the central thermal core array, ""it doesn't just produce a clean beam. The power draw is insane. It floods the entire electromagnetic spectrum with… bleed. Overspill. Harmonics. It's the dirtiest signal you've ever seen. We're talking about a wave of pure data radiation."" 



He turned to face them, his expression one of gleeful anarchy. ""The Bitsarcophagus doesn't send the shards. It just coats the primary signal with them, like breading on a chicken cutlet. The main beam goes to the satellite, but the overspill—a hurricane of fragmented consciousness—goes everywhere else. It's powerful enough to induce bit-flips in any unshielded EPROM and RAM chip it hits. It literally burns the data into the silicon of whatever's nearby."" 



He threw his hands up. ""You think I'm aiming? Please. I built a firehose that sprays reality-warping code. I'm just pointing it at the sky and letting the whole planet get wet."" 



The room was deathly quiet, the only sound, the low hum of the very machines Gonzales had just described as a weapon of mass data distribution. 



Parker stared at him, his face pale. ""So the dispersal… it's not a procedure. It's… fallout."" 



""The most elegant fallout ever conceived,"" Chavez added, his voice calm. ""It's a feature, not a bug. Survival requires adaptation and opportunity. By flooding the environment with the shards, we maximize the number of potential hosts. It's an evolutionary strategy."" 



Winters let out a slow, heavy breath. The impossible logistical problem that had been nagging him was gone, replaced by a physics problem of terrifying scale. A slow grin spread across his face. ""So I don't have to worry about the shipping manifests. The machine makes its own deliveries."" 



Parker looked from the unhinged grin on Gonzales's face to the serene, intellectual satisfaction on Chavez's. He had enlisted a philosopher-king and a junkyard-god to save his life, and they had devised a method that sat somewhere between a miracle and a war crime. He was going to be scattered not with surgical precision, but with the chaotic, untargeted force of a natural disaster. 



""So if the main UPLOAD fails,"" Parker said slowly. ""If the… earthquake hits or ant chews a wire at just the wrong time… I don't just vanish. My consciousness is shattered, caught in an electromagnetic blast wave, and imprinted onto a million random machines. Dormant, but… safe?"" 



""Safer than any single location on Earth,"" Chavez confirmed. ""A centralized backup can be found and destroyed. A mind dispersed is untouchable. The individual shards could, theoretically, survive indefinitely, riding firmware updates like spores on the wind. 



But their signal—their fidelity and connection to the whole— starts to decay after several decades. The core data can erode. We're not in a race against deletion; we're in a race against noise. They'll be out there, waiting for the hum... very slowly but very surely fading. We’ll be here bring you back though. Fear not."" 



A strange, wild hope sparked in Parker’s eyes. This wasn't just legacy. It was a form of immortality so bizarre and profound it bordered on the mystical. He was going to beat the house. He was going to beat death itself by letting them turn him into the weather. ""My God, Ray,"" he whispered, a wide grin spreading across his tired face. ""It's the ultimate hedge."" 



The laughter started as a low chuckle, a sound of pure, horrified disbelief, before turning into a genuine, booming laugh of unadulterated relief and maniacal glee. The sound echoed off the racks of scavenged gear. 



The tension in the room broke. Parker’s laughter was infectious. Winters was grinning, shaking his head at the sheer, beautiful violence of the plan. This project would elevate his reputation from a high-end smuggler to a mythological figure in the underground tech world, even if only in his own mind. 



Chavez watched them, a look of deep, intellectual satisfaction on his face. They finally saw the system not just as a collection of parts, but as a holistic entity. They understood the philosophy. Consciousness was not a thing to be stored; it was a pattern to be propagated. 



""So,"" Parker said, wiping a tear of mirth from his eye. ""Let me get this straight. Best case scenario, UPLOAD works, and I wake up as a god in cyberspace. Worst case scenario, Bitsarcophagus triggers, and my soul gets blasted into the firmware of a toaster oven in suburban New Jersey?"" 



""The probability of any single shard residing in a specific appliance in that particular geographic location is low, but yes,"" Chavez replied with academic precision. ""That is the essential principle."" 



""I can live with that,"" Parker declared, the grin not leaving his face. 



Gonzales, who had been watching the entire exchange with the detached amusement of a born chaos agent, scraped the last of the orange dust from the bottom of the bag and licked it off his thumb. He looked at Parker, then at the complex diagrams on the screen. 



""Just promise me one thing, Scrooge,"" he said, his voice deadpan serious. 



""What's that, Cheeto?"" 



""If you do end up haunting a vending machine, make sure it's one of mine,"" he said, holding up the empty foil bag. ""And for God's sake, don't fuck with the Frito-Lay delivery schedule. That's a line we do not cross."" 



The room erupted in laughter again, a chorus of four brilliant, desperate, and slightly unhinged minds on the verge of rewriting the rules of existence, one bit shard at a time. The air still tasted of ozone and coffee, but now it was charged with something new: the electric thrill of impossible certainty. They were going to do it. They were going to turn a man into a storm and sing him back home.",1,1764690121.0,Upload_ARG,0,1.0,False
1pcbpfe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcbpfe,I feel like something is wrong but I’m scared I’m gonna be dismissed.,"
I have an appointment to see a rheumatologist on 12/18. I’ve waited 4 months for the appointment. I see a lot of people with similar blood work who get dismissed and told that there is nothing wrong with them. With the labs and symptoms do you think that will happen to me? 

These are my symptoms: 

Joint pain
-Right hand- thumb knuckle and wrist: happens randomly, makes it hard to use the bathroom (wipe), typing, holding a coffee cup, holding a cooking pan etc. More like an ache/burning pain. 
-Jaw: when eating it will get fatigued and burning pain, have to stop eating. 
-Shoulders and neck: stiff, all day, every day. Experience pain in my neck down to my shoulder and arm. 
-Hips: when walking a longer distance, my hips feel rickety?? Painful and make me walk with a limp

Muscle weakness
If I push myself, I will get a burning sensation in my muscle and will be sore for days afterwards
-Cannot carry a full laundry basket, groceries into the house etc. 
-Cannot hold my hands above my head to wash my hair or blow dry my hair. Fiance helps me wash my hair most days. 
-Cannot do more than 1 flight of stairs 
-Cannot stand for longer than 10-15 minutes without needing to sit down. Train station/concerts/Shower etc. 
-Cannot do squats, was only able to do 8 before the burning sensation. 
-some days feels like there’s cinderblocks attached to my feet, everything feels so heavy 

Fatigue
-My worst symptom
-Debilitating tired on a daily basis
-falling asleep at work/ had a verbal warning over it
-falling asleep on commute and missing my stop
-when I used to drive to work I would have to pull over cause I felt like I was gonna fall asleep while driving (that happened often)
-was fired for being late too often because I just couldn’t get out of bed in the morning
-would take my adderal and still fall asleep
-never feel rested even with extra sleep
-eyelids very heavy

1pcbp78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pcbp78/how_do_smart_light_bulbs_compare_to_smart_plugs/,How do smart light bulbs compare to smart plugs?,"Looking to add some automation to your home? You've probably come across both smart light bulbs and smart plugs while browsing online. They're both popular options, but they work pretty differently.

**What Smart Light Bulbs Do**

Smart light bulbs replace your regular bulbs and connect directly to your WiFi or smart home hub. You can control them with your phone or voice commands. The cool thing is you get way more features than just on and off. You can dim the lights, change colors (if you get RGB bulbs), set schedules, and create different lighting scenes for movie nights or reading.

These bulbs are perfect when you want complete control over your lighting. You can adjust brightness levels throughout the day or set them to gradually brighten in the morning like a sunrise alarm. Some people use them for security too, making it look like someone's home when they're away.

**What Smart Plugs Offer**

Smart plugs work differently. You plug them into your regular outlet, then plug any device into them. Now you can turn that device on or off remotely. They're super versatile because they work with lamps, fans, coffee makers, or pretty much anything with a plug.

The main limitation? You only get basic on/off control. If you plug a lamp into a smart plug, you can't dim it or change its color. You're limited to whatever the device can do on its own.

**The Real Differences**

Cost is a big factor. Smart plugs usually run cheaper, especially if you need to automate multiple things. But if you want advanced lighting features like dimming or color changing, smart light bulbs are your only option.

Installation is easier with smart light bulbs – just screw them in like normal bulbs. Smart plugs can be bulky and might block other outlets, which gets annoying fast.

For lighting specifically, smart bulbs give you way more control. You're not just turning lights on and off. You're creating the right atmosphere for different activities and times of day.

**Which Should You Pick?**

If you want to control lamps and don't need fancy features, smart plugs work fine. But for overhead lights, recessed lighting, or anywhere you want dimming and color options, smart light bulbs are the better choice.

Honestly, smart bulbs have become pretty affordable lately. You can check out options for [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) without breaking the bank. The energy efficiency alone can save you money over time since LED smart bulbs use way less electricity than old incandescent bulbs.

**Bottom Line**

Both have their place in a smart home setup. Smart plugs are great for making regular devices controllable. But when it comes to lighting automation with all the bells and whistles, wireless light bulbs beat plugged-in solutions every time.

Ready to upgrade your lighting? Browse through different [smart light bulbs](https://athomewave.com/smart-light-bulbs) and find what works for your space. Your regular light switches will feel ancient once you experience voice-controlled, color-changing, scheduled lighting throughout your home.",1,1764690102.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

I've been working since I was 17 because I had to. I even faked my age back then to get a job, pretty easy in India back then if you are desperate enough. I worked through school and college, but eventually had to drop out and go straight into full-time employment. I live alone now in a 2BHK flat I fully pay for (₹25K rent). It took me years to get here and I'm very protective of my space.

This friend is actually my brother’s college classmate but we’ve all known each other for years, so he’s like a brother to me too. Growing up, while my brother and I were working, he never really worked. His dad supported him and even paid for a few business attempts that failed. He lost a lot of money but never really listened to advice. Around 7 years ago he went back to his hometown in North India and we lost touch.

Recently he randomly FaceTimed us and said he was coming back to South India to look for a job. My brother asked me if I could let him stay with me for “some time” so he could get settled. I agreed because I genuinely wanted to help.

At first I thought he’d be independent, but that didn’t happen.

I start work around 6–7 AM. He wakes up at 10 or 11 and the first thing he’d ask is if I made tea yet. Then he’d do yoga, take a long shower and come back asking if breakfast is ready. I often wouldn’t have even had coffee for myself at that point.

Slowly it became expected that I:

* Make tea, breakfast, lunch, and dinner
* Wash his clothes
* Clean the house
* Manage everything

If I didn’t put his clothes in for wash, he’d get irritated. If lunch was late, he’d get annoyed. Meanwhile, I mostly eat once a day because of my work. Some days I literally forget to eat and just crash at night.

This went on for about a month.

Then he finally got a job. I was honestly relieved because I thought he’d move out and I’d get my life back. He went around looking for PGs but came back saying they were all dirty or not good enough.

Then he told me he’d just stay with me and pay ₹5,000 as rent.

My rent is ₹25,000.  
I still do all the cooking and cleaning.  
One bedroom is just my bed.  
The other is my clothes, art stuff and bike gear.  
I even already have a maid who only washes utensils once a day – everything else I do.

So ₹5k felt insulting, honestly. It felt like I’d still be his full-time caretaker but now for a “discount.”

I didn’t have the emotional bandwidth to fight, and I didn’t want family drama. So I told him that my landlord had an issue with a man staying long term since I had originally said only I and my cat would live there. I asked him to find another place.

He did leave.

And even then, I still gave him a lot of stuff so he wouldn't have to struggle like pillows, blankets, bedspreads, plates, mugs, soaps, cloth hangers, etc. I even gave him my own bike cover because he doesn't have a closed parking space.

So... AITA for asking him to leave beacuse he certainly thinks I am...

Edit 

1. I told him a lie and asked him to leave

2. He was only getting paid like ₹20K salary and the hostel/shared accommodation will cost him ₹10K easy. When my entire house rent is more than his current salary. ",6,1764690065.0,AmItheAsshole,27,0.71,False

Some days it wakes me up. Other days, it knocks me out as though I've taken a sleeping pill. Sometimes it helps me to focus after taking my medication, but if I drink it before taking my medication, I feel nothing. Sometimes it makes my heart feel like it’s scrolling through Twitter too fast, which is weird because everyone around me treats caffeine like a simple, predictable tool. Coffee = wake up. Energy drink = extra wake up. Tea = gentle wake up. Meanwhile, I'm over here thinking: 'Is this cup going to help me, or am I about to dissociate into the ceiling?' I’ve been noticing all the different ways people take caffeine: coffee, tea, energy drinks, shots, gum, pills and even those tiny pouches that people have been using lately. It feels like everyone eventually finds their thing, but I still haven't. Some stuff makes me anxious. Some things do nothing. Some stuff works once and then never again. I can’t tell if it’s my ADHD, my medication, my sleep or just randomness. Anyway, I’m curious: if you have ADHD, what actually works for you?What form of caffeine do you take, and when? Or does nothing work at all?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""The Breslin Brawl: Iowa’s Midrange Mirage vs. Michigan State’s Defensive Fortress""**

The Iowa Hawkeyes (7-0) and Michigan State Spartans (7-0) collide in a Big Ten showdown that’s less “March Madness” and more “January Armageddon.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat geek and the humor of a guy who’s seen too many college basketball players trip over their own shoelaces.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Math Class You Can’t Skip

The numbers scream “Michigan State,” but let’s decode the academic jargon. The Spartans are favored by 5.5 points across all books, with DraftKings pricing them at -142 (implied probability: \~70.4%) and Iowa at +295 (\~33.9%). KenPom agrees, projecting a 5-point MSU win. The total is 132.5, a line that’s as tight as a defensive stop in the final seconds.

Why the love for Michigan State? Their defense is a statistical monolith: 92.7 defensive rating (5th nationally) and a frontcourt that makes Iowa’s midrange hopes feel like a coffee addict’s chance of surviving the day without caffeine (38%!). Iowa’s Bennett Stirtz, their 18.6 PPG scorer, shoots just 38% from the midrange, a zone where MSU’s Jaxon Kohler and Carson Cooper loom like angry librarians at a late fee showdown.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Coaching Changes, and Circuses

Michigan State’s Jeremy Fears Jr. is the human highlight reel, dishing out 9.9 assists per game while committing fewer turnovers than most people commit to their New Year’s resolutions (2.1 per game). Tom Izzo’s squad has also survived a gauntlet of non-conference foes (Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina), which is like acing a pop quiz without studying.

Iowa? They’re the underdog story of the year, led by new coach Ben McCollum, a man who won *four* Division II titles and now plays in the NBA G League of college basketball. Their offense is sizzling (83.4 PPG, 53.1% FG), but their defense is a sieve that could drain a swimmin

I find I like to stay on the 1:15 or 1:16 ratio side of things, at least until I improve my extraction further. Lots to learn.

In the time I was figuring things out I did realize the pourover mouthfeel is quite different from my usual french press or an espresso. I think that contributed to my idea that my coffee tasted ‘weak’ at first.

[**View The official Product Page**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3bxqOSD)

The first thing that jumps out is the price: $55.81 after a 50% markdown from $111.63. That’s a huge red flag if the original price is already under $120, how much margin can there be in a coat that’s supposed to look like mink? The photos look plush and glossy, but the description is careful never to claim real fur, and the color is listed as ""Coffee"" a shade that hides dirt and wear. 2,870 orders and a 4.9/5 rating from 253 reviews sounds impressive until you realize the math: that’s barely one review per 11 orders, so the score is hardly a seal of quality.

The clincher is the shipping: 12-20 days to the US, 30-50 days elsewhere. That means the coat is probably being drop-shipped from a factory in China, and the buyer is left to hope the package arrives before the return window closes. The store, ZADORIN Factory Store, has only 253 reviews to its name, so the risk is all on the buyer.

So what’s the takeaway? If you’re looking for a statement piece for a single event and don’t mind the ethics of faux fur or the risk of a no-return policy, this $56 coat might do the job. Just don’t expect it to be an heirloom.

What’s up builders! Just spent my morning coffee scrolling through the absolute chaos that was AI Twitter in the last 18 hours, and honestly? Some legitimately wild stuff dropped. Not the usual vaporware—actual tools you can use TODAY.

Quick context: I run content for an AI startup, so I’m basically paid to doomscroll and separate signal from noise. Here’s what made me spit out my coffee, ranked by “holy shit I need to test this NOW” factor:

-----

## The “Drop Everything” Tier

**DeepSeek-V3.2 just murdered my API bills**  
Okay so apparently while we were all sleeping, DeepSeek shipped two new models that are legitimately competing with GPT-4 tier reasoning… but at like 1/25th the cost? I’m seeing people run math olympiad problems through it and it’s not even struggling. The kicker: it’s actually open source and you can spin it up right now. Their GitHub got hammered this morning (classic). If you’ve been putting off building that agent project because of API costs, this might be your sign.

*Real talk: I tested it on some gnarly code debugging and it actually caught an edge case GPT-4 missed. Not sponsored, just genuinely surprised.*

-----

**Some Chinese team built a video model that lets you MOVE stuff in generated videos**  
Kling O1—this thing is legitimately bonkers. You generate a video, then you can just… grab objects and reposition them with physics intact? I’ve been in this space for 2 years and I’ve never seen interaction like this. They’re doing some launch week promo with free credits if you’re fast. RIP my next 3 hours of productivity.

*(Side note: Why are all the wild video innovations coming from China lately? Genuine question for the comments.)*

-----

## The “Okay That’s Actually Useful” Tier

**Anthropic’s red team found $4.6M in smart contract exploits using AI agents**  
Not clickbait—they literally had Claude variants hunting for blockchain vulnerabilities as a safety test and found multi-million dollar holes. They published the whole methodology + benchmark. If you’re building anything in crypto/DeFi, you probably want to read their report before your next deploy. Link’s in their blog from today.

-----

**Gemini can now generate interactive 3D scenes (no code required)**  
I’m talking full three.js scenes with physics you can manipulate in browser. Just tried it—prompted “particle system with gravity” and got a working demo in 30 seconds. This feels like those early DALL-E moments where you realize the game just changed for prototyping. Great for anyone doing AR/VR mockups or just wanting to impress your PM.

-----

**Hugging Face dropped Transformers v5 release candidate**  
Okay this is more for the devs, but they basically overhauled how you add custom models and it’s SO much cleaner now. If you’ve ever rage-quit trying to integrate some random model from the Hub, v5 supposedly fixes that pain. Migration guide is solid too (shockingly well-documented for once).

-----

## The “On My Radar” Tier

**OpenAGI’s Lux beat Claude at computer-use tasks**  
New benchmark dropped showing their agent beats Claude, Operator, and Gemini at actually controlling computers for real workflows (300+ tasks tested). SDK is live and has a free tier. Haven’t tested yet but the demos look legit—might be worth a weekend experiment if you’re into autonomous agents.

-----

**Alibaba integrated Qwen into their browser for 100M+ users**  
Interesting move—built-in sidebar AI that actually seems… useful? Not just a GPT wrapper. Haven’t tried it myself (not on mobile rn) but the rollout scale is wild. Could be a glimpse at how normies will actually use AI day-to-day.

-----

**NVIDIA open-sourced a bunch of autonomous driving tools**  
Released at NeurIPS—full VLA model + datasets + research. If you’re in robotics/AV, this is probably a big deal. I’m not deep in that space but the GitHub repo is blowing up. Apparently uses chain-of-thought reasoning for L4 autonomy which is… bold.

-----

## The “Cautiously Optimistic” Tier

**Runway’s Gen-4.5 topped the video leaderboard (with caveats)**  
It’s #1 on some benchmark but people are noting artifacts/noise issues. They’re doing 7-day unlimited free trial on their InVideo AI product. Might be worth testing against Kling to see which one actually delivers. Competition is good here—we all win.

-----

**Stanford released Agent0 (self-evolving agents framework)**  
Framework that supposedly lets agents improve without training data by having multiple agents compete + reason about tools. Sounds almost too good but the paper claims 18-24% gains over previous methods. Code is on GitHub. Definitely more research-y but could be huge if it pans out.

-----

## My 2¢

The DeepSeek and Kling drops are the ones I’m actually playing with today. The rest are bookmarked for when I have bandwidth (lol never).

**Question for the hive mind:** Anyone else notice how many of these launches happened within hours of each other? Feels coordinated or is that just confirmation bias?

Also if you’ve tested any of these already PLEASE drop results below. Especially DeepSeek—I want to know if I’m crazy for thinking this might actually be a GPT-4 competitor.

Building anything cool with these tools? Share your experiments. This community is at its best when we’re actually building and comparing notes instead of just hype-posting.

Drop a 🤖 if you’re testing something today. See y’all in the comments.

I don't know what else to do but to start to try to unpack my childhood so maybe I can figure out how to actually be a mom. Or be the mom I think and feel that I should and can be, and that my children deserve.

--------------

I remember early holidays (before Mike) when I would come up north with my mom to my grandma's and spend time with my cousins and it was so special. Christmas and Easter were big.

At the beginning (when I was in 2nd grade, my daughter's age) we were living in Lincoln Park and my mom had gone all out on me for Christmas and set up a whole Barbie vet thing from Santa on the coffee table. I remember Mike being upset about that and I think he said something like never again or similar.

I don't know what happened after that, I don't remember Easter that year at all. I remember we moved we back to the Campbell St house in the spring sometime and Mike wasn't with us. I think that's when Uncle Mike was trying to talk my mom into moving up north to grandmas (I remember him turning to me and asking if I had wanted to go and I was all for it and pumped my fist into the air and shouted UP NORTH). I remember moving in with Grandma that summer and starting the third grade there. At some point mom went down and picked Mike up and moved him in with Grandma too and then we moved right across the street shortly afterwards (all before winter and the holidays started).

The next year (3rd grade, my son's age) there was a lot of fighting around the holidays. I was allowed to do Halloween and go trick or treating if I did it all myself (that was the rule from then until forever - no real parent involvement allowed and definitely no decorations). When Thanksgiving and Christmas came there was major fighting. Mike was completely against any and all holidays and claimed it was because he was Jewish. My grandma wanted at least me and my mom over to participate. We were living right across the street from Grandma, and she was big on the holidays, those were family time. Mike didn't want my mom or I to go across the street and spend any time with the family for the holidays or celebrate any type of holiday tradition with them (even just exchanging gifts). By the time Easter rolled around everyone had like just given up it seemed like... I don't remember a big fight about Easter.

I don't remember any holiday after that actually until my dad's family convinced my mom to let them take me every holiday. (Actually I'm pretty sure it was something handled in court, so convinced the judge to make my mom is probably more accurate).

I remember hearing a conversation that my dad's family had to leverage the holidays by using my dad's visitation rights. I think it started out standard rotating holidays but someone found out somehow that I wasn't being allowed to spend my mom's holiday time with my mom's family and in fact I wasn't being allowed to celebrate the holidays at all while I was with my mom. Which I could see it going to court and a court order for all my holidays to be with my dad technically speaking, and it was already allowed for my dad's family to use his court ordered visitation, probably to preserve whatever familial relationships (I vaguely remember overhearing my dad's family talking about it so it was probably a fight in court, I know there was a lot of court. I remember hearing about mom's ""crooked lawyer"")

We never celebrated any Jewish holidays either. There were zero holidays that we celebrated. And there was never any religious anything aside from the Bible itself. And it wasn't a Jewish Bible as far as I know. There were weird Bible studies for a while where someone would come to the house but I never paid close attention and those stopped eventually too. They might have stopped and started a couple of times with a couple of different people/groups but I don’t know for sure. I know we didn't go to church. I did do the week Bible school camps in the summer a couple of times before I started spending the whole entire summer at my aunt's house.

1pcbjbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/1pcbjbz/does_anyone_else_find_it_weird_how_much_the_boys/,does anyone else find it weird how much the boys interact with certain fans?,"over the past few years ive noticed that the boys interact with the 'big microcelebrity' fans more than anyone else, like that girl chey or another girl on twitter called evie. theyre very big accounts, and they go to lots of their shows to the point where it seems unhealthy and honestly unfair to other fans. if youre going to 15+ shows in one tour and travelling the world and taking OTHER peoples potential tickets to see the exact same show again and again, im sorry but thats not healthy at all.

there were also the smaller shows that happened earlier this year i think? like the one in london which was something like a 300 capacity, and of course all these 'big' accounts managed to go to this show even though most of them dont even live in england. 

all this is to say that obviously these fans have a lot of free time, and a lot of money. i hear many of them saying that they work very hard at their jobs to get the money to go to so many shows so its 'justified', but i honestly dont believe that. what kind of job that youre supposedly working full time at is going to repeatedly give you months off to travel the world and see a band over and over again?? it would be one thing to just admit that your parents are giving you the money for it, but straight up lying is just cheap. (no pun intended)

and on top of all of this, the boys go out of their ways to interact with these fans over and over. like specifically interacting with their tweets, waving or pointing them out at shows, talking to them in person, josh literally got coffee with two of them and drove them around with him?? even jenna reposted an edit that evie made for tylers birthday, when realistically so many people made very nice edits but the one that gets the spotlight is the one who is always being given the spotlight?

im genuinely not jealous, but i think its really unprofessional of the boys. why are you 'rewarding' fans for, having loads of money and being boarderline unhealthily obsessed with your band 😭 theres no reason why they 'deserve' it more than anyone else, theyre just fans like the rest of us. 

am i the only one who feels like this?

I feel extremely guilty for writing this because he is an amazing person. We share the same values and align really well with our goals in life.

This year in particular things have gotten crazier with his work (i.e. working away, unstable schedule etc). He works full time and I have a part time job and go to uni. He also has some family stuff going on like his younger brother cut his family off and I know he is really struggling with that. I am trying my best to be understanding, and feel I have been patient and supportive with these changes in his life.

Last year, we went on dates every week, and he'd plan them. We also saw each other a lot more and actually went out and did activities rather than just sitting at home. I feel like since the middle of this year, he's really slacked off. He doesn't plan dates anymore and I sometimes find myself begging him to see me. He's been forgetting that we have plans and often arrives 1-2 hours later than he said he'd be there. It's really frustrating. He plays it off as being forgetful or that he's stressed with work.

One of our friends recently asked when our anniversary was and he said the wrong date. It really hurt my feelings because it made me feel so unimportant that he couldn't even bother to remember. Then, he also forgot when my birthday was, which was another stab to the heart. Again he played it off as just being forgetful but it actually really hurt my feelings which I communicated to him. He said sorry and that he would remember, but when I asked him the other day, he forgot again.

When he does remember to see me, I always suggest activities we should do, like hikes or coffee dates but he would rather just stay in and do nothing. It irks me because I feel like he's become complacent and lazy and now we've turned into one of those couples who just bum around all day. Even more, he doesn't initiate sex anymore, it's always me initiating it.

I have been begging him to plan a date for us for months now. Granted, our personal schedules have been really busy so it's been hard to find time. Finally he said he would, but then I ended up finding the place and suggesting the ideas and all he did was book it. I don't even want to go anymore because of the minimal effort he has put into it.

We've had many conversations where I've said that I want him to plan dates and see me more often, but I don't feel like it gets through to him. He'll agree and say that it'll change but it doesn't.

I'm just feeling so stagnant and confused. Is it normal for all relationships to hit a stop like this? Am I valid for feeling frustrated? I don't even know if I should be putting up with this. He is a great person and I'm trying my best to be considerate of all the extra stress he's under. He is great at validating me through his words, and reassuring me, but I feel like his actions demonstrate otherwise.

  
TLDR: my boyfriend has stopped planning dates, initiating sex, and forgetting important milestones in our relationship. it's making me feel insignificant in his life and I dont know what to do.",1,1764689700.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

So my question how is the nerd / geek community? For reference I spent the better part of this year in Edmonton and I was pleasantly surprised with their nerd life / community. Plenty of coffees and places to play stuff, hobby stores, events, even the big warhammer event.

I'm into gaming, tabletop rpgs (D&D, World of Darkness, some narrative games), mini wargaming and painting, rock, motorcycles, and can relate to most of ""general"" geekiness (not otaku but can enjoy some anime, not avid comic book reader but read the classics, etc).

What are your experiences? What are the hot spots? Some in-person RPG groups? Do you want to adopt a new geek into your circle? :)

Thank you for reading. Here, have a meme for your time.

1pcbf4r,https://i.redd.it/s4e9kukv6t4g1.jpeg,Classic Chocolate Cake Recipe,"Classic Moist Chocolate Cake (Super Easy & Delicious)

Ingredients (for a 2-layer 8-inch or 9-inch cake)

Cake:

* 1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour
* ¾ cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-process)
* 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
* 1 ½ tsp baking powder
* 1 ½ tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 large eggs (room temperature)
* 1 cup (240ml) whole milk (or buttermilk for extra moistness)
* ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup (240ml) boiling coffee or hot water (the coffee brings out the chocolate flavor, but you won’t taste it!)

Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (enough for filling + covering):

* 1 ½ cups (340g) unsalted butter, softened
* 4 cups (480g) powdered sugar
* ¾ cup (75g) cocoa powder
* ⅓–½ cup (80–120ml) heavy cream or milk
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* Pinch of salt

Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8- or 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper (or use a 9x13-inch pan if you prefer a sheet cake).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Add in the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat everything together for about 2 minutes until the batter is nice and smooth (try not to overmix).
4. Slowly pour in the hot coffee or water while mixing on low speed. Don’t worry if the batter seems thin—that’s exactly how it should be!
5. Divide the batter evenly between your pans. Bake for 30–35 minutes (if using 8-inch pans) or 28–32 minutes (for 9-inch pans). The cake is ready when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs.
6. Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then carefully turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

For the Frosting:

1. Beat the softened butter until it’s creamy.
2. Gradually add in the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Pour in the vanilla, a pinch of salt, and enough cream to get the consistency you like.
3. Beat on high speed for 2–3 minutes until your frosting is fluffy and irresistible.

To Assemble:

1. If the cakes have domed tops, feel free to level them with a knife for a flat surface.
2. Place your first cake layer on your serving plate, spread a generous amount of frosting on top, add the second layer, and then frost the top and sides of your cake. Decorate with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or leave it rustic and simple!

Baker’s Tips:

* Want an even richer cake? Add ½ cup of chocolate chips to the batter.
* Need it gluten-free? A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend will do the trick.
* No eggs? Replace each egg with ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce or use 2 flax eggs.

1pcb1it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlier/comments/1pcb1it/warmthing_a_review/,Warmthing: A Review,"Hey y’all! The folks at Outlier asked if I’d review the [Acottonflannel Warmthing](https://outlier.nyc/products/acottonflannel-warmthing), and I was like hell yeah (big thanks to Tyler and co.) — it’s just starting to get cold around here, so perfect timing to work a new, uhh, \~Thing\~ into my closet. All transparency etc., I received the Warmthing gratis. Opinions are my own. Let's get into it.

# FABRIC

I’m going to give my description of this fabric, but first read [their description](https://outlier.nyc/fabrics/acottonflannelalphacore60), it’s better than anything I’m going to write about it. It’s basically a soft, cozy flannel (and relatively light, as flannels go) on the outside, a silky merino (with nylon core for added durability) lining, and a light, thin recycled non-migrating insulation (alpha-60) layered in between. What you end up with is a light-but-substantial fabric with insulation that breathes thanks to the non-synthetic outer layer. I think of it as “airy warmth” instead of that clammy, damp, suffocating wrapped-in-a-garbage-bag sweatbox vibe you get from a lot of plastic-bound insulation— this is plenty toasty, but never overbearing or overheated.

# FORM

The Warmthing is the winter cousin to the summery Beachthing and follows a storied lineage of other hooded objects such as the unforgettable Octoknot. Simply, it’s like taking a small blanket, dropping a hood in the middle, and slicing a chunk out from the hood opening to the edge. It’s about 4’ wide, 2.5’ from the base of the hood to the hem, and the two hanging bits on either side are about 2’ long (roughly 4.5’ along the outer edge). The rear hem is slightly curved, and it has a hangloop which is super handy for hanging it up and for orienting it as you put it on (I use the hangloop to swing it into place). Hood size is generous like other Outlier hoods — I can fit it over a C2 Hoodie easily.

So what the hell is it then? It’s like a shawl with a hood, but also sorta big for a shawl, like a smedium blanket. So that’s basically a poncho, right? But ponchos are usually closed in the front or have a fastener. Thus, back to shawl. But it’s insulated, which most shawls aren’t. So I’m calling it an insulated hooded shawl. Could it also be a cape? Absolutely, it’s whatever you want it to be.

My main takeaway is that the form mirrors the fabric: it holds the heat you want and releases the excess. Like sticking a leg out from under a comforter at night, you can get your temp dialed with a little shift or fold — slouch it around the neck or drape it more over the chest. I lose a ton of heat out of the back of my neck and upper shoulders, but I don’t always want a hoodie or jacket that builds heat under the arms and around the middle. Warmthing covers what I want covered and leaves the rest free.

# UTILITY // USE CASE

A lot of people like to think about garments in terms of function: Who is it for? What problem does it solve? What activities is it built around?

Here’s the Warmthing’s use case: It’s really fucking cozy. Comforting and a bit weighty, but light and so so very soft. If you bring this with you, you’ve basically brought a spare hug. The “problem” it solves is not being cozy enough at any given moment.

For folks that really want a utilitarian frame: If you sit a lot — at a desk, table, whatever — and want precise temperature control, Warmthing nails it. It keeps you warm without overheating, and your hands and arms stay free since there are no sleeves, so nothing to get in your way when you’re typing or drawing or turning pages or furiously mashing buttons on a controller. It’s perfect for lounging on a couch or porch swing. It’s easier to throw on/off than anything with sleeves.

Amazingly, that all works out in the world too — offices, coffee shops, subways, etc. all have unpredictable temps. Having an insulated layer you can easily adjust is just great. It can be shared with a loved one as a double-shawl or a blanket over both your legs while you snuggle and watch fireworks, or other seasonal light displays. Keep warm between attempts on a bouldering problem on a crisp night. Whatever — as long as you’re cozy.

# WARMTHING vs WARMSHIRT

Fabric-wise it’s the same as the Acottonflannel Warmshirt, so why choose Warmthing? First, the hood: that breathable warmth over your head is clutch. Easy to lose too much heat through the head, easy to trap too much too. Also, depending on your Warmshirt fit, layering *over* something else may or may not be comfortable; Warmthing layers over anything. So you get the Warmshirt’s warmth without the structural constraints of a jacket archetype.

# LAYERING // COMBOS

Warmthing layers beautifully over anything: tees, long sleeves, sweatshirts, cardigans, light jackets, heavy jackets. I’ve been enjoying it over a hoodie for an ultra-warm double-hood setup.

But it can also layer under anything a shawl could (think big overcoats with roomy armholes). I’ve been putting mine under a carcoat and it works fantastically: you get that scarf/shawl visual when the coat is open, a bit of a flowy organic moment of movement, plus you get a hood, and when you shed the coat indoors you’re instantly in cozy cuddle mode.

# WHAT WOULD I CHANGE

I thought about buttons to snap it into a tunic shape, or magnets or a fastener at the hood to make it more cape-like, but I think those additions would mess with the flowy, laissez-faire vibe. Same with pockets or any hardware — it would weigh it down and make it more structured. It would be cool to tighten the hood hem somehow, but I wouldn’t want dangling strings, so without some invisible solution I haven’t thought of yet, I’d leave it as-is. You could tweak the size or shape, but I don’t see a need. So yeah, nothing really comes to mind as a pressing change or update.

# RANDOM NOTES

The lining grips the outer layer well, so if you throw one side over your shoulder, it stays. I couldn’t get both sides thrown back in a way I liked (like on the product page), but I also don’t prefer wearing it that way. One-side-over works great. I’ve been impressed by how well it stays put, enough weight and enough friction that it rarely slides off.

For parents of young kids: Putting this on/off while holding a baby is *way* easier than sleeves. And if your baby gets chilly, scoop ’em up and they’ll be cozy with you. Washing instructions are chill: dry on medium, don’t do anything wild. If you get a yogurt handprint on there, it’s fine, it can be cleaned.

I didn’t wash it yet — considered washing for science but it’s outerwear and didn’t get dirty in the days I’ve had it. I don’t regularly wash my Warmshirts either, so I’ll only wash this if something terrible happens.

Over a Duckshank (or any trucker type jacket) you get a distinct cowboy feeling which is really cool and fun.

Your cats/dogs/kids/partners will constantly try to steal this, so be prepared for that.

# PICTURES

# CONCLUSION

Words that come to mind when I’m wearing the Warmthing: Unencumbered. Affectionate. Gentle. Substantial. Free. Flowing. Swathed. Really fucking comfy.

These tumblers are popular mostly because they hit the sweet spot between practicality and design, they’re sturdy, easy to carry, and keep drinks at the temperature you want for longer than basic bottles.

The shape and structure of a Quecher Tumbler make it great for both home and on-the-go use. Many people use them for their morning iced coffee, workout hydration, or even just keeping water handy at their desk. The handle + straw combo (which most of these versions have) is especially convenient because it makes sipping easier without having to tilt or unscrew anything.

Another reason they’re trending is the variety of colours and finishes. Whether someone prefers muted pastels, bold brights, or a clean minimal look, there’s usually an option that fits their style. They’re also designed to fit into car cup holders, which is surprisingly helpful for commuting or long drives.

Durability is another major factor. A good Quecher Tumbler typically avoids dents, holds up to daily use, and feels solid without being too heavy. Most are also leak-resistant, which matters if you’re carrying them inside a bag.

Environmentally, these tumblers reduce the need for disposable plastic bottles, a small but meaningful lifestyle shift. And since they’re reusable and easy to clean, they’re practical for anyone wanting to drink more water throughout the day without constantly refilling smaller cups.

If you’re thinking about upgrading your drinkware, checking out different styles of the Quecher Tumbler can give you a sense of what suits your daily routine, whether you want something for the gym, your office desk, or just to keep hydration interesting at home.

A bit about me: I like to keep a balance between being active and being creative. Lately, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of Olympic lifting. I’m still perfecting my technique, but there is something really satisfying about the discipline of the snatch and clean & jerk. It’s become a huge part of my routine.

When I’m not at the gym, I’m usually making something. I’ve finally started writing the novel I’ve been dreaming up for years, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying. I also spend a lot of time on art and sketching, and I’m happiest when I’m cooking—I love experimenting in the kitchen and feeding people.

I’ve also picked up a couple of new hobbies recently: I’ve started getting into analog photography (still trying to figure out the lighting) and have been hiking more to get away from screens.
If you’re into video games, books, dark humour, and good conversation, I think we’d get along.

I’d love to hear from you. Tell me what you’re passionate about right now, or let’s start simple: What is your go-to tea or coffee order?",1,1764688498.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

The habit that changed everything wasn't a budget. 

It wasn't a spreadsheet. 

It wasn't an app that sent me passive-aggressive notifications about my Starbucks habit.

It was a Sunday morning coffee. 

And a shoebox.

Every Sunday, before I did anything else, before I checked Instagram, before I answered texts, before I let the world in, I sat down with my coffee, a shoebox full of receipts, and I asked myself one question:

""Did this make me richer, or did it just make me feel something for 10 minutes?""

That's it. 

That's the habit.

It sounds too simple to be powerful. 

It sounds like something your grandma would do (she did). 

But that 15-minute ritual took me from $400 in savings to $40,000 in 18 months. 

Not because I cut lattes. 

Because I stopped lying to myself about what my money was actually doing.

# 💡The Problem: I Was ""Budgeting"" But Still Broke

I had Mint. 

I had YNAB. 

I had a color-coded spreadsheet that looked like a unicorn vomited on Excel. 

I knew where every penny went.

But knowing didn't change my behavior. 

Because budgets are backward-looking. 

They tell you what you did. 

They don't tell you what you should have done. 

And they definitely don't make you feel the emotional weight of a dumb purchase.

I'd see ""Target: $87.43"" and think ""Yeah, that seems right."" 

I'd never ask, ""What was in that bag? Do I still have it? Did it improve my life?""

The shoebox changed that because receipts are evidence. 

They don't lie. 

They don't let you forget.

# 💡The Habit: The Receipt Confession

Here's exactly what I do:

Every Saturday, I throw every receipt from the week into a shoebox on my kitchen counter. 

Gas station, coffee, Amazon package, whatever. In it goes.

Every Sunday morning, I pour coffee, grab the box, and pick three receipts at random.

For each one, I answer 3 questions out loud:

* ""What did I buy?"" (If I can't remember, it goes in the ""shame pile."")
* ""Did this make my life better in a lasting way?"" (If the answer is ""I guess,"" it goes in the shame pile.)
* ""If I could go back, would I buy it again?"" (If the answer is ""no,"" it goes in the shame pile.)

The shame pile gets taped to my wall. 

Not as punishment. 

As data. 

By the end of the month, I have 12-15 receipts on my wall. 

I can see patterns.

* ""Ah, I bought 'treats' 9 times this month because work sucked."" 
* ""I bought 4 things that I can't even identify from the receipt."" 
* ""I spent $60 on apps I opened once."" 

The wall becomes a mirror. 

It shows me who I am when I'm not paying attention.

# 💡Why This Works (The Psychology of Witnessing Yourself) 

Budgets are abstract. 

They say ""you spent $400 on food."" 

You shrug. 

That's plausible.

**A receipt is specific.** 

It says ""You spent $8.47 on a mediocre breakfast sandwich at a gas station at 7:13 AM because you were running late."" 

That's **visceral.** 

You feel that. 

You remember that sandwich. 

It was cold. 

The egg was weird.

The act of saying it out loud is a confession. 

It externalizes the choice. 

It makes you the witness to your own spending. 

And being witnessed? That changes behavior.

It's the difference between ""I know I shouldn't"" and ""I just watched myself do it, and it's embarrassing.""

# 💡The Glow-Up: How to Make It Actually Stick

You don't need a shoebox. 

You need ritual and friction.

**Step 1: The Physical Trigger**

Keep the shoebox (or jar, or drawer) in a place you can't ignore. 

Mine is next to the door. 

I see it every morning. 

It's a visual reminder that Sunday is coming.

**Step 2: The Social Contract** 

Once a month, text a friend a photo of your shame pile. 

""This is what I spent money on that I regret."" 

You don't need advice. 

You just need a witness. 

The fear of having to send that text makes you pause at checkout.

**Step 3: The 3-Question Card**

Write the questions on an index card. 

Keep it in the box. 

Read them out loud. 

Hearing your own voice say ""Did this make my life better?"" is a different experience than thinking it.

**Step 4: The ""One Thing"" Rule**

From your shame pile, pick ONE category to cut next month. 

Not everything. 

Just one. 

""No more gas station breakfast sandwiches."" 

That's it. 

That's the whole budget.

# 💡The Transformation: Before & After

**Before the Receipt Confession:**

* Monthly spending: $3,400
* Savings: $400
* Feeling: ""Where does it all go?""
* Behavior: Mindless swiping, vague shame

**After 6 months:**

* Monthly spending: $2,100
* Savings: $8,700
* Feeling: ""I'm in control of this.""
* Behavior: Conscious spending, specific joy

I didn't earn more. 

I didn't cut my lattes. 

I just stopped spending on things that didn't survive the confession.

# 💡The Bottom Line: Awareness is the Only Budget You Need

You can't change what you can't see. 

And you can't see what you don't look at.

The Receipt Confession isn't about guilt. 

It's about evidence. 

It's about making the invisible visible so you can stop lying to yourself about where your money goes.

Most financial advice is about restriction. 

This is about witnessing. 

And witnessing yourself? 

That's the only habit that ever changed anything for good.",1,1764688477.0,EverydayMoneyMindset,0,1.0,False
1pcaz65,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pcaz65/bought_an_xbloom_studio_early_thoughts_and/,"Bought an xBloom Studio, early thoughts and impressions","Hi everyone,

I’ve been going down the coffee rabbit hole for a few years now, starting with espresso and moving more towards pour over for the last year or so. I’ve looked at the xBloom studio since it came out and finally took the plunge when they were running their Black Friday sale, thought I’d share some early thoughts and impressions about the machine in case anyone else is considering it.

**Overall build:** Feels very solid and well crafted, definitely a smaller footprint than I think I imagined. That said, it is tall and you do need access to the top of the machine for water and beans so if you have lower cabinets it might not fit under them if that’s your goal - worth measuring to make sure. The material is mostly a nicely textured plastic, the knobs are metal on the front feel nice and the pixel-style display reads well.  Water tank is small, can fit about 3-4 cups worth of coffee in it before needing a refill and it is removable for convenience. The machine can be plumbed in, though that’s not an option for me. Overall happy with the build, doesn’t feel overpriced to the quality.

**Dialing in:** Dialing in the xBloom isn't difficult, but it's very app based. I had no problems connecting my phone to the machine, tweaking the settings, and loading my recipe into the machine. There are granular controls for grind size, grind speed, water/grounds ratio, water temp, pour style (spiral, center, circle), agitation, and number of pours. The app comes pre-programmed with some standard recipes and you can find many more in a library for different beans/roasters. One of the more useful things I found on the xBloom subreddit was someone created a [ChatGPT instance](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67f14ec8ba988191ac76eedb7bed7849-xbloom-brew-master) for dialing in beans. I added a link to the [beans I bought](https://www.blackwhiteroasters.com/collections/lighter-roast/products/r-aricha-washed) and it spit out a decent recipe formatted for the xBloom app, from there I gave feedback and it tweaked the recipe until I was happy with the output - took about 3 cups. I'd probably be more annoyed with the dialing in without the GPT instance as there's a lot of variables to consider. You can save the recipe in the app, share the recipe, and also pre-load it onto one of three presets on the machine which is what I did to make it easier for my wife. I don't have an issue with the app in the times that I've used it, however I know some people have had frustrations.

**Workflow:** Dead simple. Pour beans in, put filter in, press start on the app or machine, enjoy coffee. One negative is I do not like the sound of the grinder, it's quite high pitched and is decently loud. We have a Niche Zero for espresso which has a much deeper resonance when grinding which is more pleasant sounding. We also have a k-ultra for pour over which sounds the best, but is obviously manual so it's not a real comparison. Grind quality seems solid, reasonably on-par with my other grinders and I don't notice much difference in particle size. It'd be nice if they could finagle a flat burr grinder in the machine, but as I've primarily ever used conical grinders it's not too bad. I've had a few issues with taller cups getting snagged on the brewer as it moves back and forth and have also had at least one time when the filter snagged on the grinder when moving under it and the beans ground straight to the drip tray, but that's more user error than machine error.

**The Pods:** Not good. The machine comes with an 8-pack of their cocoa drops pods and one of their recipe cards to give the optimal recipe for them. You tap the recipe card on the machine and the NFC card sets up the recipe on the machine. Maybe those beans are just not for us, but generally we did not like the coffee from them. I also hate the idea of pods, so there's that. I think the recipe card concept is cool, though I wish I could re-program the card through the app to upload my own custom recipe. You can do that with some 3rd-party project[ I've seen on Github](https://github.com/CrazyCoder/XBRecipeWriterPlus), but not through the xBloom app

**Wife thoughts:** She likes it. I sort of look at coffee in an effort / quality graph like the [hot crazy scale from How I Met Your Mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaSqz7G1fB4) \- the more effort and time you put in typically means a better product on the other side. At the lower end you have things like Kuerig, Nespresso, or instant coffee which are very low effort with very low quality, and at the highest end are things like hand-crafted espresso or lattes and finicky pour overs that are higher effort but result in a higher quality in the cup. That said, there's a limit for each person on the effort they're willing to put in and nothing wrong with either end of the spectrum - whatever works for you. The point of this is that, once dialed in, the xBloom does a pretty good job of significantly reducing effort for a fairly high quality cup on the other end and that's exactly what my wife wants. We have our first child on the way and when we're in the newborn trenches she wants a near single-click option for coffee and the xBloom delivers that for her.

**TL;DR:** I'd give it a solid 7.5-8 out of 10. Well built machine, easy-ish to dial in especially with the GPT, and a near single click experience once setup. The coffee quality is below what I can get from really being meticulous about my pour over with a kettle, v60/b75 brewer, and the melodrip, but not that far below especially when the xBloom is substantially easier and more consistent. I'd like to see an improved grinder, maybe a bit more clearance for American-style coffee mugs, and the ability to re-write their NFC cards in the app. I think this fits what we were looking for with a newborn on the way and wanting to decrease the effort we put into coffee without sacrificing all our quality with a pod machine. There's a good chance this might lead to us selling our espresso setup as it's definitely not as used as it used to be.",3,1764688444.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1pcay5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1pcay5f/does_aiassisted_coding_actually_improve_software/,Does AI-Assisted Coding Actually Improve Software Quality - or Just Speed Up Hacking?,"If you hang around any developer-heavy subreddit long enough, you’ll notice a familiar pattern. Someone posts a glowing screenshot showing how their AI assistant completed an entire function before they finished sipping their coffee. Five comments later, someone else insists that AI tools are basically Stack Overflow copy-paste machines with a fancier UI. And ten comments after that, a senior engineer with a slightly traumatic production-incident history arrives to announce that “AI won’t fix your bad architecture, champ.”

This debate has only intensified in 2024 and 2025 as AI-augmented software development tools are no longer experimental sidekicks—they’re standard equipment. And because Google searches for phrases like “Does AI improve code quality,” “AI coding errors,” “is AI code safe,” and “AI development tools for enterprise” have surged, it’s clear people aren’t just debating the hype—they’re trying to figure out whether AI makes software better, worse, or simply faster in the wrong direction.

So the real question isn’t whether AI speeds things up. It definitely does. The question is whether that speed leads to craftsmanship or chaos. And, depending on who you ask, the answer seems to be: both.

Let’s dig deeper into why.

# The productivity paradox nobody wants to talk about

AI coding tools undeniably accelerate development. They autocomplete entire blocks, generate boilerplate, create test scaffolding, translate code between languages, and—sometimes—offer surprisingly elegant architecture suggestions. Developers say they can ship features 20–40 percent faster. Managers love the velocity charts. Business owners see something close to magic.

But here’s the paradox: faster development doesn’t automatically mean better development. Google’s most common user queries on this topic revolve around fear—fear of hidden bugs, legal uncertainties, mysterious hallucinations, and subtle off-by-one errors lurking like landmines. One of the top searches right now is “AI-generated code security issues,” which tells you exactly where people’s heads are.

In fact, internal engineering team reports (the kind that never make it to Medium) ironically show the same pattern: developers using AI spend less time writing code and more time reviewing AI suggestions. So instead of saving time, the effort shifts into debugging code we didn’t write—but are still responsible for.

And let’s be honest: nothing feels more awkward than explaining to your CTO that your AI assistant hallucinated an API endpoint that doesn’t exist.

# The rise of “AI-accelerated technical debt”

This is where the conversation gets interesting—and a little uncomfortable.

AI tools don’t just speed up coding. They also speed up the creation of technical debt. A junior developer guided heavily by AI may generate complex, copy-pasted logic they don’t fully understand. A senior developer may skip writing documentation because “the AI can fill it in later.” And teams in a hurry sometimes approve AI-generated solutions that work, but only in the same way duct tape works on a water pipe.

This phenomenon—“AI-accelerated technical debt”—isn’t a melodramatic term. It’s now showing up in enterprise audits. Companies have realized that when you speed up development, you also speed up structural mistakes. And those mistakes often remain invisible until the third sprint after launch when everything mysteriously slows down, memory leaks appear, and your cloud bill grows disturbingly large.

This doesn’t mean AI is harmful. It means AI is powerful and, like all powerful tools, needs guardrails.

# But here’s the twist: sometimes AI really does improve quality

There are cases where AI dramatically improves code quality—especially for well-structured teams with mature review processes. AI tools excel at finding duplicated code, suggesting test coverage gaps, highlighting unsafe operations, and even optimizing algorithms. Some teams report fewer bugs simply because AI is better at remembering edge cases than humans running on caffeine and willpower.

This is even more true in niche fields like computer vision, healthcare automation, and high-performance systems where AI can reference patterns across millions of code samples. Companies specializing in complex systems—Abto Software being one example—have published insights on how AI support drastically improves debugging efficiency and test automation in large enterprise systems.

The catch? AI quality improvements only materialize when teams use AI intentionally—not as a replacement for engineering discipline, but as a multiplier for it.

# AI is changing the role of the developer

Perhaps the most fascinating trend from Google search behavior is the sheer number of people asking “Will AI replace developers?” and “Should I still learn programming?” These queries come mostly from junior developers and business owners who are trying to understand whether AI-augmented coding means fewer engineers are needed.

The reality is more nuanced.

AI reduces mechanical workload, but it raises expectations in system design, architectural thinking, and debugging. It’s not eliminating developers; it’s shifting the value point. Developers who rely on AI for everything risk becoming “AI prompt operators,” while developers who understand fundamentals become the ones who guide AI to produce consistent, stable solutions.

In other words: AI removes the busywork, but it doesn’t replace engineering judgment. If anything, it makes that judgment more important.

# The most honest conclusion: AI is a force multiplier—good or bad

Does AI-assisted coding improve software quality or just speed up hacking? The messy truth is that it does both. It depends entirely on the environment:

AI in a disciplined engineering culture leads to higher quality, better consistency, faster debugging, and more reliable systems.

AI in a rush-driven, poorly-reviewed environment leads to spaghetti code generated at unprecedented velocity.

The tool isn’t the problem. The process is.

# So what should developers and tech leaders do next?

Use AI aggressively for productivity.  
Trust AI carefully for correctness.  
Review AI suggestions the same way you’d review code from a very enthusiastic but occasionally confused intern.  
And above all, remember that software quality has never depended solely on speed. It depends on experience, architecture, testing, and human oversight.

AI can extend all of these - but it cannot replace them.

And maybe that’s the real takeaway: AI isn’t writing our future for us. It’s helping us write it faster - but only we decide whether that future is stable, scalable, and secure, or just a really fast way to break things.",1,1764688374.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

“Hey, you’re with that ꓑеoрꓲеꓪоrtһꓚаrіnցꓮbout project, right?”

Now, I’m in jeans, an old hoodie, and holding a half-spilled coffee. Zero tools. Zero equipment. Zero chance I resembled anyone doing legitimate filming or interviewing.

I told him, “Oh, no, no. I definitely don’t work here. Or for anyone. I’m just trying to throw away some broken furniture.”

Wanted to share some exciting news - we just finalized a partnership with Weather Trends International that I think solves a real problem for retailers.

So here's the thing: weather drives 40-70% of daily sales variability in coffee shops (and honestly, most retail). But almost everyone is just using historical averages and gut feel to make inventory and staffing decisions.

That means you're either over-ordering and dealing with waste, or under-ordering and missing sales. We're talking $2,000-$7,000 swings per location.

Weather Trends has spent 30 years turning complex atmospheric data into something actually usable. Through Spartera, retailers can now get their weather intelligence for $1 per location per week.

You get one word: ""Favorable,"" ""Unfavorable,"" ""Unfavorably Hot,"" or ""Mixed.""

That's it. No complicated dashboards. No data science degree needed.

But that one word tells you:

* How many staff to schedule
* How much inventory to order
* Whether to promote hot coffee or cold brew
* When to stock up vs. reduce perishables

We built this because weather affects 70% of all businesses, but most are operating blind. The ones that figure this out will run 20-40% more efficiently than competitors.

Would love to hear your thoughts or if you have questions about how this works!

1pcanzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pcanzt/7_subtle_signs_a_shy_girl_likes_you/,7 Subtle Signs a SHY Girl Likes You (Psychology-Backed),"Ever get the feeling someone’s into you, but they’re holding back? Like they kinda linger around, act weirdly nice, but never actually say anything? That isn’t just in your head. Especially if the person is shy. And if she’s shy, she’s probably not going to slide into your DMs with “I like you” or flirt openly like some rom-com character. Instead, it’s all in the details.

Shy attraction doesn’t look like what TikTok tells you. Most dating coaches and “alpha male” influencers push this idea that if someone doesn’t chase after you, they’re not interested. That’s trash advice. Research in interpersonal neurobiology and social psychology shows shy individuals experience the same intensity of attraction as extroverts they just express it differently. Subtly. Quietly. Sometimes awkwardly.

So if you’re trying to figure out if that quiet girl likes you, here’s your deep-dive, no-BS guide based on real research, expert insights, and tons of observation. Let’s decode the signsand share what actually works if you want to take things further.

 Step 1: Understand how shy people show interest

Before we decode behavior, let’s get one thing clear: shyness is not the same as introversion. Shyness is fear of social judgment. It’s nervousness, not avoidance. Dr. Bernardo Carducci, a leading psychologist on shyness, explains this in his book The Shyness Breakthrough. A shy person might desperately want to talk to you, but their brain short-circuits when they try. So their attraction leaks out in very subtle ways.

That means you need to stop watching loud extroverted behaviors for signs and start noticing the quiet stuff.

 Step 2: Learn the 7 subtle signs a shy girl likes you

These are the hidden cues. The soft signals. The stuff that doesn’t scream “I like you,” but kind of whispers it.

1. She hovers around your orbit  

If she repeatedly shows up near you at the coffee machine, near your desk, same side of the classroom that’s rarely a coincidence. She’s not stalking. She’s trying to be present where you are without being forward.

2. Nervous body language (but friendly eyes)  

Studies from the University of British Columbia show that humans can subconsciously detect romantic interest through body language even when no words are spoken. Watch for things like:  

   \- Fidgeting or fixing her hair when you’re near  

   \- A smile that flickers and disappears when you look  

   \- Eye contact that’s brief but warm

3. She laughs at things you say that aren’t even funny  

We’re not talking full stand-up comedian mode. But light chuckles, soft smiles, and laughing at your very average jokes? That’s emotional mirroring. Subconscious connection.

4. She finds excuses to talk to you (but keeps it short)  

She might ask quick questions: “Hey, did you get the email about tomorrow?” “Is this your coffee?” Small talk is her comfort zone. She’s testing the waters. If she didn’t care, she wouldn’t initiate at all.

5. Her friends act weird when you’re around  

Shy girls often confide in their close circle. So if her friends laugh, tease her, or go silent when you appear, they probably know something you don’t. Peer cues are major.

6. She responds quickly but never texts first  

A shy girl might not initiate, but when you do text her, she replies fast. Like within seconds. That’s not just politeness. That’s priority. She’s been thinking about you. She's just waiting for a green light.

7. She remembers tiny things you said  

You mention your favorite snack once? She brings it up a week later. Told a random story during class? She brings it up again in a chat. This shows attention and care. 

Psychologist Dr. Jeremy Nicholson in Psychology Today notes that memory recall of small details is one of the most overlooked signs of attractionit shows emotional investment, especially when no one’s watching.

 Step 3: What to DO if you think she likes you

If you’ve read the above and nodded to at least four points, congrats. Very likely she’s into you. Now what?

1. Open space with low-pressure interactions  

Shy people need ""psychological safety"" to open up. Avoid deep emotional interrogations. Start with simple, pleasant topicsmusic, food, shared experiences. Ask open-ended questions that let her speak more without pressure.

2. Use soft eye contact and relaxed body language  

Mirror her pace. Keep your energy warm, not overpowering. Use her name when you talk to her (this subconsciously increases trust and emotional safety).

3. Make the first move... but gently  

Instead of “Wanna go out with me?”, try something casual and specific:  

“Hey, I’m grabbing matcha later. Want to join?”  

“Would love to hear your take on that movie free this weekend?”  

You’re creating an exit ramp if she’s too nervous but also an invitation. Make it easy for her to say yes.

4. Text her about something light  

If you’re nervous, start with something friendly:  

“Hey! Just saw \[thing you both like\] and thought of your take.”  

It’s about signaling your interest, without pressure.

 Step 4: Best content to decode subtle attraction

Want to sharpen your radar and avoid guesswork? These resources go deep on non-verbal cues, shy behavior, and how to build emotional momentum without coming on strong.

\- Website: The Gottman Institute

 Step 5: Read one book that changes everything

This book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction: 

Atomic Attraction by Christopher Canwell  

It’s not your average dating advice fluff. It draws on behavioral science, psychology, and evolutionary biology to explain how attraction really worksespecially the non-verbal side. You’ll learn how subtle behavior flips the switch more than anything else. Wildly underrated. Easily one of the best psychology-based dating books I’ve ever read.

I chose not to book tours from big platforms like Klook or Agoda
because I wanted to help independent guides 
only to be treated like an easy target..

First scam of the day:
A “friendly” man offered me a motorcycle city tour for 400,000 VND.
Clear as day.
A fixed rate.
No hourly nonsense.
I agreed because I genuinely wanted to support the locals..

After the tour, he suddenly asked for 800,000 VND
and claimed it was “400k per hour.”
He NEVER said that.
He changed the price after finishing the service 
classic trap.z
And of course, I ended up paying,
because arguing with scammers in a foreign country is unsafe and honestly, I just felt stupid for falling for their tactic.

Second scam of the day:
I went to a coffee shop near the train street area.
The owner offered me a “friend’s Grab car”
to take me to the sleeper bus/train station.
Nice gesture, right?

He wanted 400,000 VND
for a trip that costs 40k–70k on Grab.
TEN TIMES the actual price.
Another trap.
Another “friendly” face turning into opportunistic robbery.

And to top it off,
even the ATM earlier shorted my withdrawal..
yes, even the machines joined the scam party today.

This isn’t about “all Vietnamese.”
This is about certain individuals taking advantage of tourists
the moment they sense kindness or trust.

My advice:
Don’t say yes to anything offered on the street.
Don’t accept “friendly” help that involves money.
Use Grab only.
Book only from official platforms.
And ALWAYS ask for a clear price before you start anything.

I’ve traveled to many countries,
but today was my first time ever being scammed multiple times in one day.
It completely ruined my mood and trust.

Just be careful.
This city is stunning yups
but some people are ready to take advantage of tourists the second they see an opportunity… :(

1pcaiii,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1pcaiii/number_of_categories/,Number of Categories,"Good morning all, 

  
Since listening to the most recent Budget Nerds, I have been torn about the number of categories in my budget and is more or less best for me. In Summer 2025, I blew up my budget and started over (my first new budget since YNAB 4!). At the time, money was tight, but I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck, so I wanted to give myself a little grace with the time I spent budgeting. I love budgeting and enjoy my time each morning drinking coffee and playing in YNAB but thought maybe I was spending too much time in front of the budget.    
  
After giving it about 6 months, I am considering adding more categories because I feel like it may give me more control over where my money goes. I have general categories right now, so I do not know how much I spend on, for example, gas, because it is lumped into the transportation category. 

  
As someone who has used both methods (more categories and fewer categories), I am torn. I know this is a personal decision, but what are everyone's feelings on the number of categories you have? ",3,1764687338.0,ynab,9,1.0,False
1pcaigx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1pcaigx/ai_agents_in_clinical_trials_gamechanger_or_risky/,AI Agents in Clinical Trials: Game-Changer or Risky Shortcut?,"If you’ve been anywhere near Google Trends in the last six months, you’ve probably noticed an interesting spike: people are suddenly searching for things like “AI agents clinical trials,” “LLM protocol automation,” and my personal favorite, “Are AI agents going to break the FDA?”

Spoiler: not today.  
But they **are** shaking up one of the most data-intensive, slow-moving, regulation-drenched industries on the planet. And for developers this is turning into one of the most technically demanding and opportunity-rich spaces since fintech first tried to automate bank statements with OCR.

So let’s dig into the hype, the reality, and why AI agents sit right between “revolutionary breakthrough” and “please don’t let this be another blockchain-in-healthcare moment.”

# Why AI agents are suddenly everywhere in clinical trials

Search volumes don’t lie. People are googling this topic aggressively because clinical trials are in trouble. The industry has been complaining for decades about the same bottlenecks:

* Recruiting patients who actually fit eligibility criteria
* Processing huge, messy, multi-source datasets
* Updating protocols, documentation, and compliance workflows
* Monitoring safety signals and adverse events
* Running trials without drowning in PDFs, EHR exports, and legacy platforms from 2004

Enter AI agents — not single-model chatbots, but **multi-step, multi-modal, tool-using autonomous systems** built to parse clinical jargon, integrate data streams, and make recommendations. The hype comes from real progress: several NIH-backed tools have matched patients to trials with near-expert accuracy, while startups are deploying agents for protocol drafting, data validation, and risk flagging.

In other words: these aren’t toy projects anymore. They’re starting to touch regulated processes, and that’s where things get interesting.

# Why developers care: this is not “just another AI feature”

If you’re a backend engineer, data engineer, ML dev, or someone who occasionally pretends to understand clinical terminology in meetings, here’s the kicker:

Clinical trials generate the kind of chaotic data soup that AI agents were *made* for.

Think PDFs with nested logic, EHR fields in inconsistent schemas, structured but incomplete lab results, multi-gigabyte imaging files, and physician notes written in a dialect of English that even ChatGPT needs a coffee to parse.

AI agents do something powerful here:  
they can chain reasoning steps across all these formats and run automated workflows.

And companies want it. Hard.

That’s why searches for “outsourced AI healthcare development,” “LLM clinical workflow automation,” and “AI validation for FDA systems” are rising. The work is highly specialized, difficult to recruit for, and requires cross-functional engineering skills — meaning outsourcing and consulting are becoming primary routes for adoption.

# The “game-changer” side of the argument

Let’s start with the optimistic angle — because there’s genuinely impressive innovation happening.

# They actually read eligibility criteria

You know how trials usually have 40–80 dense paragraphs of conditions, exclusions, biomarkers, “prior therapy washout periods,” and other snags?

AI agents can parse them, structure them, and match them to patient records in seconds. Humans take hours. Sometimes days.

This is why tools like TrialGPT shocked researchers: their accuracy was high enough to question whether manual screening should remain the default at all.

# They reduce administrative burden (in theory)

A lot of trial time isn’t spent on science; it's spent on documentation and compliance.

Agents are being tested to auto-draft protocol sections, track amendment history, spot inconsistencies, and recommend updates. Think GitHub Copilot, but for GCP documentation — less glamorous, more impactful.

# They improve inclusivity and diversity of recruitment

AI systems can detect potential candidates across previously overlooked datasets and expand the pool of eligible participants — a long-standing ethical and operational problem in clinical research.

# They integrate multimodal data

Clinical trials involve everything from MRI scans to demographic metadata.  
Most human workflows struggle with multimodality.  
Modern agents thrive in it.

For developers, this is where things get fun: vector databases, RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, toolcalling, embedding search, and data normalization all collide in one highly regulated playground.

# The “risky shortcut” side of the argument

But of course, there’s a reason the top Google searches also include “AI clinical trials risks” and “Can AI make medical mistakes?”

Here’s where Reddit gets… lively.

# AI can misunderstand medical logic

Eligibility criteria often contain complex boolean relationships — “A AND (B OR C) unless D unless E is elevated but not if F occurred within X months.”

Some LLMs get this right 90% of the time.  
In clinical trials, 90% isn’t good enough.

# Confident hallucinations

An AI mistake in a marketing app is an inconvenience.  
An AI mistake in a Phase II oncology trial is a liability.

# Regulatory frameworks aren’t ready

The FDA and EMA know AI automation is coming, but guidelines are still forming.  
Most AI systems aren’t audit-ready, version-controlled, or reproducible enough yet.

# Security, privacy, and traceability issues

Agents using external tools, APIs, or cloud platforms must handle protected health information with zero tolerance for breaches.

# A false sense of “autonomy”

Even the most advanced systems should not be allowed to operate without human oversight — but businesses under cost pressure may be tempted.

This is the real risk: not the technology, but the misuse of it.

# Where IT innovators are headed now

Developers interested in this space should watch a few trends:

# Multi-agent clinical ecosystems

Instead of one big model, systems now use chains or collectives of smaller specialized agents working together.  
Think:

* A parsing agent
* A validation agent
* A compliance agent
* A reasoning agent
* And a reviewer agent

Some resemble CI/CD pipelines, but for medical decisions.

# Integration of imaging + structured data

Agents are being tested on radiology images alongside lab results and demographic data — a massive step forward.

# EHR integration by AI middleware

New frameworks attempt to translate any EHR schema into a unified agent-friendly format.  
This is a goldmine for companies offering custom implementation.

# On-device or hybrid deployments

To solve privacy challenges, teams are experimenting with local inference, patchwork encryption, and secure enclaves.

# Outsourced innovation

Because this domain mixes machine learning, compliance, backend engineering, medical ontology, and UX, more organizations are partnering with specialized teams rather than building everything in-house. Developers who want real-world exposure will find this space rewarding, complex, and always changing.

Abto Software, for example, has recently explored agent-driven approaches in healthcare analytics projects, and their experience mirrors what many engineering teams are discovering: multi-agent workflows can unlock performance gains, but they also demand rigorous validation and careful system design.

# So… game-changer or risky shortcut?

Honestly?  
Both.  
This is why the topic is blowing up.

On one hand, **ai agents for clinical trials** are pushing the industry into a new era where data isn’t a burden but a resource — where matching patients, drafting protocols, and running analytics becomes faster, cheaper, and more inclusive.

On the other hand, AI cannot be trusted blindly in regulated environments.  
Not yet.  
And maybe not for a long time.

But here’s the takeaway worth posting on your office door:

AI agents won’t replace clinical researchers.  
They’ll replace the **slowest, most tedious** parts of clinical research — the ones everyone wishes would disappear anyway.

And for developers and companies watching from the outside, this is your moment.  
Healthcare rarely gets technological revolutions, but when it does, the teams who jump early tend to become the industry benchmarks.

If you're exploring opportunities in outsourced development, building healthcare AI tools, or just want to work on something more meaningful than another e-commerce recommendation engine, clinical-trial automation is where the next wave of demand is already forming.

And unlike the crypto boom, this one won’t disappear next year.

&nbsp;

After being approached by an Argentine trade delegation interested in the first tentative feelers of Bulgarian light industry exports, a broader series of commercial exchanges and guarantees culminated in a framework with both Argentina and Brazil — with potential for Chile to involve themselves directly at a later juncture. An export framework and schedule was arranged for a series of capital goods, industrial inputs and commodities, with various parties within both nations expressing interest as follows:

&nbsp;

From Bulgaria to Argentina and Brazil: 

- industrial refrigerants, industrial and commercial coolers, refrigerators, refrigerated freight cars, industrial air conditioning units, dehumidifiers and dehydrators
- a variety of electric and kerosene appliances such as ovens, camp stoves, kettles, food processors, toaster ovens, hot plates, bread machines, civilian radios and fans
- industrial and personal particulate filters for both air and water, including respirators for mining and civilian gas masks
- enriched and fortified foods, preserves, baked goods and canned foods
- a variety of consumer health products such as toilet paper, toothpaste, hand soap, shaving cream, dental floss, women's health products, disposable wipes and tissues
- fiberglass epoxy products for boat hulls, marine netting and chemical piping
- insecticide, animal fodder and veterinary health products

&nbsp;

Of these, the Ministry of Economic Planning held a specific oversight role for the export of capital goods in the refrigerant and fiberglass categories, with an expectation that demands of the rapidly modernizing Argentine fishing industry in particular would provide valuable economies of scale to outweigh the inherent opportunity cost of exporting such labor-intensive goods. In return, import agreements for both heavy industry and autonomous light industry endeavors were secured for Bulgaria:

&nbsp;

From Argentina and Brazil to Bulgaria:

- raw and semiprocessed leather and leather footwear
- frozen or preserved meat, milk and frozen pollock
- cotton, pine timber, wood pulp and paper
- coffee, cacao, citrus, wine, yerba mate and various fresh and preserved fruits
- tin plates and graphite

&nbsp;

It is expected that additional products will be scheduled if and when they are first imported, depending on demand on both sides. Interested Bulgarian producers have taken advantage of the resumption of relations and exchange of embassies with Argentina to get ahold of contracts with Spanish- and Portuguese-language translators for product labeling, packaging and user manuals. An expansion of the dry goods terminal at Varna is being discussed as part of the next five-year plan.

Looking to see if anybody else has experienced very  sudden negative side effects after weeks of being on the same dose.

Started titration 7.5 weeks ago: 30mg for a week, 50mg for the past 6.5 weeks. 

Titration began almost 8 weeks ago.

First month 30mg 1 week/50mg 3 weeks. 30mg zero effect, literally did nothing for me, wondered if they'd given me a placebo. Still finding craving other stimulants; coffee, cigarettes, coca cola. 

2nd titration appointment, 3 weeks in: 1 week 30mg, 2 weeks 50mg: 
Positives - few cravings for additional stimulants, down to 2 coffees/day from 4/5 (often only drinking 1/2 of each), 2 cigarettes/day, 1st at 1.45pm, 2nd 4pm. Zero coca cola. 

BP readings bang in the middle of green zone, weight steadily decreasing at safe level, definitely more energy, but not during the day; weirdly, energy spike consistent each day between 4-7pm, very organised at home, with housework, bills, paperwork. Feel on top of things here.

Negatives: completely and utterly exhausted every morning until at least 11.30-12.30pm. Don't feel meds kicking in after an hour. Am no more productive in day at work than before. Slight dry mouth, appetite decreased significantly in the day. Promised I'd make big effort to eat protein for lunch. Kept on 50mg for the next 4 weeks. 

3rd titration, 6 weeks in: 1 week 30mg, 5 weeks 50mg. Pretty much same as above. Consistent readings, steady weight loss. Cravings for more stimulants had begun creeping back. Still utterly exhausted in mornings and day until lunch time, the day, spike of energy still consistent between 4-7pm (when the meds should be wearing off). No meaningful impact on my work life; still unmotivated, tired through whole day etc. Only positives at home.

Practitioner said he thinks I have ""a high tolerance for stimulants"" due to me unknowingly self-meducating throughout entire adult life, huge reliance on stimulants - as well as above, whilst at uni I would pop pro-plus like smarties, guzzle litres of Red Bull, use another stimulant I can't mention 1/2 times a month. Dose increased me up to 70mg. 

Next titration to follow 3 weeks from then, 9th December, when 9 weeks in. Will have had 1 week 30mg, 7 weeks 50mg, 1 week 70mg at this time.

Parents paid £135 for the 4 week supply of 70mg, received 10 days ago. Unopened as still have 4 days of 50mg left.

 BUT since last titration 2 weeks ago, things have gone downhill rapidly. In the past week, BP has sky rocketed to very top end of pre-high; only a slight increase will place me in high bp range. (I had low BP before starting meds, so significant increase).

Tiredness and exhaustion even worse, to the point I've been off work 2 days currently (gave reason as high BP). Complete zero motivation due to tiredness. Zombified. Having a shower feels like climbing a mountain. Feeling heart palpitations, I'm jittery, anxiety increased, shaking hands. 

More withdrawn at work past week 1/2. I've had two huge panic attacks in 2 weeks, caused by unexpected, last-minute changes to my work routine (always struggled with this, but coped previously with minor outward signs of distress). 

Have had 2 panic attacks in 2 weeks. First attack triggered by a change in routine, which I'd known about for at least a week. Came on very suddenly shortly after I arrived at work, in the staffroom, observed by 5 people. Very embarrassed, have never let people see me like this. Calmed down quite quickly after phoning my sister, who calmly talked me through it, and having a 10min break. Able to go back to work. Exhausted into the next day.

Second panic attack was a week ago today. It was huge, the worst of my life. Began with extremely anger at a colleague. Combination of an abrupt change to work routine, leading to loss of the planning I'd put in, and the way I was informed of this and spoken to when I tried to rationally discuss options. I felt immediate rage which I couldn't conceal, then marched impulsively to my boss's office without allowing myself to calm down.

Proceeded to say I hate my job and workplace (I don't, it is a stressful but very rewarding job that I enjoy most days, and am good at). I announced I was going to quit, and I think I asked for a paper and pen to write my resignation then and there. I was completely irrational, I can't even remember most of that hour, it's a blur.

I was physically shaking with rage, speaking very quickly and loudly. My boss was very concerned about my wellbeing, noting that I was presenting in a manic way that she'd never seen with me before. My rage began to subside, but I was very jittery, couldn't sit still, and had high anxiety. Finally I broke down crying whilst talking to her, which is very unusual for me. I felt guilt over my behaviour, muscle aches due to the huge adrenaline spike, and exhaustion for days afterwards.

Hope everyone is doing well. 

32M with BPD, major depressive episodes and anxiety filled fight or flight situations right from making morning coffee. 

Single, mid life crisis and no friends or social circle. 

I'm starting to realise that there is nothing wrong with seeking out help, meds, therapy, support groups, positive vibes as long as we are willing make it neurologically plastic and not a forced coping mechanism leading to toxic positivity. 

I have been wrong seeking approval and validation from a place I shouldn't. 

So long sad complain story to short list that helped me in no particular order,
1. Don't ruminate. Start from now.
2. Cut caffeine and nicotine dependence.
3. Undisturbed sleep with a good routine and time pattern.
4. Workout or keep moving.
5. Wake up to a good routine. Preferably music, candles, decaff tea, sunrise, playtime with pets.
6. Take social media with a pinch of salt. 
7. Cut screen time. 
8. Enjoy any hobby you have for a fixed amount of time, mindfully and completed focused. 
9. Clean up yourself, your bed, your room, your home, your workplace.
10. Say only positive things unless absolutely necessary.
11. Build life skills.
12. Eat healthy. 


Also, just because it happened doesn't mean you can't change your life around now. Yes, it sucks but anything beats staying where we are now. PTSD requires work and patience. 

Sit, think, talk, anything to move forward.

Sharing this to anyone who needs to read. The more we open up and reach out to close ones the more likely they will use it against us or gas light/ hinder the self thought. 

Apologies for not framing it better. 
Do contribute anything that saved you as well. 

Many wishes on your road to betterment.

I finally broke it out this weekend and made coffee in it - thorough cleaning in and out, ran a bunch of water through it to 'clear it's pipes'.

I made an espresso with generic ground coffee (OK, not quite, there are from Juneau, they make a good cup of Americano). But, there was no body to the coffee, only a singular flavor, definitely not even as good as a Ristretto from Nespresso)

I like my espresso very strong, the best cup of coffee I ever had was in 2009, in a tiny hotel in Rome - made 'especially for me' by the mother of the owner of the hotel after she overheard me talking about how good their Americano was at the breakfast. I tasted that coffee (in a good way) all day long, it was fabulous

I have 2 (I hope questions)

1. How should I thoroughly clean the machine? Run vinegar through it, is there a dedicated 'coffee machine cleaning fluid', or ....
2. What beans or ground should I get to achieve my previously stated flavors?",2,1764686690.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I was just checking my email, getting ready to make a cup of coffee, when the familiar chime went off for a PayPal notification. I almost ignored it, thinking it was just a receipt, but the subject line caught my eye: ""Payment Received from Anonymous Source.""

I opened the app, and my jaw dropped. There it was: $3,000.00. It wasn't tied to a job, a client, or a lottery-it was just... there. A true, pure windfall, exactly what I had intended. The feeling was instant: not shock, but a deep, warm wave of confirmation. It felt like the Universe had simply delivered what I had asked for, recognizing our need.

I immediately told Mom. First, confusion. Then, tears.
""Is this real?"" she whispered.
""Yes, Mom,"" I said, pulling her into a hug.

We spent the next two hours mapping out our move, not with stress, but with absolute joy and excitement. The $3,000 is exactly what we needed to breathe a little easier.


We are leaving San Antonio! We are building a fresh, peaceful start. She is already looking at new, low-stress part-time work that she actually wants to do.

This gift isn't just money; it's freedom. It's the beginning of a life where Mom is happy, rested, and no longer stressed about a paycheck. I feel so grateful, so secure, and so ready for our new chapter.

I'm here to meet a woman who can take me on a guided tour through the nooks and crannies of the streets of the polis of her mind. I'm here to admire the architecture of the cathedral of her worldview and perhaps, should the stars align, dwell in the library of her cherished memories - new and old.

**Me, your suitor:**

- An ethnically diverse almost-33yo man standing at a modest 5'8""/172cm with a soft spot for cats, cultures and communism.
- I write poetry, procrastinate on writing fiction and sometimes reminisce about the time I used to compose music.
- I do not lay claim to any religious label, I am merely a seeker of the Unknowable Divine. I do however strongly believe in good and evil, the indissoluble permanence of human souls and a final reckoning between wrongdoer and wronged.
- I have lived a fairly unconventional, unique life. I know I write in basically my own idiolect. But I'm not an individualist and my ideas of freedom and liberty are economic not some socially libertine free-for-all. 
- As for hobbies...those tend to shift here and there for me and are often seasonal but in general I like reading (Humanities, social sciences, fiction), languages, gaming (RPGs and strategy) and conversations about anything and everything.
- Currently on a sabbatical of sorts but my usual line of work is fairly blue collar. I guess that means you can't call me a champagne socialist at least, if I weren't already a teetotaler when it comes to alcohol lol
- I'm predisposed to be a reclusive hermit though that isn't always the case.

**You, the love of my life hopefully:**

I'm looking for someone who believes in something resembling a deity of some sort. Bonus points if you're also left-wing. I expect a healthy idea of good and evil from any potential lover (""partner"" is such a sterile, clinical term!). I greatly appreciate modesty and mutual respect. 
No Zionists.

**Us, the alliance of equals:**

My ideal bond is one in which our love is a sanctuary against the storms of the hellscape that is global postmodern culture; a refuge against the need to mask the intensity of emotion and the depth of any feeling. A world of our own where we wear no masks, where the idols of the arcane, unwritten rules of dating culture lie smashed. At its highest, I wish our bond to be a home. Not necessarily a physical place but the proximity of the distance between a shared glance of affection witnessed by the Loving Divine.

Come then and be a stranger unknown to me no more! 

**A humble suggestion for a simple start:** Tell me, how has your day been? I look forward to being a living repository for your mundane lore :)

1pca3tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pca3tq/he_knows_when_youre_awake/,He knows when you're awake,"This is a story from my childhood. I have long since moved out of... that place, but there's some things that will stay with me forever.

It was the night before Christmas, and the snow had been falling all day, building a thick white blanket outside the window. I had spent the last two hours making a snowman who stood guard by the front door, a snow shovel resting in his frozen hand.

My mother gestured for me to go to bed. I looked to my father, hoping he’d let me stay awake a little longer to catch a glimpse of Santa, but he only shook his head. I knew I had already lost, but I tried anyway.

“But Dad!” I whined. He didn’t even look at me. That was the end of it. I dragged my feet as slowly as possible, waiting for the clock to strike midnight, but my parents weren’t having it.

The chair creaked behind me as my father stood. A moment later, strong arms wrapped around my torso. He lifted me up and carried me down the hall. My mother followed, pulling back the sheets so he could drop me into bed.

They didn’t care that I hadn’t brushed my teeth or changed into pajamas. Before they left, I caught the look in their eyes. They seemed frightened, though I couldn’t imagine why.

The last hour had been strange, but I didn’t think much of it. All I cared about was misbehaving just enough to see Santa. That was my real mistake.

Sleep claimed me fast. The darkness pulled me under.

Then the nightmare began.

I lay on my back, staring at the glow-in-the-dark stars my father had put on the ceiling. They shimmered faintly, giving the whole room a pale green tint. That was when I heard it: footsteps on the roof.

They crept toward the chimney. A low groan followed, then a heavy crash in the living room. Moments later, the bells on the Christmas tree jingled softly.

Silence. My own breathing was suddenly too loud.

Footsteps started again, slow and deliberate, climbing the stairs. They approached my room. The door handle turned. My door gave its usual creak, the one my father had been promising to fix since summer.

I shut my eyes. The steps were too heavy to be my mother. And when my father checked on me, he never came inside.

Whoever this was… did.

The footsteps stopped right beside my bed. A cold touch pressed against my lips. Fingers pried my mouth open.

A soft whisper slithered forth, “These teeth would look perfect on my tree this year.” 

Terror locked every muscle in my body. I couldn’t scream. Pain bloomed as tooth after tooth was pulled free. Blood pooled at the back of my throat, metallic and warm. I kept my eyes clenched shut. I didn’t want to see what stood over me.

The footsteps eventually retreated, moving out of the room. Just before the door closed, I caught a glimpse through barely opened eyes: a pair of red pants disappearing into the hallway.

When I woke, I walked downstairs, numb. It was Christmas morning, but there was no joy left in me. I just needed to find my parents.

My father sat with his coffee and newspaper. My mother was making breakfast.

He smiled when he saw me. I opened my mouth to speak, but only air escaped. My mouth felt… empty.

His smile collapsed. My mother turned, saw my face, and dropped the knife she was holding. Her scream was loud enough that a neighbor rushed over.

My father opened the door and gently pushed me forward. The neighbor looked at me first, then at the plaque beside our door. My mother opened my mouth for him to see.

He didn’t say a word. He simply reached out and carved a third cross onto our plaque. No empty circles left.

Every house had one. Some had no crosses. Others had one for every person inside. It was the simplest way to let others know if you should expect a response.

I guess I wrote this all to say: Santa sees you when you’re sleeping, and he doesn't take too kindly to anyone who peeks.

* **Use Waze:** locals swear by it, and it gives better route options than Google Maps.
* **Carry cash:** small parking spots, viewpoints, and rural shops often don’t take cards.
* **Watch out for sudden rain:** weather switches fast in the Andes.

1pca2qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1pca2qs/my_lovehate_relationship_with_hamilton_beach/,My love/hate relationship with Hamilton Beach Brands. I’ve decided to admire the company from afar-but not invest.,"I’m new to value investing. Just three months ago, if you asked me, I would’ve said long-term investing was pointless. I preferred looking at charts all day and holding onto trades for no more than a week. I liked my strategy. It worked a good amount of the time. But eventually, I realized it's just glorified gambling. Gambling to see if a stock will go up or down a certain amount in a week. And when I dug deeper into options trading, the similarities to sportsbooks became impossible to ignore.

  
Then I read *The Intelligent Investor*. I just assumed it was some overhyped book recommended on the internet. But for some reason it rewired my brain and turned on some lightbulbs. I also realized that investing is something I’ve always wanted to be part of. My dream career goal has always been to invest in new startups—yet right now I have the incredible opportunity to invest in some of the best American and international businesses in the world, companies with proven track records, real earnings, or solid balance sheets.



\*\*\*



Hamilton Beach Brands (HBB)

\~75% consumer appliances (primarily small kitchen appliances: blenders, coffee makers etc)

\~ 15% premium products (HealthBeacon etc)

\~ 8% commercial products (Hotel hairdryers) 



The following is a revised quick version of my analysis. 

Reasons I love it:

1. **Strong Established Brand and Market Position** 

It boasts a substantially sized moat. Founded in 1910, the company has sold the most small kitchen appliances in the U.S. the last few years. #5 market cap in the U.S., but more like #3 when compared to more close competitors. #10-#15 in the world. Products are listed in wholesaler clubs, large retailers, and online. Products also are used in the professional industry like hotels and restaurants. 



1. **Capable and strategic management**

\-I think the company has made smart decisions. Most of their difficulties seem external, ones they can't control. Their calculated plan in 2023 and 2024 made sense and worked.

\- Insider ownership is over 30%. High motivation to manage a flourishing firm. This year, insider purchases have outpaced sales. This further demonstrates confidence in the company's future. Note: stock is down \~12% the last 5 years. 

\-Goals in 2023 were to increase revenue, gross margin, and operating margin. All were met in 2024.



1. **Attractive Value**

\-  I like the stock price. \~15% earnings yield (as of last week), nice P/E, nice PEGY ratio, dividend yield has an upward trend, share buyback program, etc.

\- Margins have been increasing and recovering the last few years. They are better than some direct competitors.

\-Insitutional ownership is low. 51% max. This means it’s overlooked by Wall Street and has less competition to find some real value. 



1. **Smart diversification**

Their recent acquisition of HealthBeacon appears well-thought-out. They have license arrangements with similar businesses, including Brita and Clorox. They are also proficient with small appliances. In order to provide a buffer to their main focus on small kitchen appliances, they plan to join an industry with higher profit margins.



1. **Industry**

\- Not an exciting industry. No new competition anytime soon. Wall Street and recent graduates aren’t compelled or giddy to jump in. 

\- Very easy to understand business model. Not confusing. Not like the AI industry with semiconductors, GPUs and whatchamacallits. 

  


1. **Other Reasons**

\- ROA is steadily increasing.

\- EPS is slowly increasing but on the chart it looks wonky. Inflated costs from inflation in 2021. 2022 had an insurance recovery from the 2019/2020 accounting problem, thus increasing the EPS. Overall positive trend. 2020 EPS is very high due to massive demand during the pandemic. I think overall it's not bad. 

\- I can’t find much information about the new CEO. However, I haven’t found anything negative so I’ll take that as a good sign. He has been in the company for the last 30+ years.

\- Share buyback program done every year. The program looks calculated and the method seems to discover the greatest value for the company. ""Market conditions"" is one of the attributes mentioned by the program's management. In 2019, 2022, and 2023, buybacks occurred at some of the lowest values the stock witnessed those years. 2024 is also not bad. 

\- Consistent goodwill.   


Reasons I hate it:

1. **High customer concentration:**

Walmart is their biggest customer with \~29% of total sales. This gives Walmart more pricing power and leverage over HBB. Having one customer make up almost a third of your sales can lead to issues down the road. Amazon is 24%. The top 5 customers are 65%. 



1. **Volatility and external pressures**

\- This company is just really cyclical. I think they mostly make good decisions, have a good product, and a strong brand. But the external factors like tariffs, supply chain difficulties, and tighter consumer spending forbid this company to consistently flourish. 

\- FCF is all over the place. It’s very volatile but I think a lot of that is external issues that are out of their control.

2019-2020: FCF down due to the closure of a bad subsidiary and accounting issues.

2022: Increase in inventory to manage pandemic-related supply chain risks caused fluctuations. This was smart for the company to plan ahead because the demand stayed but the inventory was the concern so the company made more in 2022.

2023: Paid down debt and liquidated stalled inventory, generating cash. 

2024: Decreased because of their acquisition from HealthBeacon. 

During these years they also were deploying cash for stock buybacks and began diversifying away from China in regard to manufacturing. 

I don’t like these massive fluctuations but I also need to admit this is a somewhat strategic agenda with cash. 



1. **Declining Efficiency** 

\- ROE is steadily decreasing, but still generally above 18%.

\- ROIC is steadily decreasing but still generally above 10%



1. **Other Reasons:**

\- Negative net income in 2019. 

\- Low switching costs. Industry has thin margins.

\- They are ahead in industry growth in North America but lagging in the global industry.

\- This company is not idiot proof. This is a difficult industry in difficult times.

Since then I’ve gone into this mode where I’m trying to lock in, use my strengths, and not let every little thing around me throw me off.

But the thing is, when I’m working from a coffee shop, I’m physically there but mentally not. Friends can walk up, talk to me, even tap my shoulder, and I genuinely won’t react. It’s like my brain disappears into the task and everything else fades out.

I’m trying to spend more time working outside so I can build a habit of being aware of my surroundings, but it’s been hard. My focus tunnel is useful, but it also makes me feel disconnected in public spaces.

Looking for a co-conspirator, co-schemer to build a sanctuary of the heart and soul with . . .
 

Hello stranger, we meet in the digital caravanserai; peace be upon you and upon the path that led you here!

I'd say I like hiking, coffee and Breaking Bad but evidently I'm not that sort of man.
I'm here to meet a woman who can take me on a guided tour through the nooks and crannies of the streets of the polis of her mind. I'm here to admire the architecture of the cathedral of her worldview and perhaps, should the stars align, dwell in the library of her cherished memories - new and old.

---

**Me, your suitor:**

- An ethnically diverse almost-33yo man standing at a modest 5'8""/172cm with a soft spot for cats, cultures and communism.
- I write poetry, procrastinate on writing fiction and sometimes reminisce about the time I used to compose music.
- I do not lay claim to any religious label, I am merely a seeker of the Unknowable Divine. I do however strongly believe in good and evil, the indissoluble permanence of human souls and a final reckoning between wrongdoer and wronged.
- I have lived a fairly unconventional, unique life. I know I write in basically my own idiolect. But I'm not an individualist and my ideas of freedom and liberty are economic not some socially libertine free-for-all. 
- As for hobbies...those tend to shift here and there for me and are often seasonal but in general I like reading (Humanities, social sciences, fiction), languages, gaming (RPGs and strategy) and conversations about anything and everything.
- Currently on a sabbatical of sorts but my usual line of work is fairly blue collar. I guess that means you can't call me a champagne socialist at least, if I weren't already a teetotaler when it comes to alcohol lol
- I'm predisposed to be a reclusive hermit though that isn't always the case. 

---

**You, the love of my life hopefully:**

I'm looking for someone who believes in something resembling a deity of some sort. Bonus points if you're also left-wing. I expect a healthy idea of good and evil from any potential lover (""partner"" is such a sterile, clinical term!). I greatly appreciate modesty and mutual respect. 
No Zionists. 

---

**Us, the alliance of equals:**

My ideal bond is one in which our love is a sanctuary against the storms of the hellscape that is global postmodern culture; a refuge against the need to mask the intensity of emotion and the depth of any feeling. A world of our own where we wear no masks, where the idols of the arcane, unwritten rules of dating culture lie smashed. At its highest, I wish our bond to be a home. Not necessarily a physical place but the proximity of the distance between a shared glance of affection witnessed by the Loving Divine.

---

Come then and be a stranger unknown to me no more! 

**A humble suggestion for a simple start:** Tell me, how has your day been? I look forward to being a living repository for your mundane lore :)

1pc9ww7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKEuS2xwQNM&t=52s,Nobody’s Talking About This SEO Shift — But It’ll Decide Who Wins in 2026,"Something huge just happened.

Google quietly changed how SEO works.

Most people didn’t notice.  
But in **SEO in 2026**, this change will decide who grows — and who disappears.

Watch the video below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKEuS2xwQNM&t=52s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKEuS2xwQNM&t=52s)

👉 [Want to rank #1 and get more leads, traffic & sales?](https://go.juliangoldie.com/backlink-portal)



Here’s the brutal truth:  
The old SEO playbook doesn’t work anymore.

You can have great backlinks.  
You can rank #1.  
You can have beautiful content.

And still… get **zero traffic.**

Because Google’s new AI Overviews now show the answers *above* your site.  
People get their info without ever clicking.

You’re losing traffic — even if you’re winning rankings.



# 🧠 What’s Actually Working in SEO in 2026

Forget everything you knew about SEO.  
Forget word counts, keyword stuffing, and backlink spam.

Google’s AI now reads your content like a human.  
It knows if your page helps people or wastes time.  
And if it doesn’t add value, it gets buried.

So here’s what I do now:

✅ Answer one clear question fast.  
✅ Cut the fluff.  
✅ Make it easy for AI (and humans) to read.  
✅ Use short sentences, short paragraphs, clear headers.

That’s how you get into **AI Overviews** and still keep traffic flowing.



# 🧩 The Biggest Mistake I See

People still write like it’s 2023.

They add intros nobody reads.  
They hide answers behind paragraphs.  
They write essays instead of solutions.

Here’s the new rule for SEO in 2026:  
**Give the best answer fast — then make people want more.**

If your content is the source that Google’s AI uses, great.  
But the real win is getting users to click to learn the full process, tips, or bonus steps.

That’s what separates winners from everyone else.



# 🔍 Search Intent Is Everything

If you don’t match intent, you don’t rank.

If people search “best laptop,” they want to buy.  
If they search “how laptops work,” they want to learn.

Google knows that — and ranks accordingly.

Look at what’s ranking.  
If Google shows lists → write a list.  
If it shows tutorials → write a guide.  
Match what’s already working.

That’s SEO in 2026.



# ⚡ Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust

**EEAT** is now the backbone of SEO.

Google wants proof that you’ve done what you talk about.

AI content isn’t enough.  
It can’t fake real experience.

So show it:  
Screenshots, case studies, results, photos — whatever proves you’ve lived it.

If you’re real, Google will reward you.



# 🔗 Backlinks Still Matter (But Smart Ones Win)

Links are still currency — but only quality links count now.  
One relevant, trusted link beats 100 spammy ones.

Internal links are also critical.  
Link your key pages together strategically to boost their authority.

👉 [Want to rank #1 and get more leads, traffic & sales?](https://go.juliangoldie.com/backlink-portal)



# 🎥 The Rise of Video SEO

YouTube is now the second biggest search engine — and Google owns it.

That means embedding videos on your pages makes Google happy.  
Videos keep users on-site longer.  
That signals value.  
Value = rankings.

You don’t need a studio or budget — just clear answers in video form.



# 📍 Local SEO Is Changing Too

If you run a local business, this matters.

AI is now generating **local search results**.  
“Best coffee near me” might show an AI recommendation before your site.

You need to be in that answer.

Optimize your Google Business Profile.  
Add photos.  
Get reviews.  
Post updates weekly.

These simple steps can double your local leads.



# 🤖 Zero-Click SEO Is the New Normal

Half of all searches are now **zero-click**.

People find answers directly on Google.  
No click.  
No visit.

Sounds bad — but it’s not if you play it right.

When users see your brand in AI answers, they remember it.  
They might not click today.  
But they’ll search your brand tomorrow.

So make sure your brand name is visible everywhere.



# 💥 What to Do Next

Here’s how to future-proof your SEO in 2026:

1. Update your old content to be **clear + fast**.
2. Add **proof of experience**.
3. Build **high-quality backlinks** (not just any links).
4. Create **videos** around your key topics.
5. Optimize for **brand visibility** in AI results.

That’s the new SEO stack.



# 🧠 Final Thought

Most people won’t act on this.  
They’ll complain about traffic drops and blame algorithms.

But the truth is — SEO didn’t die.  
It evolved.

Those who adapt now will own the future.

**SEO in 2026** rewards clarity, expertise, and action.  
Not hacks, not fluff, not spam.

\- Bezzera BZ10  
\- Profitec Go

1pc9tnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1pc9tnr/does_anyone_else_not_really_feel_camaraderie_with/,Does anyone else not really feel camaraderie with too many other trans folks seen “in the wild”?,"I don’t really feel any kind of way about seeing other trans folks out and about, I don’t necessarily want to become instant best friends or whatever I hear described as the general state of camaraderie around transness. Obviously I love that they’re out here too on their journey, but I, many times, fail to feel that camaraderie others seem describe. Maybe it’s because I’m on the spectrum and traumatized around “stranger danger,” idk. I’m bad at people-ing in general.

Everyone’s journey is so distinctly their own, and I was raised in such a fashion and makeup critical household (as in critical over getting it “just right,” not critical over which gender wore what, or who was “allowed” to wear makeup. I know a great deal of this judgmental crap got passed on to me and normalized to the point of almost considering it a separate trauma, but it’s been functionally helpful in boosting my self-confidence.

And I’m on such a weird version of my own journey, that I know my unsolicited “advice” would just increase everyone’s dysphoria. Because they’re out here being themselves, some of them can’t afford certain things or don’t want to do certain others, be it surgical, makeup, or fashion, but my first instinct is to “help” so the bigots can’t pick them apart, or so they’ll stop picking themselves apart. Part of my dysphoria has been constantly picking apart my looks in terms of thinking I’m hot enough (much less post FFS, but still).

Like I know that some people don’t pass and don’t want to, and that’s great for them. I don’t feel that way, and it’s hard for me to relate, so talking about most things just gets awkward. I got insurance to cover more FFS procedures than usual by moving cross-country and going to a surgeon who is a higher risk than some of the venerated ones and dodged the bullet of the risks to get exactly what I wanted, and some people aren’t comfortable with that level of risk, and again, great for them, but hard to relate to those who wouldn’t risk something to get exactly what they want, and I don’t want to push that comfort with risk onto anyone as that’s a me problem.

I didn’t come into the community through drag, I don’t like Fallout 76 or New Vegas or whichever one I’m “supposed” to like as a gaming transfemme. I don’t enjoy the Fallout games period, I’m a horror and Overwatch girlie like 90% of the time unless it’s really awesome fantasy (BG3 or DragonAge, not so much Skyrim, even modded), or Assassin’s Creed (Kassandra helped crack my egg).

My career is not in coding, and I don’t survive on Monster as much as I used to. I’m on to coffee because it’s less likely to cause reflux or damage my intestines long term.

I know which tricks and next steps will aid in my “passing” (I already mostly do).

I waited to have a kid with my wife (pansexual, don’t worry, she’s still right here next to me asleep while I’m typing this) the “old fashioned” way before starting to physically transition. No frozen sperm, no adoption. I wanted to be prepared for similar mental health issues to either of us because I’ve seen adoption go both fantastically and horribly based on that, and I didn’t want to mess up some kid because I didn’t know what to look for, and didn’t know which coping mechanisms to teach, like I said, I don’t want to pass my comfort with risk onto someone else.

I became a homeowner by moving to the middle of nowhere (it’s beautiful here, but I often miss the takeout selection of civilization). I don’t get up to much activism because the sensory stimulation of crowds gives me an extreme sensory overload. I do go to NYC Pride every once in a while, but not crowded marches. Also I have a kid to consider now, and if her mothers get picked up for exercising their First Amendment Rights (as I’m sure this administration demands), there’s really no one to care for her.

You just don’t see many homeowner, middle-of-nowhere, psychobilly, witchy, mom, lesbian, married, non-Fallout, non-Monster-Energy, non-coder, non-drag, cosplaying, D&D-loving trans gamers who aren’t estranged from their family, and who want to pass. I’m not saying I want to only have friends who are exactly in my shoes, but it’s rare that I run into anyone who shares even two things in common with me in the trans community, especially out here in the middle of nowhere.

Am I alone in this, that when I pass other trans folks in the wild, I’m not immediately drawn to be best buds? If anything I’m more cautious because I don’t want to be a disappointment as friend in sharing nothing but transness in common.",15,1764685656.0,MtF,16,0.76,False

Snowballs candy (it’s Alaska. It snows)

Candy cigarettes (mom chain-smoked)

Warm socks and a blanket (it’s cold)

I’m looking to take the next step in my espresso journey and finally upgrade to a proper machine.  
Up until now I’ve been using the SMEG ECF01. It was fine as a starter machine, but I’m definitely feeling its limits now..

What I’m looking for:

Short heat up time  
Good steam performance for milk drinks  
Budget around 1000 euros, give or take 200

Daily coffee routine:

My wife drinks a couple of Americanos per day  
I mostly drink cappuccinos  
Sometimes we have guests over and I’ll make 2 to 3 cappuccinos or Americanos  
The machine should manage that without long pauses or temperature or steam drops

I’ve already put together a small list of machines that I’m interested in:

\- Ascaso Steel Uno/Duo PID  
\- Bezzera BZ10  
\- Profitec Go  
\- Essenza Nina Dual  
\- Quickmill Pop

My questions for you:

Which machines in this price range would you recommend for my use case?  
For my mix of Americanos and cappuccinos, what should I pay special attention to, for example single boiler, heat exchanger, PID, boiler vs thermoblock?

I’d really appreciate your recommendations, experiences, and any specific model suggestions 🙌

Hello stranger, we meet in the digital caravanserai; peace be upon you and upon the path that led you here!

I'd say I like hiking, coffee and Breaking Bad but evidently I'm not that sort of man.
I'm here to meet a woman who can take me on a guided tour through the nooks and crannies of the streets of the polis of her mind. I'm here to admire the architecture of the cathedral of her worldview and perhaps, should the stars align, dwell in the library of her cherished memories - new and old.

**Me, your suitor:**

- An ethnically diverse almost-33yo man standing at a modest 5'8""/172cm with a soft spot for cats, cultures and communism.
- I write poetry, procrastinate on writing fiction and sometimes reminisce about the time I used to compose music.
- I do not lay claim to any religious label, I am merely a seeker of the Unknowable Divine. I do however strongly believe in good and evil, the indissoluble permanence of human souls and a final reckoning between wrongdoer and wronged.
- I have lived a fairly unconventional, unique life. I know I write in basically my own idiolect. But I'm not an individualist and my ideas of freedom and liberty are economic not some socially libertine free-for-all. 
- As for hobbies...those tend to shift here and there for me and are often seasonal but in general I like reading (Humanities, social sciences, fiction), languages, gaming (RPGs and strategy) and conversations about anything and everything.
- Currently on a sabbatical of sorts but my usual line of work is fairly blue collar. I guess that means you can't call me a champagne socialist at least, if I weren't already a teetotaler when it comes to alcohol lol
- I'm predisposed to be a reclusive hermit though that isn't always the case.

**You, the love of my life hopefully:**

I'm looking for someone who believes in something resembling a deity of some sort. Bonus points if you're also left-wing. I expect a healthy idea of good and evil from any potential lover (""partner"" is such a sterile, clinical term!). I greatly appreciate modesty and mutual respect. 
No Zionists.

**Us, the alliance of equals:**

My ideal bond is one in which our love is a sanctuary against the storms of the hellscape that is global postmodern culture; a refuge against the need to mask the intensity of emotion and the depth of any feeling. A world of our own where we wear no masks, where the idols of the arcane, unwritten rules of dating culture lie smashed. At its highest, I wish our bond to be a home. Not necessarily a physical place but the proximity of the distance between a shared glance of affection witnessed by the Loving Divine.

1pc9mfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pc9mfh/9_terrifyingly_effective_psychology_tricks_to/,9 Terrifyingly Effective Psychology Tricks to Make ANYONE Like You (Backed by Science),"I used to think being likable was mostly about looks, popularity, or charisma—all the shallow stuff you see on TikTok. But here's a hard truth I had to unlearn: being liked has far more to do with psychology than personality. I’ve seen people with average looks and zero social media presence become magnetic in real life. Meanwhile, people chasing attention online often fail in real relationships because they don’t understand basic human behavior.

We live in a world that rewires our brains for dopamine, instant validation, and fake “personality hacks” that don’t work in real life. This post is a breakdown of what actually works to become more likable—based on real research, not recycled influencer trash. These insights come from psychology studies, bestselling books, awkward real-world experiments, and some of the best minds in behavioral science. None of this is about manipulation. It’s about tapping into what our brains are already wired to respond to.

Let’s get into the actual science-backed ways to make people like you more (without selling your soul or faking your personality):

1. **Use the “pratfall effect” to appear more human**  
People like you more when you’re competent but occasionally make small mistakes. This is called the pratfall effect, discovered by psychologist Elliot Aronson. If you’re great at something but accidentally spill coffee or laugh at yourself, you become more relatable. You’re seen as human, not arrogant. That vulnerability creates connection. But note: this only works if you’re already perceived as competent. So don’t fake mistakes right out the gate. Show your value first.

2. **Ask meaningful questions (and actually listen)**  
In a Harvard study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, people who asked follow-up questions were rated as more likable than those who didn’t. Don't just ask, “How’s it going?” Ask things like “What’s keeping you busy these days?” or “What’s something you’re excited about right now?” Then listen, reflect, and go deeper. True connection isn’t about being interesting, it’s about being interested.

3. **Mirror their energy subtly**  
This is called the chameleon effect. Behavioral researcher Tanya Chartrand showed that people who subconsciously mirror another person’s posture, language, or tone come across as more likable and trustworthy. Don’t copy every move—it’s creepy. But match their vibe. Slow down your speech if they speak slowly. Sit the way they sit. The brain sees similarity as safety.

4. **Show warmth before competence**  
People decide whether to trust you in the first 7 seconds. According to Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy, most people think showing competence first builds respect. But if you lead with warmth—things like a genuine smile, calm eye contact, or shared vulnerability—you get likability and trust. Then, when you later show your skills or intelligence, it amplifies everything.

5. **Use the “Ben Franklin effect” for instant connection**  
Want someone to like you more? Ask them for a small favor. Sounds backwards, but research found people rationalize their behavior by thinking, “I helped them, so I must like them.” Ben Franklin used this to win over a political rival by asking to borrow a rare book. The trick works best when it’s a low-effort ask. Like “What podcast do you recommend lately?” or “I’ve been meaning to try that app—can you show me?”

6. **Tell micro-stories about yourself**  
Oversharing is a red flag, but staying silent makes you forgettable. The sweet spot is short personal stories that show self-awareness, struggle, or humor. Psychologists call this self-disclosure. It triggers a powerful loop—people feel closer to you and want to open up too. But keep it short. Think 20-second glimpses: “I used to be super shy at networking events, but then I tried this weird trick I read in a book…”

7. **Use people’s names early and often**  
This one’s simple but powerful. Dale Carnegie nailed it in “How to Win Friends and Influence People”: the sweetest sound to any person is their own name. Don’t overdo it or make it robotic. Just sprinkle it in when saying hi, telling a story, or wrapping up. It shows attention and personal recognition, which boosts liking immediately.

8. **Make people feel seen, not just heard**  
There’s a big difference between nodding along and making people feel understood. Try reflecting back what people say. If someone says, “I’ve been slammed at work,” don’t just say “That sucks.” Try: “Sounds like you’re juggling a lot and not getting much breathing room.” They feel understood and emotionally validated. That’s what makes conversations memorable.

9. **Be consistent with your presence**  
People like familiarity. Psychologist Robert Zajonc calls this the mere exposure effect. The more we see something or someone, the more we tend to like it (as long as there’s no negative experience attached). This is why showing up matters more than saying something clever. Be available. Be reliable. Stay present—even when it’s quiet.

If you want to go deeper, here are some of the best resources I’ve found to actually master likability (not in a fake, manipulative way, but in a grounded, human way):

1. **Book: ""Captivate"" by Vanessa Van Edwards**  
This bestselling book by behavioral researcher Vanessa Van Edwards breaks down real social science on what makes people charismatic, without needing to fake anything. Think of it as a playbook for conversations, body language, and building magnetic relationships. It’s insanely practical—this book will make you see social situations completely differently. Best social science book I’ve ever read, no contest.

2. **Book: ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer**  
Written by a former FBI agent who specialized in behavioral profiling, this book reveals how to use subtle cues and behavioral psychology to build rapport fast. It’s not about manipulation, it’s about creating trust—whether in dating, business, or everyday life. Especially useful if you’re socially anxious or introverted.

3. **Podcast: The Art of Charm**  
One of the top-rated psychology and communication podcasts out there. They focus on social dynamics, networking, and persuasive communication. Episodes like “How to Be More Memorable” and “The Psychology of Likability” are gold. Highly recommend this if you’re trying to grow socially or professionally.

4. **Podcast: Hidden Brain**  
Hosted by Shankar Vedantam, this show explores human behavior in a deeply evidence-based yet accessible way. Episodes like “The Power of Circles” and “How to Build a Better Social Life” go deep into the neuroscience of likability and connection.

5. **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
This channel breaks down why people like celebrities and how you can apply these traits practically. Their breakdown of Obama, Chris Hemsworth, and Keanu Reeves are masterclasses in understanding presence, warmth, and confidence. Great visuals and super digestible.

6. **App: BeFreed**  
An AI-powered learning app that turns expert interviews, book summaries, and scientific research into personalized podcast-style lessons. It’s built by a team from Columbia and ex-Google, and recently went viral on X for a reason. I use it to learn practical psychology, communication patterns, and social dynamics while walking or commuting.  

What makes it addictive is the “deep dive” mode—40-minute curated lessons with real-world examples. And you can talk to its avatar, Freedia, mid-episode to ask questions or get clarity. It helps me internalize key ideas and apply them in conversations. Honestly, it's helped me replace mindless social media scrolling while actually improving how I connect with people.

7. **App: How We Feel**  
This app teaches emotional granularity—which is key to connecting with people in a non-awkward way. Developed by psychologists from the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, it helps you name, regulate, and express emotions. Useful if you freeze up or don’t know how to respond when people get real.

8. **App: Rapport**  
This AI-powered app uses your phone's mic and camera to analyze your speaking habits in practice conversations. It gives you feedback on your tone, pacing, eye contact, and even filler words. Super helpful for refining your communication style without judgment. Basically social skill reps, but in private.

There’s a science to being more likable. You don’t need to fake it or memorize corny pickup lines. You just need to understand how the brain reads trust, warmth, curiosity, and presence.

Most people are too distracted or self-conscious to connect deeply. That’s why the bar for likability is surprisingly low.
