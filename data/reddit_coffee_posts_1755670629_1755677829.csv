One often overlooked yet essential aspect of office maintenance is [commercial carpet cleaning](https://steamcommander.com/service/commercial-carpet-cleaning/). Carpets in commercial settings face heavy foot traffic, spills, dirt, and pollutants daily. Regular professional cleaning is vital to keep your business environment healthy, attractive, and welcoming. In this article, we’ll explore the top benefits of commercial carpet cleaning for Houston businesses and why it’s an investment worth making.

# 1. Enhance Workplace Appearance and Professionalism ✨

The first impression clients and visitors get from your business often comes from your office’s cleanliness. Dirty, stained, or worn-out carpets can make even the most modern office look neglected and unprofessional. Regular commercial carpet cleaning restores your carpets’ vibrant colors, removes stains, and revitalizes their texture. A clean and fresh-looking office reflects well on your company, creating a welcoming atmosphere that impresses customers and boosts employee morale.

# 2. Improve Indoor Air Quality for a Healthier Workspace 🌿

Houston’s climate, known for its humidity and dust, contributes to the accumulation of allergens, dust mites, and bacteria in office carpets. Carpets act like filters, trapping airborne particles, which, if left untreated, can circulate back into the air, triggering allergies and respiratory issues among employees and visitors. Professional carpet cleaning removes these harmful pollutants, significantly improving indoor air quality and creating a healthier environment. This can reduce sick days and increase overall productivity.

# 3. Extend Carpet Lifespan and Protect Your Investment 💼

Commercial carpets are a major financial investment. High foot traffic combined with dirt and grime can quickly wear down carpet fibers, leading to fading, fraying, and an overall worn appearance. Regular professional cleaning removes dirt and debris embedded deep within the fibers that ordinary vacuuming cannot reach. By preventing abrasive buildup, commercial carpet cleaning prolongs the carpet’s life, saving your business money on costly replacements and repairs.

# 4. Remove Stubborn Stains and Odors Effectively 🧽

In commercial spaces, spills, stains, and odors are inevitable. Food, coffee, ink, and other substances can leave unsightly marks and unpleasant smells if not treated promptly and properly. Professional commercial carpet cleaners use specialized equipment and cleaning agents designed to break down tough stains and eliminate odors thoroughly. This deep cleaning ensures your carpets remain fresh, clean, and odor-free, contributing to a more pleasant environment.

# 5. Minimize Downtime with Efficient Service ⏰

Commercial carpet cleaning providers understand the importance of minimizing disruption in busy workplaces. Many offer flexible scheduling, including after-hours or weekend services, to ensure your business operations continue without interruption. Their advanced equipment and experienced technicians complete the job quickly and efficiently, so your office can return to normal as soon as possible.

# Why Houston Businesses Should Choose Professional Carpet Cleaning

Houston’s unique climate challenges—high humidity, dust, and heat—make professional carpet cleaning even more important. Local companies are familiar with these conditions and offer tailored cleaning solutions that effectively address issues like mold growth and persistent allergens. Professional cleaning services also use eco-friendly products, ensuring the safety of your employees and reducing environmental impact.

# Final Thoughts

For Houston businesses, investing in regular commercial carpet cleaning delivers numerous benefits—from enhancing your workspace’s appearance and protecting employee health to extending carpet life and controlling odors. Clean carpets reflect your company’s commitment to professionalism and create a welcoming environment for clients and staff alike.

Don’t wait for visible dirt or odors to take control of your office space. Schedule regular professional carpet cleaning to maintain a fresh, healthy, and attractive workplace that supports your business success.",1,1755677088.0,u_Cultural-Material-86,0,1.0,False
1mv8nzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mv8nzy/did_she_cheat_or_am_i_overthinking/,Did she cheat or am I overthinking?,"I (27M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (25F) for almost four years. In the beginning, everything seemed fine, but I noticed something unusual when I once asked her about her exes, she avoided the question, and since it was early in the relationship, I didn’t press further.

About three months in, she invited me to meet her at a Starbucks near our university. She knew I was busy and likely wouldn’t come, but I unexpectedly finished early and decided to join her. When I arrived, I saw her sitting with another man. I immediately asked, “Who is this?” She explained that he was an old friend from high school. I was upset and left starbucks, but later she called to clarify that he was just passing by the university and joined her for coffee. I chose to believe her.

Sometime later, while scrolling through Instagram, I noticed a man consistently liking all of her posts. When I asked her about him, she admitted that he was her ex. That raised my suspicions, and I began paying closer attention to her online activity. A year into our relationship, I noticed she had liked a photo of that same ex on Facebook. When I confronted her, she claimed it was an accident. At the time, her ex was still on her friends list.

Later, she confessed that she had two more exes she hadn’t mentioned before. She admitted she had avoided telling me earlier because she was afraid I would get angry. I forgave her, reminding myself that the past should remain in the past. Since then, we’ve moved in together and now share a child.

Even so, I can’t help but wonder to this day, did she lie to me, or am I simply overthinking?",1,1755676967.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

If you're into strong, rich, and flavorful coffee, you *have to* try brewing Vietnamese coffee with a Phin filter. It's super easy, budget-friendly, and delivers a unique brew that's both bold and smooth, especially when you're using [premium coffee beans.](https://thecaphevietnam.com/collections/coffee) Let's get into it:

# What You'll Need:

* **Phin filter** (you can grab one online)
* **2 tablespoons of premium coffee beans** (medium to dark roast works best)
* **Hot water** (just off the boil, \~195–205°F / 90–96°C)
* **Sweetened condensed milk** (optional but highly recommended)
* **Glass or mug**
* **Spoon + timer**

# Step-by-Step Brewing Guide:

**Grind your beans:**

Go for a medium-coarse grind similar to table salt. Too fine and it'll clog the filter; too coarse and you'll get a weak brew.

(**Pro tip:** Always use **premium coffee beans** for a richer, smoother taste!)

**Prep the Phin filter:**

* Remove the press (the inner lid).
* Add two tablespoons of ground coffee into the filter.
* Shake lightly to even the grounds.

**Place it over your glass or mug.**

**Pre-wet the coffee (Bloom):**

Pour about 15ml (1 tbsp) of hot water to bloom the coffee. Let it sit for \~30 seconds. This helps release CO₂ and enhances flavour.

**Start brewing:**

* Place the press on top of the coffee grounds gently.
* Slowly pour \~100–120ml of hot water into the filter.
* Cover with the lid and let it drip. It should take about 4–5 minutes.

**Sweeten it up (optional):**

If you like it the traditional way, stir in 1–2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk. It balances the strength beautifully.

# Tips

* Use filtered water
* Warm your cup beforehand to maintain brew temperature.
* Experiment with condensed milk or drink it black to taste those premium beans.

Saying it’s wrong, I watch with him as a dense night cuts off the everyday and steps over it; I hold my breath.
His voice is unlike before, the resonance strong; sound shuttles and shatters on the wall.
I peel a scab from my scalp, let it drop into the basin, rinse it off, laugh at the death-rattle as it’s sucked into the drain,
peel the growth behind my ear and split it in half with a fingernail.
Only a floating ideal lights my feet; the shadow stretches far, and I fling my attention to its tip.

There lie the lukewarm corpses of his past stacked up; the films and books he called worthless and threw away are scattered.
Saying there’s almost nothing, I look away, find fragments of dates in the herds of livestock passing, and fall silent.
There’s nowhere for my gaze to flee.
I try pressing the bellows of a freight train caught in a net, but only the slack in the fittings widens.
So I pull out the future spread of my notebook, put a lid on the plans, tuck it away somewhere.

I think only this—what were all those hours for?—then pull a molar and trace just its shape.
I don’t speak.
The thought of biting through my tongue outruns the image; I look like someone else; I remember we’re out of coffee beans.

Winged ants lift, grass flows, birds wheel, the season’s smell rubs my skin.
He stares without blinking and, with a third eye, gauges the shadow of reckoning left on my face.
The lids close; the field goes dark.
I brace a wavering knee and gouge the gravel with my sole.
He says he won’t reach the next day,
and still, before any preparation that would block hope, he lets it die, and with the same mouth says, “I’ve chosen how to die.”
I dissolve that line into fish soup and offer it to his parents.

Having come up from the provinces, we were killed by the city; unable to decide where to go, we amount to nothing but an ending.
“There are many like that.”
“Because we’re the same, aren’t we?”
For my part I got by on borrowed lines, smiling neatly to gloss it over.
Memory wears down the arcade inside me.

I want to know when that reckoning comes.
To prepare for payment, I burn old letters, pack the ash in a rice-cracker tin, and pour it over my head.
Thinking so, I look at his face: the shadow of my dead father stands there, and the gaze runs through the world.

After the funeral, something definitely ends.
An ending slaps the rump of a beginning, but does not call it.
Laughter is lighter than condolence money; by the urn I slit an envelope’s mouth; the aunt beside me tries to haggle even the rent.

And then, one by one I throw things away and forget; the burned bolt picks up slack, and the night closes quietly.
All that remains is a little debt.
Memories are buried like the films at my feet; from the frame I lift a cat.

Night thickens again; our talk stays hoisted; only the smell remains.
On the inside of the jacket he loved, the salt of old cloth crystallizes,
and the third eye counts one white grain and, sleeping, moves on.



---


Explanatory Poem | The Third Eye



The bone of this poem is night; what moves is payment.
The image is the sound of a drain; the act is the hand that seals; the trace is a grain of salt.
“Just,” “so then,” “even so,” and “and then” become joints.
Livestock are a river of people; laughter is lighter than condolence money.
Violence stays a little laughable and leans on institutions.
The bolt gains slack, the night closes, the conversation hangs on its hook.
The father’s shadow queues at the ledger; the gaze runs through the digits.
The third eye counts a single white grain and sleeps.
Here, an ending does not summon a beginning.

I developed a tool to translate .xcstring files with strings. It works on AI, so you'll need an OpenAI API key. You can adjust the specifics of your application for more accurate translations. Just drag the .xcstring file from your project into the program, select the language or all languages from the dropdown, and hit ""auto-translate."" You can go grab a coffee. Requests will not exceed limits, so you don't need to worry about how many strings you need to translate.

When everything is ready, click the ""copy source"" button and replace the one in your project with the one you copied.

There are no subscriptions in the app. The price is fixed.

The app localization works great when you translate into all languages and the App Store page. My app started receiving trials worldwide. The number of trials tripled. Don't overlook localization.

# Memory Transcript: MTM Field Officer Cole Belicheck

**Date: [Redacted], 2136**

Most of my job is waiting for something to happen, such as it is right now. We have a team scrubbing the copied hard drive for anything useful, and until they find something or Chino makes a call that we can track, we don't have much to go off of.

In order to keep busy, we were running down every lead we had, trying to find the rest of the missing Venlil and discover the identity of the buyer. If we were on Earth, it'd be as simple as dragging the seller in and interrogating him until he gave them up, but people will notice if their equivalent of the sheriff went missing.

Currently I was running the serial numbers of the cold storage crates that were holding the seized, processed Venlil meat. Unfortunately they were extremely common, could be bought from many sources in bulk, and no one kept good records of the storage crates they bought—only the items they put in them.

I sigh and lean back in my chair to stare at the ceiling. Another dead end sat on my laptop display, a long list of meaningless tracking numbers for produce shipments.

""Having fun tracking down lettuce?""

I spin around in my chair to see Diaz approaching with a tablet tucked under his arm, his signature Hawaiian shirt hung loose on his slim frame and he had a large cup of coffee in one hand.

""If I read one more merchandise logbook with nothing but salads in it, I'm gonna lose it,"" I whine.

A quick analysis of his face says he has something. I could always read Diaz like a book; it's the reason I do the undercover work and he doesn't.

I put my hands behind my head and narrow my eyes as I lean back. ""What'cha got there?""

Diaz smiled mischievously. ""What, this?"" He gestured to his tablet. ""It's just a little something to get our noses out of the logbooks.""

He handed it to me and continued after a sip of coffee. ""We found out who our sneaky little Venlil is. I got everything we could find on her. May I present to you Lusora, ex-investigator for Brighton Grove Police Department.""

I began scrolling through the file, skimming the important details. ""Ex?""

Diaz nodded. ""She was a rookie investigator that was 'encouraged to quit' after a falling out. Apparently her younger sister was arrested two weeks ago, suspected of predator's disease, but there are no records of her being charged, released, or transferred. She voiced her complaints against the exterminators' guild and people didn't seem to appreciate that.""

""Sounds like she's on the same trail we're on, just a few steps behind. Do we know what she knows?""

Diaz shook his head, but a smirk gave away that he had a plan. ""We don't, but right after her resignation she made several sizeable purchases—one notebook and writing utensils to go with it, a new unregistered pad that she has yet to register, and she shifted some of her finances around to make her purchases more difficult to track. She clearly thinks she's being watched, and she clearly knows what she's doing.""

I hand his tablet back to him and pull up the report on my laptop. ""Then how are we going to find anything if she's covering her tracks so well?""

Diaz leans over my shoulder and scrolls down on the report till I see a selfie of Lusora and a human woman, early twenties, Irish heritage. ""She participated in the exchange. Miss O'Brian resides at the local shelter and the two are good friends."" He takes another sip of coffee and throws the empty cup away. ""Ditch the sad gray hoodie, we're going to need some suits.""

---

The van pulled to a stop outside the human refugee shelter, and out stepped Antonio Santiago and Nathan Riley—AKA me and Diaz. Both of us had on crisp suits, and I held a laptop bag that sported the UN logo.

We walk up to reception through the front entrance, Diaz immediately deploying his natural charm on the receptionist, who I won't lie was way too good looking to be a receptionist.

""Good paw, beautiful. We were wondering if we could get a room number for one of your residents and if I could get your number for a night out.""

She smiled at the two of us and blushed a little. ""Good paw to you as well, gentlemen, and I'm flattered but you're a few years too late."" She displayed a wedding ring and chuckled.

Diaz just shrugged. ""My apologies, can't blame me for trying.""

She smiled again in good humor and turned to her computer. ""You two must be the UN reps here to see Miss O'Brian. She's in room one-thirty-three, just take a right and it's down near the end of the hall.""

We both thank her and make our way down the hallway before knocking on Miss O'Brian's door. She answered the door wearing a white blouse with beige capri pants, her red hair was pulled into a messy bun, and her fingernails were painted an ocean blue.

""Hello, Miss O'Brian. I'm Nate and this is Tony, we messaged you about the exchange partner wellness checkup. We'd like to thank you for accepting on such short notice.""

She stepped to the side and beckoned for us to enter. A polite smile on her face as she did. ""Welcome, come in please. I'll admit I was a wee bit shocked to get yer message, but I'm glad ye could make time to get down here before yer flight out.""

She had a strong Irish accent, which made me smile a bit. I've always found that accent a little funny. ""We prefer to do these in person, but with so many exchange members and such a small staff, we end up doing most of them virtually, Ma'am.""

""Please, call me Bailey. I'm sorry that Lusora couldn't make it.""

Bailey shut the door behind us and gestured to a table. All three of us sat down with Diaz and I across from her. I pulled up my laptop and we began the interview as if we were really there to see how well things were going for the partners post exchange program.

We spent nearly twenty minutes with a few mildly probing questions nestled into the rest of them while we interviewed. The fake interview was easy enough, Bailey liked to talk and was somewhat lonely so she enjoyed the company, and me and Diaz had conducted dozens of interviews just like this, just with a little different context.

""So both of you have been doing well as of recent then? No major points of concern?"" Diaz asked.

""Well, the transition to Prime has been a wee bit rough. But I've been able to manage it well enough."" Her natural cheery expression faltered a bit before she finished. ""Lusora has had it difficult for a few weeks now, though. Her sister went missin' and she's started all these conspiracy theories about how the exterminators kidnapped her.""

She leaned in toward us as if she was about to spill a secret and we both leaned in a little to indulge her. ""Meself and her have been watchin' some o' those old cop shows recently, and she just recently learned what a vigilante is. She's been doin' her own investigation now, it's takin' up almost all her time these days.""

Diaz and I swap an intrigued glance and I decide to probe a bit further. ""This is a little concerning. Has she found anything substantial, or is it all just her grieving?""

Bailey just shrugged and crossed her arms on the table. ""Beats me. She doesn't have enough evidence to go to the authorities, she told me that there's some predator's disease buildin' north of town in the boonies that has all the answers she needs.""

""Predator's disease building?""

She just leaned back and sighed. ""She called it the, 'Keleck Rehabilitation Center' or somethin' of the like. She's started shuttin' me out now though, not sharin' as much. She's gettin' paranoid.""

I fold down the laptop and give her a reassuring smile. ""I'm sure she's just grieving. Just continue to be there for her. We'll see if we can't get you both some support from the program.""

Diaz nodded and stood up from his chair, extending his hand across the table. ""Thank you very much for meeting with us Bailey. We have taken enough of your time, and we have a flight to catch still. We wish you the best of luck.""

We exchange handshakes and she showed us to the door.

Once back in the van I removed my tie and unbuttoned the top button of my shirt, then immediately pulled up my laptop to start searching for this 'rehab center' while Diaz was driving us back to the black site. We are going to find this place, and we are going to pay it a little visit when we do.

This past month has been a roller costar for me , and tbh not very productive for last 15 days , but we are sticking to it 🔥🔥🔥

so far , I have not achieved the targeted sectional/mock score , though atp it's not very far.

I am done with VA except the rote learning part and 3/5 of quants (not doing more for now , I am trying to focus all my into these three until I master them......modern maths and geometry ain't that hard anyway)

1st and 2nd Images are of my latest VA mocks , avg score is around 125 

3rd image is of my VA sectionals when I started , avg score of 85 was the norm

4th image is of my only MCQ sectional.

Now the fourth Image here is what actually tells the whole story of my MCQ section - no dilr , no mock skills whatsoever . I initially increased my marks by 30 when I learned mock skills in VA , I at least expect 8 from here . DILR , often considered easiest section by my peer group , is like a no man zone for me ...... I have zero DILR knowledge as I never studied it , but if it's easy as they say , I expect another 16-20 from here .....giving me not 40 but 60 marks in MCQ if I make these improvements successfully.  

again , things are not all good . SA , Which absolutely killed my every chance to a PI this year , will also scar me here if not addressed now . as 40 in SA is 2/3 marks , I believe achieving it will require me more than 4/5 th of the syllabus .... I have to make a choice if I should work on current topics or complete the syllabus first.

another problem what might stand in my way is quant's fatigue which might affect my scores in VA , not much can be done here as of now , I will drink a lot of coffee before the D DAY mock(20 sept) I guess

anyway , I believe I will get a 220 even if I don't get a 40/40 /140 .......which can be a good or a bad thing depending on whether I perform good or bad in quants(as ATS matters )and if I clear the cutoffs . 

Next post will be last of this challenge , see you all on 20 sept .... I will work my ass to get this shit done till then . signing off  (hoping dumb me is not forgetting to mention something 😇)",4,1755676307.0,IPMATtards,3,1.0,False

I open sourced it and it analyses years of your Apple health data privately. You can check it out here: [https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth](https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth)

But it's a pain to run docker, open the terminal and run python code. So I turned it into a Mac app for those that want to just USE it. It runs locally on your Mac and you can use A.I. to analyze the data locally using Ollama. Since then a bunch of new local LLM's have come out and I think it'll be cool to use the new GPT-OSS if your system is powerful enough.

And that's when it dawnned on me—why isn't my self-care about finding peace in tohse small everyday moments?

I realized I don't need an elaborate spa day to unwind. Maybe true self-care for me now is sitting quuietly, soaking up the world around me, and letting myself be present. It feels like findding a slice of inner peace right in the chaos of normal life. 🌼

Lisdexamphetamine long release and Dexamphetamine booster

when i started taking elvanse i realised after a about two weeks that im getting terrible stomach pain pretty much immediately. 
so i did make sure i had at least a banana or something before it. usually i d just take the meds when my alarm goes and then snooze for another hour until im too awake to keep lying in bed. 

then i started only taking the regular dexamphetamine booster instead both at that time as it still got me up and running and only taking the elvanse an hour afterwards. that staggered approach worked well avoiding late afternoon slump and stomach pain right after taking the meds. 

now, about 9 month later, im getting the same instant stabbing pain in my stomach, middle upper body right under the sternum, when taking my 10mg dexamphetamine. having loads to drink with meds does not help. i now need a decent amount of something halfway solid or i ll suffer. 

i ve not been one to eat early at all and usually only do that mandatory lil snack / banana, snooze n hour, get up n, make a coffee, start work n have a proper breakfast round noonish. atm my snoozing routine is pretty much gone as im awake too much after eating but still too foggy n irritable to be comfy or around ppl. so i need the meds but the stomach pain is beginning to worry me. 

anyone can relate, have similar xp, tips or insights? much appreciated

1mv8bn2,https://i.redd.it/kdw8plhzo4kf1.jpeg,Top Signs You Need to Visit a Dentist Immediately,"Dental health is often overlooked until the pain becomes unbearable or the problem worsens. Many people delay visiting a dentist, assuming the issue will resolve on its own. However, early detection and treatment can prevent severe complications, save teeth, and reduce the cost of treatments. If you have been searching for a [*Dentist near me*](https://share.google/Sm9fXGrZb9zMPkyaI), this article will help you identify the top warning signs that you should not ignore.

# Why Ignoring Dental Health is Risky

According to research by the American Dental Association (ADA), nearly 42% of adults experience oral health issues but postpone dental visits due to fear or cost. Unfortunately, untreated dental problems can lead to infections, tooth loss, and even affect overall health. Studies have shown strong links between gum disease and systemic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory problems. This makes timely dental checkups not just important, but essential.

# Top Signs You Need to Visit a Dentist Immediately

# 1. Persistent Toothache

A constant or sharp pain in your tooth is one of the clearest signs of an underlying issue. Toothaches can be caused by cavities, infections, or damaged fillings. If ignored, the infection may spread to the root and require a root canal or even extraction.

**Expert Tip:** Do not rely only on painkillers. Persistent tooth pain should always be examined by a qualified *dentist in Pune* to determine the root cause.

# 2. Swollen or Bleeding Gums

Bleeding gums during brushing or flossing might seem harmless, but they often indicate gingivitis or early gum disease. Swelling, redness, or tenderness in gums should never be ignored, as gum disease can progress into periodontitis, which affects the bone supporting your teeth.

# 3. Bad Breath or Unpleasant Taste

Chronic bad breath (halitosis) is not just embarrassing; it could signal gum disease, infections, or poor oral hygiene. Sometimes, it may also indicate systemic issues. A professional cleaning and check-up can help resolve this issue.

# 4. Sensitivity to Hot and Cold

If sipping tea, coffee, or ice water causes sharp pain, you may have worn enamel, cavities, or exposed roots. Dental sensitivity requires prompt attention, as untreated sensitivity can progress into more severe decay.

# 5. Loose or Shifting Teeth

Adult teeth should not feel loose or change position. Shifting teeth may point to bone loss due to advanced gum disease or trauma. If you notice gaps developing between your teeth or difficulty biting, it’s time for an urgent dental visit.

# 6. Mouth Sores or Lumps

Ulcers, white patches, or unusual lumps in the mouth that don’t heal within two weeks can be signs of infections or, in rare cases, oral cancer. A dentist can examine and recommend appropriate treatment.

# 7. Jaw Pain or Clicking

Pain or clicking sounds in your jaw while chewing or talking may indicate temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). It can also be linked to teeth grinding or misalignment.

# 8. Dry Mouth

Constant dryness in the mouth can lead to cavities and gum disease, as saliva is essential for washing away bacteria. Dry mouth can be caused by medications or other underlying conditions and needs evaluation by a dental expert.

# 9. Broken, Chipped, or Cracked Teeth

Even minor chips or cracks can expose your teeth to bacteria and infections. Early intervention with bonding, veneers, or crowns can save your tooth and restore aesthetics.

# 10. Difficulty Chewing or Speaking

Pain or discomfort while chewing is a serious sign that requires immediate attention. It could be due to cavities, infections, or misaligned teeth. Similarly, speech difficulties caused by oral issues should not be ignored.

# The Role of Dental Implants and Advanced Care

For individuals with missing teeth, [*dental implants pune*](https://share.google/Sm9fXGrZb9zMPkyaI) provide a reliable and permanent solution. Unlike dentures, implants preserve bone structure, restore chewing ability, and look natural. Early consultation with an implantologist ensures better outcomes.

1mv8bb0,https://neurosciencenews.com/olfaction-radio-wves-29588/,Summary; Key Facts | Radio Waves Can Strengthen Sense of Smell (4 min read) | Neuroscience News [Aug 2025],"**Summary:** A new study introduces a safe, painless way to improve the sense of smell using radio waves. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on strong scents or medications, this noninvasive method stimulates olfactory nerves directly through a small antenna placed near the forehead.

Testing showed that a single five-minute session improved participants’ ability to detect faint odors for over a week. Researchers believe this approach could help patients with smell disorders and professionals who depend on fine scent discrimination.

**Key Facts**

* **Noninvasive Therapy:** Radio waves enhance smell without chemicals or surgery.
* **Proven Effect:** One treatment improved odor detection for more than a week.
* **Future Use:** Could benefit patients with smell loss and scent-dependent professionals.

**Source:** American Institute of Physics

Our sense of smell is more important than we often realize. It helps us enjoy food, detect danger like smoke or gas leaks, and even affects memory and emotion.

Many people — especially after COVID-19, aging, or brain injury — suffer from a loss of smell. However, there are very few effective treatments, and those that exist often use strong scents or medicines that cause discomfort in patients.

In a study published this week in *APL Bioengineering*, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Hanyang University and Kwangwoon University in South Korea introduced a simple and painless way to improve our sense of smell using radio waves.

Unlike traditional aroma-based therapy, which indirectly treats smell loss by exposing the patient to chemicals, radio waves can directly target the part of our brain responsible for smell, without causing pain.

“The method is completely noninvasive — no surgery or chemicals needed — and safe, as it does not overheat the skin or cause discomfort,” author Yonwoong Jang said.

In the study, the team asked volunteers with a healthy sense of smell to sit while a small radio antenna was placed near, but not touching, their forehead. For five minutes, this antenna gently sent out radio waves to reach the smell-related nerves deep in the brain.

Before and after the short treatment, the authors tested how well the patient could smell very faint odors, like diluted alcohol or fruit scents, using pen-shaped odor dispensers called Sniffin’ Sticks. They also recorded the patients’ brain signals to see how active their smell nerves were.

The team found that their method improved subjects’ sense of smell for over a week after just one treatment.

“This study represents the first time that a person’s sense of smell has been improved using radio waves without any physical contact or chemicals, and the first attempt to explore radio frequency stimulation as a potential therapy for neurological conditions,” Jang said.

The results of the current study, which focused on people with a normal sense of smell, could help professionals such as perfumers, chefs, or coffee tasters, who need to distinguish aromatic subtleties. The method could be also used to preserve or even enhance the sense of smell.

As an important next step, the team plans to conduct a similar study on individuals with olfactory dysfunction, such as anosmia (complete loss of smell) or hyposmia (reduced sense of smell).

“This will help us determine whether the treatment can truly benefit those who need it most,” Jang said.",2,1755675623.0,NeuronsToNirvana,0,1.0,False

My parents helped me rent a small apartment near campus,luckily I won’t have to share a bathroom with anyone. They’ve been really supportive and helped set up the place with all the furniture and appliances.

I have been working at a coffee shop for almost 8 months, and here’s the list of gifts I got myself to celebrate:

Invisalign – This basically took all my savings (and yes, my parents helped too). I have always felt a bit insecure about my teeth,I had an overbite and never liked how I looked when I smiled. I thought about getting metal braces, but I really didn’t want to start college with a bunch of wires in my mouth, so I went with Invisalign

Soocas electric toothbrush and Zima Dental’s ultrasonic cleaner, My dentist told me it’s super important to floss or use a water flosser. I found this Soocas one on Amazon that’s a toothbrush and water flosser in one, so it saved me from buying two separate things

Lululemon Double Zip Backpack 22L – I used to use the Adidas Wonder Blue. Honestly, even though the Lululemon one is smaller on paper, it somehow holds more. I got the raw linen color and love how the compartments are set up. I keep my iPad in the laptop sleeve, lunch and daily stuff in the main part, a pouch of hygiene stuff in the front pocket, and my ADHD meds plus power bank in the top pocket. My favorite part? The stretchy mesh side pockets,one fits my water bottle, the other holds my umbrella. Super handy

Stanley THE ICEFLOW — I ended up leaving with the Prickly Pear iceflow (which has the new lid/spout thankfully). Love that the accent on prickly pear is actually an olive color (originally it looked black or navy). And Petrol is a really pretty smokey blue in person…

1mv88p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1mv88p9/29_m4f_hiking_and_running_dates_qc/,29 [M4F] Hiking and Running Dates - QC,"Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you're a fellow lover of specialty coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? You either get guys who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly ones so I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine!

**Edit**

Note: I’m reposting this since I haven’t found the right person yet. This will be my last attempt—if it doesn’t work out, maybe online dating just isn’t for me. Still, I’ve met some good people along the way: some weren’t ready for anything serious, and with others, the connection just didn’t click. I’d like to reiterate that I’m looking for someone who’s physically active, not obese, and who doesn’t do drugs or have tattoos.

1mv87ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Living_in_Korea/comments/1mv87ba/assumptions_i_used_to_make_about_korea/,Assumptions I used to make about Korea,"I have lived in Korea for just over a year and I have always thought the people I encounter are kind and pleasant. That is until I have started taking my Korean friends to some of my favourite cafes and restaurants. 

Now not everyone is like this and I genuinely believe there are many kind people in Korea BUT my Korean friends have opened my eyes towards things I missed because I speak minimal Korean. Enough to get by but not really have conversations. 

For context, I am a white female and I would say I’m decently attractive and I am a very quiet person. I don’t wear perfume and I dress conservatively. Most of my shirts have necklines that go all the way up and all my bottoms go at least to my knees. Almost everything I wear is clothing bought in Korea. 

Here are some things that have happened to me in the last two months that before my friends mentioned something to me I never would have noticed. 

1. A coffee shop near my house that I visit maybe once or twice a month. Always the same people working and I thought they were kind but just didn’t speak much. I took a Korean friend and they were shocked at how rude the staff were to me. I was confused and asked what they meant and they said “every time you spoke in Korean they responded in English” and I suggested that maybe they just wanted to practice English but they said no, they immediately started speaking to each other about how I was a stupid foreigner. 

2. Another coffee shop. someone bumped into my table and knocked my drink over and it spilled all over me but they had already run out of the cafe and didn’t notice or didn’t care. The two girls in maybe their 30s at the table next to me laughed at me and started mocking me while a guy from another table helped me clean up. The staff charged me 25,000원 for the inconvenience and for disturbing other guests. I asked my friend about this and they said that is not normal. 

3. I went to a dermatologist to ask about a procedure. They said it would be 20,000원. I asked 3 times if they were sure and showed them the number on my calculator and they said yes things are very affordable here in Korea so I scheduled an appointment and when I showed up for it they told me it would be 283,000 원 and that 20,000 and 283,000 are so similar in price that they’re basically the same. When I told them I live and work in Korea so I know that’s not true they started blaming a coworker for giving me the wrong price. When I showed them the email confirmation I had with the price they told me they could no longer do the procedure and asked me to pay a 40,000 cancellation fee and leave. 

4. I met a Korean friend at a cafe and they got there maybe 10 minutes before me and ordered a drink. Once I arrived I said hello, put down my bags and I went up to the register to order my drink. The staff was on their phone watching a show and didn’t notice me until I was standing in front of them. I said hello and I ordered my drink all in Korean and in English they said I had to get food too if I wanted to stay in the cafe when my friend came over and said something to them and we ended up leaving and going elsewhere. My friend didn’t explain what they talked about but that the cafe doesn’t like foreigners and I shouldn’t go back. 

5. I went out for coffee with a group of coworkers. After about 10 minutes an older lady came over and told me to be quiet because I was too noisy. I wasn’t even talking, my coworker was speaking to someone else in Korean. I don’t think I had said a single word since sitting down. Maybe 5 minutes later a staff member came up to me and said several customers had complained about me being a disturbance and asked me to leave. I was shocked and my coworkers got upset with the staff but I don’t like confrontation so we left.  


All of my Korean friends have mentioned that whenever they go to cafes and restaurants with me they feel bad because the staff are always so rude to me. Most staff in cafes or restaurants don’t speak to me and if they do they only talk to me in English, even if I answer in Korean. I just assumed people were shy or wanted to practice English. There are also several ajummas and ajushis that I swear go out of there way to shove me to the side when I’m not even in their way but I think that elderly people tend to do that in general here.

Don’t get me wrong I love living in Korea and I encounter so many nice and lovely people every day but sometimes I wonder if I was fluent in the language how different my experience would be here. And I also know I am very privileged in general but these are just some things I’ve noticed in the last two months or so.

1mv86vu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mv86vu,Weight loss process from someone who lost 40 kilos.,"First of all, be patient, you cannot lose the weight accumulated in 5 years in 5 days and 5 weeks.
Losing 1 kg a week is a lie. When you start the diet, the body loses the water it retains and you can lose 2-3 kg in the first week, but as the process goes on, this number will decrease and resistance weight will be formed. Considering all these, if you are ready for the diet, we can talk about other items.

1) stay hungry 
We all know how important 'food' is for Turkish society. If you are sick, they feed you, if you are pregnant, they feed you, if a guest comes, they feed you... Let's admit it, we are hungry. But the body needs hunger as much as it needs energy. As long as you snack, as long as you eat 4 or 5 meals a day, your body will not burn large fat masses because there is already ready-made food entering the body. There is no need to use the warehouse. My personal advice is to do if. Create a breakfast and dinner routine between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Leave the body hungry for 16 hours. *** I can recommend nuts to those who have blood pressure problems. There is nothing that a handful of almonds cannot solve.

2)sugar consumption
In my opinion, buying sugar is equivalent to going and drinking the engine oil of your car. If you say you don't use sugar but drink latte, you are using sugar like honey. latte = milk = lactose sugar. If the coffee you drink is not filter coffee, Americano or plain Turkish coffee, I'm sorry, you are addicted to sugar. The same goes for the fruit group, fruit = fructose sugar. As long as sugar enters the body, the body does not say ""let me burn storage"". why would you say that?

3)carbohydrate
Carbohydrate is a storage food. Rice, bread, pasta... When you consume carbohydrates, your body will store it and send it to your hips and abdomen. Our goal is to get rid of them anyway. It is a futile effort to place a bucket under the tap while it is open and try to drain the water from the bucket. Turn the tap down first. I'm not saying you should avoid carbohydrates when you see them as absolute. Stay away from things whose main nutrients are carbohydrates. reduce it down. 

4)use of oil
Consume olive oil, avocado, hazelnut oil, walnut oil, healthy oils. Your skin will improve and your pain will improve. I'm not saying drink 1 liter of oil a day. Don't be afraid to drizzle olive oil on your salad. You can run away wherever you see sunflower and margarine derivatives.

5)water consumption
After the body burns fat, it excretes it through urine, breathing and sweat. To increase breathing and sweat, exercise is a must, cardio is a must, lifting weights is a must, but that is another matter. You need to drink water so that the urination mechanism works. 

6)sports 
hit cardio. pulse up and down. Don't be afraid of breathing and being out of breath - unless you have a heart problem. lift weights. As your muscle ratio increases, the oxygen needed by the body increases, so when your muscle ratio increases, your daily calorie burning rate (what we call metabolism) will increase. 

7)g5 ems slimfit vs
If you have been eating unconsciously for a part of your life, if you consume too much fizzy drinks and fast food, sagging, stretch marks and cellulite are normal. You can reduce it a little bit with the g5 application. However, as long as there is no nutrition and sports, it is no different than donating to a beauty center.

8)surprise the body
At the resistance weight (I stayed at 65 kilos for 8 months, I know I cried with anger :D) So, when your weight stabilizes during your diet process, you need to surprise the body. Let me explain it like this: We will consume food that is not normally included in our routine and is not included in the diet, say to the body 'I'm just kidding hehehhehehhe' and continue the diet. It is better to be careful. (The move that made me weigh 64 after weighing 65 kilos was eating 2 slices of pizza)

9) love yourself
What is losing (not being able to) lose weight? I am one of those who know best. I know what it is like to lose 3-4 kilos, go shopping and come back without buying anything. I know what it is like to escape from mirrors, window reflections and huge glass stores. For years, I used the chair at the lowest setting at the hairdresser. To avoid seeing my waist. Don't be angry with yourself. the past is past. Tomorrow is still in your hands. I have been living consciously for a year. I finally fit into the dress I bought 3 years ago.

We know each other from school and are staying in the city over the summer for internships. We’re supposed to keep living together through the fall semester too. She’s nice and friendly, but I’m honestly getting exhausted by her and her cat. She found him on the street about a month before she moved in to the apartment, and about two weeks before move-in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I said no because I’m allergic. She told me he was hypoallergenic and “excited to meet me,” and I didn’t have the energy to argue. I really regret that now.

Since day one, the cat has been acting out. First night in the apartment, he peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table. She started keeping him in her bedroom at night, but now he howls nonstop. She literally never leaves the apartment and he still howls incessantly. During my Zoom meetings and calls, he’s in the background yowling. He also lunges, hisses, and scratches at me even though I literally ignore him and never approach him. He still is feral and my roomate doesn't really do anything about it.

He constantly goes to the door and windows crying to be outside and paces around like he’s restless. My roomate doesn't let him outside and it's clear he's miserable.

She sleeps in bed with it overnight and complains about all the scathes and ""love-bites"" he gives her. She puts tiny boots on him “so his paws stay protected,” and buys him new toys every constantly. She literally waves a stuffed fake bird in front of him saying “you don’t need the outside world, you have this.” Which fells crappy. I didn't know until this situation that it's not safe for cats to be free-roaming but I still feel like he needs to be outside at least for at least part of the day. I've offered to walk the cat but my roomate says he hates the leash so ig that wouldn't work either. He howls all day and the only thing that quiets him is when my roomate feeds him- she tells me to feed him whenever im annoyed by his yells but I don't because...

The cat is severely overweight from all of this. He struggles to jump on the couch. He trips over his own stomach, knocks things over, and pants after walking across the room. The vet already told her the peeing is behavioral and that he’s obese, and she still just says “he’s just healthy now”

The apartment smells like pee and litter 24/7 and she refuses to set any boundaries with the cat, so the howling, scratching, and destruction keeps getting worse. She thinks this is all normal and keeps telling me he “just needs more love.”

I feel like I’m going crazy and I still have to live here until December. I don’t blame the cat — he’s just acting like an animal — but I’m exhausted and starting to resent both of them.

She has 5 litterboxes for the cat in each room of the apartment (even in mine because he figured out how to open the door (clever guy) and likes to pee in my bed when im gone :) ) but doesn't use them- im guessing she probably never trained him so he poops and pees wherever he wants, he has a million cat trees all around the apartment, and she is constantly petting and playing with him so it's not that he's neglected and acting out.

Im kinda at a loss. I've only had dogs and rodents and am pretty cluelesss about cats. I do not know what to do to help this guy, im not big on cats but this dude has an awful quality of life, how do I help improve his behavior withtou crossing a line? My roomates very protective of the cat and hasn't reacted well in the past when I brought up training him?

He is snipped so that isn't the issue and unforch I can not move out without getting a fine from my university because technically my roomate hasn't broken our roomate agreement we signed (before I knew about the cat) so it would count as ending the lease on my terms, and she wouldn't have to pay. Sorry for the long post, any advice helps! Im sure I sound pretty dumb to all of you but I want to help train the cat of both of our sakes tysm in advance",1,1755675142.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

Then she started sitting with another friend (22F, Chinese) and barely spoke with me anymore. It happened somewhere in the middle of the course. (3 or 4 Weeks ago)  
  
I thought that it is due to preparation for the exams, and did not pay many attentions, but after classmates stared to spread rumors, I decided to ask her. When I asked her about it, she said it’s just exam prep. I asked to sit with her again, but she said her friend also wants to sit with her. I made a stupid comment comparing her friend to a “guard dog” (I meant loyal/devoted, not insulting), because one time she chased me away from a place where our friend wants to sit. She got offended, and instead of just apologizing right away, I tried to explain. Eventually I did apologize, but since then she’s been distant (actually I am not sure if since then, it feels like she was distant since she sat with that girl).  
  
She used to call me “little brother,” so I know she doesn’t see me romantically. I just wanted a good friendship because I like her outgoing personality. TBF, at the start from the side we looked like a love birds, so maybe the reason in this? She might think that I am in love with her. TBH, I had sympathy at the start, but I didn't feel like I deserve her, at least right now I can not give anything to the relationship (except friendship and emotional support), my goal was just to build a good friendship with her. It’s been a month of coldness, and I’m thinking of asking her for coffee after her exams this weekend - but I’m worried it might be too late  
  
One more thing: a friend (24F) told me she has a boyfriend, though she never mentioned him. Plus, a friend (approximately her age, F) from China is visiting her, so perhaps she’s just busy. Still, during breaks she chats with everyone except me, which makes me feel singled out  
  
TL;DR: Classmate (33F) used to be close to me (23M), then started sitting with a friend and stopped talking to me. I made a bad “guard dog” comment, apologized, but she’s been cold for a month. I only wanted friendship, and I’m debating whether to ask her for coffee after her exams. It's not a long relationship, just almost two months (and last month was cold, but I'm still thinking about her). I am thinking to try to casually chat with her after exams to break the ice, or invite her (including her visiting friend, so it doesn’t look like a date) for coffee (but if she has a boyfriend and her friend know about this it might be awkward). In my country it is okay to have a friend from other gender, but I am not sure about China, that's why I mentioned it so much in my post  
  
My question: How can I rebuild things without making it awkward? I hope that situation is not really hopeless, course will last for one and a half month.",1,1755675016.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Celtic vs. Kairat: A Tale of Two Teams, One Overwhelming Favorite**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient footballs with opinions, we gather to witness a clash of titans: **Celtic** (Europe’s answer to a winning lottery ticket) vs. **Kairat** (Kazakhstan’s “we’ve never done this before, but we’re *very* organized” team). The first leg of their Champions League qualifiers kicks off on August 20, and the odds? Let’s just say bookmakers are so confident in Celtic, they’ve already started planning Kairat’s Europa League send-off party.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Celtic is the Sun, and Kairat is a Candle

Let’s crunch the numbers like a defender crunching a watermelon on the pitch. Celtic’s H2H odds sit between **1.1 and 1.12**, implying a **90-91% chance of victory**. For context, that’s the statistical certainty of your morning coffee being hot—or your boss micromanaging your weekend. Kairat’s odds? A comically steep **17-22.5**, translating to a **5-6% chance**. If you’re betting on Kairat to win outright, you’re essentially betting that gravity will stop working during the match.

But wait! There’s a lifeline for the underdogs: the **+2.5 goal handicap** market, where Kairat’s odds of **1.69** suggest they might avoid a *humiliating* defeat. Implied probability? **\~60%**. So, while Celtic is expected to win, Kairat could very well keep it closer than the price of a NFT in 2022. The spread markets back this up, with Celtic favored by **-2.25 to -2.5 goals**. In other words, Kairat needs to be as stubborn as a Kazakh ox to keep this within three goals.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Ambition, and 100,000 Ticket Requests

Celtic, Scotland’s answer to a well-oiled Swiss watch, enters with a **55-game Premiership winning streak** this spring. Their squad? Healthy, hungry, and probably already drafting a victory speech in Kazakh. Kairat, meanwhile, is a team of contradictions: they’ve won the Kazakh title four years in a row but have never sniffe

1mv82zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mv82zk/aio_bfs_mom_keeps_taking_my_food/,AIO - bf’s mom keeps taking my food…,"I’m (20F) living with my bf (23M) , his mom and younger brother. I’m currently 30 weeks pregnant but that’s not really relevant other than the fact that I signed up for WIC and have EBT. I just recently got a job but haven’t started it yet since I have to go through training next week; so I don’t have any income at the moment. Meaning I rely on my food stamps and WIC. 

Last month before I got my new job, my bf’s mom asked me to buy her those K-cup coffee from Costco with my EBT. Although I had offered to buy stuff to make meals for everyone, I had not agreed to use it for anything for one person unless it was for myself. Like nobody else in our home drinks coffee so that’s something I wasn’t going to get her. I turned her down, I did hesitate to say no because I didn’t want to be rude and it’s something I wasn’t comfortable saying straight to her face. I asked her if it was wrong to say no she said it was fine so I said no. She proceeded to get upset and tell my bf that I can’t even help him out since he had even offered to give her money for the coffee but she didn’t say anything to me. She left to her car after and then when she came back she threw her keys pretty loudly indicating that she was upset and then stomped upstairs to her room. 

After I finished the dishes, my bf and I went to the store to pick someone up for one of his friends. She called him while we were waiting for an assistant to open something for us and he walked away to talk to her. At first I didn’t know who he was talking to but when someone finally helped us he got off the phone and he was visibly irritated. I asked him who was on the phone and he told me that it was his mom. She had told him that she didn’t want me living with them anymore. She had asked for one thing (which isn’t true that whole month she had been asking me if I had money on my EBT and if I had any WIC left; she even told me I should have helped her buy the fruit for our baby’s gender reveal with my EBT) and I couldn’t even do that. She goes off about how she pays for everything (ex. part of the rent, water, and electricity etc) and that I don’t contribute to anything (which is also not true, I have been getting groceries for all of us since I got my card and I have helped with rent when I was working last year, even when it wasn’t a lot it was something, I had literally woken up that day and started doing chores even though I do that every day). I apologize to my bf for putting him in that position (she had also told him that she knows that he would leave if I had to and that she loves him) I never expected that conversation to escalate to that level of my living situation being at risk. 

Once dinner time came around, I had cooked dinner for everyone, his brother grabbed food and ran upstairs and then his mom had come downstairs grabbed food and ate it in the kitchen rather at the table that I had set up. When she finished she asked me if I would be happier living with my parents. I told her that I was fine here but that if she wanted me out then I’ll find a way to get out of her hair. I asked her when she wanted me out and she said that she wasn’t kicking me out but that she feels like we are on different pages and that she felt disrespected and like I was taking advantage of her kindness for letting me stay with them. We have this whole conversation about why I told her no and a lot of it was just going in circles. She said that I didn’t seem happy there because so many things were being brought up all the time. Like she has a problem with me leaving notes even though I have only left 2 one was to remind them to help with the litter boxes because she had said she would do them but then proceeded to leave them dirty for a week while my bf was out of town and the other was to tell his brother to keep my cat out of his room if he didn’t want to help out with caring for her like feeding her or letting her out to use the bathroom. That note did have some anger attached to it so I get how that note could have come off as rude. She also doesn’t hold my bf’s brother accountable for anything like cleaning up after himself or at least his mom and brother such as doing their dishes when the sink is full or when there is dishes left on the stove or table. Even though that’s something expected from all of us (all of us meaning me my bf and his mom). So there have been times where I have left his and only cleaned up after myself. She had a problem with that and we all had a conversation about helping each other out because we all want a clean home. Nothing has really changed. You still have to ask him to do things. 

Anyways I’m getting sidetracked on if I’m overreacting or not. 

During this main conversation about my EBT and me “not contributing”, she brought up that she just wouldn’t ask me for anything anymore and that she won’t eat the food that I buy. 1) I never had a problem with sharing. 2) I never said she couldn’t eat my food. I didn’t say anything to that because she started rambling about something else so I’m going off of her word(s). From that night on, I have only bought food for me and my bf. I don’t go shopping unless I’m out of food or I really need something such as a missing ingredient for a recipe. 

I bought heavy whipping cream for a potato soup that I like to make, eggs, string cheese for snacking throughout the day since my baby likes to kick the shit out of me as soon as I get a sense of hunger. I should have my own space for the food I get with EBT but we only have one fridge so I put my stuff on one side of the fridge depending on the size. I also keep my stuff in a small drawer in the fridge since nobody really gets veggies but me. I thought she would stick to her word about not taking anything I buy but I woke up one morning and had seen that my heavy whipping cream was opened. I put it behind our Britta since I have put things in the back before and they go untouched by anyone but me, but that wasn’t successful. She uses it for her coffee  in the morning even though she has like 3-4 creamers and her own milk. I ended up putting it in the small drawer, that I put my protein shakes that she has also used for her coffee without asking, and it worked she stopped using it. Although she has used some of the eggs that I have bought.

We ended up going out to eat one morning and she asked who had bought the whipping cream and I said I did and she asked why I bought it. I explained to her that I needed it for soup. She told me that she was used it for her coffee and I just let her know that I knew. Then fast forward to this week and last week. I woke up early one morning to go watch my brother and she was in the kitchen making her coffee, she seen me grab my cheese sticks from the drawer and I already had a feeling that she would want to grab some too. I never offered her any especially since she said she didn’t want to eat anything I bought. But I had grabbed 2 cheese sticks and forgot about it then until I got home and so I put them back in the fridge to eat the next morning. She had taken one and she has been taking them since. She only now just brought up that she had “one” of my cheese sticks and that she didn’t know if I was hiding them or something, I told her I know, but her having one is a lie because I have only had either 4-5 out of 16 since I bought them and half of them are gone now and her and I are the only ones in the house that eat them. 

I just don’t get why she would go and say that she wouldn’t eat anything I buy but then go and sneak theses things and then once she knows I caught up to her taking them she’ll go and tell me that she’s been using or took “one”. Idk sorry for the long rant/vent but I just want to know if I’m overreacting about this or not. I don’t want to feel like I have to protect my food in anyway and wish things would go back to the way it was before the coffee incident but you can’t go back in time and maybe this is for the better. 

Btw I don’t eat anything that she buys or offers me because I never asked her for anything even before I got my EBT and WIC and I told her if she doesn’t want to eat anything I buy or ask me for anything then to just buy stuff for her and my bf’s brother because I got me and my bf.",1,1755674735.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I’ve started a LISA and an emergency fund, but there are other “wants” I’m saving up for gradually to, such as tattoos, Christmas budget, holiday funds and potential engagement ring etc etc. 

I currently manage my finances through 3 accounts I have with Lloyds (they’re old accounts still on my app so it’s useful to me using them as different pots). I get paid into account 1, which has my emergency fund buffer in it, and all my bills come out from. I leave enough there to cover the bills and then transfer into account 2 (figures as an example) £500 which is my monthly “fun money” for things like takeout, impulse purchases, my coffee treats. And I put £1,000 into account 3 and have this as my “saving” account. 

The savings account is only on pittance interest and money comes in and out for the bigger things often enough that an ISA or S&S doesn’t seem worth it, and the money there isn’t significant. 


So here’s my issue. The money in account 3 isn’t very clearly marked how much is there for shorter term things like tattoos vs longer plans like holidays etc and I find myself at risk of overspending on one area to the detriment of another without being aware. 

What I’d like is a single account (with any bank provider) that will let me “partition” the funds in the account for select things.

Instead, he told me not to buy him anything and we argued. That’s when he ended things.

We were together for 2 years, and this wasn’t the first breakup. Most of the time I argued with him because he was always busy with work and family. He has some kind of avoidant issue.... I tried to understand, but I also work long hours and still wanted to make time for him. Whenever I wanted to talk, he would fall asleep or call me immature. I just wanted to feel heard.

I’ve broken down a lot over this. He would say sorry, but nothing changed. He sometimes said he was sad too and even cried, but then everything went back to the same cycle.

Before leaving, he told me not to wait for him or text him anymore. But at the same time, he promised he would come to my graduation and even said he wants to see me in 10 years. Part of me wants to believe him and wait, hoping maybe we could get back together that day. But another part of me knows I’ve already spent most of this relationship just waiting for him.

1mv80sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/chatgpttoolbox/comments/1mv80sd/boston_dynamics_and_deepmind_debut_alma_a/,"Boston Dynamics and DeepMind Debut 'ALMA', a Humanoid Robot That Learns Complex Physical Tasks from Single Video Demonstrations","In a collaboration that merges world-class robotics with cutting-edge AI, Boston Dynamics and Google DeepMind today unveiled ALMA (Articulated Language-Model Agent), a new humanoid robot platform capable of learning and replicating complex, multi-step physical tasks after watching a single video of a human performing them. A video released by the companies shows ALMA observing a person making a cup of coffee—grinding beans, operating an espresso machine, and steaming milk—and then successfully reproducing the entire sequence. This ""one-shot"" learning ability represents a monumental leap in embodied AI, moving beyond pre-programmed routines to a future of general-purpose robots that can learn on the fly.

The technological breakthrough behind ALMA lies in the sophisticated software stack that translates visual input into robotic action. The system integrates three key AI components. First, a powerful Vision-Transformer (ViT) model, which the teams call ""Action-ViT,"" processes the demonstration video. It doesn't just see pixels; it segments the video into a series of discrete sub-actions and identifies the objects involved and their spatial relationships. For instance, in the coffee-making task, it identifies ""pick up portafilter,"" ""insert into grinder,"" and ""press grind button"" as distinct steps. Second, the output from Action-ViT is fed into a large multimodal model, reportedly a specialized version of Google's Gemini. This model acts as the robot's ""brain,"" translating the identified sequence of actions into a high-level, language-based plan. It effectively reasons about the task, saying to itself, ""First, I need to get the coffee beans. Then, I need to grind them. The video shows the human using the silver machine for that.""

The third and most critical component is the policy network that translates this high-level plan into precise, low-level motor commands for Boston Dynamics' new, highly articulated humanoid hardware. This is where the real magic happens. Instead of learning a policy from scratch through millions of trials of reinforcement learning, ALMA uses a technique called ""inverse policy distillation."" The large model generates a target outcome for each sub-action (e.g., ""position the portafilter under the grinder spout""). A pre-trained, general-purpose motor control model then rapidly calculates the specific joint torques and movements required to achieve that outcome, effectively creating a new ""skill"" in real-time. This is what allows for the one-shot learning; the robot is not learning the physics of movement from scratch, but rather sequencing pre-existing, generalized motor abilities based on the new instructions from the language model. The ALMA hardware itself is a marvel of engineering, featuring new high-torque electric actuators and tactile sensors in its fingertips, giving it the dexterity needed for such delicate tasks.

The implications of this technology are staggering and extend far beyond making coffee. A robot that can learn by watching could be deployed in countless unstructured environments. In manufacturing, it could be taught a new assembly line task in minutes by a human worker, rather than requiring days of reprogramming by robotics experts. In logistics, it could watch a video of how to properly load a truck with irregularly shaped boxes and immediately adapt its strategy. In elder care or home assistance, it could learn a user's specific daily routines simply by observing them. This drastically lowers the barrier to deploying robots for a vast range of tasks, potentially transforming entire industries and aspects of daily life. Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a renowned AI researcher not affiliated with the project, commented, ""This is the convergence we've been waiting for. The fusion of large-scale vision and language models with advanced robotics hardware is the key to unlocking general-purpose physical intelligence. It's a significant milestone on the path to AGI.""

Of course, the challenges are still immense. The demonstrations, while impressive, were in controlled environments. How ALMA will handle unexpected situations, novel objects, or interruptions is still an open question. The safety protocols required for a powerful humanoid robot that learns autonomously are incredibly complex. The risk of the robot misinterpreting a video or attempting an action that is unsafe for itself or its environment is very real. The research teams stated that ALMA operates within a ""safety envelope"" defined by the language model, which constantly assesses the planned actions against a set of core safety rules. However, the robustness of these AI-based safety systems in the real world has yet to be proven. The societal and economic disruption of such technology, particularly its impact on labor, will also become a central topic of debate.

The debut of ALMA marks the beginning of a new era for robotics. The long-held dream of a general-purpose robot that can assist humans with everyday tasks has moved from the realm of science fiction to a tangible engineering reality.

1mv80k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mv80k7/is_my_intuition_correct_on_this_one/,Is my intuition correct on this one?,"**CONTEXT.** In middle school I (27, M nowadays) had a crush (27, F nowadays) which friendzoned me. On a Feb 14 I asked her to be my GF and she told me yes but after a week she said to better keep it as friends. I was obssesed about her and she was the first person that made me experience romantic love in my life. She seemed to enjoy the validation I gave her and also admitted that I was physically cute but never allowed me to be more than friends.

Middle school finished, then came high school and college and by this time I obviously moved on as soon I wasnt seeing her daily and it was just a sweet memory. Then on the pandemic, out of the blue she added me to her IG close friends. So from 2020 to this year here and there (not that often) I would reply to her stories. Sometimes she answered me very cold, sometimes not that cold but kept it a very short convo and sometimes left on read. We mutually have always liked out IG posts.

About 4 weeks ago  I replied to one of her stories and she followed the conversation pretty smoothly and this time it was different. We were talking long about the past and how do we are nowadyas. She asked me how much I have changed physically and told her that she should see it in person, which she agreed. I told her we should get drinks next saturday and she enthusiastically accepted.

**FIRST DATE.** I decded time and place on where we should meet and when I saw her I felt like I traveled back in time to when I was 14 years old. She looked stunning as always and obvioulsy seemd at first a little nervous given that reconnection. We had good time in the first place for about 2 hours, strong eye contact, she didnt used her phone until I did, didnt go to the bathroom until I did, she was pretty present in the convo. I suggested to move other place which was withing walking reach. We were walking pretty slowly and talking to the 2nd place. In the 2nd place the dynamic was pretty similar except that I was drinking way faster than she and I was starting to get drunk lol.

Overall it was a good night given that we had a long talk catching up, only thing that I think I messed up was that only physical contact was when we met and when we said goodbye  we had a hug. Other thing I didnt like was that most of the talk was focused around her and she didnt ask me that much questions. Obviously on dates I let the woman talk for an inital period but after some time they usually want me to talk.

**BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND DATE**

We talked thorugh Insta and I tried to push a bit in my romantic intentions as I started light teasing, light flirting and subtle compliments. She responded pretty well on the teasing playing the game too but on compliments she avoided them or minimized them. We set up the date for sunday to drink her favorite latte.

**SECOND DATE**

This time I offered to pick her at her home which she agreed. I went to her house, picked her up and went to the coffee to go drink her favorite latte on Sunday afternoon. We drank it and since it was pretty fast and wanted to spend a bit more time with her I suggested to go to a brewery (which she already told me she didnt like that much) because it was the first place that cacme to my mind. We went there, we both ordered a beer but she only gave her beer 2 or 3 zips and gave it to me. We talked a ton as I was drinking both beers (drinking slowly) and the dynamic was something similar (most of the talking was about her). At some points I started to share something similar that I lived regarding to what she was talking, then she made 2-3 questions and returned to her flow and that was most of that interaction. Here on the physical side I tried to escalate a bit. I grabed her hand to check her nails, to check her bracelet, I compared our hand sizes I also touched her hair while we were talking about it. When we got into the car to go to her house she put her belt right away. On the way to her house she was talking a lot and seemed comfortable. When we arrived at her house she was saying goodbye pretty abrupltly and I stopped her by giving her a light touch on her leg and a regular goodbye cheek kiss.

**BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD DATE**

I replied to one of her IG CF stories on monday and carried convo to tuesday in which it died. On wednesday night I told her that we should go for dinner on Saturday night and she replied Thursday midday accepting. I initiated less convos thorugh IG this week so therefore we didnt talk much.

**THIRD DATE**

I pick her up at her house on saturday night and we went to a sushi place for dinner (I already told her that I dont like sushi but I do like teriyaki or salmon). The diner had the same dynamic (mostly talking around her, minimizing or avoiding even subtle compliemnts). After we got in the car I suggested we should go for drinks and we went to a nice speakeasy. We were seating in the bar and the dynamic was pretty similar except this time I was caressing her leg while we were talking and this time she asked me a little bit more questions. I took her back to her house and again she was saying goodbye too quick. I was feeling terrible that I didnt went for the kiss but my intuiton did felt that it would be pretty akward given she wasnt asking about me nor looking to know about me.

**KEY CONSIDERATIONS**

* Im 5'9, athletic build and baby faced. She is 5'3 she does look 27, pretty feminine and dressed elegant and fancy.
* I proposed all dates and payed for everything (Always I do pay everything when dating girls).
* On 1st date she told me all of her friends were on their own thing (all dating).
* After 1st she talked about her closest friends with their names as if I already knew them (She referred to them the ones that appear on my photos).
* She talked a ton of her work dynamics and it seemed her default conversation topic.
* She though remebered tiny details of things that I told her via IG or in person.
* When we were saying goodbye on 1st date, I told her to notify me when she arrives her house. Didnt do it but first thing in the morning she apologized. When we were saying goodbye she told me to notify her when I arrive at my house because ""given that you say you are drunk"", which I dindt notify her.
* After 3rd date I havent texted her and I dont think she will text me.

**CONCLUSION**

My conclusion is that this girl got into an IG convo because she was bored and had a little curiosity on me and then maybe she didnt like what she saw or she just simply wanted validation and be entertained and feel chased.

To me it was pretty painful noticing that she is not that interesed but at least I tried. I was thinking that maybe after all these years we could connect romantically which it seems is not going to happen.

My question to this sub reddit is: I know that some girls want to leave the initiative to the guy (which I dont mind at all as guy) but with the context that I have given to you does this sound like this girl want to keep going out and me having initiative or she is not interested at me at all? Answer might be obvious but my feelings at the moment obstruct my rational thinking.",1,1755674471.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1mv7yix,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mv7yix/im_falling_for_my_female_best_friend/,I’m falling for my female best friend,"tldr; I’ve been spending more 1-on-1 time with my long-time best female friend and I caught feelings for her. 

So me (25M) and my female best friend (25F) have been friends for 9 years since college.

We have not been best friends since the start but we were part of the same close friends group (I was closest with a male friend in the group who’s closer to every friends in the group compared to me). But over time, due to group hangouts, travels, etc. we have gotten closer and I now consider her to be my best female friend.

A few months back, I quit my job to take a break before I study abroad for a year this September. Since I became the most available friend in the friend group, she’s been inviting me to hang out more (dinners, going to movies 1-on-1, going to concerts as a group). There has not been clear signs of romantic interest as I view her invitation as a friendly one because her best female friend has been very busy.

We live close by (5 minutes drive), so there have been many opportunities for us to hang out, and I often pick her up and drop her off most times we meet. And recently, I realized I have caught feelings for her. I feel like our lifestyles are compatible, we like similar food, we enjoy listening to music and going to concerts, and we enjoy our time together.

Next week, she’s inviting me to go to a Planetarium with her to do some indoor stargazing. Her favorite song artists have these themes relating to sky and stars so she’s been wanting to go.

In our recent meetings, we have been hanging around closer to one another (walking and sitting with shoulders touching). This might be just me unconsciously moving closer as I realized my affection towards her, but she doesn’t seem to mind it either.

I’m very conflicted as to whether I should tell her my feelings. I’ve honestly lowkey liked her since college but there was no sign of possibility so I dropped it off, but this time I’ve fallen even deeper.

——
Moments that have made my feelings stronger are such as:
1. Her staying with me as the last person to drop off in the friend group after concert night since she knows that one of the friends I’m supposed to drop off live in a village that has scary vibe at night. I didn’t know until I dropped that friend off but she told me she knew I would have been anxious driving out of the village alone.
2. Spending more and more time with her and starting to have very small physical touch (shoulders rub)
3. Going to lunch with her near her office and asking her why she dresses so proper when her managers are not in office today, then she telling me that I dressed up because I’m eating with you today. She also brought her work laptop to sit with me in a coffee shop under her office, despite a bunch of her close female friends in office today which she could have hangout and sit/work with.
4. Being able to be ourselves and not be awkward despite spending so much time together so often makes me feel like this could be the type of relationship I yearn for. A calm and slow-paced quality time together.
5. Every time I meet a new girl I always subconsciously compare them with my female best friend. I feel like she’s set a standard for what kind of person I want in a relationship that it’s hard to develop meaningful relationships with other potential female connections.

1mv7tzp,https://i.redd.it/nznaagrlj4kf1.jpeg,Survival tips to survive in an IIM,"When you finally walk through those IIM gates, the excitement is real… but so is the chaos. 
Everyone tells you about the glory of “making it” - not enough people tell you how to survive it.

Here’s what no one tells you until you’re in the thick of it:

1) Your Google Calendar will be your oxygen.
Classes at 8:30 AM, a surprise quiz at 10, group meeting at 2, case comp deadline at 6, cultural event practice at 9… and somewhere in between, you’ll need to eat, sleep, and exist. Time-block everything. Even naps.

2) Submissions will hunt you in your dreams.
And sometimes, you’ll finish them just minutes before the portal closes. Learn the art of starting early - “last minute” works once or twice, but burnout comes fast.

3) Your batchmates are your biggest allies.
That “random” group you’re assigned to? They might become your 3 AM chai partners, your presentation saviours, and your sanity keepers. Invest in people - it’s the best ROI you’ll get.

4) Impostor syndrome is normal - don’t let it eat you.
You’ll sit next to people who’ve worked at global firms, won national competitions, or coded apps for fun. Remind yourself: you earned your seat too.

5) Health is not optional.
Skipping meals, living on coffee, ignoring exercise - it feels manageable until it’s not. Energy is your real currency here. Protect it.

6)Learn to say NO.
Clubs, committees, hackathons, networking meets - you can’t do it all. Pick what aligns with your goals and let go of the rest without guilt.

By the end of your IIM journey, you’ll realize it’s less about grades and more about grit. You’ll leave with sharper skills, lifelong friends, and stories that’ll make you smile years later.

So yes - crack CAT. But more importantly, get ready to thrive once you’re in. Because inside an IIM, survival isn’t just about getting through the day… it’s about becoming someone stronger than you imagined. 
It's too much but believe me once you are inside you will genuinely go through these phases. 

P. S - you can definitely appreciate the beauty of campus ! It's really hard to ignore .. ",13,1755673805.0,CATiim,2,1.0,False

*The* ***spherical cow*** *is a* [*humorous*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour) [*metaphor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) *for highly* [*simplified*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization_(philosophy_of_science)) [*scientific models*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model) *of complex phenomena.*[*^(\[1\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow#cite_note-nasa-1)[*^(\[2\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow#cite_note-2)[*^(\[3\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow#cite_note-3)[*^(\[4\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow#cite_note-4) *Originating in* [*theoretical physics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics)*, the metaphor refers to some scientific tendencies to develop* [*toy models*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_model) *that reduce a problem to the simplest form imaginable, making calculations more feasible, even if the simplification hinders the model's application to reality.*

Now I'm wondering if most of the psychological concepts, are in fact some sort of toy models or rough, simplified abstractions of much more messier and more complex underlying reality?

Perhaps for a professional psychologist with a lot of real life experience in psychology, they might be helpful as some sort of crutch, helping them understand how people's minds work, and what makes them tick. But I guess even for professionals, reliance on too much of psychological concepts and abstractions could be more hindrance than help.

But ordinary people, who are not educated in psychology, and who don't have experience working with people in therapy, etc, I am afraid the knowledge of psychological concepts and ideas could actually diminish their understanding of other people.

Without knowing any psychological concepts, in understanding other people we rely on the following:

\- theory of mind (which is kind of a natural thing, and lack of theory of mind could suggest autism)

\- empathy

\- common sense

\- comparison with our own experiences

When unburdened by abstract psychological concepts and ideas, these skills can sharpen over time, and become very accurate. This was the case in some world famous novelists who were able to have nearly perfect understanding of the ""human soul"" without any studying or knowledge of psychology.

But once we start adding more and more psychological concepts into our mental toolbox, they could become a burden at certain point. Instead of seeing things clearly as they are, we see them through the prism of those concepts, which are too often, rough abstractions, almost like spherical cows.

Here are some examples of failures that could be caused by knowing too much psychology, but not deeply enough to be an actual expert:

1. For some reason a student gets just four hours of sleep one night. Instead of making themselves a strong coffee and somehow battling through it (where studying results won't be ideal, but they could still be adequate), they start worrying about ""sleep deprivation"", and how this will affect their memory consolidation process and how studying will be ineffective, so they decide to skip studying on that day altogether.

2. An undisciplined teenager gets harshly criticized by their parents for their low grades and messy room. Instead of acknowledging their errors and trying to make more effort to correct it, they start thinking about how their poor discipline is due to trauma of being raised by narcissistic, authoritarian parents, who use a lot of verbal abuse in order to control them. Now instead of studying and cleaning their room, they keep thinking about being ""psychologically abused"", and they might even post about it on ""r/raisedbynarcissists""

3. Someone learns about big five personality traits. Now for the next couple of months, instead of seeing people as they are, in their full complexity, and all ""shades of gray"", with all their quirks, that taken together add to their personality, they start seeing everyone through the prism of big five, and they get this hobby of estimating the level of big five traits for each person they know. They end up understanding them worse then they did before they started the whole process. (Because at the beginning they looked at them as real people, with their backgrounds, home situation, aspirations, values, motivations, etc, that can all contribute to their behaviors... now they look at them as mindless carriers of 5 traits that deterministically influence their behavior)

4. Abusing Freudian ideas, attachment styles, etc... is so common that it's not even worth mentioning anymore.

Those are just some examples... but I think there can be found many many more of them.",2,1755673701.0,PsychologyTalk,0,1.0,False

1mv7s1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1mv7s1n/cucked_by_a_bartender/,Cucked by a bartender,"Okay so I need some advice or maybe just to vent. 

I hooked up with my friend (late 30s, bartender/musician, professional slut) after months of tension. The makeout was so intense he actually pulled back and said maybe we shouldn’t have sex, because kissing me felt “too real”, like it meant something, unlike all the strangers he normally fucks. It was funny and kind of beautiful in a pathetic way. Of course, we ended up having sex anyway, and it was good. The next morning we got coffee and laughed about it, like we’d finally filed the paperwork and could just be friends.

For context: I don’t want to be with him. I’m looking for a life partner, and he’s a bartender who wants to rack up bodies until he dies. We’ve always been honest about that - me wanting something stable, him wanting chaos - and that clarity is why our friendship worked. We could talk about politics, music, books, romance, without any pretense.

Fast forward: I see him working at the bar, and there’s a girl draped over him, clearly trying to fuck. Normally, fine. But this girl was so profoundly stupid it was unbearable. Watching him entertain her felt like watching someone groom a child. And then I had to actually sit there and talk to her, when all I wanted was to hang out with my friend.

I left pissed and later texted him some dramatic line about being a bad friend for making me wingman. I’m sure he interpreted it as jealousy, which is what really annoys me. Because I don’t want to date him. I just want the friendship - the banter, the fun, and the occasional make out.

So how do I keep this dynamic without him projecting some narrative of jealousy or secret longing onto me, when in reality I’m just allergic to retards? For real, I just want things to be normal between us how they used to be before we fucked but also now fucking sometimes without him thinking it’s this whole thing, and he can definitely still pick up girls in front of me as long as I’m not forced to talk to them when their invalids. Why can’t two hot people who want completely different things have fun and hangout and have sex while they sort out their shit.

She apologizes, but she repeats the same behavior again and again.

She gets angry over very small things, sometimes acting like the world is ending. There are times I can’t even leave the house because she doesn’t want me to see other girls, even though I have no interest. She blocks me over minor things, calls me malicious names, makes fun of me and my family, screams at me to do things, and says very, very rude and mean things constantly.

She says and does things I know she isn’t comfortable with. When I tell her not to do something, she says, “YOU DON’T CONTROL ME,” even though I know her well. Sometimes she talks about posting pictures online just to annoy me and then makes it seem like I’m being manipulative. She frequently says, “If you do this, it’s over,” even for the smallest things, like going into town to get food if another girl might see me.

She has insulted my family repeatedly. She once said that every time I look in the mirror, I probably look like my dad and nothing like my mum. My dad was abusive, tried to kill my mum, and hurt my brother. She went through every post of my dead brother and made fun of him. During my brother’s funeral, she wasn’t there and once asked me to destroy my brother’s watch, which I faked breaking. She sometimes jokes about my dead brother being in hell.

She has threatened me. She once said she would kill me, wait until I was about to sleep, and stab me. She made me get on my knees and say sorry while she recorded videos. She made me drink toilet water and throw away my food. She sometimes makes me think her mum hates me by messaging me from her phone. She made me think she killed herself by sending a picture of a knife and then blocking me when I was in the hospital nearly having a heart attack.

She blames me for the pain she feels and brings up every little thing I’ve done, constantly comparing it to her own experiences. She never lets me bring up the things she has done, except a few times with proper context. She insults me and my family repeatedly, screams at me frequently, and makes me feel controlled in every part of my life.

She stops me from working because she doesn’t want me to work or see other girls. I had to take a loan to pay rent, and she asks for money back that she sent me, even though I have spent double what she sent on things like coffee.

I’ve never shouted at her or called her names. I know when something is going to happen because I know her very well. My memory has gotten worse, and I feel scared to do things.

I set no mop zones over the rugs and used the medium water level on hard floors. It cleared the kitchen grease as expected, and it also lifted a couple of older coffee spots in the living room that my manual mop never quite removed. What stood out to me was the water control. There were no puddles, fewer streaks, and the floor dried in minutes compared with my previous unit.

I feel terrible. I hate this video game. Actually, I almost never enjoy any video game anymore. Its just not fun anymore. But I still keep on installing and uninstalling games. Again, and again. For years.  
  
Now this is it. I am literally crying of sadness, just after one freaking game of this terrible toxic video game. I have to work in like, 30 minutes, and I m not in the right state for it.  
Its kind of my dream job. I worked hard to get it. And I feel like I m about to ruin it just because I can't manage to quit these terrible games. I m so scared that this could happen. I need to react.  
I struggle with mental illness conditions. Its hard to live with it, but I learnt a lot and I can have a decent life now, even with mental illness. And these games are ruining it all.  
  
I just uninstalled all of my games again. I also uninstalled the launchers, this time. I just hope that I won't ever install anything like this again. I hate it. It s the only addiction I could not beat. I stopped cannabis, I stopped tobacco, I stopped drinking. I can stop coffee for a few weeks without any problem. But I can't manage to stay away from video games for 24 freaking hours. It s crazy... I m venting, sorry.

I’m a Korean student studying in Malaysia now. Back in Korea, café hopping is like… almost a sport 😂 We go from one café to another just for different vibes, pretty drinks, and desserts.

Since coming to Malaysia, I’ve been exploring some cafés here and wah… the feeling is really different!

In Korea, many cafés focus on concept — super Instagrammable interiors, seasonal menus, and themed decorations.

Here in KL, I notice more coffee-focused places and cozy community vibes.

I’ve been to some popular spots at Petaling Street, but I want to find those hidden gems that locals love.

So… Malaysian friends, please tell me:

Where are your must-visit cafés in KL or Malaysia?Any places with unique menus, aesthetic vibes, or nice spots to chill/study?

Terima kasih in advance! Can’t wait to explore more this weekend 💛

Bringing him coffee in the morning before he asks. Saying thank you more often. Leaving my phone in another room during dinner. Checking in on how he’s really feeling instead of assuming I know.

None of it felt big in the moment — but over time, it created this undercurrent of safety and appreciation that started to rebuild trust and connection.

I’d already burned through all the obvious free food hacks—Costco samples, hotel lobbies, church potlucks. Then I had the dumbest idea that somehow… worked.

Every morning, I’d just… walk into random houses around my neighborhood. Not breaking in or anything—just slipping in when a door was ajar, or when a garage was open, or I’d follow a dad grabbing the paper and just nod like I belonged. The trick was confidence.

I’d head straight to the kitchen, mumble a casual “morning,” and sit down like I’d been living there my whole life. Pancakes? Eggs? Toast? Whatever was on the table, I was eating it. Nobody ever questioned me. Families just assumed I was, like, a cousin, a visiting exchange student, or maybe their kid’s weird new friend who crashed the night.

I got so good at blending in I even developed “roles.” In one house, I was “quiet guy who drinks black coffee.” In another, I was “the cousin who doesn’t talk much but always grabs extra toast.” I once buttered six biscuits in silence while an entire family argued about carpool schedules, and not a single person looked twice at me.

Best part? People actually offered me stuff to take “for later.” A juice box, a granola bar, a leftover cinnamon roll. It was like meal-prep without the prep.

For about a month, breakfast was covered. Every time I smell maple syrup now, my brain immediately goes back to nervously buttering toast while pretending to be “Uncle Jeff’s nephew from Ohio.”

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

6pm dinner. Variable here. But usually 200 grams of some kind of meat with vegetables. Approx 30 grams protein.

So I recently shifted to a new apartment and things haven't been going well lately. I used to stay at a hostel (been almost 1.5 years), and the food (terrible and unhygienic), the space, the area, the distance to travel to my office, everything started to take a toll on me. 

My friends ditched me after they asked me to move in with them into a new apartment, twice.

So I finally moved into a new flat by myself. A colleague of mine told me that moving in to a new house in this month can be inauspicious, and since then I haven't been able to get that thought out of my head, especially after I recently lost someone very very close to me in my family just the day after I moved in.

Now coming to what a crappy start to the morning I had. 

I wanted to just work from home and thought I would make a nice breakfast for myself, some avacado toast and coffee but both the avacadoes were bad. So I told myself ""ok leave that"". Let me try picking up a new hobby because all I do lately is work, work and work. So went on to call a sports academy to enroll myself for badminton classes. None of them picked up. 

I then thought let me call to get a gas cylinder connection since we have been only using induction so far and I am unable to adjust to it. None of those guys are picking up (called about 3-4 different people).

Finally decided to get my warranty registered for the mattress I ordered recently. The website is absolute crap and not taking in any of my details. 

I feel terrible now especially after you know you want to make the most out of your day but things just...don't align.

Am I overreacting to all of this? I know these are small things and trust me I'm very very greatful for everything that I have. But it's just one of those days I guess and I wanted to get this off my chest.

basically, you do something you *actually* like, then the boring task, then another small dopamine hit right after. like a sad little productivity oreo.

mine was:

* good coffee (the real kind, not sad office drip)
* expense reports (hell)
* sending my friend a dumb meme about capybaras

the task still sucked. but i actually *did* it. and then i wasn’t stuck in that “i know i need to do this but i physically can’t make myself start” loop all day, which was honestly the win.

i’ve started keeping a list on my phone of tiny things that give me that dopamine hit funny tiktok, texting someone something stupid, looking at pictures of golden retrievers, blasting one song and pretending i’m in a movie, whatever. my brain needs that. logic doesn’t move me. dopamine does.

anyway. not a miracle. but it helped. figured i’d post in case anyone else is drowning in mid-week brain fog and needs a dumb little trick to get started.

Later in the day when there was more dine in customers I was expected to fill coffees and take orders basically immediately. Obviously it’s easy to take drink orders and run food out but I don’t know the menu very well yet for when people order. They will ask for something and I don’t know all the right things to clarify, like biscuits and gravy could be a small or large order, anything with bread needs to be asked white or wheat. And I don’t know little things that we do or don’t have. I’m obviously figuring it out by making the mistake and having to go back and ask the customers or going and asking a customers question to another server. But it just makes me look so dumb and I wish I had more help to learn this stuff before. I secretly cried 4 times my first shift because I just felt so confused. Is this normal? I’ve never been a server before and I just feel like I needed more help before making a fool of myself.

Not a vibe. So I started digging into purifiers that *actually work* without costing a kidney. 

That’s when I found the **Qubo Smart Air Purifier Q500...**a Hero Group product (yes, the same folks who make bikes, now making your air cleaner). On paper, it looks like a hidden gem: bigger coverage, smart control, long filter life.

👉 **Too lazy to read the whole thing? Here’s the link:** [**Qubo Q500 Smart Air Purifier on Amazon**](https://www.amazon.in/Qubo-Purifier-Pollutants-Allergens-Filtration/dp/B0CMH9TSVC?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# Product Details (No Jargon Zone)

* **Model:** Qubo Smart Air Purifier Q500
* **Coverage:** Up to **500 sq.ft.** (bedroom, living room, or even a compact hall)
* **Filtration System:** 3 stages
   * **H13 HEPA filter** → captures 99.99% allergens, dust, pollen
   * **Activated Carbon layer** → removes odors, smoke, VOCs
   * **High-efficiency pre-filter** → traps big particles like hair and lint
* **Filter Life:** Up to **9000 hours** (\~1 year, depending on usage)
* **Control:** App + Voice (works with Alexa & Google Assistant)
* **Motor:** Ultra-quiet BLDC (energy-saving & durable)

# Why It Stands Out

* **Smart Control = Less Fuss.** Being able to control it from your phone or just yell “Hey Google, turn on the purifier” is actually convenient. No hunting for buttons.
* **Bigger Coverage.** 500 sq.ft. means it can handle more than just a small bedroom—perfect for 2BHK living rooms.
* **Long Filter Life.** 9000 hours = less worrying about replacements every few months.
* **Energy Efficient.** The BLDC motor isn’t just quiet, it also sips power instead of gulping.
* **Decent Price for Features.** Considering it has app + voice control, the pricing feels reasonable compared to flashy brands.

#  Where It Falls Short

* **App Setup Can Be Glitchy.** A few users mentioned initial hiccups with Wi-Fi connection. Once set, it works fine.
* **Design Is Plain.** Minimalist white box vibe—it won’t win design awards.
* **Filter Cost Not Widely Known.** While it lasts long, replacement pricing info isn’t as transparent as Honeywell’s.
* **No Air Quality Indicator Light.** Would’ve been nice to see pollution levels at a glance.

# Who Should Get It?

* Families with bigger bedrooms or small living rooms (500 sq.ft. coverage = decent size)
* Tech-friendly folks who love app + voice control integration
* People who want **low-maintenance, long filter life** without frequent replacements
* Anyone who wants “premium-ish features” without Dyson-level pricing

**Bottom line: The Qubo Q500 is one of those underrated smart purifiers that checks most boxes...good coverage, HEPA H13 filtration, app/voice control, and long filter life. If you’re okay with the basic design and can manage the app setup, it’s a solid buy for modern homes.**

1mv72hn,https://i.redd.it/kgkymlg5b4kf1.jpeg,Stain-Resistant Fabrics: Why They’re Basically a Superpower for Your Sofa,"Let’s be honest: no matter how careful you *think* you are, life has a way of decorating your sofa with “memories” you didn’t ask for. A rogue coffee drip on a sleepy Monday. Your kid’s snack crumbs forming an archaeological layer in the cushions. The dog who joyfully trots in from the yard, convinced the couch is their throne.

It’s the circle of home life — and for a lot of us, it’s the reason our living room furniture starts looking… tired.

But here’s the thing: it doesn’t have to be that way.

This is where **stain-resistant fabrics** come in. They’re not just a fancy add-on — they’re the kind of game-changer that lets you enjoy your home instead of stressing about it. And if you’ve never looked into them before, this might be the sign you needed.

# 🛡 What Makes Stain-Resistant Fabrics Special?

When people hear “stain-resistant,” they sometimes think it’s marketing fluff. It’s not. These fabrics are made to actively *fight back* against the spills, smudges, and everyday messes that usually mean hours of cleaning or permanent marks.

The science is in the way they’re woven or treated. Some have special coatings that make liquids bead up on the surface. Others use fibers that naturally repel moisture and oils. Either way, the result is the same — instead of soaking in instantly, that coffee spill just sits there, giving you time to grab a cloth and wipe it away.

If you’ve got a family, roommates, or pets, you can already see the appeal. Imagine your sofa surviving years of movie nights, snack fests, and pet naps without looking like it’s been through a war.

One real-world example I’ve seen is a **vegan leather sectional** (Mid in Mod’s *Delano Cognac Vegan Leather* is one) — it looks sleek, it’s comfortable, and because vegan leather is naturally stain-resistant, it’s super low-maintenance.

# 🎨 You Can Have Style and Easy Cleaning

There’s a myth that furniture built for real life can’t also be beautiful. That you either get something stylish but fragile, or something durable but boring. Not anymore.

These days, stain-resistant fabrics come in the same luxurious textures, colors, and styles you’d see in high-end design. The only difference is, they stay looking *new* for way longer.

Take **boucle fabric** for example — it’s soft, textured, and perfect for that cozy-yet-elevated look. Normally, light-colored boucle would be a nightmare to keep clean, but a treated version (like Mid in Mod’s *Chesterton Cream Boucle Sectional*) holds onto its airy, light vibe without you panicking every time someone sits down with a latte.

# ☀️ The Sneaky Furniture Killer: Sunlight

Stains aren’t the only thing that can wreck your furniture’s look. Sunlight can fade colors over time, especially in bright, open rooms. That’s why fade-resistant fabrics are also worth paying attention to.

Think about a bold orange recliner in a sunny corner — gorgeous, but normally doomed to fade into a sad, washed-out shade. If it’s made with fade-resistant materials (like the *Ashland Recliner Chair in Orange Suede*), that vibrant pop of color sticks around, even after years of sunny afternoons.

# 🏡 Don’t Forget About Rugs

Your rug might take even more abuse than your sofa — constant foot traffic, snack spills, the occasional coffee disaster. That’s why I think **washable, stain-resistant rugs** are basically essential now.

One I like is the *Layla Gray Gold 5x8 Washable Rug* — it’s stylish enough to pull a whole room together, but you can literally throw it in the washing machine when life inevitably happens.

🧼 How to Keep Stain-Resistant Fabrics Looking Good

Even though these fabrics fight off a lot of mess, they’re not invincible. A little care goes a long way toward keeping them fresh. Here’s the quick, no-fuss approach:

* **Move fast.** The sooner you deal with a spill, the easier it is to remove.  
* **Blot, don’t scrub.** Press a cloth into the spill instead of rubbing — scrubbing can push the stain deeper.  
* **Mild soap is your friend.** A couple drops of dish soap in lukewarm water usually works wonders.  
* **Air dry.** Skip heat dryers — let it dry naturally.  
* **Test cleaners.** If you try a specialized cleaner, test it on a hidden spot first.  

For vegan leather or leather, a quick wipe with a damp cloth and then a dry one is usually enough. For suede or microfiber, a fabric brush keeps things clean without messing up the texture.

# 💡 Why I Keep Coming Back to Mid in Mod

There are plenty of brands offering stain-resistant furniture now, but Mid in Mod’s approach hits a sweet spot for me:

* **Design that doesn’t age.** Mid-century modern lines, warm wood accents, and proportions that work in most spaces.  
* **Materials that last.** They don’t just resist stains — they also age well without looking worn out.  
* **Versatility.** Whether your home is minimalist, eclectic, or somewhere in between, their stuff blends in beautifully.  

# 🎯 Less Stress, More Living

Here’s the reality: spills, crumbs, and sunlight are part of life. But they don’t have to be the reason you replace your sofa every few years. Stain-resistant fabrics let you enjoy your home *without* treating it like a fragile museum.

Whether it’s a sleek vegan leather sectional, a fade-proof recliner, or a washable rug that can handle the chaos of daily life, you don’t have to choose between style and durability anymore.

So if you’ve been holding off on buying a light-colored sofa because you’re worried about stains… maybe it’s time to rethink that.

And hey, if you’re curious, check out Mid in Mod’s collection — not as a sales pitch, but because some of their designs genuinely change the way you think about “practical” furniture.

adhd mid-week slump is real. it’s like i used up all my focus on monday and now i’m just... here. existing. watching dust collect on my to-do list.

today i tried this thing i saw on soothfy (buried in one of their micro routines). i almost didn’t even bother because it sounded kinda dumb something called a “dopamine sandwich” but weirdly, it worked???

basically, you do something you *actually* like, then the boring task, then another small dopamine hit right after. like a sad little productivity oreo.

mine was:

* good coffee (the real kind, not sad office drip)
* expense reports (hell)
* sending my friend a dumb meme about capybaras

the task still sucked. but i actually *did* it. and then i wasn’t stuck in that “i know i need to do this but i physically can’t make myself start” loop all day, which was honestly the win.

i’ve started keeping a list on my phone of tiny things that give me that dopamine hit funny tiktok, texting someone something stupid, looking at pictures of golden retrievers, blasting one song and pretending i’m in a movie, whatever. my brain needs that. logic doesn’t move me. dopamine does.

anyway. not a miracle. but it helped. figured i’d post in case anyone else is drowning in mid-week brain fog and needs a dumb little trick to get started.

I used to be part of a book club here in Secunderabad, but it kind of fizzled out because members became irregular. I really miss that space, so I’d love to start my own book club again, with a twist.

Back in my old club, I used to take initiatives to invite foreign authors for online sessions with us, and it was so much fun. I’d love to bring that vibe back: a cozy, regular book club that also occasionally connects with authors, writers, or other book lovers from around the world.

Here’s what I’m imagining:
	•	We meet once a month (in person, somewhere central in Secunderabad/Hyderabad).
	•	Group size: small but committed (6–10 people would be perfect).
	•	We pick books together (mix of fiction, non-fiction, classics, and contemporary).
	•	Optional: themed snacks/coffee to keep it fun.
	•	Bonus: occasional online sessions with authors, like I’ve done before.

## What is Mirexa Platform?

Mirexa is an **automated trading platform** designed to help both beginners and seasoned traders participate in the financial markets. Think of it as your personal digital assistant for trading — it analyzes market data, identifies potential opportunities, and even places trades if you choose to automate the process.

It supports multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and **commodities**. That means you’re not just tied to Bitcoin or Ethereum — you can diversify your trades with gold, oil, or even Tesla stock.

The idea behind Mirexa is to reduce the complexity of trading. You don’t need to be glued to charts all day or have a degree in finance. Thanks to its user-centric design and smart algorithms, trading feels a lot more manageable — even kinda fun.

## Who Created Mirexa Platform?

As with many newer platforms in the automated trading space, **specific details about the founders** of Mirexa are not widely available. That might sound sketchy at first glance, but it's actually pretty common among platforms that use white-label trading systems (i.e., platforms that build on top of existing infrastructures like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge).

From what I’ve gathered, Mirexa seems to be built by a group of **financial technology experts and traders** who have likely worked on similar platforms. The tech stack and user interface are very similar to a few other reputable systems, which tells me these folks knew what they were doing.

That said, I’d love to see more transparency in the future — maybe a LinkedIn profile or two wouldn’t hurt.

Based on my experience and research, **Mirexa doesn’t show red flags** that are typical of scams. The platform works, withdrawals are processed (within a few days), and customer support responds.

However, like any trading platform, **you can lose money** if you’re not careful. Trading is risky by nature, so don’t treat it like a get-rich-quick scheme. Also, always start with the demo account to get a feel for how everything works.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Nationals: A Tale of Two Slides (One’s a Waterpark, the Other’s a Hamster Wheel)**

The New York Mets (66-58) and Washington Nationals (50-74) collide in a clash of NL East fates, where the Mets aim to end a six-game road losing streak while the Nationals hope to avoid becoming the first team since the 2012 Tampa Bay Rays to lose 80 games and host a *Jeopardy* clue about their existence. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a concession stand juggling hot dogs and existential dread.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Mets Are the Favorite (and the Nationals Are Just Here for the Snacks)

The betting markets are as clear as a postgame press conference with Max Scherzer: the Mets are heavy favorites. Decimal odds of **1.54-1.6** (implied probability: **62-64%**) suggest bookmakers view this as a “formality with a side of optimism for the underdogs.” The Nationals, priced at **2.42-2.67** (implied **38-41%**), are about as likely to win as a person convincing a group chat that 2005 was the ’90s.

The spread (-1.5 for the Mets) reflects the Mets’ superior pitching and batting, while the total runs line (8.5-9) hints at a game where “low-scoring” means *fewer* than the Nationals’ ERA allows. For context, Washington’s 5.34 ERA is so porous, it’s basically a sieve that also tweets existential complaints.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rivalries, and the Curse of the “Almost Good”

The Mets enter with **David Peterson (3.30 ERA)** on the mound, a pitcher who’s as reliable as a coffee shop barista on a Monday. Opposing him is **Jake Irvin (5.14 ERA)**, whose ERA is so high, it’s practically a ZIP code for “where did this game go wrong?” Peterson’s 3.30 ERA is a tidy number, like a well-folded laundry pile. Irvin’s 5.14? That’s a stack of unfolded socks: chaotic, avoidable, and slightly concerning.

On the offensive side, the Mets’ **Pete Alonso (.268 BA, 28 HRs)** is a human missile launcher, while the Nationals’ **C.J. Abrams (.270 BA, 16 HRs)** is a leadoff man with the power of a “maybe” and the speed of a “definitely not.” The Mets also boast **Juan Soto** (baseball’s version of a golden retriever—unstoppable, lovable, and occasionally napping in the wrong spot) and \*\*Francisco Lin
