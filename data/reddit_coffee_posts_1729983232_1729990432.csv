1gczfn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1gczfn1/my_observations_as_an_american_who_just_spent/,My Observations as an American who just spent most of the past two weeks in Scotland.  ,"Here are my observations and thoughts on the United Kingdom 



Folks speak perfect English here, but the farther north you travel the faster they speak,  consonants may be lost.   There may be a repository of lost consonants on Isle of Skye.   Apparently the southern portion of America has a lost consonant locker,  probably near Fort Knox Kentucky as it’s under consonant security.  



No matter,  they are friendly and helpful.   Looking lost at a bus stop?  No worries someone will kindly get you back on track or suggest a great pub to pop into later for a pint.  



There is a national pride,  the streets are clean and safe.   Since gun ownership isn’t a national pastime people have a general feeling of safety.    The perception of many UK residents is that American is the wild-wild west.   A place where perception isn’t too far removed from reality. 



The UK really embraces the tap and go culture.   We never needed currency here.  Tap and go made every aspect of the trip easy from boarding city buses,  the London Tube, the Uber boat on the Thames, the train to Glasgow,  and various purchases at coffeehouses, pubs, and restaurants contactless and easy.    America could really get on board with this program.   I’m going to add it’s super nice when your card or your phone never leaves your sight.  Our Canadian friends to the north get this too especially at restaurants. 



There isn’t a huge tip culture here.   Sure some higher end restaurants add a 10% charge. For the most part service is included in the purchase.   So unlike using the self-checkout at the airport for an overpriced water bottle and having to choose the “no tip” option.   (Not an exaggeration!). Additionally, the price of things in the UK here seems much more reasonable than in the US.  Even at he airport where a standard sized bottle of water was only 1.30£,  about a dollar and seventy-five cents.  



It’s difficult to find fresh green salad or vegetables on most menus. A sign on a popular restaurant said indicated that a Glasgow salad was actually fish and chips.  The potato is ubiquitous and prepared in a myriad of ways.  Practically every dish comes with chips.   Oh,  and if I didn’t  mention it chips are fries and crisps are chips,  and biscuits are cookies,  Confused now?   There seems to be two sauces readily available at every meal: good old American style ketchup and HP sauce or brown sauce as it’s affectionately known.  Brown sauce is sweetened up version of our A-1 sauce.  Restaurants food portions, snack food portions,  are smaller and so are most of UK denizens.  



Chock the previous comment up to health and then recognize that the UK and much of Europe has a smoking problem.   As a former smoker it’s always sad to see a younger generation addicted. 



Much of scotch whisky I sampled is as velvety and smooth as the treeless landscapes of the northern highlands.   Some of the Islay scotch is a rich and peaty as its heritage,  while the Speyside and Highlands malts carry the richness and complexity of an Oregon Pinot Noir.   



 There is so much globalization in alcohol sales making it easy to enjoy  a Drambuie, the Isle of Skye’s  herbal scotch liquor which was a favorite nightcap of my Dad back in the day and readily available in rural Arkansas some 40 years ago.   There are many gin varieties that are not easily obtained in the states.   The problem here is similar to practically every place that we’ve ever traveled.    From time to time Robin enjoys a dry gin martini and I while I prefer the same with vodka.   The logic for both of these drinks is why would I order a premium spirit with all its complexity only to have it diluted by a substandard cheap vermouth.    So the quandary continues.    The exceptional bartender will immediately recognize my order for a “dry martini“  eliminates all the vermouth from the equation.   While other less attentive bar backs will hear the word martini and immediately infuse the drink with the cheap fortified wine.  

So,  if you’re a pro bartender and have suggestions,  I’m all ears.  



Almost without exception every restaurant or breakfast spot we stopped at played 80’s and early 90’s American music.    A few spots in London were,not surprisingly, still hung up on the Fab Four.     That said when American businesses play Hip-hop or rap,  I’m outta there!    But this is Europe and you don’t have to leave your table until you’re good and ready.    For a long time I’ve thought that dining should be an experience.   As an old man,  I eschew counter service.   I feel especially put upon the preset tip is 20%.   What service am I pre-tipping for?  I still have to find silverware and the drink station and then buss my space before I leave.    Here on the other side of the Atlantic once you’re seated,  there is no rush to turn your table over.   Want to sip that cappuccino for 2 hours and surf Facebook,  no problem.    



As I finish editing my observations from my couch at home with my favorite cup of coffee I’m still in awe that I woke up yesterday morning in London England and went to bed last night Albany Oregon.   While that entire process took more than 24 hours it was worth it and still amazing that we can move that freely and quickly around the globe. 



I’ll leave you with a quote from one of my favorite authors,  a quote which is perhaps more salient today than ever before: 



Mark Twain wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”

1gczdlq,https://i.redd.it/p6pw28rv47xd1.jpeg,How to fix filling consistency ,"This is by far my favorite cake recipe I’ve ever made. The King Arthur Chocolate Mousse Cake with Raspberries. My issue is when I make the filling. The directions say…

>To make the filling: In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter, cream cheese, 3/4 cup (85g) of the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt, mixing at medium-low speed until smooth.

>Melt the chocolate; a minute or less in the microwave should be sufficient to soften the chips enough that you can stir them until completely melted and smooth. Add the melted chocolate to the bowl and mix on medium-high speed for 1 minute, or until a bit lightened and fluffy.

>Whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar with the Instant ClearJel. Beat the heavy cream until soft peaks form, then add the confectioners’ sugar mixture. Beat just until the cream is stiff; guard against over-beating, which will turn the cream grainy.

>Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture; scrape the bowl, and stir to combine any sticky residue. Finally, fold in the chocolate mini chips, if you’re using them.

My issue is I have never managed to get it to ‘look’ nice. The filling always tastes delicious, but I have yet to figure out how to get the cream cheese to mix in smoothly. It looks horrible. Is there something I am messing up here? The only thing I do different from directions is I do not use the ClearJel. Is there suggestion I should try?

All week, before the anticipated event, Hana fretted over what gift she should get for his parents, especially one that would win the mother’s approval. Though Jeong-wook insisted it wasn’t necessary, she felt compelled to do it. She wanted the first meeting to go off without a hitch, and she believed that presenting a gift to her future in-laws would set the right tone and make a positive impression.

But what could she possibly give to a wealthy family? How could she win over people who already had everything? These questions burned in Hana’s mind, keeping her awake from midnight until morning as she tirelessly searched through online lists of gift ideas. Yet, nothing seemed to be good enough. The few rare items that caught her attention were simply unaffordable for her.

“Fruits!” her mother suggested on the eve of the event.

They were strolling through the open-air market passing by several vendors selling assorted fruits. Hana, on the brink of tears, continued to search through items on her phone with a sense of desperation, hoping to find something that could be delivered first thing in the morning.

Hana raised a brow. “Fruits?” she repeated, incredulously.

Her mother nodded.

“B-but just fruits?” Hana sputtered. “Unless they were sprinkled with gold flakes, I don’t think Jeong-wook’s parents would be too impressed.” Then the tarot reader’s Judgment card came to mind, suddenly twisting her insides.

“A gift shouldn’t be about the price. It’s the intention behind it that matters. Fruits are a gift all could enjoy.”

Sighing, Hana scanned the fruit stands, feeling unsatisfied with the choices. Then, her eyes laid on a stack of gift boxes of Asian pears. She plucked one up. It was as round and large as a baby’s head. Its golden skin shone in the sunlight.

“You could never go wrong with fruit,” her mother said.

After purchasing a dozen pears, Hana began to pack for the weekend, picking out the best outfits she had in the closet. Her family was high on excitement and pride. Every now and then, they told her how thrilled they were that she had found “The One.”

But Yoo-jin, her best friend since childhood, was less than enthusiastic. “Eonni, you need to be careful,” Yoo-jin warned her over the phone.

Hana laughed. “I’m sure his family isn’t that bad. Look at how they had raised Jeong-wook! He’s the kindest and most thoughtful man I’ve ever been with.”

“Is he? Do you really know him?”

“Well, of course! We’ve been together for six months.”

“People from that class, like him, they’re…”

“They’re what?” Hana felt a rush of irritation as she listened to her friend’s judgment.

“They’re not like us.”

“What do you mean?”

“What I mean is that they live in a far different plane of reality than we do,” Yoo-jin’s voice was cautious, even frightened. “We see how things are, but they see how they want things to be, and they won’t stop until they get what they want.”

“I think that’s how they became successful. If anything, it’s admirable, even inspiring!”

“Eonni! Listen to what I’m saying.” Yoo-jin then paused for a moment, taking in a sharp breath, and said in a much calmer voice, “It could be dangerous to involve yourself with them, especially with this family.”

“Dangerous?”

“I’ve met people like Jeong-wook and their families here in this city. I’ve seen what they’re really like, and what they really look like. They’re not...people.”

“Oh, Yoo-jin, you’re being ridiculous now!”

“I’m telling you that you’re walking into a trap!”

Hana scoffed. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. With a firm readiness to end the call, she gawked at her phone in disbelief as if it were Yoo-jin in front of her.

“Eonni?”

“Can’t you just be happy for me?” Hana spat. “You get to live your dream in Seoul, while I’m stuck here! This is the one good thing that’s happened to my life in years! And everyone’s happy for me except for the one person I thought would be the happiest! I thought it would be you!”

“I—I…” Yoo-jin stammered.

Then, without hesitation, Hana ended the call. But as she sat in silence, a queasy feeling lingered in the pit of her stomach. She couldn’t help but wonder: do I really know him?

XXXXX 

A loud knock at the front door abruptly awakened the Gwak household. The sun had barely risen, and Hana couldn’t help but wonder who could be so inconsiderate as to disturb them at such an early hour. In a drowsy state, she joined her parents and grandmother as they made their way to the front door. When her father opened it, they were warmly greeted by a man dressed in a chauffeur’s uniform, wearing a cheerful expression.

“Annyeonghaseyo!” the man said, lifting his hat and bowing his head. “I’m here to drive the young Miss to the Roh family’s estate.”

Hana’s heart sank in disappointment. She had been looking forward to seeing her boyfriend all week. “But Jeong-wook told me—” she started to say.

“Yes,” the chauffeur cut her off, “he was going to come get you himself. However, another matter came up, and so his mother sent me instead.”

He checked his pocket watch and frantically urged her to get her bags and hurry. 

“We need to go now; it’s important that we’re not late!”

Hana hurriedly dressed and gathered her belongings, feeling rushed and unable to even say goodbye to her family with a kiss. Within five minutes, she was out the door, following the chauffeur to the waiting SUV in the parking lot. The chauffeur, although friendly and courteous, spoke very little, focusing on opening and closing the door for her and even offering a peppermint candy. Lost in her own thoughts and fantasies, Hana didn’t mind the prolonged silence.

Hana gazed out the window, envisioning every detail of her arrival at the Roh family’s house. First, she would bow deeply, showing utmost respect, rather than simply nodding her head. Then, she would present Jeong-wook’s parents with the gift box of Asian pears, carefully chosen as her offering.

Her stomach fluttered with nervous anticipation as she imagined their reaction. Hana held onto the hope that her mother was right—that fruits would be a gift that everyone could enjoy. But she thought that once his parents saw the kindness of her heart and the depth of her love for their only son, they’d embrace her as a part of their family.

The chauffeur pulled into a rest stop, announcing a quick smoke break. His demeanor seemed tense and nervous. He tried to placate with a cigarette. Hana didn’t find this behavior unusual; many people she knew who worked under pressure often sought solace in smoking. It was a common sight to witness them pacing restlessly in office building parking lots, surrounded by wispy clouds of smoke.

She’d see them from the third-floor window of her math academy. Sometimes she had to shut the window because the smell made her light-headed. She couldn’t completely blame them for the nasty habit of smoking; it was one of the few things that soothed them, even if only for just five minutes.

As the chauffeur continued to smoke and mutter to himself, Hana decided to step out of the car. She perused the various food stands and coffee shops and the clothing stores that mostly offered popular hiking gear and hats. Then, someone caught her eye. A woman sitting by the window in a coffee shop seemed oddly familiar. As Hana approached closer, the woman’s face came into clearer view, and then it struck her. It was the tarot reader.

The woman, sensing Hana’s gaze, looked up and their eyes met. Her eyebrows raised in surprise, and Hana felt a tinge of embarrassment at being caught staring. She quickly composed herself, offering a polite smile and bowing her head. Before she knew it, Hana found herself seated across from the tarot reader, feeling slightly embarrassed that she couldn’t recall the woman’s name. Seeing that the tarot reader appeared to be around the same age as her mother, Hana addressed her as “ajumeoni” out of respect.
“Well, it’s a pleasant surprise to see you here!” The tarot reader smiled, spreading a sense of motherly warmth that Hana found comforting, quietly easing Hana’s anxiety about meeting Jeong-wook’s family.

Hana nodded. “Likewise! Ajumeoni, I want to apologize for how I was in our first meeting. I was a bit rude and sour. My grandmother and mother were always pushing me about marriage, and I was upset that they dragged me to do the tarot reading without letting me know their intention.”

The reader waved her hand dismissively and chuckled. “Oh, don’t worry about it. You wouldn’t be the first one. So many mothers and grandmothers come to me asking about their son’s or daughter’s future—always about marriage, babies, and careers.”

“I also want to say thank you, too.”

“What for?”

“I remember that the Lovers card came up in the reading. You were right. I met someone, and I wasn’t even looking… it just happened. Perhaps, it was fate. I honestly feel that he’s the one.”

“Ah, yes, now I do recall that card! Well, I’m happy for you that things seem to be working out.”

“It is! I’m on my way to meet his family for the first time, and I’ve been feeling nervous about it too.

“Just remember what I told you…Whatever they say or do, don’t let it get to you, don’t lose your sense of self-worth. You may need to firmly put your foot down with them.”

She placed a tender hand over Hana’s hands as they unconsciously crumpled and tore away at the small pieces of a napkin. “I’m sure your meeting with his family will go well,” she added. “I don’t mean to make you even more anxious, but I say this to most of my clients because people tend to overly romanticize their partners, and when the truth finally reveals itself, they’re crushed. It’s difficult to see someone so heartbroken.”

Hana straightened up in her seat and forced a smile, quietly telling herself that the reader was wrong and that the cards were a silly thing. “You’re right on that too. I’ll be careful as I can be.”

The reader reached into her purse and pulled out the deck of cards. “How about a reading for your journey?” she asked, shuffling the cards like an expert casino dealer. “Free of charge. Just something to ease your mind.”

Before Hana could respond, a loud bang on the window startled both of them, causing some of the tarot cards to slip from the reader’s hands and fall to the floor. Looking outside, they saw the chauffeur with a frantic expression on his face, pressing it against the window. He pointed at his watch and gestured for Hana to hurry.

As they made their way back to the vehicle, Hana struggled to keep up with the chauffeur, who walked with hurried, large strides and was muttering to himself about their lateness, and that the Mother was going to have his head for supper.

“You must be getting hungry,” the chauffeur said, suddenly breaking his long silence, and glancing over at her through the rearview mirror. “It’s going to be a long trip to the Roh house. You might want to eat the candy to stave off your hunger.”

“Oh, well, I’m okay. I can hold out. The drive to Seoul isn’t too long for me.”

“Seoul? Oh, the Roh estate isn’t in Seoul. It’s much farther than that.”

“But Jeong-wook told me—” she stopped herself as she just remembered that her boyfriend had never mentioned where his family lived. She had always assumed it was in Seoul. That was where everything was, and anybody who was anybody lived in Korea’s largest bustling capital city.

“If we’re not heading to the city, then where are you taking me?” she asked.

“I’m not allowed to say. But you should have something to eat. It’s a long drive. Do you not like peppermint? I’ve got other flavors.”

Keeping one hand on the steering wheel, the chauffeur reached over to the glove compartment with the other hand. Inside, the compartment was filled with an assortment of hard candies, each of them a different color and flavor. He extended his hand, offering a handful of them to Hana.

“There’s orange, grapefruit, blueberry,” he listed off the flavors and urged her to take one.

Hana tensed up, unsure of how to respond. Seeing that she wasn’t going to take any candies, the chauffeur let out a sigh of frustration. He tossed them back into the glove compartment and slammed it shut.",1,1729990092.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

now when she asked if she could bring him over again, i said i’d rather she didn’t bring him this time, and she got super defensive, saying that i “don’t like her dog” and that i’m being unfair to her as a dog owner. i tried to explain that it’s more about protecting my stuff, but she’s barely talking to me now and says i’m “picking my furniture over our friendship.”

Then I realized that the Aeroccino 4 exists which made me think maybe i should buy machine and milk frother separately. So either the citiz and then also buy Aeroccino 4 or Essenza mini and the Aeroccino 4. So as you can tell, i am very lost right now. What would you guys say? Perhaps none of these?

1gcyolk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1gcyolk/halfway_through_physics_class_time_stopped_at/,"Halfway through physics class, time stopped at 2:52pm."," **”Stop.”**

I *really* needed the bathroom. 

For fifty painstaking minutes, I had been staring at the clock on the wall, willing it to go faster, uncomfortably shifting side to side in my seat so much that I was starting to get weird looks. 

**2:52pm.**

*Eight minutes,* I thought dizzily, squeezing my legs together. 

*Which was just two chunks of four minutes.*

*Four chunks of two minutes.*

The pain started like normal stomach pain, the kind I could deal with. 

I swallowed two Tylenol with lukewarm soda. 

But this was different. 

This kind of pain was contorting and twisting my gut so much, I had to keep leaning onto my left buttock for relief. 

I must have done it so many times, I caught the attention of the guy sitting next to me. Roman Hemlock who was half asleep, dark blonde curls hanging in half lidded eyes, his chin leaning on his fist. He shot me a look. I couldn't tell if it was *Are you okay?* or *Can you stop moving around so much?*

From the single crease in his brow, the slight curl in his lip, I guessed the latter. 

It's not like Roman was helping. 

For half the class, he'd been tapping his foot on the floor, then his chair leg, and to complete the orchestra, his fingers joined in, tap, tap, tapping on the edge of his desk. 

I didn't know if it was a bored thing, an ADHD thing, or he was trying to keep himself awake. It was easy to tolerate without the pain, but *with* it, the boy’s incessant tapping was more akin to a dentist drill splitting my skull open. 

I already felt nauseous, the sad looking chicken nuggets I forced down at lunch making an unwelcome appearance at the back of my throat.

It was too fucking hot, the stuffy summer air glueing my hair to the back of my neck. The material of my shirt was making me cringe, sticky against my skin. 

Tipping my head back, the lights were too bright. Every sound was *too* loud. Imogen Prairie, who was sitting behind me chewing her gum a *little* too loudly. 

Kaz Samuels scribbling notes like a maniac. 

I could hear every stroke of his pencil, every time he paused, looked up at the presentation, and continued writing. 

When I leaned forward in my chair, I could smell exactly what Isabella Trinity had eaten for lunch, the stink hanging in the air.  

It became a case of sucking in my stomach and taking slow, deep breaths. 

I’d never had these kinds of stomach cramps before. But it didn't take me long to figure out *what* they were.

I was yet to start my period at the grand age of sixteen, which meant this was it. 

After countless sessions with the doctor, and feeling like a social outcast among my group of friends who started their periods in middle school, it had finally happened. 

The cramps in my gut that felt like my torso was being ripped apart, was in fact me entering womanhood. When my breath started to quicken, my mouth watering, I raised my hand, biting my lip against a cry. 

*Fuck.*

Something lurched in my gut, a wave of nausea crashing into me.

*I was going to throw up.*

“Mr Brighton.” 

Roman spoke up before me, waving his arm. “Can I use the bathroom?”

The teacher’s answer was always the same. Which was why I had been crossing my legs for the entirety of the class, unable to focus on anything but my gut trying to twist itself inside out. 

Mr Brighton leaned against the wall, his eyes glued to the PowerPoint awash in our faces. We had been staring at the exact same slide for maybe five minutes now, and our physics teacher was yet to speak, his gaze somewhere else.

Mr Brighton was my Dad’s age, a greying man in his early fifties who always wore the exact same suit with the exact same stain on his collar. 

The man was about as interesting as watching paint dry. 

Normally, I would drift off myself, lulled into slumber by the low drone of his voice. 

But the pain ripping me apart was keeping me awake. 

“Mr Brighton.” Roman said, louder. His voice snapped me out of it. “Can I use the bathroom?” He paused, exaggerating a loud sigh. *”Please?”*

The teacher straightened up, folding his arms. 

“Mr Hemlock, you know the rules. Why didn't you go before class?”

“I didn't *need* to go an hour ago, did I?”

“You will no longer need to go to the bathroom, Mr Hemlock.”

Roman made a snorting noise.

“What?”

The low murmur of my classmates collapsed into white noise.

Glancing at the clock, I was anticipating the school bell. 

The sickness swimming in the pit of my belly was reaching dangerous territory. 

**2:52pm.**

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

It was 2:52 the last time I checked, and five minutes had surely passed.

This time, I waited a whole minute and counted the seconds under my breath. The clock still didn't move. The ticker was frozen halfway between three and four. 

Slowly, the same realisation began to hit the twelve of us. The clock on the wall had stopped. But it wasn't the only thing that had stopped. The cool breeze drifting through the window was gone. 

The sound of birds outside, and the cheer squad practising their routine. 

Everything had stopped. Trying to ignore a sickly slither of panic twisting its way through me, I checked my phone under my desk. There was a text from my Mom lighting up my notifications. When I tried to swipe it open, nothing happened. My lock screen was frozen, stuck at 2:52pm.

With my hands growing clammy around my phone, I stared at the time, willing it to move, to flick to 2:53. 

But nothing happened, the numbers stubbornly staying at 2:52.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Roman’s voice brought me back to reality, though I was sure I'd dropped my phone. I heard it hit the floor with a sickening crack. Whatever he was saying, though, faded into dull murmur, when I turned toward the window. 

Something was *wrong* outside.

The cheer squad were nowhere to be seen. 

Being on the top floor gave us a front row seat to their practice sessions.

I stopped watching when their flyer did a death defying flip, almost breaking her neck. *2:52pm.* I couldn't see the cheer squad. But I *did* see Jessie Carson mid-sprint across the track field, strawberry blonde curls suspended in a halo around her. 

I could see exactly where she had frozen in place, her left foot hovering off of the ground, her right foot driving momentum. It wasn't just Jessie who had stopped. The dirt she was kicking into a cloud behind her was hovering, caught in mid-air. 

Studying the faces around me, my mouth went dry. 

Roman Hemlock, mid-argument with our physics teacher. 

His eyes were wide, lips curved into what would have been a yell. 

Fuck. 

Was I the only one?

But then Roman blinked, and I realized the boy wasn't frozen. He was trying to think of a comeback. “What do you mean I won't need the bathroom anymore?”

“Mr Hemlock, please lower your voice.”

“Why? You can't dictate to me when I do and don't need the bathroom, dude!”

Moving onto the rest of my class, the others were still moving.

It was too quiet, though. 

Yes, Roman was still tapping his foot. 

Imogen was still chewing her gum. 

Kaz was still scribbling notes like a psychopath. 

But they were the *only* noise I could hear. 

I wasn't the only one confused. The classroom had pricked with a sense of urgency. Kids were checking their phones, their gazes glued to the clock. Even Roman, who was still arguing, was starting to notice. I watched his gaze lazily roll to the clock on the wall. 

I pretended not to see his cheeks visibly paling. 

We had all come to the exact same terrifying conclusion. 

**2:52pm.**

Time had come to a halt, and somehow, we had *not*.

“Is that clock broken?” Roman interrupted, leaning forward in his chair.

Kaz twisted around, settling the boy with an eye-roll. 

“Check your phone, dumbass.”

“I broke my phone.” 

Imogen threw her iPhone at him, narrowly missing hitting him in the face. 

“Everything is frozen,” She said, her voice shuddering. “It's not just the clock.”

I waited for Roman’s response. For once, though, he was speechless. 

“Well done, Imogen. That is correct.” Mr Brighton spoke up, tearing a piece of paper from a workbook and striding over to the door, glueing it over the glass window. When we started to protest, some of us were shouting, while others bursting into tears, he calmly took out his key and locked us in. 

I should have been surprised that our teacher had spontaneously decided to take his entire class hostage, but the rumor mill had been churning. 

According to Becca Jason, the guy’s wife divorced him and took his kids. 

I could feel myself sinking into my chair, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

So, this guy had nothing to lose. 

Taking his place in front of his desk, the man settled us with a patient smile. 

“From now on, you will stay inside this room.” He said. “In case you haven't noticed, time is currently frozen at fifty two minutes past two. The thirteen of us are tucked into the twenty first second, and will be, for the foreseeable future.” 

I could tell the others wanted to argue, but we couldn't deny that time had stopped. Kaz was staring down at his frozen phone, Imogen hyperventilating behind me, Roman glaring at the clock, chewing on a pencil. We wanted it to be a prank, a joke, some kind of glitch in the matrix that would fix itself. 

But then a whole minute passed by. Followed by another. Kaz threw his phone on the floor, hissing in frustration. Imogen let out a wet sounding sob. 

Roman’s pencil split in his mouth, slipping from his fingers. 

We couldn't pretend it wasn't happening or call our teacher out on his BS, because it was everywhere around us. 

The sudden absence of outdoor ambience, birdsong, planes flying overhead, and traffic outside the school gates. Everyone and everything had stopped, and we were the only ones left. 

This was a nightmare, surely. 

My physics class were some of the most  boring and pretentious people in the school, and somehow the world had been reduced to the twelve of us inside our classroom. 

We were scared, of course we were. But reality had stopped making sense, crashing and burning in a single second. We had no choice but to listen to our teacher. “Now, before you freak out, it may not feel like it, but the twelve of you have  *also* stopped.” 

Mr Brighton held out his own hand, and placed it on his heart. 

He was right. 

I was so busy trying to understand what was happening, I had failed to realize my period cramps were gone. 

“Do me a favor, and press your hand over your heart.”

“You mean like, in a culty way?” Imogen whispered. 

“Obviously.” Roman grumbled, halfway out of his seat. He was hesitant, though, in case our teacher was armed. It only took one glance from our teacher, and he slumped back into his chair. “This crazy fucker clearly wants to play mind games with us.”

“No, I'm just asking you to feel for your heart.” 

I felt for mine, and there was nothing, my stomach twisting. 

Roman stabbed his fingers into his neck, feeling for a pulse. 

He tried his wrist. 

Then his heart. 

*Nothing*. 

“The twelve of you are currently in a state of stasis,” the teacher explained to us, “You are not alive, nor are you dead. Your bodily functions are also on pause, such as your heartbeat and your pulse. In this state there will be no need for food and water, or going to the bathroom.” 

His gaze found a ghastly looking Roman, who looked like he was going to faint. “Your minds, however, as you can see, are working as usual.”

“But *why*?” Imogen demanded in a shriek. 

Mr Brighton’s lip curled. “I would rather not answer that question.”

“Because you're lonely.” Roman spoke up. He swung back on his chair, narrowed eyes glued to the teacher. 

“Your wife and kids left you, so you're asserting power over a group of sixteen year olds. Which is kinda fucking pathetic.”

Mr Brighton’s expression darkened, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

The worst thing any of us could do was threaten him. He had taken kidnapping to a whole new level, and we were alone with this psychopath, trapped inside a second. I waited for the man to stride forward and attack the kid. But he didn't. 

Instead, the teacher leaned back on his desk. “Yes.” The man nodded. 

“I suppose you could say I am.”

“But why *us*?!” Kaz hissed. 

“Because you are *children*.” Mr Brighton responded casually. 

He straightened up, taking slow, intimidating steps towards Roman’s desk. The rest of us leaned back. I tried to pull my desk with me, but it was glued to the floor. Frozen. Mr Brighton’s shoes went click-clack across the hardwood floor. 

“You are right,” the man said in a murmur, “I *am* lonely. My wife and kids *did* leave me, and I have nobody left to control. I have  nobody else to contort and use to my advantage.” Reaching Roman’s desk, he leaned in close until he was nose to nose with the kid. 

“Congratulations, Mr Hemlock. You have just earned yourself detention.”

Roman stayed stubbornly still, but he was visibly afraid. I could see him very slowly backing away. Roman was all bark and no bite. He was a loud mouth, sure, but he was also the least confrontational person in the class. 

“What?” He spluttered. “You trap us in a *time loop* or time trap, or whatever, and you still want to act like a teacher?”

“Stand up.” The teacher ordered. 

“What if I don't?”

Mr Brighton’s expression didn't waver. “You said it yourself. I can and have trapped you inside a single second. What else do you think I'm capable of?”

Roman stood, kicking his chair out of the way.

“What are you planning on doing to me, old man?”

The teacher maintained his smile. “Stand up straight, and close your mouth.”

To my confusion, Roman Hemlock did all the above. 

He straightened up, and closed his mouth. 

“Do not fight me.” The teacher said calmly, “Do as you are told, and follow me.” 

The boy did exactly as instructed. 

His jaw slackened, that rebellious light in his eyes fizzling out. 

I think that's when we all collectively agreed that going against this teacher and trying to escape was mental suicide. 

“I will use Mr Hemlock as an example to all of you,” Mr Brighton said, turning to the rest of us. “If you break the rules or are derogatory in any way, you will be given detention.” 

He grabbed the boy’s shoulders, forcing him to walk towards the supply closet. Roman moved like a robot, slightly off balance, his gaze glued to thin air, like he was tracking invisible butterflies.

""Your time in detention will depend on the severity of your rule-break.” He opened the door, gently pushing Roman inside, and following suit. When the door closed behind them, there was a pause, and I remembered how to breathe. 

Kaz Samuels slowly got up from his desk, inching towards the closet. 

“This guy is a certified nut.” He announced. 

He turned towards us. “Whatever he's doing to Hemlock, we’re probably next.”

“He stopped time.” I spoke up, my own voice barely a croak. “He’s capable of anything.”

“But *how* did he stop time?” Kaz whistled, tipping his head back. The boy was slow, his fingers grasping each desk as he slid down the aisle. “He said he was lonely, right? But why take it out on us? What did we do to him?”

“Check his desk for a weapon!” Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

Kaz nodded, striding over to the man's desk, his hands moving frantically, shoving paper on the floor. He took an uncertain seat on the man's chair. 

“There's nothing here,” he murmured, lifting stained coffee mugs and ancient textbooks. “It's just…test papers.” Kaz ducked from view, trying the drawers. 

“He's a fan of Pokémon,” he said, “There's a tonne of Pokémon cards,” Kaz straightened up, running a hand through his hair. “No sign of a weapon, though.”

He picked up a ruler, waving it around. “This could work. If we plunge it in his eye.”

“Try his laptop!” Imogen was halfway out of her seat. 

Kaz did, slamming the keys. “It's locked.”

“Look *harder*!” Ren Clarke threw a pencil at him.

“I am!”

After a minute of searching, Kaz grabbed a single piece of paper. 

He held it up, and I squinted. 

It was a list of our names, with several of them highlighted. 

“Fuck.” Kaz dropped the list, his expression crumpling. The stubborn bravado facade transforming him into our sort of leader dissipated, hollowing him out into exactly what he was. Just a scared kid. Kaz’s hands were shaking. 

“Mr Brighton’s got a hit list.” He whispered. “He's going to kill us.”

“How do you know that?” I found myself asking.

Kaz slowly dropped into a crouch, picking up the paper and holding it up. 

“Look.” He pointed to a capitalised name at the top of the list highlighted in red.

**ROMAN HEMLOCK.**

There were six names highlighted in red, including mine. 

**CRISTA ADAMS.**

As if on cue, Roman’s cry rang out from the supply closet, suddenly, freezing us all in place. Kaz jumped up, adapting the expression of a deer caught in headlights, eyes wide, almost unseeing. 

He fell over himself to tidy up the desk, putting everything back where he had found it, sliding the list between a pile of test papers. Kaz took slow, stumbled steps back, his feverish gaze glued to the closet, before turning and making a break for it and diving into his seat. 

“Brighton’s got a hit liiiist,” Kaz said, in a mocking sing-song, “And we’re *all* on it.”

What followed was deathly silence. I think we were expecting Roman to cry out again. But when he didn't, the class started to stir. Some kids started praying to a god they didn't believe in, while others were in varying states of denial, trying to call their parents with dead phones.

I wasn't sure what parts of me *had* stopped, but I was still alive, still felt like my lungs were deprived of oxygen, my chest aching. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, trying to find my voice, a shriek trying and failing to rip through my mouth. 

Being kidnapped and held hostage is one thing, but being imprisoned inside a single, never ending second, was an existential hell worse than death. 

Slowly, I pressed my palm over my heart once again. Then I breathed into my cupped hands. 

I was expecting it, but no longer being able to feel my own heartbeat and breath, was fear I didn't think was possible. The kind that glued me to my seat, hollowing me out completely until I was nothing, an empty shell with no heartbeat, no breath, no thoughts, except denial, followed by acceptance. 

And finally, regret. 

I regretted not hugging my mother goodbye before I left for school. 

I regretted acting like a spoiled brat when my parents refused to drive me halfway across the country so I could attend Coachella. 

I regretted stepping inside Mr Brighton’s fourth period physics class. 

Mr Brighton reappeared, slamming the door behind him and locking the boy inside. Part of me flinched, while the rest of me remembered not to move a muscle. I was barely aware of time passing. Or it wasn't. Time had stopped, so now long had I been sitting there? 

I could no longer measure the passage of time with hunger or thirst, and my body felt the same. I wasn't stiff or tired or achy. Looking out of the window, the sky was the exact same crystal blue, every cloud in the exact same place. 

Jessie Carson was still frozen mid-run, strands of dark red hair caught around her. 

“What's wrong with you guys?” Mr Brighton chuckled, and I twisted back to the front, a shiver writhing down my spine. “Why don't you give me a smile?”

The teacher returned to his desk, and I was already subconsciously sitting up straight in my seat, forcing my lips into a jaw-breaking grin, following Brighton’s instructions. In the corner of my eye, Imogen was sitting very still, forcing an award-winning cheesy smile, while Kaz grinned through gritted teeth. 

“Mr Hemlock just earned himself two weeks inside the supply closet.” he said casually, perching himself on the edge of his desk. The man studied each of us, taking his time to rip every shred of us apart. 

*Mind, body, and soul.*

I struggled to maintain my stupid smile, shoving my shaking hands in my lap. 

“Would anyone like to *join* him, or are you going to follow the rules?”

The rest of us stayed silent. I don't think any of us breathed. 

Our teacher nodded to Kaz, inclining his head. 

“Samuels. Are you all right?”

Kaz’s smile faltered slightly. He shifted in his chair. I could see sweat trickling down his right temple. “Uh, yeah.” He swiped at his forehead, like he couldn't believe he was sweating. “Yeah, I'm good.”

The teacher’s eyes narrowed. He moved toward his desk, and we all held our breaths. Mr Brighton seemed to study his hit-list, lips curving into a frown. 

His gaze flicked to the boy, and then the paper. 

*He knew*, I thought dizzily. 

Mr Brighton *knew*  the kid had been rummaging through his desk. 

But this was all about control. The teacher was using fear to control us, to manipulate our thoughts without having to get physical. He could have called out the boy right then, but Brighton was settling with mental torture instead. 

He just wanted to make my classmate squirm. 

Without a word, the man folded up the piece of paper and slipped it into his pocket. “Mr Samuels, you are sweating,” our physics teacher said, mocking a frown. “Are you feeling okay?”

Kaz hesitated, tapping his shoe in a rhythm.  

Being one of the smartest kids in the room definitely gave him an advantage. 

I could already see the cogs turning behind half lidded eyes. Kaz was weighing each scenario, sorting them into positives and negatives. 

The positives of answering would mean he was one step towards being in the clear, but there were two negatives. 

Brighton would question him if he had left his seat, and then demand how his hit-list had magically moved across the desk. 

Talking back was surely a rule-break, as well as outright lying. 

Opening his mouth would get him in trouble, either way, and Kaz knew that. 

So, he just nodded, forcing an even bigger smile. 

Brighton’s lips pricked, his gaze straying on Kaz. “Good!” He cleared his throat, turning to the class. Kaz slumped in his seat with a sharp breath, resting his head in his arms. If Mr Brighton noticed, he didn't say anything. “Ignore the sweating. It should stop, along with hunger and thirst.”

Our teacher seemed to be able to manipulate everything in his vicinity. 

*Time.*

*Minds.*

And slowly… contorting *us* into his own. 

In the single second we were trapped inside, I felt days go by in a dizzying whirlwind that was like being permanently high. When I stood up, I felt like I was floating. 

When I sat down, hours could go by, even days, and I wouldn't even feel them. I did try and count the days, initially, scribbling them on a scrap piece of paper, but somewhere around the thirteenth or fourteenth day, I lost count. The world around us never changed, in permanent stasis, and maybe that was sending us a little crazy. 

After a while of being stuck at our desks, Mr Brighton allowed us to wander the classroom, as long as we stayed away from the door. I lay on the floor for days, counting ceiling tiles. 

Sometimes, Imogen would join me. 

I couldn't sleep, but I could pretend to sleep, imagining a world that was back to normal. I didn't feel hungry, but my brain did like to remind me of food at the weirdest times. I was aware of weeks passing us by, and then months. 

I never grew hungry or tired, and my bodily functions were none existent. 

I couldn't remember what pain felt like, or the urge to go to the bathroom. Even the concept of eating and drinking became foreign to me. Putting something in your mouth and chewing to sustain yourself? 

That sounded odd. 

The only thing that *was* changing was our slowly unravelling metal state.

I don't know how it started. Weekends and Tuesdays blended together. On one particular SaturTuesday, I was hanging upside down from my desk, watching Kaz and Imogen doodle on the whiteboard. 

Kaz had a plan to escape, but after a while, his ‘plan’ to distract the teacher, had gone nowhere. After passing notes between us, the twelve of us had decided that we needed a weapon. 

That was maybe a month ago. I wasn't sure what mind games our teacher was playing, but Kaz Samuels, who we were counting on to be our brains, was slowly falling under his spell. Their game had been going on for three days. The two of them were having a *competition* to see who could draw the craziest thing.

Mr Brighton was at his desk as usual, marking papers. 

Imogen was drawing a weird looking ‘skateboard’ when the doors to the storage closet flew open. 

Roman Hemlock appeared, and to my surprise, wasn't a hollow eyed shell. 

He held up his hand in a wave, his lips forming a small smile. 

“Yo.”

Roman’s reappearance was enough to snap us out of it. Kaz and Imogen stopped arguing, the rest of the class going silent. I sat up, blinking rapidly.

I was sure our collective consensus was that Roman Hemlock was dead. 

Mr Brighton lifted his head and gave the boy a civil nod. “Mr Hemlock will be rejoining us,” he said, his gaze going back to marking papers. “Please make him feel comfortable. I'm sure he's very excited to be able to talk to you again.”

Instead of going to his desk, the boy immediately joined the others, snatching the marker off of a baffled looking Kaz, and drawing an overly artistic sketch of a penis. I wasn't sure what confused me more. 

The fact that Roman Hemlock had some serious artistic skills, *or* that he seemed suspiciously fine for someone who had been locked in the storage closet for two weeks with no social interaction. 

With my last few lingering brain cells still clinging on, I studied the boy. 

There were no signs of bruises or scratches. 

His eyes seemed normal, not diluted or half lidded. 

Unable to stop myself, I jumped off of my desk and joined the others, where Kaz was already interrogating the guy. 

“WHAT–” 

Imogen nudged him, and he lowered his voice, leaning against the wall. “What did he do to you?”

Roman shrugged, rolling his eyes. “Relax, dude. He didn't do anything to me.”

“Then what was that yell?” Imogen hissed. 

The boy cocked his head. “Yell?”

“You yelled out,” Kaz folded his arms, narrowing his eyes. He was already suspecting one of us had been compromised– or worse, brainwashed into compliance. Kaz stepped closer, backing Roman into the desk. “You cried out when you first went in there,” he murmured, “So, what was *that*?”

Something in Roman’s eyes darkened. “Oh,” He said, his lip curling. “That.”

Kaz’s expression softened. He rested his hands on the boy’s shoulders. “Yeah,” He whispered. “What did he do to you?” 

Imogen shoved Kaz out of the way, shooting the boy a glare. 

“You don't *have* to tell us, you know.” She said in a  small voice. “If it's too traumatising, or he did something you don't want to talk about–”

Roman cut her off with a laugh, and suddenly, all eyes were on him.

The remaining nine of us were eagerly awaiting an explanation. 

“Are you fucking serious?” 

When Kaz didn't respond, Roman gathered us in a kind of hustle, the four of us grouped together. I felt like I was on the football field. Still, though, if the guy’s goal was to look as suspicious as possible, he was doing a great job. 

Roman studied each of us, one eyebrow cocked. When Mr Brighton glanced up from his work, Roman shot him a grin, lowering his voice to a hiss. 

“You seriously think our fifty year old physics teacher has been abusing me in the storage closet?

“Then why did you cry out?” Kaz demanded. “Did he hit you?”

Roman stuck out his bottom lip. “I'm pretty sure he didn't hit me.”

“So, you cried out for no reason.” 

“Why are you covering for him?” Imogen poked his forehead. “Are you lobotomised?”

Roman wafted her hand away. “Stop prodding me, and no, I'm 100% good.” He backed away from us, like we were observers, and he was the zoo attraction. 

“I won't be, if you keep treating me like I'm senile.”

“Okay, fine,” Kaz sighed. “Just answer one.”

“Shoot.”

“When you first went in there, you made an unmistakable sound of distress–”

“Not this again,” Roman groaned. “Of course I yelled! I was shoved into a pitch black storage closet on my own! What, did you expect me to stay silent?”

Kaz didn't look convinced, Imogen nervously sucking her teeth. 

The boy leaned back, resting his head against the wall. His eyes flickered shut. 

“Stop looking at me like that, there's nothing to tell you,” he murmured, “Brighton didn't do shit to me. I was just freaked out.” Prying one eye open, he fixed us with a glare. “I am *so* sorry for reacting like a human. Next time, I'll make sure to attack him and pin him to the ground.”

It's not like we believed him. I don't think Roman believed himself. 

Something significant had changed in him. He was no longer argumentative, like half of his personality had been torn away. Roman set a precedent. Because once he was following instructions and walking around with a dazed smile, others began to follow. I can't remember how much time had passed since I thought about escaping. 

Days and weeks and months had collapsed into fleeting seconds I only noticed when I wasn't playing games. 

I wasn't aware of my own lack of sanity until I found myself, on a random SaturWednesday. I was laughing, gathered with the others on the floor, around a Monopoly board. The game had been going on for almost a week. 

Reality hit me when I was laughing so hard I tipped back. 

I can't remember why I was laughing. I think Imogen told a bad joke. 

“Hand it over.” Roman, who was the King of Monopoly, held out his hand, demanding my last 250 bucks. I remember noticing his smile, my foggy brain trying to find hints that he was in some kind of trance, or being controlled by Brighton. But no. His smile was real. 

Genuine. 

To my shock and confusion, so was mine. 

I wasn't in a trance or any type of mind manipulation. I was completely conscious. 

*Was this… Stockholm syndrome?* I thought dizzily. 

*Was I enjoying this?*

My thoughts were like cotton candy, disconnected and wrong, and they barely felt like my own. My gaze found Imogen and Kaz, the two of them sitting shoulder to shoulder, enveloped in the game. 

They looked exactly the same, their hair, clothes, everything about them staying stagnant. It was them themselves who had drastically changed. I had never seen them look so carefree. 

Imogen was a hotheaded cheerleader, and Kaz was the smart kid who gave himself nosebleeds from overworking himself. But now, they were laughing, nudging each other, caught up in an inside joke. Blinking slowly, my gaze strayed on them. 

Sure, it could be manipulation. It could be brainwashing. But it could also be real.

Kaz caught my eye, raising a brow.

“You good, Christa?”

Again, my smile felt real. Like I was having fun. 

“Good. It's your turn.” 

I picked up the dice, throwing them across the board.

Two sixes. 

“I can already see her landing on one of my hotels.” Roman murmured. He sat up, resting his chin on his knees. “As the clear winner, I have a proposition.”

Ignoring him, I moved my piece– immediately landing on Park Place.

“I'll give you 500,” Roman announced, “If you give up New York avenue.”

“That's all I've got!” 

Imogen nudged me. “Don't do it. If you give him New York Avenue, he only needs one more.”

“One thousand.” Roman waved the notes in my face. 

“My final offer.” 

When I reached for the cash, he held it back. 

“New York Avenue"", he said, with a grin. 

“And your pride.”

Reluctantly, I handed my only property over. 

Kaz threw the dice and moved his piece, and I half remembered we had an escape plan. “Community chest.” Kaz picked up a card. “Go straight to jail.”*

Roman spluttered. “That's karma,” he said, “For stealing from the bank.”

“You were stealing too!”

We had a plan. 

We had…. a plan. 

After discussing it in detail, Imogen and I were going to try and get onto Brighton’s laptop. It wasn't a perfect way to escape, but it was coherent. 

So, what happened? 

We were going to get out, so what… what was *this*? 

Kaz’s earlier words hit me from months ago. 

*“Mr Brighton *is* the thing keeping us here,”* he explained. *“If we kill him, I'm like, 98% sure we’ll go back to normal.”*

*“Okay, and what if he dies and we’re *stuck*?”* Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

*“I said 98% for a reason. Yes, there's a small chance his power will die with him. But there's a bigger chance that its effects will die when he does.”*

Ren nodded slowly. *“Right, and where exactly did you learn this information?”*

*“You'll feel a lot better if I don't answer that.”*

*“Okay.”* Ren gritted his teeth.  *“So, we just need to find a weapon, right?”*

*“And don't tell Hemlock,”* Kaz rolled his eyes. *“I don't care what he says, that boy definitely had his mind fucked with. Hemlock is a liability. If we tell Roman, he tells Brighton, and we’re screwed.”* Kaz nodded to me, then the others. *“Keep your mouths shut.”*

Presently, I wasn't sure the boy *wanted* to escape. 

Slowly, I rolled my eyes over to Mr Brighton, who had joined us to play. 

He was happily marking papers, taking part when he could. 

It felt…right. 

Not like we had been forced or manipulated, but more like he belonged. Part of me wanted to question why I felt like this, but I found that I didn't care. I didn't *care* that we were essentially dead, in a never ending stasis and stuck inside fifty two minutes past two. 

I stopped thinking about the outside world a long time ago. 

I couldn't even remember my Mom’s face.

I made my decision, dazedly watching Imogen throw a *chance* card at Roman. 

He flung one back, threatening to tip the board. 

*I wanted to stay.*

In the corner of my eye, however, someone was still awake. 

Ren, who had been sitting next to me, kept moving, further and further away. 

I didn't notice until he was inching towards our teacher, a box cutter clenched between his fist. There must have been a point when we found a box cutter, when we made it our weapon of choice. 

But somewhere along the way, I think we just… lost the longing to want to escape. 

I didn't see the exact moment the boy stabbed the blade into the man's neck, plunging it through his flesh, but I did *feel* a sudden jolt, like time itself was starting to falter and tremble. 

Mr Brighton dropped to the ground, and I found my gaze flashing to the frozen clock.

Which was moving, suddenly. 

Slowly creeping towards **2:53pm.**

Something sticky ran underneath me, warm and wet. 

Blood. 

Blood that was *running*. 

Roman’s half lidded eyes found mine, and he blinked, dropping the dice. 

Like he'd been asleep for a long time. 

**2:53pm.**

*We were free*. 

The cool spring breeze grazing my cheeks was back. I could feel my own heartbeat, sticky sweat on my forehead. 

And outside, Jessie Carson let out a gut-churning scream. 

More screams rang out. 

Down the hallways. 

Getting closer. 

And *closer*. 

For a disorienting moment, I don't think any of us believed we were free. 

Roman twisted around, his gaze on the doorway. 

The piece of paper the teacher had stuck to the glass slipped away. 

But Roman’s gaze was glued to the door, his cheeks paling. 

His lips parted into a silent cry. 

Following his eyes, I glimpsed a shadow.  

A shadow that was frozen at *2:52pm.*

**2:53pm**. 

“Fuck.” Roman whispered, stumbling to his feet. 

He turned to the rest of us, his eyes wild. 

“Get DOWN!”

I dropped onto my knees, crawling under a desk, the classroom exploding around me. 

**2:54.**

Blood splattered the walls, and I was crawling in it, stained in my friends. 

**2:55.**

I grabbed Mr Brighton's hand, squeezing for dear life. 

Roman joined me, his trembling fingers feeling for a pulse. 

A gunshot rang in my ears, rattling my skull. 

When Roman went limp next to me, I wrapped my arms around my teacher. 

“Mr Brighton, say *Stop*.” I whispered, when Imogen’s screams *stopped*. 

*He was so cold…*

“Mr Brighton! Take us back!”

Footsteps coming towards me, ice cold steel protruding into my neck.

1gcyj1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nathalycuevas_snark/comments/1gcyj1r/nathalys_whiteness_long_ass_rant/,Nathaly’s whiteness / long ass rant,"So I’ve been lurking this subreddit for a little while and I don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion but Nathaly isn’t trying to be white, she is white. It seems like people (and Nathaly herself) have a hard time differentiating race, ethnicity, and nationality. If we want to be specific her race is mestizo aka mixed native/white and presents as a white person in my eyes. She is however Latina ethnicity wise and Mexican because of her parents which I’m assuming were born and raised in Mexico. She definitely has some indigenous features mainly her nose but I don’t want to make this entire thing about race because the whole thing is overly complicated. But it’s very clear she is white and has probably never faced any adversity due to her race.

I’m not even trying to defend her because I do think it’s disrespectful and rude of her to talk to her parents in another language knowing damn well they can’t properly communicate in English. The almost obligatory English in her vlogs is actual white washing because she’s catering to a white English speaking audience. There’s lots of parents who force their kids to only speak English in order to assimilate better but I don’t know if that’s the case here. I personally know several people with the “Mexican look” who speak zero Spanish and are still discriminated because of how they look. I stumble upon other bilingual channels of Americans living in Mexico and vice versa and they all speak their native language. All she has to is tell her editor to add subtitles but of course she’s too lazy even for that. Overall it feels disrespectful making her parents to speak English and attempting to justify it because her channel is in English….

What I don’t understand are the whitewash comments about her hobbies (although I do think a lot of them are forced). But even before her blonde hair “era” and every other era she makes up she always presented and acted as a white person. I don’t think drinking starbucks, driving a range, doing pilates, etc. is exclusive to white people. From what I can infer through several of her vlogs is that she despises being Mexican and feel shames about it. She only claims it when necessary. This is probably why she is trying so hard to distance herself from the community she so deeply believes is inferior. She thinks by integrating into “white girl” hobbies she’ll stop being associated with Mexicans. I don’t think she understands that she is already white and can’t become more white by forcing herself to do things that she probably doesn’t even enjoy doing. I mean I guess she could be more white but that’s pointless.

What’s funny enough none of the things she does are exclusive to white people and she doesn’t realize that. She can embrace her Mexican heritage while still doing all those other things she supposedly loves. She will probably be the first to use the “support small poc latinx businesses” card when and if she even opens that coffee she so desperately wants. And frankly she should be embarrassed to do so because she can’t even call herself hispanic because she’s a no sabo kid. I remember one vlog she said something along the lines of “people can’t tell I’m Mexican until I talk” like okay and you also can’t speak Spanish properly so what does that make you? Like I think she just hates being Mexican because she associates negative stereotypes with them and wants to distance herself from that community as far as possible. I think what I’m trying to say is we can’t hate on her for being or trying to be white when we are equally upholding stereotypes that can end up being harmful most of the times. Sometimes we are putting too much emphasis on her race and it’s just reductive in my opinion. Because what does it even mean to be Mexican?

I sometimes think y’all want her to be a walking stereotype of a Mexican and if we’re being honest she’s not far off if we’re basing it on negative generalizations of Mexicans. She barely graduated high school, lowkey an alcoholic, babies her bf, not to mention a naca. She’s constantly dropping f bombs and she’s such a potty mouth in general. She also lacks proper hygiene. I don’t know why she thinks of Mexicans as low class when what she’s doing in her day to day life is so tacky and “low class”. She might think because she has money she’s now somehow excluded from the “lower class Mexicans”. She’s trying so hard to distance herself from the latino community she fails to realize she’s just as “bad” as them. I mean she might not be in any drama but she’s so dismissive towards her family and treats strangers better than she does her own family. She also buys her friends and doesn’t realize they only like her because she has money. Her “friend group” is honestly so sad and that’s coming from a person who is literally a loner lmao.

I know this sub doesn’t like discussing politics but now that I think about it it would be embarrassing if she did support Trump considering his policies and supporters encourage discrimination against non English speakers. Like how dumb do you have to be? Her mom’s video about how the doctors didn’t take her seriously probably had to do with the fact that they’re immigrants and non English speakers. Knowing all that happened to her mom and still supporting him would be sad to say the least. She probably think she’s in the top 1% and she’ll be included in Trump’s tax exemption bracket.

1gcygwo,https://i.redd.it/0gswgpy8w6xd1.jpeg,My A.I. generated starter kit. How did it do guys?,"TL;DR - I had chat GPT curate a DE starter kit for my specific needs. This is what it had me buy.

Alright, Reddit, I’ve finally taken the plunge and decided to start shaving my head. But here’s the catch: I’ve got coarse hair and super sensitive skin, which means I’ve been the not-so-proud owner of more ingrown hairs than I’d like to admit. Cartridges weren’t cutting it (pun intended), so I went the lazy route and asked ChatGPT to build me the ultimate starter kit.

Turns out, it pulled a lot of its suggestions from this subreddit, so I thought I’d share the setup it curated for me. Here’s what I’m working with:

Razor: Feather ASD2 – Apparently, if you’re going to drop cash, spend it on the razor. ChatGPT’s words, not mine. Supposedly gentle yet effective, which is exactly what I need to avoid looking like I got into a fight with a cheese grater.

Blades: Feather (because why not live dangerously?) – ChatGPT suggested a sample pack too, but we’re starting bold here.

Cream: Jack Black Supreme Triple Cushion – For those “I only have five minutes before I need to look respectable” mornings.

Soap #1: Stirling Bergamot Lavender – Everyday soap. GPT already knew I’m a lavender enthusiast (AI knows me better than I know myself at this point).

Soap #2: Wholly Kaw King of Oud – My “treat yourself” soap. Because if I’m going to bleed, I might as well smell amazing.

Brush: Omega 10066 Boar – GPT suggested I start with a budget brush. Not exactly a spa treatment for the noggin, but it’s supposed to be good for exfoliating the head. Plus, I was told to spend my budget on the razor, so here we are.

Bowl: My trusty coffee mug – Apparently, ChatGPT has no respect for my aesthetic goals. It didn’t think any bowl was worth the budget over a “free” coffee mug. It’s giving me budget barber vibes.

So here I am, staring at my kit and gearing up for my first DE head shave. Wish me luck, folks! If this post disappears, you’ll know I lost the battle with my own head.

I've tried *most* of 'em, so here’s the scoop on where to find genuine connections, minus the scammers and empty wallets.

# 1. [**Seeking.com**](https://www.findingsugardaddy.com/seeking)

Massive user base, so you’re not stuck talking to the same five people. Flexibility’s a big plus—you can go for an in-person meet or keep it online if that’s your vibe. Heads up though, it’s pricier than some, but for privacy and real options, it’s worth it.

# 2. [**SugarDaddyMeet.com**](https://www.findingsugardaddy.com/SugarDaddyMeet)

Focused *only* on sugar relationships, so no randoms trying to sell you fitness shakes. They verify users too, so you’re less likely to deal with sketchy profiles. I found it easy to use, and it’s pretty reasonable on the cost front.

# 3. [**Sugarbook.com**](https://www.findingsugardaddy.com/sugarbook)

This one is pretty upfront about the whole “mutual benefits” thing, which is kinda refreshing. Great mobile app, solid privacy features, and it’s cheaper than Seeking but with similar quality.

# 4 SecretBenefits.com

Ladies, you’ll love this one—it's free for sugar babies. Super simple and keeps everything discreet. Advanced filters make it easy to find exactly who you’re lookin’ for.

# 5. WhatsYourPrice.com

Dating with a twist: sugar daddies bid on dates, making things clear from the start. Think dating auction meets straightforward arrangements—no games, lots of active users, and upfront about what everyone wants.

**Pro Tips:**

* **Stay Safe**: Look for platforms with user verification like SugarDaddyMeet, where you don’t have to worry about fakes.
* **Pick Public Spots** for your first meeting—coffee shops, not secluded areas.
* **Don’t overshare** personal info too soon. Privacy settings are there for a reason; use ‘em.

Whether you're exploring out of curiosity or ready for a sugar relationship, these apps can actually help you connect without the usual dating app hassle. Give ‘em a shot and see what fits.",1,1729986675.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False

We are both 17 and we started dating on a school trip where we spent a lot of time together. When we got back, we still spend a decent amount of time together during a school break. 

Once school started, though, I never get to see her outside of school. 

The problem is that her mom is pretty protective. Her older sister said that she wasn’t allowed to do ANYTHING until date she moved out. 

I’m realizing how bad it is now because my girlfriend will ask her mom to go to the store or the car wash, just something super innocent like that, and she will say no(?!?!)! Like that is so insane to me because my parents are pretty chill. 

I basically never see her right now because she got grounded for a month because she hung up on her mom. It is safe to say that they have a ‘strained’ relationship.

Anyway, she is not even allowed to go to coffee shops to do homework while she’s grounded and I just don’t know what to do.

Tl;dr my girlfriend’s mom doesn’t let her out of the house for anything and I really want to see her.

It was nice, if a bit busy. To my surprise I ran into Darling while we were about to leave and we spoke for a while. They've been having some health issues so it was nice to see them doing well. We bought some tarts, some soup base, a jar of spices I don't remember the name of at the moment, and a huge bag of popcorn. I had a good time. Mother had to stop in to the store on the way back and I admit, near the end there I started getting queasy. Still, I managed to keep myself together and it only took 15-20 minutes for the nausea to go away when we got home. For anyone else, that would be a low bar but I can be no one else than myself so...

Once we were home I took the pets out for a bit. The weather was odd today; overcast, then sun, sudden rain, surprise hail, and then bright sun again. We got out at the second flash of sunlight. It didn't last long but it was a nice while it lasted. When I was ready to come in, I finally picked the rest of the peppers. Most are still green but with the weather taking it's final turn, their is no time to let them ripen on the plant. We'll still find uses for them. 

Now, onto my writing. I wrote around 430 words. I think for now, the late night writings is what I'm going to be doing. We are finally selling the microwave we have stored upstairs in my office; once that's gone I'm going to clear out my office again and finally use it when I need some privacy. That will also be a good place to finish the first cover and start the second. I am certain I am going to be splitting the book in two now and an idea for the next cover found me while I was in the shower. There are no more potent ideas than ones that find us in he shower or moments from sleep. The first cover is tentacles and an oyster, reminiscent of a vulva. The next cover, following that logic, must resemble a penis; that's just logic. It is going to be a cigar being lit by two matches, a serpentine tongue curling around the smoke. I think I can paint that. Hopefully. Even if I can't, I still need to paint the first cover sot here's plenty of time to prepare.

All in all, a good day. Full of decisions and sweets. Now, I'm going to make some coffee, have a tart, and wait for the perfect time to write. Wish me luck.

1gcy6v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1gcy6v2/conlang_for_inuniverse_text_instead_of_players/,Conlang for in-universe text instead of player's language,"Hey! Design problem here. This issue is not backed up by playtests just yet, but I figured I should use the knowledge of others before potentially misdirecting my time!

Just for broad context my game is a visual novel bartending game, of the likes of VA-11 HALL-A or Coffee talk, but it's 3D and in hell. In my game, outside of the main gameplay loop of serving drinks to customers, collecting blackmail and experiencing the main story, you can explore the city.

Though I haven't decided whether I should have the city signs (plus any in-universe things characters hand to you) to be in a ***fictional language,*** or just be in English/the localised language of the player. For more context, this fictional language is currently a relex of English, meaning it is functionally English but the symbols are different.

My current understanding of the possible pros and cons (again not informed by playtesting) is:

Pros:

* Fictional language is more immersive
* Promotes exploration, as you'll have to investigate and match letters on notes you receive to find locations, which could be rewarding
* 90% of the game's assets won't have to be localised!

Cons

* Could potentially alienate players since it's slightly uncomfortable being almost fully immersed in a language you can't immediately decipher
* Might break game flow, as if players don't immediately understand let's say, a flyer given to them by a character, they may not bother to look further into it and then miss out on content they would have otherwise interacted with.

I should say that *I would provide a way to read and translate signs* via a button prompt, which will feed into that exploratory aspect, and if the language was just a basic relex of English, English speakers could pick up on that and actually be able to read signs with some practice which could be a fun way and easy way to add a lot of easter eggs.

**My thoughts:**

I feel like it's one of those things non-indies couldn't risk doing, but something that maybe I should give it a shot. It's a bit experimental, but I think overall it could enhance the experience, and make players feel like this place is more real than pixels on the screen. Though Im sure I could do the same with everything in English! Suspension of disbelief and all!

I'm mostly into the fact that it could enhance the exploratory aspect of things, but it would be quite barebones. It wouldn't be a system where you collect words you've seen and can meticulously log everything, or keep signs translated once you've read them. It would purely be up to the player's own motivation to decipher things.

None of this affects the main story as the ""language"" will be encountered 90% out-of-bar.

\---  
Anyways, I hope any design enthusiasts, professionals, or heck just gamers have any thoughts.

I just moved in to his apartment a month ago and I’m really struggling to deal with all of his “rules” and standards. Most of it is fairly normal stuff like using a coaster and turning lights off and I am happy to adjust to keep the peace. I wouldn’t call myself a messy or chaotic person (since I’ve moved in I’ve been handling most of the household chores and keeping a pretty tidy home) but I have adhd and despite all I do to manage my symptoms there’s still a level of forgetfulness and human error that occurs and when it does he’s been having these over the top, angry reactions. The latest example was when I was painting my nails at the coffee table before a wedding we were supposed to go to (I rarely paint my nails but was excited about a special occasion). I spilled a drop or two of remover on the table and it left a white mark and before I could even apologize or acknowledge my mistake he was going off the rails screaming and lecturing me. I grew up with a lot of men that had issues with anger and have also had experiences with emotionally unstable partners in the past and have had many vulnerable conversations with him about this. I try my best to not let past experiences dictate current situations but it causes me to shut down a bit. How do you deal with a partner that gets so upset over something accidental? Are his standards and rules too rigid?

1gcy10r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gcy10r/aitah_for_getting_annoyed_at_my_partners_bad/,AITAH for getting annoyed at my partners bad(?) approach to intimacy,"
I 23F have been struggling getting in the mood for intimacy with my partner 27M. every time I try to talk to him about it end up in a big argument. lately it seems like all he wants to do is go to the bedroom. He says that this isn’t the case at all but he “has needs”. For me the problem isn’t being intimate but how he goes about it. He will just want to start right away. I don’t really know how to explain it but there’s no build up. For example I was out of town for 3 weeks and just got back last night. I had a class in the morning and he was supposed to meet me. My class ended early and he said just to meet him near his House. I said it didn’t make sense for me to go to him and then go back downtown but he said he wanted to give me my birthday presents at home, so I went, he picked me up from the subway station near his house. He gave me my presents in the car. And then he parked outside his house. When I asked him aren’t we going to walk around downtown, he said let’s just go inside for a bit (I only had a couple hours free since I had to meet my dad somewhere after) I protested a bit and said let’s just go we don’t have a lot of time and he said we’ll just drink our coffee inside and then go. So we went to his room and as soon as I sat down on his bed he is trying to get on top of me and kissing me. I pushed him off and said half joking but more annoyed “you’re not going to ask me about my day even? Or how I’ve been since I was out of town for 3 weeks” he says how was your day while still trying to kiss my neck and put his hand under my shirt. At this point him even asking just felt so disingenuous. And I said my days actually not been the best since I got some bad news about a friend. He didn’t seem to care, he was asking questions but more like gossip? And after a few minutes started trying to do stuff again. It wasn’t even that I was upset about my friend because I’ve felt this way about him starting intimacy before. it just felt so rushed like if he doesn’t start right this second he’ll explode. So I was like “can you relax for a minute” and then he said “ok let’s just lie down for a bit”, at this point it was clear that we weren’t leaving the house. I could tell he was annoyed so I tried explaining “it just feels like you care more about having sex than actually talking to me and having conversations.” And then explained more about how it felt kind of rushed with no build up, and almost desperate. He just said he understood and then we just lied in bed until I had to leave. And then he had this really aggressive attitude as soon as he got out of bed. He was sighing, aggressively grabbing his keys, gave me one word answers. I said if you were upset why didn’t you say anything before. I can’t talk right now. He said I’ve turned really weird and I’m making intimacy too weird in our relationship. I had to go so he called me while I was on my way home and was extremely angry, talking about how he has needs and if I think all he cares about is the physical aspect of our relationship then he can’t change my mind and he’s not going to try to. ended with let’s just have a relationship with no intimacy.

My name is David, a 28-year-old guy from New Jersey. I'm here in search of a meaningful relationship with a like-minded individual who shares my values and aspirations.

In terms of appearance, I'm of average height at around 5'10"". I'm bald but naturally blond with a stylish beard. You'll often find me rocking black band shirts and comfy sweatshirts. If you're into a laid-back and alternative aesthetic, we might just hit it off! Here are multiple pictures of me: https://imgur.com/a/mA06N8G

When I'm not immersed in a game or exploring extreme metal music (mostly Black Metal), I enjoy the company of my friends. Together, we go on camping trips, visit museums, get dinner or treats, watch movies, play board games, and hang out. We've also visited the Renaissance faire a couple of times. I used to play music with friends as a vocalist. Recently, I've been having movie nights with one of my best friends, enjoying new movies and showing him some he's never seen.

I've also been hanging out at my local game store recently. I met a bunch of cool people there, and I enjoy playing TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Pokémon. Recently, I've also gotten into building model kits. Outside of the game store, I'm trying some language learning, こんにちは. I would love to play D&D, but I don't quite have the time or people, unfortunately. One of my best friend's girlfriends has expressed interest, so don't be afraid to be nerdy with us.

Professionally, I am an IT Tech. I just started at a new place, and I've been learning new things and getting along great with all my coworkers. Academically, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. I'm a laid-back individual who doesn't partake in drugs or party scenes (yes, I even abstain from coffee!). I don't drink alcohol either, but I don't mind if you do. My friends have beers while I'm around. Apparently, I have an INTJ personality type. I maintain a positive and lighthearted atmosphere, constantly cracking jokes with my close-knit group of friends.

In terms of my ideal partner, I'm looking for someone around the ages of 18 and 25, preferably of East Asian or Caucasian descent. As someone who's reasonably skinny, I am also looking for someone who is slim, fit, or petite. I'm not the biggest fan of tattoos or piercings either, but that's not always a dealbreaker, so don't let that completely deter you.

My long-term goals involve building a future together and creating a life filled with meaningful experiences and shared adventures.

I am very confused and am seeking any advice/wisdom. ,"Me and my partner broke up and it’s been the hardest breakup I have ever experienced. I (24M) had been with my girlfriend (20F) for almost a year and a half. I was really not ready for a relationship when we started dating. We had some pretty complicated circumstances including her moving in with me about 6 weeks into our relationship due to her mom filing bankruptcy and having to move across the country to live with my girlfriends grandparents. My mom had left when I was younger and I know how much it hurts to leave everything you know especially at 19. We became very codependent but still had time with our friends and our own lives. Pretty soon we started having small fights due to the complications of moving in together so fast but we fought really hard to work things out. We had tried an open relationship at one point and it did not work so we both agreed to be monogamous (I hooked up with an ex which we had agreed not to do. I regretted it instantly but take full responsibility for my actions. Although in my head I did it because I knew I could cut this person off and that I would not communicate further but that’s beside the point. It hurt her. We then went on a trip to NYC and she told me I could hook up with this girl and then after she treated me very negatively but I would not have done it if she said no and really only did it because she encouraged it because she wanted to spend time with her really close friend from home.) I’m just giving this background to help explain where her lack of trust in me started. I had a lot of avoidant tendencies in the beginning and some aspects were present throughout our relationship. She had moved to another town about 8 months into us dating and began going to community college. I was worried about the distance but I would bend over backwards to come visit her even with my extremely stressful work schedule. I truly love her despite my words sadly not always meeting my actions. When I felt unheard in the relationship I developed a bad habit of threatening to end it due to her refusing to change certain things. Since the beginning of our relationship if she would yell at me or try to fight and was disrespectful or mean I would ask for space (15-30 minutes) to calm down so I don’t fuel the fire. She was never able to give me this space which due to some of my trauma made me feel cornered and escalate fights sometimes leading to me threatening the relationship. I want to make my negative behaviors very clear but I recognize that I loved her throughout these tough times but I struggled with fully letting my walls down because of how much I was into her and I was scared of getting hurt. Our relationship started getting better. She had a Roomate in the apartment she lived in when she was going to community college that had to move out due to family reasons so for the second semester she moved back in with me after deciding she wanted to take a semester off and attend a four year school. The clashing of responsibilities, stress, money and our own personal mental healths started again. I had gotten into therapy by this time and was encouraging her to find a therapist as well because we both really wanted a life with each other and she was very clear she wanted a life and family with me. (Looking back, I recognize that is a big thing to say at 19 but I really trusted her word and that it was what she wanted.) at some point due to all the fighting we became very on or off. Like we’d have 4 good days, then 2 bad days on and on. But we both still loved each other. Finally this past July i had asked for a break after she told me to shut the fuck up and when I tried to go calm myself down and get a coffee so we wouldn’t fight she chased me into the yard and was hitting my car as I was leaving. I love this person so much and am so disappointed in my negative actions as-well as hers that got us to this point. I asked for a break because I couldn’t allow myself to be like this with someone i care about. She then after about a week came and got all of her things from my house and told me she couldn’t do this anymore. I understood but was ofc sad. I then got a call from my best friend who told me she was at my house with some dude. So I took my lunch break at work due to not wanting some random dude in my house. It turned out to be her guy friend who while I was uncomfortable with I never had a reason not to trust and didn’t want to be that type of partner to say what she can and can’t do. Realizing it was him I was like “oh okay” and then she started telling me all the things she had been bottling up via yelling. This prompted her friend to go wait in his car (he has a suburban so it was easier to move all of her stuff out in his car). We both started going back and fourth and it got pretty nasty. She left calling me all types of names and telling me she’s going to go fuck other people which hurt. But I accepted that she was done ya know?  About 2-3 weeks later she calls me and tells me she doesn’t want to do this with anyone else and really wants to focus on fixing things. I love her and as a result asked her if she could come over and talk with me about it. We decided to try again. All of my negative behaviors pretty much subsided at this point. When we got back together things were going really well and we were communicating more. I would get slightly jealous when she would go out with friends 4-5 times a week and not invite me however because of the fact she was leaving for school in September. I want to also add that I work 7 days a week, let her live with me for free and paid for basically everything. Not that it’s about those transactional things but it does hurt when you go above and beyond to try and give someone things to feel comfortable and they don’t consider inviting you to things. She had also crashed her car about two weeks before school so I dropped 2k and completely rebuilt the front end so she could have her car at school. We were really happy all things considered the fighting was getting better and we were more communicative. Then she went to school. The one thing I had emphasized the importance of was communication. She went from talking to me all the time to very delayed responses and never calling. Mainly this concerned me because it was off of the baseline of how we interacted our entire relationship. During the first two weeks she called me a total of about 10 minutes. I had then explained that I’m really freaked out about how distant she was being and she came and visited me and told me it was going to be okay. Then after another week of the same type of communication I told her I cannot really continue this dynamic as it’s causing me a lot of anxiety and stress and I didn’t think it was too much to ask to communicate. Like one time she didn’t respond for 6 hours and her reason was because she was smoking weed with her new friends. Which to me doesn’t make it hard to respond to a partner you said you want a life with and professed your love to so many times. It got to the point where I felt discarded. Whether that is valid or due to my own internal problems I am unsure. But it made me cry like damn we put all this work into making this relationship better and then boom. I told her I don’t know if we should go our separate ways or not but I am really worried about our relationship and need to take a break so I can at least get used to this new communication dynamic. Due to me threatening the relationship many times in the past she put her foot down and said no this is a breakup and I’m not sure if we’re ever getting back together. I was devastated. I was unsure of how in three weeks we went from talking about where we want to move and a family to this point. I had reached out about a week later to ask her if she wouldn’t mind getting her things from my house because it was making me sad to look at. She refused and told me not to touch any of her things. She then told me I belong in an institution and just said a bunch of nasty things that hurt a lot. I said maybe in another life and she told me she would never choose me. She also had said she had been unhappy for a long time and brought up the things I wrote in the beginning of this post. I said “so you got back together with me and basically just used me for housing?” She said “I did what I had to do.” I was really hurt. About a week after that she texted me and apologized for saying all of those things and told me she still loves me and is just unsure about everything right now. I’m trying to be understanding because I know college is a big life change and it can make you question everything but I am still hurt by the things she said. She called me one morning and begged to see me. I was very opposed but she cried until I did. She then cried until I’d buy a hotel and sleep with her. After this she told me she had kissed a guy at a party and I saw that she had tinder downloaded which kind of bothered me because she waited until after we had sex to tell me this she also told me she would delete tinder if I wanted which I asked her to and have no way of confirming if she did or not. On the way to bring me back to my town she told me she loves me and said “I’m coming back, I just need time” later that day she sent me a song and told me she wants it to be played at our wedding. My head at this point is beyond confused. I dream about her almost nightly and she’s the first and last thing on my mind before and after bed. Now she keeps reaching out and I tried to explain to her that it hurts when she tells me she loves me and all of this stuff followed by I’m not sure if you’re right for me. I asked if we could go no contact due to how much it was effecting my life until she made a decision but she will still contact me every one to two weeks saying that she misses me and just needs time to decide how she feels and that it’s hard for her not to run back to me. It’s very confusing. Some of my friends think she is using the past to justify the wedge she drove between us to hook up with people in college but keep me as a safe option. I asked her about this and she said if she was trying to do me dirty she would’ve already slept with someone else. I haven’t done anything with anyone and don’t think I could for a very very long time as truly she is the only person I am interested in and want to fix things with. It sucks because if its truly about the past I was avoidant for the first half then changed and now she resents me for the past. I told her if she’s going to keep talking to me that she should at least be able to agree to make an effort to work things out at some point (she said it could be up to a year and I agreed to wait that long) and she said she was willing to. My point was if I cannot even ask you to try again at some point I think we shouldn’t contact each other until you’re sure of what you want. I am doing so many positive things for myself. I have read multiple books on self growth, relationships and been in the gym a lot. I lost a bunch of weight and have been cooking all of my food at home paying down my debt. My life is really good right now minus all of this stuff with my ex. I am just concerned of the potential that my unwavering love for her has the potential to allow me to be picked up and dropped by her and lead on. Like I do want to talk to her but when she calls and we talk for two hours and she tells me she loves me followed by a week of radio silence it is very confusing. I did make a lot of mistakes in our relationship but I truly have been putting in the work to improve myself and my self esteem to facilitate a healthier dynamic with her. I encourage her independence and think regardless of what happens with us that this was a needed break due to how codependent we had become. She struggled with picking restaurants, advocating for herself and knowing what she wanted out of life despite my attempts to facilitate these things and I think her new environment is a really good place for her to become more independent. I just hope I’m not getting played and I’m really struggling with the rumination of it all and that I’ve never been so committed to anyone and they’re completely unsure of where I fit into their life.

1gcxnas,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1gcxnas/im_worried_im_the_narcissist/,I’m worried I’m the narcissist. ,"We went long distance as he pursued an internship in coffee. 

A week before he left he told me I abused him. It hurt me. I told him I couldn’t agree, as I can’t see it, but I also can’t not agree, because this is serious.

Before we got to the narcissist accusation, he threw a book at the wall next to me, the book that he wrote down his issues/examples of narcissism for me to review. 

He sat me down and told me he thought I was a narcissist. I fought with him at first, but then he sat me down and we watched Instagram reels about videos of narcissists, how to spot them, how to heal, “top 10 signs their a narcissist”. 

I watched them all and agreed with him. Bit explained that I could also see where those related to him too. He couldn’t take it, cut me off and put that idea down. Explained that we were talking about his issue with me and that it wasn’t the time to discuss my issues with him. 

He left and I promised to be better. To change. To come a better woman. I didn’t tell him but I started therapy again. So I could work on being better. Began to focus on myself when he left so I could heal and learn to love myself. Took up classes, running, socialising blah blah blah. 

Two weeks in. He goes to dinner with a woman he’s met twice. To her house. By themselves. He didn’t ask me how I felt about it and he didn’t get home too late. So late he wrote me a message about their night and then fell asleep. 

It made me uncomfortable. I sat with my feelings for two days then reached out explaining how I felt. Before we got to communicating, he said “you don’t trust me, I know I shouldn’t have told you” and hung up the phone. 

The other woman then decided to throw him a birthday party (this would be their third interaction). Two days before the birthday and a week of fighting for my feelings to be heard, he agreed that he felt she was flirting. Agreed that their “innocent” conversations might be more than that. Was asking for advice on what to do about the party. 

I told him to go. That it was too late to get out of it and that we needed to discuss some boundaries. 

Birthday comes. He doesn’t call me. 

We then fight over my feelings of disrespect and insecurity over the situation. He says he’ll only see her in group settings, (HE SAYS. not me. I said I wouldn’t tell you what to do, that’s not my place, you just do what you feel is best to make me feel respected). 

Any who. He then starts disregarding my feelings of disrespect to explain that he feels abused by my actions. He calls me crazy, I’m not right, controlling, manipulating. Tells me to “show my therapist these messages”. 

I do. And as a therapist does, she expressed that she was happy to see me express my feelings. And of course asked me how I felt about the situation. We discussed how I could continue to express my feelings in a productive way blah blah blah

He continues to make me feel crazy. I start feeling horrible about the way I’m speaking to him. I worry I’ve caused permanent damage. That I am abusive. And manipulative. And controlling. I apologise and explain that I was just fighting to be heard. He says that an excuse. 

I show his sister the messages. From start of the issue to current. She cannot see anything wrong from my end and says he’s being very defensive. 

It makes me relieved. 

He finally comes back to say he agrees with me again after I continue to fight productively about my feelings with blessing from his sister who says I’m handling it well. 

Anywho, a month goes by and he begins texting his friends (who are also my friends) and says “I’m driving him crazy because he went to a female friends house”, his friends response “did you ask her how she felt about it before and?” No response from boyfriend. 

At this point, no one knew this was going down. I haven’t told anyone, bar his sister. 

Then I find out from the friends girlfriend. And I call him. I’m so ashamed. Please don’t come for me, I know I done wrong and I’ve cried to people about how wrong this was. I call him to demand to see these “innocent” messages and how I knew he was lying for a month.

After a row, we hang up and I feel horrible. 

The next day, I wake up to a message from him. It’s so concerning, I don’t know what to do. He’s making me feel horrible and my anxiety is at an all time high. 

He made the rule in our relationship that we don’t talk to others about what’s happening. We keep it between us. But I don’t know what to do. I’m worried at this point. 

I call his brother, crying saying I was worried that this isn’t normal to be so defensive over my feelings. To be able to disrespect them. 

His brother says “I know he sent me the screenshots, I haven’t read them yet let me call you back”. 

He’s broken the rule!!! I felt shit that I even called his brother (who’s like a brother to me we grew up together). His brother calls me back, explaining that my boyfriend said I was abusing him. And when his brother asked why he said “just wait and I’ll get proof”. He also said other things (which I’m not aware of as his brother didn’t share which I respect) but his brother explained to me “there just human reactions, we’ve all been there but it’s not abusive”. 

More time goes by and we’re arguing more than ever. He stops calling. He stops answering. He doesn’t read my messages for hours. Or a day at most. Ignores the videos and voice notes I send. 

I have a misscarriage. I call and call and call and call. Nothing. I decide it’s best not to tell him as this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don’t want him coming home. He’s also grieving the death of his nanny. It’s not the time. 

My mental health dips because of this. I lose a bunch of weight and people start expressing concern. (Nobody knows). They express this concern to boyfriend. He doesn’t reach out. 

Eventually we text a bit and he says I’m not mentally well. I ask why? He says he knows I’ve been “self harming”…I ask who told him that, “everyone”.??? I tell him, I’m not, what makes you think I am? “you’re starving yourself”. I explain that I’m not, my anxiety is just bad and I’ve lost my appetite, but I still eat. I express I’m sad that he knew all this time and didn’t reach out to ask why etc. He explained that I wasn’t mentally well, said he wouldn’t have kids with someone like me or to leave HIS kids with me…

This broke me. 

Moving on, he then expressed moving to Africa. But is withholding all the details because I’m not “mentally fit” to deal with it. I explain not knowing about a massive change in our life is causing further anxiety. I’m asking about the house and if I should continue to decorate it in case we sell it. 

(P.S this is his house. A mortgage in his name that I send him monthly payments for and monthly payments to buy myself into the house, no contact, just mutual trust, throughout this whole situation I continue to decorate the house, take care of all the finances, our dog etc)

Fast forward, he calls to ask about my thoughts on moving again. I make a few jokes, he doesn’t find them funny. 

Later that night, he calls to break up with me. Said that the jokes where what caused it. Said that if “going on holidays with my friends was more important” he doesn’t see how it will work. He then says I abused him. That 1% of me is bad and it’s the 1% he can’t live with/I can’t push past. I’m 99% good. Says everything I’ve ever done wrong. I explain “ok well, I stayed with you after you raped me” and he said “and you’ve just made me certain that I made the right choice” (was I bad to say that? My thought process was, I’m 1% bad, and you can’t move past that, but was able to move past rape??). 

We cry and argue some more. I tell him about the miscarriage. The conversation ends. We part ways. He gets annoyed that I didn’t tell him, I explain that I tried and he didn’t pick up the phone. That tried for a week. He says he stopped talking to me because I scare him. 

He sends a text the next morning saying he isn’t sure. Then later that day writes me a break a letter that he sends me a photo off. 

I fight for him to take me back for two days then all contact stopped. 

I reach out to ask if he’d like me to tell his family since he isn’t in the country. He says no we’ll tell them when he is home. As you can probably tell I’m quite close with his family and I was spending lots of time with them. They kept asking about him and it was getting harder and harder to lie about our breakup. I reach out and explain that I will tell them as it’s hurting me. He says “ok, but I would prefer you to wait”. I tell him that I’ll let them know on that Saturday. 

I start doing my rounds telling everyone individually. While I’m waiting to tell his brother he bombards me with messages to get access to the Spotify. That he needs the music to find solace. I explain that this is disrespectful to my situation. He said “this is 9 years of my music” I say “and this is 9 years of my relationship with your family, have some respect” him “it takes 2 seconds”. 

No contact. Texts me later that day to ask how it went. I ignore. 

His family express that they’re upset. I tell them the trust “a week before he left he said I abused him, all this fighting was my last chance”. They all asked how I abuse him, I said “tbh I’m not sure, he never gave examples but would call me manipulative, controlling and narcissistic”. His sister in law says that he abused me. His brother says he’s a narcissist. 

I move on. I start getting quite happy without him. I put on weight. I start picking up hobbies. Socialising more. My friends express that they always thought I wasn’t up for socialising. That I always sat in on the weekends with Dylan. 

A month goes by and he’s asking his sisters about my health. They explain to me it makes them uncomfortable. That he never texts and now the only time they hear from him is to ask about me. I call him to explain that this isn’t ok. It’s not fair on them to put them in the middle. We get to talking and arguing and crying and then chatting and laughing and smiling. The next day he sends a letter about trying again. I send him one back. We both agreed to move forward as friends and date when he returns. 

Things are going well. He invites me to visit on his connecting flight home in Scotland. Sends me a playlist called “you and I”. Calls me just to chat. Goodmorning texts. It was all going great. 

Then he does it again…stops texting. Calling. Ignoring…and when he does it’s only to talk about himself…I express that I wasn’t ok with this. 

And it happens all over again. He unfollows me on Instagram. Removes all our photos. Leeps telling me how much he wants this but then doesn’t show me with his actions…still ignores…the cycle continues…

Fast forward to today, I call him saying I can’t do it anymore. That I won’t make him choose. That he shouldn’t see me when he’s home. I explain I’m upset that we’ve been talking and he hasn’t asked ahont the miscarriage. He says that manipulating…that I haven’t changed…that HE doesn’t think this will work. That he won’t call me. That he has all these female friends…

I tell him it’s me calling him to end it…not the other way around…he says when he gets back I need to financially respect him about the house if it’s going to take months for me to buy him out…that “everyone” (aka people he’s only now for 5 months on an internship) are telling him not to let me buy the house off him but because he’s so nice and still cares for me he’s LETTING me, I tell him that he can buy me out

We argue some more and he says my shouting is  out of control. I say “I’m sorry you don’t like my reaction to your actions” I explain that I don’t think he’s ok that he needs help and that the issue is he can’t see where he’s went wrong in this relationship

And he hangs up. 

Throughout all this, I’ve been letting my friends, family and even his family see our messages. They have all expressed concern. That “this isn’t ok”. I’ve cried to each of them how I’ve went wrong. How horrible I am. Why did I say that why did I say this, apologised countless of times to him, to his family to my friends, for bothering them or hurting them…

They all express that it’s ok. That I’m not what he says I am. That I’m a good person. That they can’t see any wrong with my words and what I’ve done (and they have told me where I have went wrong, believe me. And I am ashamed and I am hurt and I have apologised). 

He made me feel so crazy…that I was so horrible in what I was saying, that I started to record our conversations so I could listen back and know that I did say what I said. Or that I didn’t say what he was accusing me of saying. I began to only tell people the things he done wrong if I had photo evidence because he made me believe he done NO WRONG. 

Now I lay in bed wondering if I am a narcissist. Reading this subreddit worrying. Asking questions….

I know there is two sides to every story…can you help me just a little?

At this moment in time i have him blocked so not to reach out to me. I’m finding somewhere to live for when he returns. I left all his family chats. (I explained to them why I left). I want someone there with me when he returns…I’m so worried he’s going to drag me back",2,1729984694.0,NarcissisticSpouses,3,1.0,False
1gcxn6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gcxn6l/the_situation_between_me_and_my_ex_24m_20f_am_i/,The situation between me and my ex. (24M) (20F) Am I being played?,"Me and my partner broke up and it’s been the hardest breakup I have ever experienced. I (24M) had been with my girlfriend (20F) for almost a year and a half. I was really not ready for a relationship when we started dating. 

We had some pretty complicated circumstances including her moving in with me about 6 weeks into our relationship due to her mom filing bankruptcy and having to move across the country to live with my girlfriends grandparents. My mom had left when I was younger and I know how much it hurts to leave everything you know especially at 19. We became very codependent but still had time with our friends and our own lives. 

Pretty soon we started having small fights due to the complications of moving in together so fast but we fought really hard to work things out. We had tried an open relationship at one point and it did not work so we both agreed to be monogamous (I hooked up with an ex which we had agreed not to do. I regretted it instantly but take full responsibility for my actions. Although in my head I did it because I knew I could cut this person off and that I would not communicate further but that’s beside the point. It hurt her. We then went on a trip to NYC and she told me I could hook up with this girl and then after she treated me very negatively but I would not have done it if she said no and really only did it because she encouraged it because she wanted to spend time with her really close friend from home.) 

I’m just giving this background to help explain where her lack of trust in me started. I had a lot of avoidant tendencies in the beginning and some aspects were present throughout our relationship. 

She had moved to another town about 8 months into us dating and began going to community college. I was worried about the distance but I would bend over backwards to come visit her even with my extremely stressful work schedule. I truly love her despite my words sadly not always meeting my actions. When I felt unheard in the relationship I developed a bad habit of threatening to end it due to her refusing to change certain things.

 Since the beginning of our relationship if she would yell at me or try to fight and was disrespectful or mean I would ask for space (15-30 minutes) to calm down so I don’t fuel the fire. She was never able to give me this space which due to some of my trauma made me feel cornered and escalate fights sometimes leading to me threatening the relationship. I want to make my negative behaviors very clear but I recognize that I loved her throughout these tough times but I struggled with fully letting my walls down because of how much I was into her and I was scared of getting hurt. 

Our relationship started getting better. She had a Roomate in the apartment she lived in when she was going to community college that had to move out due to family reasons so for the second semester she moved back in with me after deciding she wanted to take a semester off and attend a four year school. The clashing of responsibilities, stress, money and our own personal mental healths started again.

 I had gotten into therapy by this time and was encouraging her to find a therapist as well because we both really wanted a life with each other and she was very clear she wanted a life and family with me. (Looking back, I recognize that is a big thing to say at 19 but I really trusted her word and that it was what she wanted.) 

at some point due to all the fighting we became very on or off. Like we’d have 4 good days, then 2 bad days on and on. But we both still loved each other. 

Finally this past July i had asked for a break after she told me to shut the fuck up and when I tried to go calm myself down and get a coffee so we wouldn’t fight she chased me into the yard and was hitting my car as I was leaving. I love this person so much and am so disappointed in my negative actions as-well as hers that got us to this point. I asked for a break because I couldn’t allow myself to be like this with someone i care about. 

She then after about a week came and got all of her things from my house and told me she couldn’t do this anymore. I understood but was ofc sad. 

I then got a call from my best friend who told me she was at my house with some dude. So I took my lunch break at work due to not wanting some random dude in my house. It turned out to be her guy friend who while I was uncomfortable with I never had a reason not to trust and didn’t want to be that type of partner to say what she can and can’t do. Realizing it was him I was like “oh okay” and then she started telling me all the things she had been bottling up via yelling. This prompted her friend to go wait in his car (he has a suburban so it was easier to move all of her stuff out in his car). We both started going back and fourth and it got pretty nasty. She left calling me all types of names and telling me she’s going to go fuck other people which hurt. But I accepted that she was done ya know?  

About 2-3 weeks later she calls me and tells me she doesn’t want to do this with anyone else and really wants to focus on fixing things. I love her and as a result asked her if she could come over and talk with me about it. We decided to try again. 

All of my negative behaviors pretty much subsided at this point. When we got back together things were going really well and we were communicating more. I would get slightly jealous when she would go out with friends 4-5 times a week and not invite me however because of the fact she was leaving for school in September. 

I want to also add that I work 7 days a week, let her live with me for free and paid for basically everything. Not that it’s about those transactional things but it does hurt when you go above and beyond to try and give someone things to feel comfortable and they don’t consider inviting you to things. She had also crashed her car about two weeks before school so I dropped 2k and completely rebuilt the front end so she could have her car at school. 

We were really happy all things considered the fighting was getting better and we were more communicative. 

Then she went to school. 

The one thing I had emphasized the importance of was communication. She went from talking to me all the time to very delayed responses and never calling. Mainly this concerned me because it was off of the baseline of how we interacted our entire relationship. During the first two weeks she called me a total of about 10 minutes. I had then explained that I’m really freaked out about how distant she was being and she came and visited me and told me it was going to be okay. 

Then after another week of the same type of communication I told her I cannot really continue this dynamic as it’s causing me a lot of anxiety and stress and I didn’t think it was too much to ask to communicate. Like one time she didn’t respond for 6 hours and her reason was because she was smoking weed with her new friends. Which to me doesn’t make it hard to respond to a partner you said you want a life with and professed your love to so many times. 

It got to the point where I felt discarded. Whether that is valid or due to my own internal problems I am unsure. But it made me cry like damn we put all this work into making this relationship better and then boom. 

I told her I don’t know if we should go our separate ways or not but I am really worried about our relationship and need to take a break so I can at least get used to this new communication dynamic. Due to me threatening the relationship many times in the past she put her foot down and said no this is a breakup and I’m not sure if we’re ever getting back together. I was devastated. I was unsure of how in three weeks we went from talking about where we want to move and a family to this point.

 I had reached out about a week later to ask her if she wouldn’t mind getting her things from my house because it was making me sad to look at. She refused and told me not to touch any of her things. She then told me I belong in an institution and just said a bunch of nasty things that hurt a lot. I said maybe in another life and she told me she would never choose me. She also had said she had been unhappy for a long time and brought up the things I wrote in the beginning of this post. I said “so you got back together with me and basically just used me for housing?” She said “I did what I had to do.” I was really hurt. 

About a week after that she texted me and apologized for saying all of those things and told me she still loves me and is just unsure about everything right now. I’m trying to be understanding because I know college is a big life change and it can make you question everything but I am still hurt by the things she said. 

She called me one morning and begged to see me. I was very opposed but she cried until I did. She then cried until I’d buy a hotel and sleep with her. After this she told me she had kissed a guy at a party and I saw that she had tinder downloaded which kind of bothered me because she waited until after we had sex to tell me this she also told me she would delete tinder if I wanted which I asked her to and have no way of confirming if she did or not. On the way to bring me back to my town she told me she loves me and said “I’m coming back, I just need time” later that day she sent me a song and told me she wants it to be played at our wedding. 

My head at this point is beyond confused. I dream about her almost nightly and she’s the first and last thing on my mind before and after bed. Now she keeps reaching out and I tried to explain to her that it hurts when she tells me she loves me and all of this stuff followed by I’m not sure if you’re right for me. I asked if we could go no contact due to how much it was effecting my life until she made a decision but she will still contact me every one to two weeks saying that she misses me and just needs time to decide how she feels and that it’s hard for her not to run back to me. It’s very confusing. 

Some of my friends think she is using the past to justify the wedge she drove between us to hook up with people in college but keep me as a safe option. I asked her about this and she said if she was trying to do me dirty she would’ve already slept with someone else. I haven’t done anything with anyone and don’t think I could for a very very long time as truly she is the only person I am interested in and want to fix things with. It sucks because if its truly about the past I was avoidant for the first half then changed and now she resents me for the past.

 I told her if she’s going to keep talking to me that she should at least be able to agree to make an effort to work things out at some point (she said it could be up to a year and I agreed to wait that long) and she said she was willing to. My point was if I cannot even ask you to try again at some point I think we shouldn’t contact each other until you’re sure of what you want. 

I am doing so many positive things for myself. I have read multiple books on self growth, relationships and been in the gym a lot. I lost a bunch of weight and have been cooking all of my food at home paying down my debt. My life is really good right now minus all of this stuff with my ex. 

I am just concerned of the potential that my unwavering love for her has the potential to allow me to be picked up and dropped by her and lead on. Like I do want to talk to her but when she calls and we talk for two hours and she tells me she loves me followed by a week of radio silence it is very confusing. 

I did make a lot of mistakes in our relationship but I truly have been putting in the work to improve myself and my self esteem to facilitate a healthier dynamic with her. 

I encourage her independence and think regardless of what happens with us that this was a needed break due to how codependent we had become. She struggled with picking restaurants, advocating for herself and knowing what she wanted out of life despite my attempts to facilitate these things and I think her new environment is a really good place for her to become more independent. 

I just hope I’m not getting played and I’m really struggling with the rumination of it all and that I’ve never been so committed to anyone and they’re completely unsure of where I fit into their life.

I'm just at the end of my second trimester and before pregnancy was able to drink a few cups of tea and coffee a day. After finding out I was pregnant, I cut out caffeine until around 6 weeks ago.

I've had a few cokes here and there, no reaction. I've had matcha twice, no reaction. Then I brought back my black tea (English Breakfast, Dilmah) and started getting jitters and anxiety attacks later in the day. After some trial and error, figured out it was the black tea. 

Then after a week, I tried (instant) coffee and... No reaction?! It makes no sense to me, I thought black tea was less caffeine and better because of L-theanine?

I'm not planning to consume caffeine everyday day, but it's nice to enjoy a cup when visiting friends or family. Anyone else reacting to caffeine like this?",1,1729984576.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

It was from my mother; she told us that my dad wanted a serious birthday this year and not to embarrass myself. 

Let me give you a little context for why she said what she said. When I was 12, I used to pull a lot of pranks. I always thought it was funny and harmless, but my family didn’t so. I used to put toothpaste in my dad‘s coffee and put hair dye in my mom's shampoo and stuff like that, so I kept this up through my teenage and adult years, and every time I came over for a holiday, I would do something to prank them, especially on birthdays, so you see why she would ask this. 

So we get to the party, and me and my wife start putting the presents on the table, and we start helping with decorations, and then we got to the birthday cake. Now this is where I think that I was the asshole. I go up to my father and we start talking about how he was doing and other things, then I think it would be a great idea to pull a TikTok prank on him. 

He’s a retired police officer, and recently I’ve seen this TikTok where a guy would go up and ask for the officer's name and badge number, and when that officer gave it to him, he would say good boy, so I asked my dad for his old name and badge number, and after he told me I said good boy, he was livid when I said this and stormed out the venue.

1gcxiwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1gcxiwb/oru_friendship_dilemma_idk_if_i_should_help_a/,Oru friendship dilemma - idk if I should help a friend set boundaries. ,"OK so I am part of a friend group and this is specifically about two people in the group. One of them is a guy and he is the smartest, most selfless guy I have known my entire life. For instance, he does other ppls hw before his. The other person is lazy, somewhat spoilt, and is also dating another friend of mine in the group (that's how I know her). The guy and I graduated already but the girl is a junior so she's still in college. I came to know last week that the kind friend has been doing the girl's final project, which is super intensive. What's funny is, they're not even the same major. But since the guy is smart, he knows how to do stuff. She keeps doing this and even when we were all in college together, she used to make my kind friend do all the work. It's OK to ask for help, but the issue here is, the dude is unemployed, is not from a well-off family and is currently struggling with job applications and grad school essays for some universities abroad. Anyways back to the issue - the girl and I went out for coffee the other day and she casually mentioned how the guy worked on her final project for many hours the previous day. Even in the group she occasionally goes ""Hey did you get time to work on my project?"". I am so so pissed, but the guy being the usual paavam doesn't care.

I wanna make sure this guy knows how to set boundaries because honestly he deserves SO MUCH. I also lowkey wanna confront the girl, but idk how because she's also a friend. There's aspects of her personality I don't like, but she's been a supportive person too. My friends in the group agree with me (some of them have brought it up w me), but the issue is her bf is very defensive and we just know he's gonna get mad if we say anything.

1gcxfew,https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/1gcxfew/a_complete_guide_to_staff_needs/,A Complete Guide to Staff Needs,"This extensive research project came about because I couldn’t get my staff to pee. They should use any staff-only toilet and I had plenty, yet they were constantly angry about full bladders. They complained about other wants, too, but I was especially baffled by the way they’d walk right past staff-only toilets while moaning about wanting a toilet.



[After 12 hours in a prison with 2 staff-only toilets, nobody has found one.](https://preview.redd.it/83kvovgdj6xd1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac01424b4aeadbad5bec39c4c21e442e49b33907)



I watched closely and figured a lot of things out.

# Schedule Enough Break Time

Your highly ethical staff will never take care of their own needs on company time, only break time. They can be starving and bursting and staggering, and they’ll just keep working inefficiently until break time arrives and they can try to satisfy everything. Accordingly, the first thing to do is to **make sure that they have enough break time.**



[This helps a lot all by itself.](https://preview.redd.it/xlk6ezzuj6xd1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=454ecbcfeaa16d76f946bbfb064ebbe94c91055e)



The default is 10%, which is ridiculously low. I suggest at least 20% for even small maps. Larger maps will need a higher ratio to account for more travel time. I usually do 30% break time regardless of map size, though a small map could probably get away with less.



# Each Staff-Only Room Should Have All Facilities

They will use any staff-only room for breaks. It can be zoned staff-only or can be a room type only for staff, so this includes marked staff rooms but also includes security rooms and training rooms. This is why they’ve always wandered into psychologist’s offices to sit on the couches – offices are staff-only except for appointments.

They pick based on the need they want to satisfy first. They usually pick a staff-only room close by, but not always. Their desires can be more specific than what we see. For instance, if you have only staff canteens and no snack machines, some staffers will be hungry forever because they want candy bars. The reverse does not apply, though: if they prefer a healthful meal, they’ll make do with the snack machine.

**Once in a staff-only room, they will try to satisfy all their needs in that one room.**



[Harley needed bladder\/bowels relief most, so he went to a staff-zoned toilet.](https://preview.redd.it/bnlhgdcrk6xd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=121c375b81f61bf0ea5a289549ef3cbf4095e752)



If he can’t meet his other needs in that room, as is the case here, he will eventually retarget and try to reach another staff-only room. He may run out of time before he can reach it, leaving all needs but bladder unsatisfied.

Afterwards, he stood around in the toilet stall even after someone else came in and started using the toilet. He managed to get out of the toilet stall and try to retarget, but he couldn’t find the couch in time. He never did get any food or comfort on that break.



[Harley. Dude. There's a couch right there.](https://preview.redd.it/xgihl81kk6xd1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=62def1f4f95997ae6b846868861d95b7ffc86919)



The reverse happens when he goes to a standard staff room first. Unless you have toilets in the staff room – not attached, actually part of the staff room – then he will get food and comfort but be unable to pee, and he’ll have to spend time getting frustrated, retargeting, and traveling. He may not make it before his break is over. If he goes to a security room or the warden’s office, he can’t satisfy any needs.

This means that **each potential break room should have all of the facilities,** with canteen food being the lone optional exception.

Offices are a minor problem. The office staff (the warden, lawyers, etc.) are still on the old system of exhausted/tired/normal and can be ignored for this, but the offices attract other staff.

Offices are staff-only (except by appointment) and count as possible break rooms, so if they have couches, staff members who want comfort first will head in there for their breaks. They’ll then get frustrated by the lack of food, toilets, and entertainment. It’s reasonable to put a private toilet in a private office, but who wants a vending machine in there?

One solution is not to add couches or chairs other than the desk chair, but psychologists’ offices need a couch. For offices with couches, I suggest the coffee machine instead. Staff have food preferences – for instance, they’ll ignore all staff canteens if they’ve decided they want snacks – and coffee doesn’t provide enough food to attract hungry staffers, but it will still help staffers who’ve wandered in there to use the couch. A radio is also easy to add, and a doorless toilet will complete the facilities.



[The warden is now prepared for guests.](https://preview.redd.it/svhco9vll6xd1.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=0abc2f64f30e3b0d187e035cbf73882673527de5)



Another thing to note is that the **toilets shouldn’t have doors**. Adding doors turns them into separate rooms, so while they’re still usable (if staff-only), the staffers will have a harder time finding them. This was the source of my initial problem of full-bladdered staff: I’d been putting doors on the the toilet stalls, so they had to do one navigation for bladder and another for food instead of handling both in one room. The toilet should be in the same room as the other facilities.

Here’s one of my cell blocks from a large prison. The security room is also the break room for any staff who need breaks while working in that cell block. Cooks and janitors use it just as happily as guards do. It can be marked as either a staff room or a security room; either zoning will work for both security and staff.

[The cooks seem to be making do with this arrangement.](https://preview.redd.it/vfkl9cwql6xd1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=6570f53a7a28c1d589e9957fda32d63a02c0e855)



# Facilities In Every Staff-Only Room

They’ll also take breaks in their own workplaces, even if they’re not staff-only and there are no break facilities. This is okay in staff-only workplaces like security rooms, because you can just add the facilities.

Kitchens are a problem. They’re fine if staff-only, but if you zone them to allow prisoners for prison labor, staff can’t use those facilities and prisoners will wander in to do so. They may steal knives while they’re in there.

I don’t have a perfect solution. My approach is to put a staff-only break room as close to the kitchen as possible, so that cooks can easily get there once they realize there’s nothing interesting in the kitchen. My basic cell block above has the kitchen and the security/staff room adjoining.

# Special Considerations

# *Gardeners*

Gardeners spend their time outdoors, and their additional travel time means that they have a harder time getting their needs filled. We could increase their break time up to 50%, but gardeners are already among the least efficient workers, so I'm hesitant to do that.

If there's an area of the map where the gardeners do a lot of their work, a break room can go there. Otherwise, I've had some success with dotting radios around the map in workplaces and public rooms, and sometimes even outdoors. The gardeners get some recreation whenever they walk through such a zone while on break, so their entertainment level stays a little higher and they can focus their breaks on their other needs.

# *Dog Handlers*

Dog handling teams can require a little more attention, because the dogs are on the old system (exhausted/tired/normal) while the handlers are on the new system with multiple needs.

Like other staff, dog handlers will never attend to their own needs on company time. This includes any time they’re taking care of the dogs, which includes watching tired dogs sleep. When it’s time for their own breaks, they park the dogs in crates (which is also rest for the dogs) and go tend to their own needs. In other words, the dogs rest during the human’s break, but not vice versa. Accordingly, it’s better to let the handlers take enough breaks than to make them go until the dogs are tired.

This is an issue for long routes, such as those along a perimeter wall. I’ve tried adding dog/handler care stations partway around their routes, but this doesn’t work well. The handlers use them, but the rest of the staff keeps decided to traipse out there as well, resulting in too much travel time. The real key is to have only short routes, along with sufficient break time as above, so that they’re free to take their breaks as needed. The red and blue dots can be alternated to have segments overlap, so that no stretch is uncovered. When I’m using the largest map, I break the perimeter into ten segments.

As with other staff-only rooms, kennels should have all the break facilities.



# TL;DR

Increase staff time considerably: at least 20% for small maps, 25% for medium, and 30% for large maps. Every staff-only room should have all break facilities. Don’t put doors on toilets.

After a whirlwind romance they wed and had a son, Tim with another little one on the way. Don hadn’t put his past behind him however. After returning home after landing a high paying surgeon post he found Kaylynn and Tim fast asleep so invited Dina over to celebrate.

After putting two ‘Don Specials’ (tv dinners) in the microwave the couple became a little distracted. The next thing they know BOTH ovens have caught fire. Not wanting to be left out the new fireplace decided to light the Espresso machine - is coffee flammable?

Don was too busy worrying that his beloved exercise machine was at risk to notice that the fire had engulfed Dina and that he himself was seconds from disaster. The fire spread and soon both sims and the entire kitchen were no more - somehow the boombox survived.

Don had never bothered with a fire alarm. It didn’t seem very manly to worry about something little like fire. Kaylynn and Tim are blissfully unaware as they celebrate Tim’s birthday upstairs.

But was this a tragic accident? And was Don the true target. Does a certain influential sim perhaps hold a grudge after her marriage and reputation were put on the line a few years earlier? And can this be brushed under the carpet.

I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around.

* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
