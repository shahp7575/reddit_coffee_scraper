1n7fv6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1n7fv6f/why_will_my_boyfriend_not_stop_with_this_girl/,Why will my boyfriend not stop with this girl?,"would appreciate outer perspective, opinions on the situation. My boyfriend and I and I have been together for six months before him and I got together. He lived in a house with three roommates one of them being somebody he used to be intimate with. Since him and I have gotten together, it has been a problem that he has still been talking to her on the phone and texting her and specifically doing it when I’m not around. His solution to the problem is I will just cut her off and stop talking to her if that’s what you want. At the end of the day I don’t want that because the girl did not do anything. I don’t want anybody to get hurt. 

He ended up going and getting coffee with her the other day after him and I got a huge argument because he was having phone calls with her again and I expressed that it made me feel very uncomfortable. I made him go stay at his own house this night and the next morning he broke down and she console him and they went and got coffee together because they are “just friends”. When I tried to set the boundary of saying, I don’t care if you guys are friends, but I do not want you guys to go out and do things one on one more together he called me, narcissistic, manipulative, and controlling because I asked him to not go and do things with this woman that he used to be intimate with I never said that they could not hang out with each other as a collective group because the house he used to live in has roommates her being one of them. 

I’ve expressed that them talking on the phone when I’m not around also makes me uncomfortable, but I don’t want to be controlling and tell a man what he can and cannot do. Does it make me feel very uncomfortable yes. At this point in time I feel like I’ve just gotten used to the fact that these people her and my boyfriend normalizing this type of behavior and it’s starting to really frustrate me and upset me because I keep getting called crazy and jealous. She has called me jealous and so has he. Of course, I’m jealous when they used to be intimate with each other, but I’ve tried to be very kind and compassionate towards this situation because I don’t think it would be right for him to completely cut her off. 

His name is still on this lease and he still sees her and they consider each other “” friends. The part that’s really getting to me is that my boyfriend keeps saying that I’m controlling and manipulative because this makes me feel uncomfortable and I’m getting worn out at this point and it’s making me not like him anymore nor do I feel like I can trust him because he went behind my back and went and got coffee with this girl. A few days after all of this happened I sat down with him and I said why would you go do that when you knew I wouldn’t like it. He said I was very upset about the fight we got into so she can sold me. She’s just my friend. 

I didn’t look at it the way that you’re looking at it. I responded with I understand that she’s just your friend but why would you go do that when you knew I wouldn’t like it essentially he said I just didn’t think it would hurt you. This is getting the point of being worn out and I’m so tired of my feeling being invalidated. How should I approach this problem when it comes up again because I know it will, I’m starting to think he’s a narcissist. I never have seen this side of him or has ever made me feel this way and it’s very painful. I’m also confused..  I’m so tired ",1,1756908620.0,AskMenAdvice,2,1.0,False

Here’s how to actually find them.,"Most people look for jobs by updating their LinkedIn profiles and sending out tons of resumes, usually to never hear back. The problem is that up to 70% of jobs are never posted online. This hidden job market is where the best work-from-home opportunities are expected to be in [2025.Here](http://2025.Here)'s how you can access it:

1.  Referrals are very important. People are four times more likely to get hired if someone recommends them. Make a list of companies you want to work for and find at least one current employee to have a coffee chat with once a week. Instead of just asking for a referral, find ways to get involved, have genuine conversations, and show your value.
    
2.  Communities are very valuable. Good jobs often appear in online groups, such as Slack groups (Tech Ladies, Work At Home Hub), and plenty of subreddits, before they are posted for everyone to see.
    
3.  Career pages are often more effective than job boards. Save 10 company pages you like and check their job pages once a week. They often post jobs there before putting them on LinkedIn.
    
4.  Reaching out to companies directly is often effective. Sending a polite email or message to a hiring manager explaining how you can help often gets attention before a job is even open.
    
5.  Use both automation and networking. Do not just apply to hundreds of jobs without thinking or talk to people without following up. The real trick is to do both together.
    

Tools can help:

Bottom line: Stop only competing for jobs on public job boards where there are over 1,000 resumes. The best opportunities are often found in the hidden job market—through referrals, community connections, and direct outreach. Add smart tools to help, and you will get interviews much faster.",1,1756908499.0,jobhunting,0,1.0,False

1n7fs87,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1n7fs87/my_predicament/,My predicament,"Hello! I have posted here before, but my situation is now more complex than ever before. 37F recently married, want to have a baby (time is a factor because of my age). Diagnosed in May/25 with a 10cm HH and grade D esophagitis. Had had burning symptoms for around a year before that. Was started on PPIs with complete remission of the burning pain and told it was safe to get pregnant and have surgery later on. However in June I had three episodes of nocturnal aspiration. Got really scared and went to see a surgeon.  
  
Surgeon told me I should have a fundoplication before pregancy or I would suffer from extreme reflux in the third trimester. He said I wouldn't have to wait much long to get pregant because by the time the baby got big, everything would be properly healed. Orderded a manometry and pH study (off PPIs). Results showed extreme reflux, complete dysmotility of the esophagus and an incompetent inferior esophageal sphincter (it never closes). I was shocked and devastated. He told me fundoplication would no longer be an option, because creating a wrap would leave me unable to eat. He also said that the dysmotility is most likely permanent. He started considering a gastric bypass, but referred me to a gastroenterologist that he trusted for a more complete evaluation.  
  
The gastroenterolist, however, told me pretty much the opposite of what the other guy said. He said he wouldn't have any surgery before pregancy because the pregancy could damage the repair and also it could be unsafe from a nutritional standpoint. He also doesn't think my dysmotility is permanent, and that my esophagus probably works better on PPIs (meaning if I repeat the manometry while on the meds I would get a better result). He doesn’t think my HH is that big either, as endoscopies are not good in measuring size. He said there are meds I can take while pregnant to get me through it and I can think about surgery later (similar to what the doctor that diagnosed the HH had said to me back in May). He wants me to have a new endoscopy in a month to see if the esophagitis is healed and if there's no Barrett's (VERY scared and anxious about that).  
  
He pretty much told me to go home and make a baby, but I feel so insecure. He said he was going to speak to the surgeon to try to align their views regarding my case. But then what? What am I supposed to do while I wait? Anxiety is eating me alive. I feel so lost and depressed. Also I miss coffee and chocolate so much. I hate all this.",1,1756908420.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False

*Transform your daily routine by mastering the skill that separates achievers from dreamers*

## The Hidden Superpower Nobody Talks About 🎯

Picture this: You wake up feeling sluggish, unmotivated, and frankly, terrible. Your brain immediately starts negotiating with you - ""Maybe skip the gym today,"" ""That important project can wait,"" ""You deserve a break."" This internal dialogue happens to everyone, yet most people surrender to these fleeting emotional states without realizing they're giving up control of their lives.

What if there was a way to become immune to these mood swings? What if you could operate like a high-performing machine regardless of how you feel in any given moment?

The answer lies in developing emotional independence - the ability to act according to your predetermined plans rather than your current emotional state.

## Why Your Mood Is an Unreliable Navigator 🧭

### The Science Behind Emotional Fluctuations

Your emotions are essentially chemical reactions happening in your brain. These reactions are influenced by countless factors: sleep quality, blood sugar levels, weather, social interactions, hormones, and even what you ate for breakfast. Relying on such a volatile system to make important decisions is like trying to navigate using a broken compass.

Consider these daily scenarios:
- Monday morning blues making you want to call in sick
- Post-lunch energy crash tempting you to postpone important tasks
- Social anxiety preventing you from networking opportunities
- Weekend laziness derailing your fitness routine

### The Cost of Mood-Driven Decisions

When you consistently follow your moods, you create a pattern of inconsistency that compounds over time. That fitness goal you set? Abandoned during the first week when motivation waned. The business idea you were excited about? Forgotten when the initial enthusiasm faded. The skill you wanted to learn? Pushed aside when it became challenging and less enjoyable.

## Building Your Emotional Immunity System 💪

### Step 1: Recognize the Mood Trap

Start by becoming aware of when your mood is trying to hijack your plans. Throughout the day, pause and ask yourself:
- Am I about to change my plan because of how I feel right now?
- Is this decision based on logic or emotion?
- Will I regret not following through on my original intention?

### Step 2: Create Non-Negotiable Systems

Develop systems that remove decision-making from emotional moments:

**Morning Routine Automation** ⏰
Set up your morning routine so it runs on autopilot. Lay out clothes the night before, prepare breakfast ingredients, set multiple alarms. When your system is bulletproof, your mood becomes irrelevant.

**The Five-Minute Rule** ⏱️
Commit to doing any planned activity for just five minutes, regardless of how you feel. Often, starting is the hardest part, and momentum naturally builds from there.

**Implementation Intentions** 📝
Instead of vague goals like ""I'll exercise,"" create specific if-then plans: ""If it's 6 AM on a weekday, then I'll put on my workout clothes and head to the gym, regardless of how I feel.""

### Step 3: Reframe Your Relationship with Discomfort

Understand that discomfort and resistance are normal parts of growth. Instead of seeing negative emotions as stop signs, view them as speed bumps - temporary obstacles that don't require you to change direction.

## Practical Applications for Daily Life 🌟

### Career Advancement
- Attend networking events even when feeling socially drained
- Complete important projects during low-energy periods
- Have difficult conversations regardless of anxiety levels
- Maintain consistent work quality through emotional ups and downs

### Health and Fitness
- Exercise according to schedule, not energy levels
- Maintain healthy eating habits during stressful periods
- Keep regular sleep schedules regardless of weekend temptations
- Attend medical appointments even when feeling well

### Relationships
- Communicate important issues despite feeling uncomfortable
- Show up for friends and family regardless of personal mood
- Maintain relationship routines during busy or stressful times
- Practice forgiveness and understanding even when feeling hurt

### Personal Development
- Study or practice skills during unmotivated periods
- Read educational content instead of mindless entertainment
- Maintain journaling or reflection habits consistently
- Pursue long-term goals through inevitable enthusiasm dips

## The Compound Effect of Emotional Independence 📈

### Short-Term Benefits (Weeks to Months)
- Increased reliability and trustworthiness in others' eyes
- Better physical health through consistent habits
- Reduced anxiety about making decisions
- Improved self-confidence and self-respect

### Medium-Term Benefits (Months to Years)
- Significant progress toward major goals
- Stronger relationships built on dependability
- Enhanced professional reputation
- Greater resilience during challenging periods

### Long-Term Benefits (Years to Decades)
- Achievement of dreams that seemed impossible
- Deep sense of personal mastery and control
- Wisdom gained from consistent experience
- Legacy built through sustained effort

## Overcoming Common Obstacles 🚧

### ""But I Need to Honor My Feelings""
Honoring your feelings doesn't mean obeying them. You can acknowledge that you feel tired, anxious, or unmotivated while still choosing to act according to your values and commitments.

### ""This Seems Too Rigid""
Flexibility has its place, but it should be strategic, not impulsive. Build flexibility into your plans rather than using emotions as escape hatches.

### ""What About Mental Health?""
This approach actually supports mental health by creating stability and accomplishment. However, genuine mental health issues require professional attention - don't confuse temporary mood fluctuations with clinical conditions.

## Daily Implementation Strategies 🎯

### Morning Mental Preparation
Start each day by reviewing your planned activities and mentally committing to them regardless of how you feel. This psychological preparation creates a contract with yourself.

### Energy Management vs. Mood Management
Focus on managing your physical energy (through sleep, nutrition, and exercise) rather than trying to control your emotions. Good energy makes it easier to ignore negative moods.

### Progress Tracking
Keep a simple log of times you followed through despite negative emotions. This record becomes powerful evidence of your growing emotional independence.

### Celebration Rituals
Create small rewards for yourself when you successfully ignore mood-driven impulses. This positive reinforcement strengthens your new neural pathways.

## The Ripple Effect on Others 🌊

When you develop emotional independence, you become a stabilizing force for those around you. Colleagues know they can count on you, friends trust your consistency, and family members feel secure in your reliability. This dependability becomes one of your most valuable assets in all areas of life.

## Advanced Techniques for Mastery 🎓

### Emotional Surfing
Instead of fighting negative emotions, learn to surf them. Acknowledge their presence, observe their intensity, and continue with your planned actions while the emotion runs its course.

### The 10-10-10 Rule
When facing a mood-driven decision, ask yourself: ""How will I feel about this choice in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years?"" This perspective often clarifies the right action.

### Identity-Based Action
Instead of asking ""What do I feel like doing?"" ask ""What would the person I want to become do in this situation?"" This shifts focus from temporary emotions to lasting identity.

## Creating Your Personal Action Plan 📋

### Week 1-2: Awareness Building
Simply notice when your mood tries to derail your plans. No judgment, just observation.

### Week 3-4: Small Commitments
Choose one small daily habit and commit to doing it regardless of mood. Start with something manageable like drinking a glass of water upon waking.

### Month 2-3: Expanding the Practice
Add more areas where you'll ignore mood-driven impulses. Focus on one area at a time (fitness, work, relationships).

### Month 4-6: Integration
This practice should start feeling natural. You'll find yourself automatically questioning mood-driven impulses.

### Beyond 6 Months: Mastery
Emotional independence becomes your default operating system. You'll wonder how you ever lived at the mercy of your moods.

## The Ultimate Freedom 🕊️

True freedom isn't the ability to do whatever you feel like doing - that's slavery to your emotions. Real freedom is the power to choose your actions based on your values, goals, and commitments regardless of your current emotional state.

When you master this skill, you join the ranks of people who achieve extraordinary things not because they have extraordinary emotions, but because they've learned to act extraordinarily despite ordinary emotions.

Your mood will continue to fluctuate for the rest of your life - that's human nature. But your ability to succeed, contribute, and thrive doesn't have to depend on these fluctuations. You have the power to rise above the emotional rollercoaster and live with intention, purpose, and unwavering consistency.

The choice is yours: Will you be driven by the winds of emotion, or will you become the captain of your own ship, steering confidently toward your chosen destination regardless of the weather?

Start today. The next time your mood tries to negotiate with your plans, remember that you have the power to politely decline the negotiation and proceed with your original intention. Your future self will thank you for this decision countless times over.

---

*Remember: This isn't about suppressing emotions or becoming robotic. It's about developing the strength to act in alignment with your best interests even when you don't feel like it. This skill, once developed, becomes the foundation for every other success in your life.*

‎i am currently graduating college student', since first year ako i had a circle na puro guys—and yes, i'm one of the boys. they're actually nice and funny, i am comfortable with them pero syempre may mga katarantaduhan pa rin at sabay na sabay ako sa lahat ng trip nila as if i am a guy too lol. sanay na sanay na ako sa trip nila. tapos noong second year second sem nakabuo ako ng cof na puro babae dahil sa groupings—they're my past friends btw and yes nagre-friend ako sakanila kahit na we had misunderstanding before and paninira, plastikan, and now, we are in good terms kasi di naman ako nagtanim ng galit sakanila at wala ako ginawang masana sakanila kahit sobrang daming kwento ang nakarating saakin during that time, i just considered that situation as immaturity nalang lol—well, anyway, going back to the topic. i still hang out with guys lalo pag may inuman, however, minsan nakakatampo kasi magsi-send nalang sila sa gc ng videos or pictures na magkakasama sila sa coffee shop or kung saan mang gala. i feel like excluded na ako sakanila just bcs i hang out with girls na. as i have mentioned, sanay ako sa trip nila and my girl friends aren't used to their behavior bcs it is honestly annoying kapag hindi mo sila kilala deeply mapipikon ka talaga literal. and ewan ko ang awkward kapag pinipikon nila yung girl friends ko kasi nanahimik lang ako or nakikitawa. and these girl friends of mine are serious in terms of behavioral acts, manners, and schoolworks—which are opposite nung guy friends ko. ewan ko, nakakaramdam ako ng hiya sa guys friends ko kapag kino-call out sila dahil binibiro nga lang sila but they're always took it seriously parang nasa isip ko ""hayaan nyo na kasi ganyan talaga sila, nagbibiro lang naman sila di pa kayo nasanay."" and same din sa girls iniisip ko rin, ""hayaan nyo na may pagka-sensitive and pagka-maldita talaga sila pagdating sa mga ganyang behavior."" alam nyo yun parang gusto kong i-please yung both cof ko kasi parehas ko silang mahal at importante, kasi syempre i do have different personality and trip kapag kasama ko yung guy friends ko and ganon din sa girls kaya ayokong magkakasama kami sa iisang lugar kasi i feel like i have to shift different personalities (i am pretending? lol). tapos dahil sa feasibility study namin daming misunderstanding kasi kami nga lang ang madalas nakilos which is really annoying pero nawawala rin yung inis ko kapag natulong yung guys pero for my girl friends hindi nila na appreciate yung help and sacrifices din nung mga guy friends ko (we're in the same group, btw). tapos kanina yung pinaka-close ko sakanila told me that nag-aaya sila ng tagaytay sabi ko, ""sama ako."" tapos sabi nya, ""tara."" and nasa isip ko non baka sila sila lang kasi hindi naman binanggit sakin. and then, after class kanina, nag paalam na girl friends ko, so i decided na sasama ako sa guy friends ko tapos nag aayaan sila na magtagaytay using car, and i told them na sama ako sa tagaytay, and the other one told me that, ""ikaw tagaytay ka mag-isa."" eh kakakita ko lang na sumenyas sya as if he's driving a car and yon no one asks me if i want to join, tumawid sila and then no one called me to be there kaya umalis nalang ako at umuwi. plus, hindi ako nasama talaga kapag walang invite kasi kahit hindi nila ako iniinvite i am fully welcome at ramdam ko yon dahil sanay kami na ganon ang tratuhan kahit walang aya if u want to join go you can join, pero kanina it's just so different. it just triggers me na ang importante nila sakin tapos baka wala lang pala ako sakanila dahil maybe because nalayo na rin sila sakin dahil kahit hindi nila sabihin i know that they don't like my girl friends and perhaps they think that i am one of the girls they hated. ewan. feel ko ang babaw nito pero ano ba dapat kong gawin? i am pleasing my guy and girl friends? i feel like ang balimbing ko. i don't know what to do.  parang gusto ko nalang lumayo sa both cof ko.

1n7fmtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1n7fmtg/26m_trying_as_hard_as_i_can_but_nothing/,26m trying as hard as I can but nothing,"Hey everyone,
I just need to vent and maybe hear some outside perspective.

I have friends of both genders that I talk to every day. I try to stay positive, outgoing, supportive. I’m tall, go to the gym regularly, my face is meh but I do all the skincare I can without surgeries that change bone structure, as I can't afford it. Despite all that, I’ve never had any luck on the dating front.

On dating apps, it’s always the same. I rarely match, and when I do, girls will chat with me but completely avoid meeting. I’ll invite them for coffee and suddenly they’re “busy” for weeks. One even admitted she had nothing to do, but the second I asked to meet, she magically became unavailable.

I’ve only managed to have a good chat with three girls from apps in the last four months. Besides that, one girl I met a year ago seemed interested, but she was clearly after money, she always said she needed money for this and that. We drank together, cuddled a little, she asked if I had a wife, girlfriend, then if I've ever had a girlfriend and at last if I was a virgin. I didn’t lie, told her the truth, and she basically told me to leave after that. That still stings.

The truth is, I’ve never even kissed anyone. My friends don’t know. It feels shameful to admit as a man, so I just bury it. Each year it feels weirder, like a heavier weight on me.

I’ve had online connections through random chat sites too - great conversations, good chemistry, girls showing interest. But as soon as I sent a photo, all interest vanished. That crushed me even more.

Right now I’m talking to one girl from badoo who keeps making sex-related jokes (“my friend says the best way to lose weight is sex”, ""i have some weight to lose"" etc), but when I ask her later to meet for coffee she’s suddenly busy for weeks. It drives me crazy.

I’m honestly lost. I’ve gone out of my comfort zone, I’ve been trying for a long time, and yet I’ve never even had the chance for something as simple as a kiss. Meanwhile, I see other guys who can barely form a sentence, getting stares and interest just because they’re handsome. It feels so unfair.

I don’t even have standards. I just want a chance, an experience, something to build a ground on for my hopefully existing future experiences. Instead I feel invisible, ashamed, and stuck, I just don't know what to do.",2,1756908070.0,virgin,0,1.0,False

My bf (23) and I (21) had unprotected sex and I’m spiralling,"I’m spiraling over a possible pregnancy scare and need some reassurance. Back in mid-July I took Plan B (around July 8/9) because I was close to ovulation, which completely messed up my cycle. I had some early bleeding, but my “true” period came on July 10. Things finally regulated, and my next actual period started on August 17 and ended around the 21st. Fast forward to August 29 (Cycle Day 13), I had unprotected sex, he pulled out, but I know that’s not reliable. Then again on September 1 (Cycle Day 16), same situation. Now it’s September 3, and I’m panicking because I’ve got tender breasts, acne, bloating, constipation, and cramps. The thing is, these are also my usual PMS/ovulation symptoms, and I’ve been under extreme stress lately (panic attacks, barely any sleep, lots of coffee, eating poorly). I haven’t tested yet this cycle because it’s too early, but my next period should be due around September 14–18. 

Mind you, he pulled out and came roughly 15-30 seconds after and I also gave oral prior to every insertion (even between rounds). We tend to have unprotected sex more often than not because I’m mildly allergic to the lube on the outside of condoms (we’ve tried a few different brands) and he also can’t feel much with a condom on (my cervix is quite small and we can never seem to find the right size condom, either too big or small). 

TL;DR: Took Plan B in July, true period came July 10, next period Aug 17–21. Had unprotected sex Aug 29 and Sept 1 (pullout, no finish inside). Now I have PMS-like symptoms but am terrified it’s pregnancy. Period due Sept 14–18. When can I test for reliable results, and does this sound more like PMS/ovulation than pregnancy?

EDIT: Some people might say that this is super irresponsible of us and yes yes I know and understand. We’ve made sure to seek out other alternatives and firmly decided on no more unprotected sex 😅",1,1756908059.0,amipregnant,2,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I and I have been together for six months before him and I got together. He lived in a house with three roommates one of them being somebody he used to be intimate with. Since him and I have gotten together, it has been a problem that he has still been talking to her on the phone and texting her and specifically doing it when I’m not around. 

Nothing weird or anything to make me think he’s cheating… he’s with me everyday  at my house. His solution to the problem is I will just cut her off and stop talking to her if that’s what you want. At the end of the day I don’t want that because the girl did not do anything. I don’t want anybody to get hurt. I don’t expect him to stop talking to her because then I just look like a bad person and they did know each other before me.. that’s the easy route for him and not a real solution because he’s going to end up seeing her at the house and it’ll just cause more problems down the line. 

When they talk he says their friendship primarily is just her talking about her life and how she needs a friend and vise versus…. All the roommates are toxic and have no life experience so they depend on him to help them with everything (his words) He ended up going and getting coffee with her the other day after him and I got a huge argument because he was having phone calls with her again and I expressed that it made me feel very uncomfortable. I made him go stay at his own house this night and the next morning he broke down and she consoled him and they went and got coffee together because they are “just friends”. When I tried to set the boundary of saying, I don’t care if you guys are friends, but I do not want you guys to go out and do things one on one together he called me, narcissistic, manipulative, and controlling because I asked him to not go and do things with this woman that he used to be intimate with I never said that they could not hang out with each other as a collective group because the house he used to live in has roommates her being one of them. I’ve expressed that them talking on the phone when I’m not around also makes me uncomfortable, but I don’t want to be controlling and tell a man what he can and cannot do. Does it make me feel very uncomfortable yes. At this point in time I feel like I’ve just gotten used to the fact that these people her and my boyfriend normalizing this type of behavior and it’s starting to really frustrate me and upset me because I keep getting called crazy and jealous. She has called me jealous and so has he. Of course, I’m jealous when they used to be intimate with each other, but I’ve tried to be very kind and compassionate towards this situation because I don’t think it would be right for him to completely cut her off. His name is still on this lease and he still sees her and they consider each other “” friends. The part that’s really getting to me is that my boyfriend keeps saying that I’m controlling and manipulative because this makes me feel uncomfortable and I’m getting worn out at this point and it’s making me not like him anymore nor do I feel like I can trust him because he went behind my back and went and got coffee with this girl. A few days after all of this happened I sat down with him and I said why would you go do that when you knew I wouldn’t like it. He said I was very upset about the fight we got into so she can consold me. She’s just my friend. I didn’t look at it the way that you’re looking at it. I responded with I understand that she’s just your friend but why would you go do that when you knew I wouldn’t like it essentially he said I just didn’t think it would hurt you. But I understand why it did. I won’t do it anymore but proceeds to call me controlling. This is getting the point of being worn out and I’m so tired of my feeling being invalidated. How should I approach this problem when it comes up again because I know it will, I’m starting to think he’s a narcissist. I never have seen this side of him or has ever made me feel this way and it’s very painful. I’m also confused..  I’m so tired ",1,1756907820.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Im graduating with a chemical engineering PhD in spring 2026 (defense is planned for February!), and I'd like confirmation on how to go about my job search starting now.

I've put in a lot of effort to develop a strong network in my field of research over the course of my studies, but I could use some tips on the appropriate way to lean on that network to find job placements. 

As is, my plans are as follows:

-At the in-person conferences Im attending now, I plan on talking to people (PIs, company reps) during coffee breaks and social events, floating that Im graduating soon and interested in working with them

-Applying to positions through company websites as positions are posted for industry work

-Cold emailing professors with relevant research regarding post doc positions

-Asking PIs in my network via email/in person if they know of opportunities or could ask around for me

-Looking for PIs in my network with industry connections and asking those PIs for introductions to their industry connections (this would also primarily happen over email, but in person when possible)

My primary concern is getting a job that pays decently (decent pay is, at least, a livable wage that allows me to pay off my loans to the tune of some extra $1K per month). Relocation, exact industry, specific job tasks, etc. are all negotiable as far as Im concerned. 

I would *prefer* to work in industry, but I would accept a post doc before leaving myself unemployed. 

Is there anything else I can be doing? 

Is there any etiquette I should be aware of? Specifically, is it looked down upon or seen as desperate if I straight up say ""Im graduating and want to work for you""? Or is this something that I shouldn't be blunt about and should, instead, be coy and say things like ""Ill be graduating this year and your work aligns well with my interests and skillset""?

I would be happy to take any and all tips people have for how to lean on your network for finding work. I absolutely *have* a network, but leaning on it for work connections is a first for me, and obviously Im nervous. 

I would also appreciate it if anyone was willing to tell me their timeline of PhD graduation to first job and the general efforts put in for the outcome!

1. Treat coffee with respect
Coffee is not water. Stop pounding it at 5pm and wondering why you’re staring at the ceiling at 2am. Be strategic, not chaotic.

2. Mind-map your classes
Before lectures pile up, grab a sheet and map out each course + big topics. Turns your brain into a spider web of connections instead of a random soup of notes. And yes, there’s science that says it boosts memory.


3. Build buffer time
Stop scheduling life like you’re a robot. Add 10–15 min cushions between things. That way, when class runs late or you spiral on a calc problem, you don’t nuke your whole day.


4. Change your scenery
Your bed is for sleep, not essays. Rotate in a café, library, or even a park bench. New environment = new focus, and you’ll dodge the “oh look my fridge again” problem.




5. Track your time like a nerdy wizard 🪄
Don’t just hope you’re studying enough — track it. I started using Studentheon (it’s free) and it legit changed the game. You hit start on a Pomodoro timer, and it spits out stats/graphs of how much you actually worked. Wildly motivating to see “wow, I actually studied 30 hours this week” instead of just vibes.

In the end there wasn't much that we didn't enjoy, most was absolutely amazing, but the Atlanterhavsvegen (Atlantic Ocean Road) was one we did feel it was overrated and a bit of a tourist trap. We went there on our way from near Runde island to Trondheim and were left unimpressed. It was a very short area, you could of course not stop just anywhere to take in the views and the places you could stop were tourist traps with overpriced (even for Norwegian standards) coffee, ice cream and pastries.

Don't get me wrong: I don't feel it was a waste of our time, because life is all about ups and downs and the lesser experiences make the better experiences even better so to speak. But I do feel that if anyone is planning their trip, it's definitely not worth driving this road specifically.

We've had similar to much nicer roads and views in and around Runde Island, Fosnavåg and Ålesund all without the loads of tourists surrounding you, just to name one area. Also: when you're already driving with your (rental) car from place to place, you're more likely to come across other stunning features just by accident anyway. For example: we encountered and drove the extremely beautiful Vikafjellsvegen with tons of beautiful views during many kilometers and many different viewpoints with mountains, lakes, villages all coming into view at various stages. Or while also touristy but much more quiet and for us a total coincidence that we'd be driving there: Langfoss waterfall with a very nice view over the fjord/lake there as well and even a hiking option close by.

For us, going further North the Atlanterhavsvegen added around 1,5 hours to our trip time and we felt that large parts of that detour weren't special at all and only a small stretch for like 20-30 km was nice but also not the greatest. It might've been all the hype since we've seen lots and lots of websites noting this as one of the top scenic items in Norway, but we definitely don't agree.

So apart from this being a tip for anyone considering going there, how do others who went there feel about it? Do you feel the same as we did? And how about Norwegians themselves, I'm guessing for you guys it's also not that special, right? 

As a final note: I understand this post might feel a bit negative, but trust me when I say we had an absolute blast in Norway and would rate our holiday 11/10 if that's possible.

Testing the Sony WH-CH520/CZ IN headphones over the past several weeks has been an interesting experience. These wireless on-ear headphones promise a lot—long battery life, natural sound quality adjustments, and great usability. Did they deliver? For the most part, yes, but like anything else in life, there are some things you should know before throwing these into your cart.

**Design and Comfort**

The lightweight plastic design immediately stood out when I unboxed these headphones. At just 5.2 ounces, wearing them for extended periods was a breeze. The adjustable headband and soft ear pads made sure they didn't feel tight or awkward on my head, even during all-day work-from-home marathons. I wore them while cleaning, gaming, and even during a sweaty outdoor run—although, note, they aren’t water-resistant. This means you might be flirting with danger if you take them out in wet conditions. They look sleek with their angular yet rounded ear cup design, though some might say they feel a little too plasticky for their price point.

**Audio Performance**

Here’s where the Sony WH-CH520 headphones show their strengths. The dynamic drivers paired with Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) technology delivered pretty clean and crisp audio. High frequencies felt nuanced, and subtle details in quieter tracks were surprisingly noticeable. 

I tested the sound customization offered via the Sony Headphones Connect app, and it’s intuitive to tweak the EQ settings to match your personal taste. Whether I was binge-watching thrillers, blasting EDM workouts, or mellowing out with acoustics, the sound felt consistent and well-balanced. However, if you’re an audiophile looking for eardrum-shaking bass, these may fall short. 

[Check Sony WH-CH520/CZ IN price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b0bzpk3xfq/)

**Battery Life That Doesn’t Quit**

This is one area where these headphones truly shine. Sony boasts a whopping 50-hour battery life, and honestly, it’s every bit as great as it sounds. I ran them for three days straight (on and off, of course) before needing to charge. Even better, the fast-charging feature is an absolute lifesaver. A quick three-minute charge provided about 90 minutes of playback, which means even if they die mid-Netflix binge, you’re back in action in no time. Just make sure you have a USB-C charger handy since they didn’t include a wall adapter in the box.

**Voice and Call Features**

During calls, the built-in microphone and noise-cancellation capabilities held up fairly well. I tried this feature in a noisy coffee shop, and the noise reduction worked decently to let the person on the other end hear me instead of the background espresso machine. Taking calls is made ridiculously easy with simple earcup buttons, which is great if you tend to lose your phone at the bottom of your backpack every time it rings.

**Positives**

- Extremely lightweight for all-day comfort
- Up to 50 hours of battery life with quick-charge capabilities
- Reliable sound quality with adjustable EQ settings
- Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity provides a solid 10-meter range
- Easy pairing with Swift Pair and Fast Pair features
- Integrated voice control for hands-free operation  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Plastic build might feel a bit cheap to some users
- Lack of water-resistance means you can’t use them in damp environments
- Bass performance may not satisfy hardcore audiophiles
- No wall charger in the box  

**Peer Products**

Comparing these to some competitors in the on-ear wireless category, the Sony WH-CH520 holds up well in terms of battery life and comfort. Products like JBL’s offerings in a similar price range lean slightly more toward bass-heavy sound profiles but lack the same level of battery efficiency. Meanwhile, premium models from Beats deliver a bit more aesthetic polish and sound clarity but at significantly higher prices.

Against budget competitors, these headphones push ahead. Many cheaper models might offer gimmicky features like flashing lights but fall woefully short in sound fidelity and durability. Here, you get most of the essentials without glaring compromises, though it’s worth weighing priorities like build quality versus performance.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

These headphones provide excellent bang for the buck. While the plastic material might leave some wishing for a more premium build, the trade-off comes in the form of impressive performance features often seen in pricier models: powerful battery life, reliable sound quality, easy operability, and solid app integration. Rarely do on-ear headphones in this range combine such comfort with this level of thoughtful engineering. Whether you prioritize casual listening, work calls, or gaming sessions, you'll find they stretch your dollar quite far.

2 months ago, I launched [**postscheduler.co**](http://postscheduler.co) — a bulk social media scheduling tool that lets you post to 10 platforms at once in seconds. Upload a folder, set timings, done.

Today:

* 1 paying customer
* $16 MRR
* Countless hours explaining to my friends that “yes, people really pay for this… sometimes.”

Not life-changing money. Actually, not much money at all. But somehow, someone out there wants something that’s basically just me, my laptop, and way too much coffee.

The irony? I built this because other schedulers already exist, and I thought, *you know what the world needs? ANOTHER scheduler.*

Turns out… maybe it does.

I've been planning to get one of those machines (Dermadry probably), so I hope it's useful for managing the sweat. Any tips that can help so I can still have coffee and not sweat so much?",3,1756907239.0,Hyperhidrosis,0,1.0,False
1n7fa2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1n7fa2o/should_you_choose_the_best_electric_kettle/,Should you choose the best electric kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy,"Testing out the ZWILLING 53105-100-0 has been a delightful experience for someone like me who thrives on precision in the kitchen. The sleek design instantly caught my eye; it’s truly a modern appliance that manages to elevate any countertop. I believe aesthetics matter, and this kettle blends form with function seamlessly. Everything from its polished, double-walled stainless steel body to the ergonomic handle feels thoughtfully designed. It has the kind of finish that resists fingerprints—a small victory for anyone, like me, who dreads constant cleaning. 

**Ease of Use and Feature Highlights**  
Setting it up for the first time was straightforward, even without glancing at the manual. The kettle boasts a double-walled body, which not only keeps the water hot longer but stays cool to the touch, which is especially important for households with kids. I tested this feature multiple times and can confirm it works wonderfully; no accidental burns here! The 70° lid opening is another nifty design element. It eliminates that dreaded moment of confronting a faceful of steam every time you open a boiling kettle.

**Performance and Temperature Control**  
During testing, boiling water felt impossibly fast with this device. I was preparing tea, coffee, and even hot cocoa on a busy morning, and this kettle didn’t miss a beat. For tea aficionados, the ZWILLING kettle’s precision stood out, particularly its ability to heat water to exact temperatures. I experimented with green tea, which requires less heat than black tea, and the kettle’s four temperature settings came through perfectly. I also loved the 30-minute keep-warm function. Think of those moments when you pour a cup, realize you forgot something, and come back to lukewarm disappointment—this kettle solves that problem.

**Good Points**  
- The double-wall construction keeps water hot while ensuring the exterior stays cool.  
- Cleaning is a breeze with its seamless stainless steel design; there are no pesky crevices.  
- Its app compatibility with the ZWILLING Culinary World App is innovative for recipe guidance.  
- The 70° lid effectively keeps you safe from steam burns.  

**Bad Points**  
- The inclusion of manual temperature settings would offer even more versatility.  
- Its 1-liter capacity might come off as slightly limited for larger families. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Living with this kettle daily, I really came to understand the importance of thoughtful engineering. This thing is seriously sturdy yet lightweight, weighing in at under 3 pounds. The powder-coated silver finish feels professional, and the heat-insulated materials ensure durability. One thing I noticed was the quality of the handle—ergonomic but robust enough to give you full control without slipping. While the 1-liter capacity works great for a single person or small family, it might require extra boils for larger groups.

**Competing Products**  
To give you some context, I compared this with a couple of market rivals like the Breville IQ Kettle and Cuisinart’s Perfectemp Electric Kettle. Both competitors lean towards higher capacities and a broader range of temperature controls. However, the ZWILLING 53105-100-0 narrowly edges them out with its superior build and innovative safety features, such as the double-wall design that eliminates exterior hot surfaces. While the Breville unit offers more options, it’s generally bulkier and trickier to clean. For me, functionality without hassle wins every time.

**Quality for Price**  
This kettle feels high-end, and honestly, its pricing reflects that. While it may not land in the “budget-friendly” category, every penny seems to go toward features and design enhancements that justify its value. If you appreciate a premium aesthetic combined with efficiency and safety, it’s a no-brainer. However, if you’re someone purely seeking capacity over features, you might be tempted by less expensive alternatives that focus on size rather than functionality.

‎i am currently graduating college student, since first year ako i had a circle na puro guys—and yes, i'm one of the boys. they're actually nice and funny, i am comfortable with them pero syempre may mga katarantaduhan pa rin at sabay na sabay ako sa lahat ng trip nila as if i am a guy too lol. sanay na sanay na ako sa trip nila. tapos noong second year second sem nakabuo ako ng cof na puro babae dahil sa groupings—they're my past friends btw and yes nagre-friend ako sakanila kahit na we had misunderstanding before and paninira, plastikan, and now, we are in good terms kasi di naman ako nagtanim ng galit sakanila at wala ako ginawang masana sakanila kahit sobrang daming kwento ang nakarating saakin during that time, i just considered that situation as immaturity nalang lol—well, anyway, going back to the topic. i still hang out with guys lalo pag may inuman, however, minsan nakakatampo kasi magsi-send nalang sila sa gc ng videos or pictures na magkakasama sila sa coffee shop or kung saan mang gala. i feel like excluded na ako sakanila just bcs i hang out with girls na. as i have mentioned, sanay ako sa trip nila and my girl friends aren't used to their behavior bcs it is honestly annoying kapag hindi mo sila kilala deeply mapipikon ka talaga literal. and ewan ko ang awkward kapag pinipikon nila yung girl friends ko kasi nanahimik lang ako or nakikitawa. and these girl friends of mine are serious in terms of behavioral acts, manners, and schoolworks—which are opposite nung guy friends ko. ewan ko, nakakaramdam ako ng hiya sa guys friends ko kapag kino-call out sila dahil binibiro nga lang sila but they're always took it seriously parang nasa isip ko ""hayaan nyo na kasi ganyan talaga sila, nagbibiro lang naman sila di pa kayo nasanay."" and same din sa girls iniisip ko rin, ""hayaan nyo na may pagka-sensitive and pagka-maldita talaga sila pagdating sa mga ganyang behavior."" alam nyo yun parang gusto kong i-please yung both cof ko kasi parehas ko silang mahal at importante, kasi syempre i do have different personality and trip kapag kasama ko yung guy friends ko and ganon din sa girls kaya ayokong magkakasama kami sa iisang lugar kasi i feel like i have to shift different personalities (i am pretending? lol). tapos dahil sa feasibility study namin daming misunderstanding kasi kami nga lang ang madalas nakilos which is really annoying pero nawawala rin yung inis ko kapag natulong yung guys pero for my girl friends hindi nila na appreciate yung help and sacrifices din nung mga guy friends ko (we're in the same group, btw). tapos kanina yung pinaka-close ko sakanila told me that nag-aaya sila ng tagaytay sabi ko, ""sama ako."" tapos sabi nya, ""tara."" and nasa isip ko non baka sila sila lang kasi hindi naman binanggit sakin. and then, after class kanina, nag paalam na girl friends ko, so i decided na sasama ako sa guy friends ko tapos nag aayaan sila na magtagaytay using car, and i told them na sama ako sa tagaytay, and the other one told me that, ""ikaw tagaytay ka mag-isa."" eh kakakita ko lang na sumenyas sya as if he's driving a car and yon no one asks me if i want to join, tumawid sila and then no one called me to be there kaya umalis nalang ako at umuwi. plus, hindi ako nasama talaga kapag walang invite kasi kahit hindi nila ako iniinvite i am fully welcome at ramdam ko yon dahil sanay kami na ganon ang tratuhan kahit walang aya if u want to join go you can join, pero kanina it's just so different. it just triggers me na ang importante nila sakin tapos baka wala lang pala ako sakanila dahil maybe because nalayo na rin sila sakin dahil kahit hindi nila sabihin i know that they don't like my girl friends and perhaps they think that i am one of the girls they hated. ewan. feel ko ang babaw nito pero ano ba dapat kong gawin? i am pleasing my guy and girl friends? i feel like ang balimbing ko. i don't know what to do.  parang gusto ko nalang lumayo sa both cof ko.

If you’re curious about how many calories are in your favorite frothy treat, you’re not alone.**

Mocha coffee blends the rich, robust flavor of espresso with the creamy sweetness of chocolate, making it a tempting choice for coffee lovers everywhere. But have you ever stopped to think about what’s really inside that cup? Understanding the calorie content of your mocha can be an eye-opener, especially if you’re watching your calorie intake.

Dive into this article to uncover the truth behind your beloved mocha coffee and learn how it fits into your daily diet. You might be surprised by what you find!

# Mocha Coffee Basics

Exploring the calorie content of a mocha coffee can guide your dietary choices. A typical mocha coffee contains around 200-400 calories, depending on ingredients like milk, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Adjusting these elements offers a way to enjoy your coffee while managing calorie intake.

Mocha Coffee Basics Mocha coffee is a delightful blend of rich espresso, creamy milk, and luscious chocolate. This popular beverage caters to both coffee and chocolate lovers, offering the best of both worlds. But have you ever wondered how many calories are hidden in this tasty treat?

# Ingredients Breakdown

The ingredients of a mocha coffee are simple yet indulgent. Typically, a standard mocha includes: – Espresso: A concentrated coffee brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. It’s the base of your mocha. – Steamed Milk: Adds creaminess and balance to the strong espresso flavor. – Chocolate Syrup or Cocoa Powder: This is where the sweetness comes in, transforming a regular latte into a mocha. – Whipped Cream (optional): A finishing touch that can add extra calories if you’re not careful. Each ingredient contributes differently to the total calorie count. The chocolate syrup, for instance, is often the main calorie contributor. Have you ever thought about how the choice of chocolate can affect the calorie content?

# Types Of Mocha Coffee

Mocha coffee isn’t a one-size-fits-all drink. There are variations that can tweak both the flavor and calorie content: – Classic Mocha: The standard version with espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate syrup. – White Chocolate Mocha: Uses white chocolate instead of regular chocolate, often leading to a sweeter taste. – Iced Mocha: Perfect for warm days, this version replaces steamed milk with cold milk and is served over ice. – Skinny Mocha: Made with skim milk and sugar-free chocolate syrup to cut down on calories. If you’re watching your calorie intake, a skinny mocha might be your go-to choice. But does it still satisfy your mocha cravings, or do you prefer to indulge in a classic version? Mocha coffee offers a rich and satisfying experience, whether you’re sipping on a classic or experimenting with variations. Understanding the basics and knowing your options can help you enjoy this drink while keeping an eye on the calories.

# Caloric Content

If you’ve ever wondered why your favorite mocha coffee feels like a treat, the answer might lie in its caloric content. Understanding how many calories are in your mocha can help you make informed choices about your coffee habits. Whether you’re watching your waistline or simply curious, a closer look at the calories in a mocha can be quite enlightening.

# Standard Mocha Calories

A standard mocha typically comprises espresso, steamed milk, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Each ingredient adds its own share of calories. A regular-sized mocha, say around 12 ounces, can contain approximately 250 to 400 calories. The variation often depends on the milk and chocolate used. Whole milk and regular chocolate syrup tend to be more calorific compared to skim milk and sugar-free alternatives.

Think about your usual order. Does it include extra syrup or toppings? Each addition can subtly increase the calorie count. Next time you sip your mocha, remember it’s not just the taste you’re enjoying, but a calorie-rich blend.

# Variations And Their Impact

Mocha coffee comes in a delightful range of variations. You might choose almond milk over dairy, or opt for dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. These choices can significantly impact the caloric content. Almond milk generally has fewer calories than whole milk, offering a lighter option for those mindful of their intake.

Consider trying sugar-free syrups or skipping the whipped cream. These simple tweaks can save you calories without compromising the coffee’s essence. As you experiment with different mochas, you’ll notice how these adjustments affect the overall calorie count.

Have you ever thought about how your coffee preferences influence your daily calorie consumption? Next time you order, weigh your choices. You might discover a new favorite that aligns better with your dietary goals.

# Factors Affecting Calorie Count

When savoring a delicious mocha coffee, you might wonder how many calories you’re sipping. The answer isn’t straightforward, as several factors can affect the calorie count. From the type of milk you choose to the sweeteners and syrups added, each element plays a significant role in determining how indulgent your mocha coffee becomes. Let’s dive into these factors and see how they influence your coffee’s calorie content.

Is there anything I can try?","I'll start off by saying that I currently take Magnesium glycinate, vitamin D+K2, Iron & Vit C. I also have a chronic dissociative disorder of almost 10 years which makes me feel like my life is an out of body experience - and since onset, many things have gone from bad to worse over time with my body/lifestyle. I also went for a sleep study for the possibility of sleep apnea within the last couple of years, which was negative. 

The dissociative disorder I have can take a massive toll on the nervous system, and like many things this may be making it worse; however there doesn't seem to be a pattern here.  Speaking only of the sleep issues - sometimes for weeks on end I will be fine and can get through a whole day, I sleep for 8-9 hours at night and that will be all.

Sometimes I will be beyond exhausted in the daytime, and even in the morning within hours of waking up from an unbroken sleep. I wouldn't say I ever actually feel rested from any length of sleep I get, but the tiredness and exhaustion I suddenly feel before I end up passing out from anywhere between an hour or two in the day, offers no option for me to control it. And then perhaps a few days later it won't happen again for weeks.

I do exercise and go to the gym 4-5 times a week doing weight training, plenty of walking and a balanced diet. I'm also able to go without caffeine, but usually have 2-3 teas or coffee's a day at a maximum, this is especially needed when feeling exhausted and there is a need to stay awake.

In that short amount of time, I faced immense burnout doing the work of 2-3 people with no recognition. I cried more at that job than any of the other jobs combined. The building had a special room where crying is common, and I would see my coworkers rant to supervisors and cry, but obviously nothing was done about it. HR was useless. 

My first supervisor was cool and understood that I was training and said it usually takes 6 months to a year to fully understand the job. Sadly he got promoted and his replacement made my life miserable. 

Each accounting clerk has their own store locations and within 3-4 months I had 4 stores to cover. My previous boss only had 2, and any excess work she was supposed to do, she would pass it off to me and my colleagues. We always had a quota to reach and we would get pulled into that room if we weren’t putting in 100% everyday.

Well I became her target. Before her promotion she would always pull me aside and give me “tips” like when I would joke about things she told me to be more feminine and “read the room” all while joking about how she can tell I used to work around men. 

My 90 days at this point was coming up and from what I knew everyone got a raise. My boss kept making excuses, we didn’t have time, we’ll do it in a couple weeks, etc. One time she even said she got coffee on my paperwork, whatever. Two months later, our systems were down and so right then and there I’m like “we have time now”. 

I was denied a raise over two mistakes I made after the 90-day period. Make that make sense. I was already doing the work of two people every day, with zero acknowledgment, and that was the thanks I got. I also got threatened a write up at that review if I made a mistake again. 

So I started putting in minimal effort, aka just my job. I stopped helping others with their work, I stopped offering up my time. I just came in, did my work and gone home all while applying for new jobs. My boss noticed this. 

You’d think “wow she did so much work it’s taking a toll on me maybe I should treat her better”. No…

I got pulled and got a write up over it. She said “we noticed your effort has gone down since your review. I know not getting a raise sucks but that doesn’t excuse not helping the team. I flat out told her that if I’m doing such a bad job then why would they put extra work on me? She shut up. 

She ended up moving my desk next to hers so that she can see everything I do. She’d do petty things, like on my break I got out my phone and she nagged me that it was out. I had to remind her it was my break. 

I got sick of the micromanaging and I had an interview and the day I got an offer I said peace out. When I told her I needed to “talk” she had me sit down with head of HR. She didn’t know I was going to put in my notice so I wondered why she wanted HR to be there. Should’ve seen her face when I made her read my resignation letter. 

After I left a previous coworker reached out to me saying my ex boss quit due to being “overwhelmed”, two weeks after I left.

I've tried using the LEAP method to encourage him to keep up with his meds and psychiatrist appointments. So far, that has helped.

The problem is that a lot of his delusions and insecurities are directed at me. He thinks im one of the undercover agents, and that im working with a team that is trying to kill him. I work from home, and he thinks that every email I send is a secret code plotting his end. It's a lot. I've tried to use LEAP for this as well, but it doesn't work.

Here’s the backstory:

I kept realizing how much money I (and friends around me) were burning on *forgotten subscriptions*. The worst offender? I found out I’d been paying for a yoga app since 2024… and never opened it once. That was over $200 down the drain before I even noticed.

And it’s not just me.  
Every small online business owner and AI founder I talk to says the same thing:

* Buying dozens of SaaS tools.
* Losing track of free trials.
* Random $19/month charges sneaking onto the credit card.

For 2 months, I lived inside VS Code, and EXPO GO, and way too much coffee. I wanted to build a tool that:

* Tracks every subscription in one place.
* Sends reminders before payments hit.
* Warns when free trials are about to end.
* Gives analytics and a budget view so you can *see* where your money’s going.
* Even integrates with a calendar so you don’t get blindsided by renewals.

It’s been… exhausting.  
I had days where I thought no one would ever care.  
Days where I thought maybe I was just building for myself.

But today… someone else believed in it enough to pay.  
My **second sale**.

It’s tiny in the grand scheme.  
But for me? It feels massive.  
Because it means this pain point is *real* and the problem is worth solving.

I’m sharing this here because I know many of you are on the same journey — trying to build something from scratch, doubting if anyone will care, wondering if the late nights are worth it.

If you’re in that boat, here’s my takeaway:  
Don’t underestimate the power of solving your *own* frustrations. Chances are thousands of others are living the exact same pain.

I’m beyond thrilled right now. And grateful.

Anna Nagar is not just another neighborhood in Chennai; it is a dynamic marketplace that attracts a diverse audience. The area is home to affluent families, working professionals, students, and entrepreneurs—each group active on social platforms.

# 1. High Competition

From **cafés on 2nd Avenue** to **fitness centers in Shanthi Colony**, businesses in Anna Nagar face stiff competition. Without professional social media management, it’s easy to get lost in the noise.

# 2. Digital-First Audience

Residents of Anna Nagar are highly tech-savvy. They look up businesses online before making purchase decisions. A strong, engaging online presence is no longer optional—it’s mandatory.

# 3. Local Opportunities

Anna Nagar businesses can leverage **hyperlocal targeting** to reach customers in nearby neighborhoods such as Mogappair, Kilpauk, and Ayanavaram. Expert social media handlers create campaigns designed for this regional market.

# 4. Festival & Seasonal Campaigns

Chennai’s festivals like **Pongal, Deepavali, and Navratri** present opportunities for creative campaigns. A local handler understands how to align content with cultural trends to maximize engagement.

# Core Services Offered in Social Media Management

A professional agency or freelance social media handler in Anna Nagar typically provides the following services:

* **Content Strategy & Planning** – Monthly calendars aligned with brand goals.
* **Graphic & Video Creation** – Professionally designed posts, reels, and ads.
* **Copywriting & Hashtags** – Engaging captions with SEO-driven hashtags.
* **Paid Ad Management** – Running targeted ad campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
* **Influencer Marketing** – Collaborations with Chennai-based influencers.
* **Community Management** – Responding to queries and building relationships.
* **Performance Analytics** – Monthly reports on reach, engagement, and conversions.  
* **How Local Expertise Makes a Difference**

For businesses in Anna Nagar, success on social media isn’t just about having great visuals or trendy hashtags. It’s about **understanding the community, the culture, and the lifestyle of the people who live and shop here**. While global marketing strategies may look impressive, they often miss the **local heartbeat**.

That’s where local expertise comes in—ensuring campaigns are not only creative but also deeply relevant.

# 1. Cultural Connection

In Chennai, festivals and traditions are not just occasions—they’re emotional touchpoints that influence how people shop, eat, and celebrate.

* **Festival-Driven Campaigns:** A Pongal thali offer at a restaurant, a Deepavali “Glow Package” at a salon, or Navratri shopping reels at a boutique resonate more strongly than generic “Holiday Sale” posts.
* **Local Celebrations:** Even smaller events, like college cultural fests or temple gatherings, can be tied into campaigns to feel authentic.
* **Language & Tone:** Adding Tanglish or Tamil phrases gives a campaign warmth and relatability.

 *Example:* A clothing store in Anna Nagar West ran a Pongal reel where staff wore traditional veshti and saree, captioned *“Pongal ku ready ah? Our festive fits are here!”* The post felt like part of the celebration, not just a sales pitch.

# 2. Location-Based Promotions

Local expertise means knowing where your customers spend their time and how to **geo-target ads** for maximum impact.

* **Neighborhood Hotspots:** Ads can be customized for people who visit **Anna Nagar Roundtana, Shanthi Colony, 2nd Avenue, or Tower Park**. These areas are social hubs, and campaigns linked to them feel instantly relatable.
* **Nearby Localities:** Customers from Mogappair, Kilpauk, or Ayanavaram frequently shop in Anna Nagar. Geo-fenced ads ensure your brand reaches them too.
* **Footfall to Store:** Instead of wasting ad spend on the whole of Chennai, local targeting makes sure promotions drive **walk-ins and real customers**.

 *Example:* A café on 2nd Avenue promoted a “Happy Hours” offer only to people within a 5 km radius of Anna Nagar. The campaign doubled footfall during weekday evenings.

# 3. Trend Adaptation

Social media is driven by trends—but what works in Delhi or Mumbai doesn’t always click in Chennai. A local expert knows how to **adapt trends with a Chennai twist**.

* **Slang & Humor:** Captions with local slang like *“Chumma oru coffee vibes da”* or references to Tamil cinema grab attention.
* **Local Memes:** Turning trending meme formats into **Anna Nagar lifestyle jokes** makes content instantly shareable.
* **Festive Music & Filters:** Using Tamil film songs or Chennai-based trending audios for reels increases relatability and virality.

*Example:* A gym near Tower Park used the trending “Pushpa movie dialogue” audio but reworked it for fitness content: *“Anna Nagar la gym ku pogala na… Thaggede Le!”* The reel went viral among locals because it blended a national trend with Chennai humor.

1n7ew3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n7ew3a/explore_best_singleserve_espresso_machine/,Explore Best Single-Serve Espresso Machine Breville Delivers,"Compact coffee makers have always intrigued me, but the Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine stood out instantly with its sleek design and promises of convenience. Described as minimalist yet powerful, I was eager to test if it lived up to the hype. After a couple of weeks using this machine daily, I have a mix of experiences to share—from sipping exceptional espresso every morning to noting quirks other reviewers also mentioned.

**Sleek and Space-Saving Design**

The first thing anyone would notice about this espresso machine is its small footprint. At just 3.3 inches in depth, 8 inches wide, and 12.9 inches high, the compact size makes it ideal for even the tiniest of kitchens. I placed it snugly on my crowded countertop, wedged between a blender and a spice rack, and it didn’t feel intrusive at all. Its matte black finish blends beautifully with modern kitchen aesthetics, giving it a sophisticated vibe. It’s obvious the focus was on functionality and a clean design, which I appreciate.  

[Find the best price for Breville BEC250BLK1AUC1 on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b073zht2fm/)

**Performance and Espresso Quality**

This machine’s ability to pull an espresso shot or a lungo with just a press of a button was genuinely impressive. It heats up rapidly, and I clocked its preparation time at under 30 seconds—ideal for rushed mornings. As someone particular about coffee consistency, I was satisfied that the 19-bar high-pressure pump delivered rich and creamy shots every time. Paired with the included milk frother for a cappuccino or a latte, it felt like a café experience without stepping outside. The quality rivals mid-range machines that I’ve tried before, though the specific Nespresso pods are a non-negotiable for this device, limiting coffee variety to Nespresso options unless third-party hacks come into play.

**User-Friendliness**

Brewing coffee is straightforward with this device. The two-programmable cup sizes, espresso and lungo, offer flexibility in strength and flavor. Despite being fully automatic and button-operated, cleaning it is surprisingly hassle-free. The removable parts—capsule container, drip base, and water tank—make it simple to rinse and dry. Here's something I didn't expect to enjoy this much—the automatic shut-off feature, which kicks in after nine minutes of inactivity. It’s reassuring for forgetful folks (like me) who rush out without thinking twice.  

**Highlights**

- Compact design suitable for tight spaces  
- Simple button-based operation  
- High-pressure pump ensures delicious crema  
- Quick heat-up time under 30 seconds  
- Automatic energy-saving mode for efficiency  

**Drawbacks**

- Limited to Nespresso-compatible coffee pods  
- Noisy compared to some other machines I’ve tested  
- Smaller water tank (20.3 fl oz) needs frequent refills  
- Milk frother takes additional space, negating its compact benefits for some  

**Competing Options**

Stacking it against similar single-serve espresso machines, like the Keurig K-Supreme or the De’Longhi Dedica, there are notable pros and cons. While the Essenza Mini beats them with its compact size and superior espresso quality, others often offer more pod compatibility or customizable coffee brewing. De’Longhi’s Dedica, for instance, is quieter and allows the use of ground coffee alongside pods—which is a dealbreaker for coffee aficionados seeking variety. The Essenza Mini caters to a niche group prioritizing space-saving design and effortless operation but feels less versatile than its competitors.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**

This is where opinions can be divisive. If you’re only brewing one or two cups a day, the machine feels like money well spent. Its consistent performance and convenience justify its place in any coffee lover’s kitchen. However, the recurring pod expenses and the occasional need for descaling (especially if you live in a hard-water area) may offset initial savings. That said, Breville and Nespresso do make it tempting with their included capsule welcome kit—it’s a thoughtful gesture to help users kickstart their coffee journey.

So this first part of the story will be kinda from my pov before finding everything out. a few weeks back, i started dating a guy from my hometown. i’m in college now and live about 5 hours away from home, but this guy and i were willing to put in the effort required for a long distance relationship. we shared attraction for each other in high school. after he got out of his last relationship that was really hard for him, he reached out to me. we started dating about two weeks ago, which i know is a short time, but i’m unfortunately known for rushing into things that seem too good to be true. everything was amazing. we were facetiming every morning and night. i went back home for a weekend and that friday he took me on the most amazing date ever. he bought me flowers, got me my favorite coffee, made me a basket of fuzzy socks and all the candies that i love. he even made me candied pecans because i wasnt able to get them at the gas station i usually stop at on the way up. then we went back to his house (that he owns) and watched both of our favorite movies, and then he made me dinner. filet fucking mignon! it felt perfect. sunday, when i was leaving to come back to college, he said that he realized he just wasn’t ready for anything too serious and didn’t wanna hurt me but wanted to be honest. i greatly appreciated that. so we didn’t talk for a whole 3 days, and he reached back out to me again. i ended up going back home the next weekend for labor day and to spend time with him. it was once again amazing, everything i ever wanted. and we also had all the big talks about our possible future together. then, when i left yesterday (monday) the same thing happened. he cut things off saying that he wasn’t ready. i let him know that i couldn’t keep doing the back and forth and that the next time he reaches out he better actually be ready, but to take all the time he needs. he apologizes again and says that next time he comes back, it’ll be for good. so i leave it at that until around midnight last night when i get a message from his ex that he recently split up with.

this is the fun part. turns out, he had been dating me and still talking and sleeping with her the entire time. including the short amount of time i wasnt at his house this past weekend to spend time with my family. his ex informs me of all of this and tells me that he said that our relationship means nothing to him. that he’s just using me to get over her and it’s not working.

the real kicker is, he had told me that things with this girl was serious. like he had bought a ring serious. but he didn’t want her in his life anymore. he wanted me. ofc all of that was a lie because, (according to the ex and confirmed by him) the day after we started dating, he showed up at her doorstep and proposed to her. she said no ofc and he came back to me.

i’m at the point where i just don’t even know what to say. i’m in utter disbelief. i blocked him on everything. i didn’t argue, didn’t ask why or what he was thinking, just got him out of my life because i know i deserve so much better.

but yeah. that’s been my past 24 hours. my whole world is turned upside down and i don’t know what to say or do or think.",4,1756906213.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False

I'm a single mom to a 5 year old. My parents and grandparents (and my foster mom) have all passed away, so I have no support financially, for child care, even just a place to go if I end up homeless. I inherited half of a house a few years ago that my ex and I put in our names, but he left me for another woman recently so I'm working on getting the mortgage solo. Sure, it might sound nice to own a house on my own, but I'll be paying about 60%+ of my take-home pay for the mortgage - without including the bills. I could sell it, but rent around here is about $1800+ anyways which is the same as the mortgage so I may as well stay in the house. I do not make a lot of money at my job, and my job itself is so insanely stressful that I regularly cry on my commute to and from. I desperately need a new one, but I only have (paid) child care set up for before and after school and I can't afford any more than that, so I have to find something that pays decent that's a 9-5. Easier said than done in this market. 

I wake up at 6:30 every day because of my son. Get him to before-school care, get myself to work, bust my ass to meet idiotic deadlines, can't even leave for a lunch break. Cry on the way home, pick up my son, get him fed and bathed and in bed. Clean my house, pack lunches, do laundry, all the chores. Flop on my couch and be too tired to read a book or enjoy anything so I go to bed. Repeat forever.

I keep getting sick, I assume my system is messed up due to stress/exhaustion and so I keep catching things, which makes everything worse because I can't take time off. I can't ask my mom to come watch my son. I just have to keep going. No matter what. I just tried to answer the phone here at work and my voice is so raspy and dead the poor guy couldn't understand me, haha.

Sorry for the rant, I just feel like I'm beyond my limit but there's no real way to stop. I have my son to think about, I don't want to sell my house and live in a car and put him through that. I can't sell my house and move back home with family, they are dead. I can't get a new job that's less stressful unless it pays equal or more than my current one. I can't even take off a day to recharge because the financial hit will be tough, and no one else at my work does my job so when I'm not here, everything comes to a halt eventually and my boss freaks out.

I daydream about being seriously ill, enough that I have to stay in a hospital (I'm not American, if you can't tell from that) for a few days and then no one could realistically blame me too much for missing work or needing help with my son. It would still fuck me over for when I'm well again, but for a few days I could actually just.. not be responsible for a bit. I just want to sleep in until 8:30 am. I want to go for a walk, maybe get an iced coffee and read a book down by the water. I want to poke around the thrift store and find something super weird to buy. I want to actually ENJOY the home I'm paying for instead of being gone all day and too exhausted at night.

I'm sorry for the rant. I just wish I had a bigger adult than myself who I could lean on, but unfortunately I'm the big adult now and there are no benches to sit along this path.",1,1756906212.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

1n7etfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1n7etfm/life_optimization_tiny_shifts_for_massive_gains/,Life Optimization 💯: Tiny Shifts for Massive Gains in Happiness & Productivity! ✨📈🧠,"Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever feel like 'optimizing your life' means you have to completely overhaul everything overnight? It's exhausting just thinking about it.

But what if the real secret isn't in massive, life-altering leaps, but in **tiny shifts**? Small, almost unnoticeable changes that compound over time into something huge. That’s where the massive gains in happiness and productivity *really* come from. It's not about hustle culture; it's about smart, sustainable systems.

Here are a few tiny shifts I've been playing with that have made a real difference:

*   **For Productivity (📈): The 'Two-Minute Rule'.** If a task takes less than two minutes (replying to that one email, putting a dish away), do it *immediately*. It's shocking how much mental clutter this clears and how much momentum it builds.

*   **For Happiness (✨): The 'One Good Thing' Log.** Before bed, just write down one single good thing that happened that day. Could be a great cup of coffee or a nice chat with a friend. It literally trains your brain to start looking for the positive.

*   **For Mindset (🧠): The 'I Get To' Reframe.** This one is a game-changer. Instead of thinking ""I *have* to go to the gym,"" try ""I *get* to move my body."" Instead of ""I *have* to finish this project,"" it's ""I *get* to create something valuable."" It shifts the feeling from a chore to an opportunity.

Of course, a lot of these shifts are easy on paper. The hard part is sticking with them when you're feeling down, burnt out, or just plain stuck. I've learned that you can have all the productivity hacks in the world, but if your emotional foundation is shaky, nothing sticks.

It's not always about just 'doing more.' Sometimes it's about healing the part of you that resists the 'doing.' I've been exploring emotional regulation lately, and for anyone who feels stuck in that way, I've found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful for building that solid inner foundation.

It’s all about those 1% improvements. So, I’m curious to hear from you all...

1n7eqfp,https://i.redd.it/6hu10ku6bymf1.jpeg,1999 Bâtard-Montrachet Came Back to Life,"I recently picked this 1999 Domaine Jomain BM up; the risk of premox in this era of white Burgundies playing high in my mind, but the frankly amazing price was worth the risk.

Upon opening, the dark colour was definitely a red flag. On the nose, slightly tired notes of yellow apple, white peach, honey, and caramel came out the glass. The palate was as the nose, with further notes of spicy oak, coffee, and walnuts. This nuttiness protruded slightly too much, throwing the wine out of balance. Another red flag. It hadn't fully gone into those nightmare premoxed sherry notes, and there was still good acidity, but I was definitely dismayed.

A fully developed wine that was mature and oxidative. It appeared past its best and was pleasant but a bit too oxidative; a shame but worth the price of admission. There were the makings of a very good wine in there with the structure and acidity, but just felt that it was too oxidised. I went to bed and held out hope that the overnight slow-ox might at least bring out some development.

My hopes were more than exceeded. The next day this wine was a completely different beast; the tired yellow apple had woken up into fresh red apples, with floral jasmine and white peach in the background. It had come into beautiful balance, and oyster shell minerality was singing through now. The nuttiness was of course still there, but had taken a supporting role adding great complexity. The wine had physically lightened in colour, become utterly gorgeous and was fully deserving of its Grand Cru status.

This transformation got me wondering; how many white burgs from the mid/late 90s were wrongly thrown down the sink on that first night, wrongly labelled as premoxed, never to be given the chance to wake up and show their true quality? I have never known a wine to improve as much as this with air; I'm not really one for scoring wines, but this would have upped its score by well over 10 points overnight, and to give a ballpark figure was scoring into the mid-90s.

A real rollercoaster of an experience, and an invaluable lesson for me going forward.

Dinner dates are overrated,"Simple dates are the best dates: walks in parks, beaches and forests, ice cream, juices, tea, coffee, yoghurt, bowling, mini-golf, regardless of one's income. In my experience, it cuts a lot of bullshit and allows me to get straight to screening for intimate and sexual compatibility. The closer in physical proximity one can be to one's date, the better the date will be. I have never understood the appeal of dinner dates. The first criticism I have of dinner dates is the food being a distraction, especially if it's a multi course meal. The second criticism I have is that can set a transactionary and materialist paradigm for a relationship in which quality of dates are defined by quantity of money rather than quality of time. Also, I am a big fan of eschewing social norms and doing what one finds fun. If one is into stamp collecting, one should incorporate stamp collecting into the date. If one is into musical instruments, one should incorporate playing musical instruments into the date (i.e. giving an informal lesson). If one is into botanizing, one should go to a botanical garden or forest and talk about the myriad of different plants that are edible or medicinal. If a foodie, go grocery shopping and cook a meal! Show them your herb and vegetable garden! (if you have one). I am really adamant that dating should resemble every day and ordinary life and needn't be a contrived, superfluous and formalized activity. ",32,1756905863.0,changemyview,37,0.71,False

Making new friends as an adult is hard and I met her at a time when a lot of my close friends had just moved away so I was really happy to find someone that was fun to talk to and hang out with. We also have kids the same age so it's been great for them too. Nothing about Dana’s appearance or demeanor screams “crazy rich” but I discovered after we got to know each other a bit that her and her husband are extremely wealthy. Despite my husband and I being upper middle class, the wealth disparity between us can be a bit intimidating if I dwell on it, but luckily it hasn’t been a factor in our friendship at all. We do normal stuff like grab dinner or coffee from time to time, and hang out at regular places. While not “rich” myself I have a good job and am fortunate to lead a pretty comfortable life so I don’t need anything from Dana besides her friendship.

My (45F) SIL “Kate” and I have a pleasant/cordial relationship when we see each other at family functions but otherwise don’t spend much time together. I have nothing against her, and as far as I know she has nothing against me, but we are two very different people with very little in common. In the course of our 10+ year relationship neither us has invited the other to hangout outside of family events. Kate has her own business which is dependent on client relationships. I believe that Kate is good at her job but I don’t try to recommend her to my friends or other family because 1) I don’t like to mix business and family for anyone and 2) she has a somewhat difficult personality and the majority of her business relationships go south.

About a month ago Dana and I ran into Kate while we were out jogging in the park. I have no idea how Kate recognized Dana, but ever since she saw us together she’s been pestering me with questions about how I know her and asking to be included in our meetups. I put her off for awhile but things came to a head at a family BBQ this weekend when Kate told me I was gatekeeping my friendship with Dana “because she’s rich”. I told her that a lot of our meetups revolved around the activity that we are both into (which my SIL has stated multiple times she’s not interested in) and that I didn’t feel comfortable introducing them when it seemed like Kate was only interested in meeting her because of her money. 

Some backstory is that my SIL has met other friends of mine that are wealthy (although none as wealthy as Dana) at parties and has pestered them with really intrusive questions about their income and wealth. Because those meetings happened organically I just let it be, but always found it inappropriate. 

Dana left the party and my MIL said she was crying in her room because she’s always wanted to “get an in” with a more affluent group of friends and is upset that it seems to “come so easy to me”. My MIL doesn’t usually get involved in these things but she asked me if I could consider helping her out by introducing them so that SIL could promote her business. I said no because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable situation but now they are both upset with me. AITAH for not making this introduction?

hey, first time posting here so i’ll keep it simple.

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

I was diagnosed mid-July and put on Diamox 4x daily (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bed) by the hospital team. Of note: I wasn't really having noticeable headaches at the time of diagnosis; I *was* having vision symptoms. 

I found the 4x a day timing very annoying! At my first post-diagnosis appointment in early August, my neuro-ophthalmologist said I could switch to two pills in the morning, two at night (which I worked to have roughly 12 hours apart). I did this, and the first day or two was rough as my body adjusted, but then it mostly was okay. Some breakthrough headaches.

At my follow up appointment, I noted that I was still having headaches and wondered if it could be because of the Diamox dose change. (I read that the Diamox half-life is 6-9 hours, so I was hypothesizing that roughly 6 hours into the dosage, I might be experiencing a drop off in effect.) My doc was not especially convinced of this, but said I could try if I wanted to.

I've now switched back to 4x daily (thanks to the Finch Care app for making this less of a giant pain in the ass), but still spend a lot of the day with a very low grade headache -- like wearing a slightly too-tight hat. Coffee seems to help some, as does getting outside and moving around.

For those of you who've had different dosage/timing experiences, did you find that one was better than the other? If they were both the same, what have you noticed (if anything) that helps with the low-grade headache? ",1,1756905692.0,iih,0,1.0,False

1n7ejrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n7ejrx/does_the_chulux_qfcm801_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does the CHULUX QF-CM801 Single Serve Coffee Maker Live Up to Reviews?,"Testing out the CHULUX QF-CM801 Single Serve Coffee Maker has been an interesting experience, especially for someone who juggles between an endless stream of work calls, quick morning routines, and the occasional weekend relaxation session. This compact coffee brewer seems like a promising contender in the single-serve world, and in my daily use, it did live up to some of the hype—but not without a few quirks. Let’s dive deeper into what makes this coffee maker tick.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the start, the CHULUX QF-CM801 Single Serve Coffee Maker feels designed with convenience in mind. Its compact dimensions—7.48"" deep, 4.33"" wide, and 9.06"" high—make it an ideal fit for smaller kitchens, office desks, or even dorm rooms. It barely took up any counter space, and I was thrilled to see that its lightweight design (just over 2 pounds) made it portable enough to take on road trips, camping, or hotel stays. The BPA-free materials for the water tank and needle were reassuring for someone like me who values safety in everyday appliances. Despite its practical size and materials, the minimalist black finish stands out, giving my kitchen counter a neat and modern look.  

**Operation and Usage Simplicity**  
This coffee maker boasts a “one-key switch operation,” and honestly, I couldn’t love this feature more. With a busy schedule, I appreciated how straightforward it was—just fill it up with water, insert a compatible coffee pod, and press the button. In about three minutes, I had a hot cup of Joe ready to drink. The auto shut-off feature was another big win, especially on mornings when I was rushing out the door and didn’t want to worry about turning off appliances. It even doubles as a hot water brewer, which came in handy for brewing tea after a long workday.

[Check CHULUX QF-CM801 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b010nmmph0/)

**Functionality and Compatibility**  
One aspect that makes this product versatile is its compatibility with both 1.0 and 2.0 coffee pods. I mainly use classic pods and occasionally throw in a reusable filter for my own coffee grounds, and both seemed to work seamlessly. The removable drip tray was another nice touch. It allowed me to place travel mugs up to 5.7” tall under the spout, which made my on-the-go coffee prep much smoother. However, I noticed that the capacity can only hold 12 ounces per brew, which might feel a bit limiting for those who enjoy larger servings. 

**Advantages**  
Based on my time using it daily, the product brings several perks:  

- Compact and travel-friendly.
- BPA-free materials for safety-conscious users.  
- Super-fast brewing with around 3-minute prep.  
- Auto shut-off helps prevent overheating and saves energy.  

**Drawbacks**  
On the flip side, there are some critiques to take into account:  

- Slightly noisy during the brewing process.  
- Lacks the option for larger serving sizes beyond 12 ounces.  
- Preheating time feels slightly longer than some competitors.  

**Competing Brands**  
When evaluating this coffee maker against others, like the Keurig K-Mini and the BLACK+DECKER Single Serve, I could see where it outperformed and where it fell short. Compared to the Keurig, the CHULUX excels in portability and price, as the Keurig tends to be bulkier and pricier. The BLACK+DECKER felt like a worthy competitor due to its robustness, yet I found it lacked the rapid brewing time that the CHULUX offers. One area where CHULUX may feel behind, however, is customization. Some rivals allow more control over cup sizes or brew strength, which this unit doesn’t fully provide.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Despite a few shortcomings, the unit delivers solid value for money, especially if you’re looking to fill a niche for quick single-cup brews without breaking the bank. Its durable build and user-friendly operation make it worth every penny for small households, offices, or travel enthusiasts. The ability to use coffee pods or grounds ensures that you’re not locked into one option, enhancing its everyday utility.

I’m a cybersecurity consultant on a road trip to a client site half way across the country. I’m also planning on doing some work _on_ the road by testing some client systems in the field.   
  
I’ve packed a bit too much. I’ve got changes of clothes, a wireless pentest rig the size of a small suitcase and a tool kit in case my car breaks down. The day I leave, my co-worker asks me to bring a banker’s box of material for the engagement, since they’re flying out instead. I can carry it all, but if I need anything other than my sunglasses, I’ve got to pull over and pull everything out like a rest-stop yard sale.   
  
That’s all irrelevant. I’ve got clear skies, temps in the high 60’s (21C) and mid-pandemic open roads. A few hours and I’m in the Appalachian Mountains. Curves, beautiful scenery and wild elevation changes tell me this was a good idea.   
  
But I’ve got to do some work. My first CopperBolt location is outside Morgantown, West Virginia. It’s also a good time to stop and take care of a few necessary things. Fuel, bathroom and a decent meal outside at a local roadside cafe. It doesn’t hurt that this place is across the street from the town library and its last generation CopperBolt box. 
  
And by cafe, I mean the kind of place that has their menu on black plastic letters on a RC Cola menu board sign.  
  
I look at my calendar and realize that I have some internal-to-the-firm status call in half an hour. There’s the possibility that people who shouldn’t know that I’m doing a road trip on company time will be on the call.   
  
I’ve planned for this. I brought a towel-sized sheet of green screen fabric. I’ll hang it from the convertible top hoodsticks and nobody’d be the wiser.   
  
Take the call, interact like I’m availably home and go.  
  
I want to take a poke at this CopperBolt first. That means I’ve got to dig out the bunch of WiFi cards, SDRs, USB hubs and cables, like an H.R. Giger MicroCenter. I stack my other luggage on the hood and next to the car, then pull out the plastic bags holding the components.   
  
20 minutes to call.   
  
A basic SSID scan doesn’t show anything obviously CopperBolt related. The library does offer guest WiFi, but I’d like to collect some details, like the the [OUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier) of the WiFi cards.   
  
10 minutes to call.  
  
Why, USB, why? You’re damn mercurial after like five WiFi cards.  I’ve got antennas stuck to bits of the car and cables all running a box with a stack of Raspberry Pis. Some selective unplug or power cycles and hardware is starting to work. 
  
5 minutes to call.  
  
I’m going to have to use the hotspot. It was a cool idea, to prove my point by using an open CopperBolt WiFi network to attend a call.  I can see all the WiFi and Bluetooth devices within range of the library, including the cars driving by, but I don’t see a CopperBolt-xxxxxx network.  
  
3 minutes to call.   
  
If I hang the green cloth from the convertible top frame, it’s too close to my head. I start putting the top down and find a position half-way down that works. 

2 minutes to call. 
  
I’m in the passenger seat. A little adjusting and Zoom will fake my home office and nobody’s the wiser. I’ve combed my hair. I look presentable enough. I’m breathing deeply, trying to relax enough to have that half-zombie ‘time is a flat circle’ look for the call. 
  
The call starts. There’s the usual pre-call chatter. I want to keep my talking to a minimum, so I wave hello and keep looking at the wireless scan on my laptop.  
  
 A few of the participants are dropping company gossip. I try to stay out of this unless I have first hand knowledge of the event.   
  
This is one of those times.   
  
This time, they’re talking The Lawnmower Man.  That’s the nickname for a salesman who joined a client call sweaty and shirtless last week.  Normally the salesperson is there to listen to the clients and see if there’s additional work they can sell. The salesperson decided to multitask and take the call while mowing his lawn. He managed not to accidentally go off mute while on the mower, but the video did show him topless. 
  
Not a confidence inspiring look to start with, and he went down from there. He read from the findings section of the deliverable like a sermon, then tried to close a sale during the call, even after the client made it clear to the rest of us they needed time to plan a response to our findings.  
  
A few of us were on the client’s Slack where they made it clear that they never wanted to see The Lawnmower Man again.   
  
The participants on my current call are taking Lawnmower Man’s side and how unfair it is for the client to pick on him for his eccentricities.   
  
I really don’t want to do anything more than _attend_ this call, so I don’t say anything. 
  
Then I see a managing director join the call. This is definitely someone I don’t want figuring out I’m on a road trip.   
  
 

    
    
  
The Managing Director clears their throat and people go silent.  
  
Managing Director:”I’m working on a few fast-flyers and I need SMEs to put some color on our decks”  
  
(translation- I’m trying to sell some engagements and want people familiar with the industry or technology to convince the prospective client that we know what we’re doing)  
  
The MD puts up a slide with a bunch of prospects. One is of particular interest to me. I hope to be able to quickly explain my experience and go back on mute.    
  
We go through the first five or six. I nod silently to look engaged-ish. Mine is probably number eight on the list, so I’m coming up with my elevator pitch.  
  
I notice a new WiFi network, named ‘Bobby’s Chevrolet” appear on my scan.   
  
The seventh is something industrial. I think it’s some component of an oil refinery or chemical plant. I’m only paying attention to know when the discussion ends. 
  
I hear the squeak of brakes and the clatter of a diesel engine by my ear. There’s a Chevy Silverado pulling into the spot next to my car. It’s got a modest lift kit and a middle aged man wearing a safety green t-shirt and wraparound sunglasses. He’s surveying the scene with suspicion.   
  
Man:”Hey! What on Earth are you up to?”    
  
Oh no, he’s talking to me. I double check that I’m on mute, take my headset off and look up at him.  
  
me:”Uh, I’m working. Can you leave me be?”  
  
Man:”What? Are you an influencer?”  
  
me:”Look, Bobby, I’m working. I’m paid to do this.”  
  
Guessing at his name definitely surprised him. He gets out of his truck and double checks that it’s locked before walking slowly to the cafe. 
  
And somehow I missed the engagement I wanted. The call eventually ends and I get to show attendance by saying “thank you” before dropping off.   
  
I go back to looking for the CopperBolt and after a bit, determine that it’s not doing anything wireless. That’s a data point.   
  
It’s time to get back on the road, but it’s also time for a cup of coffee. I order at the counter and see Bobby walk out, back to his truck. On his way back, he takes his time peering into my gear.   
  
As I walk up with my to-go coffee, I offer an apology:  
  
me:”Hey there, sorry to freak you out. Your truck gave you away”  
  
Bobby:”I guessed. Is that what all this is for?”  
  
me:”Yep. It’s for wireless scanning”  
  
Bobby:”Uh-huh. Have a good one”  
  
Bobby leaves and I pack up my gear to resume my trip. I’ve got other CopperBolt devices to look at and miles to go.

Here’s how to actually find them.,"Most people look for jobs by updating their LinkedIn profiles and sending out tons of resumes, usually to never hear back. The problem is that up to 70% of jobs are never posted online. This hidden job market is where the best work-from-home opportunities are expected to be in [2025.Here](http://2025.Here)'s how you can access it:

1.  Referrals are very important. People are four times more likely to get hired if someone recommends them. Make a list of companies you want to work for and find at least one current employee to have a coffee chat with once a week. Instead of just asking for a referral, find ways to get involved, have genuine conversations, and show your value.
    
2.  Communities are very valuable. Good jobs often appear in online groups, such as Slack groups (Tech Ladies, Work At Home Hub), and plenty of subreddits, before they are posted for everyone to see.
    
3.  Career pages are often more effective than job boards. Save 10 company pages you like and check their job pages once a week. They often post jobs there before putting them on LinkedIn.
    
4.  Reaching out to companies directly is often effective. Sending a polite email or message to a hiring manager explaining how you can help often gets attention before a job is even open.
    
5.  Use both automation and networking. Do not just apply to hundreds of jobs without thinking or talk to people without following up. The real trick is to do both together.

Chapter 40: Report and Orders.

In the Guard's Deep Command Center, carved from solid rock beneath the Mojave Desert, the silence was so profound that one could only hear the quiet hum of the life-support systems and the barely perceptible, low thrum of the Swarm project's quantum computer. The hours dragged on in a tension that seemed to thicken the air. On the main operations floor, in what was known as ""The Pit,"" dozens of officers stared at their consoles, their faces illuminated only by the glow of the monitors. Above them, in the center of the room, floated a gigantic, three-dimensional holoprojector, displaying the Solar System with almost divine precision.
At this moment, however, all attention was focused on a single, distant point in the Kuiper Belt. Five small, green icons—strike group ""Spear""—moved in a silent, time-delayed ballet of death with two frigates. Quantum communications had failed the exact moment Spear group decelerated near Persephone, hiding in its shadow to prepare an ambush. Aris suspected that the two Plague frigates had employed some unknown quantum communications jamming system. He searched for clues in the Swarm's intelligence and scientific data, but unfortunately, there was not the slightest trace of information about such capabilities.
Aris began to speak. ""The Swarm is not omnipotent, Marcus. The reptilian race has the ability to jam quantum communications."" Aris continued, ""We are only just beginning to understand the new equations and theories of quantum physics.""
Admiral Marcus cursed under his breath. ""That capability is priceless for gaining an advantage on the battlefield at such distances. Fleet staffs will be using data delayed by hours, days, even years."" ""Jesus,"" he breathed, clutching his head. ""You have to figure this out, brother, do you understand? You have to."" Marcus's plea was like the cry of a child whose toy had been taken away.
Aris interjected, cutting him off. ""Fortunately, this jamming doesn't have a system-wide range. The data you see is coming from one of the Swarm's Eye satellites, located an hour's light-speed away from the battlefield. Its quantum link is working, but the delay is two hours. It takes an hour for the radar waves to reach the battle, another hour for the reflection to return, and then it's transmitted instantly to Earth through the operational quantum transmitter.""
Admiral Marcus Thorne had not left his command post for a single minute since the first shot was fired in the delayed battle transmission. He stood on a raised platform overlooking the entire hall, a lone, motionless figure against the cosmic map. In his hand, another cup of black, bitter coffee grew cold. He hadn't slept for over thirty hours, overseeing the creation of Earth's defense line and approving the ambush plan Volkov had presented to him. He didn't feel tired. He only felt a cold, controlled pressure and frustration.
The frustration was caused by the tyranny of physics. The battle he was watching was a ghost. It might have already ended, billions of kilometers away. The light signals carrying the image of what was happening were only now reaching their passive sensors and the telescopes on Earth. The delay was over six hours, and in those images, the battle had just begun. Yet, according to the radar data from the Swarm's Eye satellite, it had been raging for four hours. He was the most powerful military commander in human history, yet he was just a helpless spectator, forced to watch a performance whose outcome had been decided long ago.
He analyzed every one of Volkov's maneuvers picked up by the Swarm's Eye radar system, but he understood nothing. Why was there no signal from one of the ships? Why did three ships then approach the cruiser and disappear, leaving a single, virtually stationary signal for four hours?
""Admiral,"" a voice suddenly shouted as an officer ran towards him. It was Second Lieutenant Chen, the quantum communications officer. ""We have a signature of an incoming signal. Identifier: G-F-S Gryphon. Transmission Protocol: Omega. Confirming successful quantum entanglement and initiating decryption. Time to full data download: fifteen seconds.""
Aris yelled, ""They won, brother!"" and laughed.
""How?"" Marcus asked. ""How do you know?""
""Quantum communication on the battlefield is back online. I suspect they destroyed some device on the Plague frigates. Which means they won,"" he smiled.
An absolute silence fell over The Pit. Even the quiet murmur of conversations ceased. All the officers looked up from their consoles, their eyes fixed on the main holoprojector. Three seconds. That was all that separated them from the truth. From the final accounting of gains and losses. Marcus Thorne felt the muscles in his back tighten even further. This was the moment of truth.
When the countdown ended, the signal from the Gryphon's quantum communicator was like a bursting dam. A torrent of data—raw, uncompressed, brutal—poured onto the screens. The Swarm project's quantum computer, linked to the command systems, immediately began to analyze and visualize it, painting a full, multi-layered picture of the battle on the holoprojector. They finally had live data, bypassing the distance and the time needed to receive it.
First came the telemetry. The chaotic, jagged flight paths of destroyers performing evasive maneuvers, sudden spikes in energy consumption, G-force readings that should have crushed human bodies. It was a record of pure, physical violence. Thorne saw the moment the Ivan the Terrible was hit for the second time—its motion vector changed abruptly, the ship lurching before its systems could stabilize it.
Then came the combat logs and recordings. This was the worst part. Short, fragmented video feeds from the bridges just before impact. Thorne forced himself to watch. He saw the terrified but determined face of Captain Orlov on the bridge of the Piast, a second before the image was flooded with blinding white and the transmission was cut forever. He saw the chaotic scene on the shattered bridge of the Ivan the Terrible, blood on Volkov's face, and heard his roar as he gave the order for the final, desperate salvo from the plasma cannon. He heard the screams of the wounded, the shriek of alarms, the crack of tearing metal. These were no longer just icons on a map. They were his people.
The third layer of data was the coldest and cruelest. Medical reports and damage assessments. Three-dimensional models of the damaged ships appeared on the main screen. The Ivan the Terrible was a phantom, with huge, red-marked holes in its hull. The Jagiellon had a gash in its sensor tower. And on a side monitor that no one wanted to look at, a list of the dead and wounded began to scroll. Name, rank, service number. A long, unending list. 137 names from the Piast—killed. And 121 from the Ivan the Terrible, including 83 killed. But there was also good news: 13 of the 16 drifting sailors had been rescued; the rescue operation was a success. Unfortunately, three didn't make it. Suit malfunctions had claimed their lives; they suffocated in the blackness of space, alone, illuminated by the pale light of the solar system's star. Their bodies were brought aboard the Jagiellon with full honors.
Marcus's mind processed the information with superhuman speed. He saw it all: the first, failed salvo; the invisible blow that destroyed the Piast; Volkov's desperate but effective response; the disabling of one enemy and the destruction of the other; then the desperate tactic where the cruiser became a shield. Everything was now clear and matched the radar data from the Swarm's Eye. A victory. Yes. But at what cost?
Just as he was analyzing the damage report for his flagship cruiser, Second Lieutenant Chen, the same communications officer, stood beside his console. He was sweating, having run from console to console, but this time his eyes burned with excitement. ""We have a report from Volkov himself, Admiral! Confirmation from the battlefield! Strike group Spear reports...""
""STOP TALKING.""
The Admiral's voice was like the crack of a whip, cold and sharp. There was no anger in it, only absolute, total concentration. The officer fell silent mid-word, as if he had hit an invisible wall. Everyone in The Pit froze upon hearing the order. Thorne hadn't raised his voice, but its intensity filled the entire room. He pointed a finger at the main screen, where the combat logs were currently scrolling. ""I can see it, Lieutenant. I am processing the raw data. Your verbal summary is, at this moment, an irritating, slow-moving noise. I know they were victorious. I know Target Alpha was completely destroyed, and Target Beta is disabled with potential prisoners. You have the full report in the network. Read it, process it, and send it to the UN."" Admiral Thorne suddenly looked at the officer again.
""My apologies. I haven't slept for many hours. You perform your duties exemplarily and with due diligence. I wish there were more officers like you. That was my fault.""
The officer, honored by the statement, straightened up, stood at attention, gave a stiff salute, and retreated silently to the edge of the desk. Thorne had already forgotten him. His mind had jumped from analyzing the past to planning the future. Victory was not a cause for celebration for him. It was a bloody, but priceless opportunity.
He turned away from the main screen and addressed his chief of operations, Commander Hanako Tanaka, a woman with steel-gray eyes and black hair who had stood silently beside him through the whole ordeal. ""Hanako. Immediately dispatch research vessels and transport ships with spare parts from the base on Ganymede. It's our closest facility. Assign two 'Wasp'-class patrol boats as their escort. I want them there yesterday."" The Wasps were already obsolete; the 500-ton ships were mainly used for training young sailors and had a single, outdated small railgun, but they were the closest.
His voice was cold and precise. Every word was an order that set another piece of humanity's gigantic war machine in motion. Hanako nodded, her fingers already tapping commands on her own console. ""What guidelines for the research team, Marcus?"" she asked, her voice just as calm.
""Their mission: examine the Plague wreck. I want to know everything. Absolutely everything. What they're made of, the structure of their armor. How their reactors work, the principle behind their drives. Above all, I want a full analysis of their weapons. What material the projectiles were made of, what velocity they achieve, and how in the hell they remain invisible to our sensors. Have them investigate why the Gryphon's sensors were the only ones that detected something. Order them to take that technology apart, atom by atom. And most importantly...""
He paused for a moment, turning to look her straight in the eyes. His gaze was so intense that even she, a veteran of countless political and military battles, felt a shiver. ""And most importantly, Hanako, they are to determine if anyone can be taken alive. If that's even possible. I want to interrogate one of those reptiles. I want to know what they think, what they fear, how they fight. I want to get inside their heads. Order the boarding party and xenobiologists to make every attempt to secure a live or intact specimen. Carry out this task regardless of the cost. I repeat, regardless of the cost.""
""Understood, Admiral. Casualties authorized,"" she replied without hesitation. They both knew what that meant. The lives of the research team members were secondary to the potential value of such a prize.
Thorne turned back to the communications officer, who was still standing by the desk. ""Lieutenant.""
The soldier snapped to attention.
""Relay a new order to Captain Volkov. Immediately. The sailors from the surviving destroyers, and those from the boarding parties, are to form a joint team and search the Plague wreck for survivors and data banks. Have them look for their bridge, their command center, anything that resembles a memory core, a flash drive, etc. Secure everything that isn't nailed down. We cannot wait for the team from Ganymede. I need preliminary data immediately. Send it.""
""Yes, sir!"" The lieutenant, having recovered from the shock, saluted and ran off to transmit the orders that would send the battle-weary soldiers on another, possibly suicidal, mission.
Admiral Thorne was left alone in his silent command center. The holoprojector still showed the battlefield—two destroyed red symbols and four surviving green ones. He glanced at the scrolling list of casualties.
The wreck was a mine of information. A treasure trove of technology that could give them an advantage in the next engagement or at least level the playing field. And a potential prisoner... was priceless. It was the key to understanding the enemy, and understanding was the key to victory.
War was based on information, and information was a form of power. He had just sent his people to seize it directly from the bleeding entrails of a defeated enemy. The price was terrible, but for Admiral Marcus Thorne, who in his mind was already designing new shields, new swords, and thinking of the next, inevitable battles, it was entirely acceptable. It was the first down payment on the account of humanity's survival. And he was prepared to keep paying. To pay in blood, and then with the lives of his soldiers.
A memory from 12 years ago surfaced in his mind: cannon fodder.

1n7efbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n7efbf/showcase_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_stanley/,Showcase the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Stanley Set Worth It,"Testing out the Stanley 10-09566, the Camp Pour Over Set, felt like a blend of nostalgia and practicality. This isn’t just any coffee maker; it’s one of those products that feels purpose-built for someone who values both simplicity and ruggedness. With a green hue reminiscent of old-school camping gear, it instantly took me back to childhood trips where a sturdy thermos and smoky fires were non-negotiable. The hammertone finish complements its outdoor aesthetic while hinting that it’s made to last.

**Design and Build Quality**

Durability was the first thing that caught my attention. Its stainless steel construction not only adds to the robust vibe but also ensures it can take a beating without cracking or breaking. I’ve accidentally knocked it off the counter once (or twice), and apart from a slightly louder-than-expected thud, it shrugged off the fall like it was nothing. While the reusable stainless steel filter is a genius addition that saves money on disposable filters, it’s also perfect for an eco-conscious user like me. It feels like they thought of every little aspect, from the mug included in the set to the BPA-free materials—no weird plasticky taste sneaking into my coffee here.

**Pour-Over Brewing Made Simple**

I’m no barista, but the pour-over process here was surprisingly straightforward. Just add your desired coffee grounds, pour in your hot water in slow, intentional circles, and a few minutes later, you get a cup of coffee that rivals high-end cafes. Stanley’s instructions even had cheeky tips, like adjusting the number of tablespoons depending on how strong I wanted the brew—“5 tbsp if you’re shameless” became my go-to setting. Unlike ceramic options I’ve tried in the past, heat retention with this setup is on point. My coffee cooled slower, making it perfect for savoring, especially on those crisp dawn hikes.

**Check Stanley 10-09566 price on Amazon.**  

**Key Benefits**

- Durable stainless steel construction withstands wear and tear.
- Reusable filter eliminates waste and works seamlessly for fine-tuned flavor extraction.
- Perfect for outdoor activities, offering convenience and an on-the-go coffee solution.
- The included 12 oz mug is designed with insulation in mind, keeping beverages hot longer.
- BPA-free materials ensure peace of mind for health-conscious coffee lovers.

**Areas for Improvement**

Not everything about this coffee setup is flawless. While testing it outdoors during a windy day, I noticed that the process could get messy if you’re not careful when pouring water. A spout with a bit more precision would help prevent spills. It also felt slightly larger than expected, so packing it among tight camping gear required some creative strategies. Additionally:

- The cleaning process, though quick with a rinse, can occasionally leave finer coffee grounds needing a second scrub.
- Stainless steel filters demand a bit of finesse to prevent clogs, particularly with overly fine coffee grounds.
- Might not be the most compact or lightweight option for minimalistic campers.

**Portability for Adventurers**

As someone who loves camping, Stanley’s pour-over kit checked many of my boxes. It’s designed for outdoor enthusiasts who want a fuss-free way to brew their coffee while soaking in nature. The tough, insulated mug and hassle-free setup were ideal for mornings spent lakeside or after an exhausting day of hiking. Though slightly bulkier than I would have liked, it compensated by delivering a premium coffee taste wherever I pitched my tent. Compared to other coffee makers I’ve lugged around, this is clearly more durable and reliable—just wish it folded or stacked a little more efficiently.

**Competing Products**

Looking at how it stacks up to other options out there, I couldn’t help but think back to ceramic drippers or glass pour-over setups. Those products offered equal brewing quality but lacked the ruggedness needed for outdoor settings. The glass models I’ve owned always felt one camping trip away from shattering, and the cleanup process wasn’t nearly as quick as what I experienced with this stainless steel beauty. While the Stanley set sits at the pricier end of camping coffee solutions, most alternatives lacked either the included mug or the blend of durability and aesthetics. Overall, its steel finish and reusable filter gave it a winning edge for regular use beyond just camping.

**True Value**

Investing in this coffee maker might feel like a splurge, but for what it delivers, it’s fair to say you’re getting your money’s worth. Many competing products would require you to purchase reusable filters or invest in a sturdy, insulated mug separately. Here, it’s bundled together with the promise of longevity—a lifetime warranty backs this up, assuring buyers that it’s more than just a passing kitchen or camping fad. For those who spend significant time outdoors or simply enjoy a solid mug of coffee at work or home, it’s a genuinely worthwhile purchase.

1n7eepc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n7eepc/my_ex_asked_me_for_time_after_2_months_of/,My ex asked me for time after 2 months of relationship due to the reappearance of his 4-year-old ex who left for infidelity and disappeared 10 months of his life but reappeared,"I am 32 years old. In mid-May 2025 I met C. (35) It was one of those encounters that are not forced: same music and movies, series, we both collect sneakers and curiously we have the same in addition to coffee rituals at home, similar humor and long conversations, not to mention that we have a very similar style. On June 12 we became boyfriends. Before me, C. had had a 4-5-year relationship with ""Alex"" (33) that ended in Aug/Sep-2024 due to his infidelity. According to C., the three worked in the same place at that time and during the infidelity Alex and the other girl showed each other, kissed and caressed each other in front of her at work all this said by C. Since from day 1 we talked and made things clear, she also told me that Alex never did anything at home if something was needed to be repaired until C's father went. Justifying that he worked a lot and was never at home with hours from 6:00 am to 11:00-12:00 pm but a few months before after confessing the infidelity, Alex entered an attitude of repairing what was needed and being more aware of everything at home but one day he arrives and confesses that he has deceived her like this simply when he took his things and left without saying goodbye: there was no real closure. But as she mentioned to me at the beginning of a relationship with whom she cheated on C. To get into context, when he cheats her is with someone from the same job where they worked, so she asks for her change to where she is currently and a few months pass in tranquility, so she enters into a denial but 2 months of the breakup she tells me that Alex's mom arrives to talk to her to forgive him to what she in her words tells her that the decision to leave was his decision to deceive her she takes refuge in her pet a 16-year-old dog who dies from him Attack of another dog in December, a few days later he adopts a kitten that helps him pass the days while from January to May he tries to go out with suitors but nothing flows after the first date or simply after seeing them behave the first time.

With me, on the other hand, everything flowed quickly when we started talking, the conversation was very fluid, organic, no topics were forced, everything came out spontaneously and even on several occasions we got to run from the cafeterias because we did not feel the time with time we began to get to know each other more and a month I see that something more than a friendship can happen and I dare to ask her that if she wants to be my girlfriend at this point I still don't know when I finish with Alex that's why I think everything is fine the days go by, and we start with details, careful intimacy, validation with Her circle, and several things of mine in her house (sweat, I said to give her when we turned 2 months old, matching socks, a cushion that she liked and I gave her (it should be emphasized that here we went to do super she told me that it was the first time someone went to the supermarket with her that she always went alone) bracelets with our names that she bought when we turned 1 month old).

A week after we got engaged, C. uploaded our first photo. A few days later, Alex reappeared for the first time to talk to her to which she asked me to go with her to which I agreed but when the day comes in the morning she tells me that she wants to go alone to give her a definitive closure. In that first face-to-face, C. validated me as a couple: he told him that he was with me and that he was reorganizing his life with me. From that first contact, Alex became insistent: calls and messages all the time, also taking advantage of the closeness at work.

Even so, July passed like any other couple: we saw each other 2-3 times a week, Saturdays for us, daily video call, careful intimacy and details. In July C. defended me: a common person told her ""you could get something better"" and she defended me; she talked about me with her parents and her circle and her parents already wanted to meet me.

On August 12, when we turned two months old, we couldn't see each other as we had planned because of her overwork since she is in charge of an apartment in a hospital so C. starts crying and telling me that she didn't want us to have spent that day like this and tells me ""sorry"" (deep crying) Then I thought it was pure frustration for the day; today I see it as ambivalence that was already appeared. That week he got together work and family. On August 17, the breaking point arrived: Alex showed up at C.'s parents' house to talk to them and apologize for having cheated on his daughter (C. told me as it is). The 18th asked me for time and space, but at the same time ""I don't want you to leave.""

I marked my limit: if you feel something for him, I step aside. Even so, we continued writing for a few days, without a romantic tone.

On August 25 we agreed on zero contact. She closed with: ""when I have an answer, you will see it."" On the 26th (my birthday) he sent me a very affectionate message (""tqm... always in my little head and my heart...""). On the 29th I wrote to him about a hospitalized cousin; he answered on the 30th in the morning, briefly. Since then, silence.

Between those days and the following days, indications appeared that, added together, make me think of pseudo-coexistence with Alex (not a formal move, but 3–5 nights a week, routines and things of him in his house). I detail them as I saw them: •	 WhatsApp with ""Alex"" on top: I didn't ""get into"" his computer. I saw it in statuses/stories that she herself uploaded to her WhatsApp; she doesn't have me blocked and I saw what any contact sees. In one of those clips his screen was distinguished and ""Alex"" appeared as the first chat.	 A man's wallet and fag at his table: that weekend it was before ""contact 0"" I called him and he didn't answer. I went to his house; I rang the bell and with the first ring I got his message: ""did you call me?"". From the outside, all the lights on except the bedroom. That detail hit me because when we were together, the light in the room was always off when there was intimacy.	 Stories: it went from going up almost daily to going down a lot.	 Work/family: C. and Alex are coworkers (not the same area) as I mentioned she is in charge of an administrative area of a hospital and he is a driver within the same hospital because as I said before she asked for his change to another place but months later she relocates all the staff where they initially worked and arrive where they had changed her. She eats with her family 2–3 times a week and on Saturdays there are family breakfasts. C.'s dad used to have a good relationship with Alex (I saw him in old publications).

C. rejects therapy (""I don't want to go to the Psychologist""). He also removed symbols: he removed the photo from the bouquet I gave him and stopped wearing the bracelet with my name. Minor but symbolic data: the streaming account I made was left with the user ""C. LOVE"" and continues to use it.

Before the zero contact, he sent me audios: ""I'm not at 100%"", ""I need to talk and I don't like to lie"", ""I don't want you to think I did something wrong"", ""he has talked to me and looked for me"", ""I need time alone to think / analyze"", ""at this point I don't know what I want... if later you don't want to continue with me, I'll understand"". Cold I read it as ambivalence + reactance (the more they say ""don't forgive him"", the more he pushes the opposite) + sunk cost (""5 years are not forgotten"").

Since August 25 I am in zero contact since I talked to her to give her space as she asked me but when I told her that she is in a defensive attitude and tells me ""I'm sick of being told what to do or not to forgive him"", ""neither with you, nor with him, I want to be alone"": I don't deny that I love her, but I separated what I feel from what I do. If one day I appeared with facts, I would only accept a coffee if these five are fulfilled: 1.	 Royal court with Alex 2.	 Visible limits at work (labor treatment only).	 Constancy with that frame.	 Let him take his part (he left me in limbo) 5.	 Slow pace (no ""sealing"" in a hurry).

I share this because I know that I'm not the only one to whom an ex with ""home field"" (family, custom, coworking) reappears and everything is rearranged. I'm looking for similar experiences: how did they distinguish healthy love from rebound/nostalgia? What signs helped them not to deceive themselves when there are domestic indications like mine? Do zero contact and my criteria seem reasonable to you or would you adjust them? Have you seen real changes without therapy in reconciliations after infidelity and how are they verified over time?

I'm not looking to demonize or spy. I just want to do my part well: take care of my peace and my dignity. If life brings clean facts, I will decide from the calm; if not, I will simply leave",1,1756905055.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

They say the camera never lies. But I know better. It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic,those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living. Sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling… I capture confidence in its most seductive forms. It’s not about posing…it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera? I’m your classic Irish mischief maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half read fantasy book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks with my camera in hand and off the cuff road trips, the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator.

Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you?

They say the camera never lies. But I know better. It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic,those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living. Sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling… I capture confidence in its most seductive forms. It’s not about posing…it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera? I’m your classic Irish mischief maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half read fantasy book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks with my camera in hand and off the cuff road trips, the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator.

Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you?

And yes, I absolutely swap pics. It’s kind of my thing.

Toasting and charring don’t just shape a barrel—they reshape the whisky. From soft vanilla to intense smoke, it’s the fire that defines the flavour. 🔬



As a chemist exploring distillation, I’ve been fascinated by how controlled heat transforms oak into flavour-rich casks. Here's how it works:



🔥 Toasting – Gentle heat for layered sweetness:

🍯 Light Toast – Lignin breaks down, releasing vanillin for soft vanilla sweetness, while syringaldehyde adds delicate floral hints.

🥜 Medium Toast – More heat produces furfural for rich caramel and almond notes. 5-HMF deepens the profile with toffee sweetness.

🍫 Heavy Toast – Intense heat boosts syringaldehyde for coffee and dark chocolate notes, while furfural transforms into deeper caramel tones.

🔥 Charring – Intense flame for bold smoky notes:

🌲 Light Char – Quick charring forms a charcoal layer. Guaiacol adds soft, woody smoke, while syringol introduces subtle complexity.

💨 Medium Char – Deeper charring forms syringol for richer smoke and cresol for spicy, medicinal depth.

🔥 Heavy Char – Deep char creates activated charcoal. Phenol gives earthy smoke, while cresol adds bold, heavy charred flavours.



💬 Which side do you lean towards—sweet toasted notes or bold smoky depth? And have you ever tasted a whisky that nailed the balance? 👇

1n7e6q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuckyBarnes/comments/1n7e6q2/my_bucky_barnes_headcanons/,My Bucky Barnes Headcanons,"These are just a few head canons I have for him and most of them are used in my fanfic on wattpad The Ghost of Winter. Lmk what ya'll think. 

He runs cold and always feels cold. Bucky is typically show wearing several layers and the years of being in cryo has messed with his body temperature. When someone touches Bucky his skin is colder then most. This also means that when he takes a shower it has to be scalding hot just so he can feel a little warmth. 

Bucky isn't a big physical touch guy. Not anymore. Its a result of his own trauma as well as a fear that he might hurt other people. If he does touch you it's s sign of trust, major trust. There are only very few people who he lets touch hims. However if someone is hurt he won't waste time, he'll jump right in and see what he can do to help, to stabilize or treat the wound. If Bucky touches you it is also a sign of trust in you. 

Bucky does not like super tight clothes. It feels suffocating and reminds him of the suit hydra used to make him wear. 

Hates speaking in Russian. Reminds him of his time as the Soldier. Spending time with Yelena and the Red Guardian though have helped change his perception on it bit by bit. 

Bucky won't wear any type of earpods, nothing that goes directly in his ear (and though he wears comms devices it's not his favorite) and he just started warming up to headphone that go over the ears. It reminds him of the memory suppressor chair so he typically listens to his music out loud. 

Speaking of music Bucky loves 40's music and loves records and record players. 

Bucky does like/ is particular about who touches his hair/head. It's a very sensitive part of his body that he feels he needs to protect. Its been ingrained in him on a subconscious level. And he never wants anyone to mess with his head every again. 

Bucky still has nightmares. They were getting better after Falcon and the Winter Soldier but when the Void happen it kick started all of those memories again.

Bucky is a gentlemen. Always walks on the outside of the side walk, opens doors for every woman, and goes out of his way to help one if they are struggling with carrying something like too much grocceries of shopping bags. He had four sisters so he respects woman. 

This one sort of goes off the way before but Bucky is not physically intimate. Or at least he hasn't been since the 40's. I have that being the case for two reasons. 1. Bucky was a victim of assault when he was with hydra resulting in ptsd and trauma. He isn't just going to turn around and be comfortable. Bucky doesn't do one night stands. He doesn't do clubs. 2. Bucky would only be intimate like that with someone he loves whole heartedly, when he is ready, and when he trusts them fully and himself. It would take time and I think it should. If he ever is he is very gentle, slow and making sure his partner is comfortable. But physically intimacy isn't how he shows love. He shows it in so many other ways that physical intimacy really isn't needed to communicate that. And now this one might seem a far reach but I can even see him waiting till he is married. I don't know, I know its sort of against his flirty personality we see in the 40's but again different man. 

Bucky knows way too many languages.

Bucky can take apart and put together any weapon in the field in a ridiculous amount of time. 

Stray animals come up to Bucky. They are drawn to him and he always pets them after hesitating for a moment (but its hard not to pet a cat thats rubbing against your ankle or a dog nudging you hand). He starts taking them in sometimes just for a night feeding ,bathing them, and giving them a place to sleep before seeing if any of the avengers he knows wants the animal or drops hem off at the shelter.

He physically cannot sit or sleep with his back to the door. Just can't. 

A way Bucky shows to someone that they matter to them is by cooking for them, bringing them food or coffee (or whatever they drink) and helping however he can. (For instance Bucky- at least I think- doesn't know that much about boats or at least the type of boat that Sam has but he still showed up to try to help, learning along the way).

Thinks Yoga might be the weirdest thing on the planet. 

Bucky still keeps a journal. He writes nearly every day down because he never wants to forget. He'll keep things too that he finds in the pages something as random as a sugar packet someone used for their coffee. He also has begun writing down what he is grateful for. 

At first Bucky was afraid to step into any church. He didn't think he belonged there. That he was too long gone. That no one could ever forgive him. But Sam takes him to church one day (idky and idk when) and slowly Bucky's feelings toward it shift (idk I see him likely having some sort of idea of christianity since it was pretty common in the 40's to have some type of religion and if I recall Christianity was ranked highest? Idk I'm not googling that right now). Now he'll attend a Christmas eve service if he has time sitting in the back with a hood over his head and his hands tucked in his pockets. Still can't go to an easter service. 

Bucky is skilled with his hands. He worked with them before the war and years of training only amplified that. He can untangle anything and fix almost anything. 

Bucky still enjoys reading and has a small library in his apartment. He leaves Bob books to read. 

Bucky used to write letters to Steve after he had left. But now Bucky has found himself more in the past few years learning that he can be a person without Steve. He also had Sam. Now he has the Thunderbolts, who are far from perfect but in a way remind him of growing up in a large family. Its chaotic. Usually not under control. But they would do anything for the other and always have each others backs (no matter how annoying the other is).

Bucky hates public appearances but always goes because someone like Red Guardian can't be trusted and John Walker always just end up talking about himself. It's usually him or Yelena or Ghost (but Ghost once made someone cry when she started talking about why she was in the suit and the explosion that caused her to be the way she was. When Bucky stared at he with a what happened in his eyes she just shrugged like she was surprised the older woman had broke down).

For the longest time Yelena was the only person Bucky could relate to about mind control. They would talk about it together on late nights. (but now in my fic he does have someone else to talk to it abt if that person would ever open up about it)

Well that it for now hope you liked it.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I’ve traded deadlines and early alarms for late breakfasts, random adventures, and way too much coffee and I’m not even sorry.

With all this extra time, I thought why not meet some new people? I’m all about healthy friendships, good conversations, and nothing but good vibes right now.

We can talk about travel plans, music throwbacks, guilty-pleasure TV shows, random life stories, or just share memes until we cry-laugh. Basically, if you’re kind, funny, and like keeping it light with just the right sprinkle of deep talks, we’ll get along just fine.

So, if you’re up for a genuine chat or just want a vacation buddy to swap stories with, drop me a message. Let’s see where a little random connection takes us.

My issue is how she acts with our kids. She enjoys the fact that they refer to her as scary. She yells at them daily. It can be for wearing the ""wrong"" pair of pants to or asking to take a walk or leaving a wrapper on the coffee table. Every time I've tried talking to her about it she get angry and says I act like she's never allowed to be upset. I asked her when was the last time she actually enjoyed spending time with them and she dismissed it saying she would enjoy it if they ever listened to her. Almost every time we plan a family vacation or a family outing she gets annoyed with them for something and it ends with her yelling at them or sitting there quietly and not talking. When she does enjoy what we're doing, she openly emphasizes how it would be better if it were just me and her. 

I know that she never planned on having kids, we've talked about that before. I never planned on having kids either, but we did. I feel like she has some sort of resentment towards them though and she sees them as a chore. ",3,1756903661.0,confessions,4,0.67,False

I’ve realized recently that I don’t really have anyone in my life I can nerd out about books with offline, so I’m thinking of starting a small book club. Just a few people meeting up for food/ coffee and yapping about books.

For me, just consuming media isn’t enough to complete my experience, I need to discuss and dissect it with others. I love digging into personal takeaways, societal angles, and literary analysis because it expands my mind and my understanding of people.

This wouldn’t be a “let’s all read the same book together” kind of club. Instead, the idea is that each of us brings in whatever we’ve been reading and we talk about it (without major spoilers). This is because I've been there, done that numerous times and it always fizzles out because it's really hard to match timelines. 

One small note: this will probably be most enjoyable if you’re already someone who reads regularly, since the conversations often connect across different books and ideas. It’s less of a “let’s start reading” club and more of a space to share and exchange what we’ve already been reading.

Time: Brunch this Sunday
Location: In and around Kalyani Nagar or Viman Nagar

I mostly read fiction across genres. Right now I’m reading Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts, The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin, and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

1n7djcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1n7djcq/how_can_net_solutions_still_surprise_developers/,How Can .NET Solutions Still Surprise Developers in 2025?,"Every year, developers call time of death on another technology stack. And yet, some platforms just won’t quit—because they don’t need to. .NET is one of those. Once pigeonholed as the “enterprise-only, Windows-first” framework, .NET has quietly evolved into something surprisingly modern, open, and versatile.

But here’s the kicker: .NET solutions in 2025 aren’t just surviving—they’re changing the way we think about speed, cross-platform development, and modernization. If you thought .NET was boring, you might want to take a second look.

# 1. From Enterprise Bloat to Lean Experimentation

For years, .NET projects had a reputation for heavy configs and IIS nightmares. Today? Developers are building **microservices with minimal APIs, cross-platform apps, and lightweight containers** using .NET 8+ that spin up faster than you can finish your coffee.

That agility flips the old narrative on its head. .NET solutions are no longer lumbering giants—they’re toolkits for quick iteration.

Need a regex-based API to validate a number format like `^\+?[0-9\-]{16}$`? In modern .NET, it’s almost effortless. And thanks to runtime performance improvements, you don’t sacrifice speed to keep your code maintainable.

# 2. Truly Cross-Platform, Finally

Remember when critics said, *“.NET is chained to Windows”*? That’s history. With .NET Core and now .NET 8, developers deploy to Linux, macOS, cloud-native environments, and even IoT devices.

Why does this matter? Companies that once relied on expensive Windows servers can now **deploy .NET code across Kubernetes clusters, hybrid clouds, or lightweight containers**. That’s not just flexibility—it’s efficiency.

For developers, it means your skills are suddenly more portable than ever.

# 3. Domain-Specific Innovation

.NET doesn’t have to be everything to everyone—it thrives in industries where **stability and performance** are non-negotiable:

* **Healthcare**, where .NET solutions process sensitive data with compliance baked in.
* **Finance**, where transaction-heavy workloads demand reliability.
* **Manufacturing**, where IoT devices and backend systems integrate seamlessly.

The clever part? Many businesses don’t want a full rewrite. They want **incremental innovation**—layering AI-driven analytics, automation, or modern UIs on top of .NET systems. That’s innovation without disruption.

# 4. Lessons from .NET’s Evolution

What .NET teaches us isn’t just about code—it’s about mindset.

It’s easy to chase shiny new frameworks. It’s harder, but smarter, to ask: *“Can we modernize what works instead of scrapping it?”*

That’s where .NET shines. It rewards pragmatic teams who evolve gradually, rather than hitting reset. That mindset is invaluable for any developer.

# 5. Businesses Are Paying Attention

It’s not just devs who notice .NET’s evolution—business leaders do too. The framework’s maturity and flexibility make it a favorite for digital transformation.

Abto Software, for example, has shown how you can modernize .NET apps without ripping them apart. By integrating AI modules, migrating workloads to the cloud, or extending solutions with APIs, older systems become **launchpads for innovation** instead of dead weight.

That’s strategy—and strategy sells.

# 6. The “Enterprise Dinosaur” Myth

Yes, .NET jokes still float around. You’ll hear cracks about bloated enterprise apps or “VB.NET nightmares.” But those so-called dinosaurs are now delivering performance benchmarks that rival lightweight frameworks.

In a world where tools vanish overnight, .NET’s persistence is actually a feature. The ecosystem is stable, the support is consistent, and the tools won’t disappear in a GitHub repo cleanup.

Sometimes, boring is reliable. And reliable is underrated.

# 7. Where Do We Go from Here?

If you’re a developer, don’t dismiss .NET. Try using it as a thought experiment:

* How would you design a high-performance API with minimal overhead?
* Could you integrate AI-driven services into an existing .NET backend instead of rewriting it?
* How would you make a decades-old .NET ERP system talk to modern cloud microservices?

If you’re a business owner, the question is simpler: **Do you really need to replace what works, or can innovation happen incrementally?**

# Final Thoughts

.NET solutions in 2025 aren’t dinosaurs—they’re evolving toolkits. Developers who explore .NET’s modern capabilities discover speed, flexibility, and reliability hiding beneath an old reputation.

So the next time someone asks, *“How can .NET solutions still surprise developers in 2025?”*—you’ll know the answer. Not because .NET suddenly became trendy, but because it’s quietly proving that evolution beats extinction.

Maybe the real surprise isn’t .NET itself—it’s what developers and businesses choose to build with it.",1,1756902753.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share a story about how well things have gone so far, just to offer some peace of mind if anyone's looking for that kind of story!

37, no kids, VERY BAD period pain and heavy bleeding. moderate exercise history. suspected Adeno and known fibroids, dr wasn't sure if I had Endo. NO SURGERY HISTORY and I was worried about nausea/sickness after surgery because I get super nauseas in the car.

found a surgeon where I live (New England) who does davinci surgery. met with her in the spring, had my second ever pelvic ultrasound, and scheduled for aug 21. it started to feel WAY too real and I was nervous, but every 28 days when I was going through 12-15 tampons and 3-5 pads per period, I remembered why I was doing this.

I made a list called ""symptoms in case I ever forget how bad it was"" which included: Leg pain, Sciatica, Lower back pain, Neck pain, Bloating like I’m pregnant every single day for 20 years, Exhaustion. No really. Exhaustion., Period cramps!!!!, TMJ might be related?, Constipation, Bladder pressure and pain, Moody, Sex pain, Bleeding after sex, Cramps so bad my feet hurt, Planning vacations around my period, 10+ tampons a day plus pads, Could I ever take a full breath?, Back pain, Horrible headaches from neck pain, 4 pm coffee is normal now, Adderall to be less foggy, HORRIBLE PAP SMEARS, Hip flexor tight pain ?, HUGE CLOTS OMG, bleeding thru a tampon after an hour lol, Anxiety dreams about toilets overflowing with blood, Constantly needing to plan around bathrooms.

my surgery was on Thursday, so starting sunday, I ate a high fiber, low meat diet, with lots of broths and other nutrient dense foods. I drank more water everyday than I've ever had (which was annoying because my bladder was SO SMUSHED, I have since learned). 0 alcohol, sleep early, and I did a lot of visualizations to try and relax. I imagined my surgeon going home the night of my surgery and saying that she had a good workday, and that helped me anxiety a lot.

surgery was at 1 pm, arrival at 11. fasted after 8 pm night before. had 1 ensure pre surgery drink, per my surgeon, and LOTS of water up til 11 am.

easy check in, super  chill pre-op, loved my team. my surgeon actually came to get me in the waiting room, and she did my pre op pep talk before going to eat her lunch while I got set up. it made me feel weirdly calm that she was about to go eat lunch (because it's her normal workday!), and I felt relaxed and ready to roll. I get nervous in hospital because I have emetophobia, but the hospital had private pre op and post op rooms, which was amazing. wiped down with those warm antibacterial wipes. my anesthesiologist was so caring and calming. my partner was with me the whole time, and then they walked with me down the hall before I was carted off. I went in at 12:45 pm.

I got on the OR table and it was so weirdly cozy and comfortable. I said, 'it's like a NASCAR pit' as 4 or 5 people got me set up, and everyone introduced themselves and asked how I was feeling. my surgeon said hi again and gave me a brief run down, and then reassured me that I'd be taken care of. a mask was put up to my face sideways while someone asked me to breathe in and imagine the last place where I felt calm (in bed with my cat), and then I woke up with a pile of graham crackers on my chest in my private recovery room, with a nurse typing at her computer and welcoming be back. :) oh, and the little cup of ginger ale next to me was SO DELICIOUS. I guess I told them beforehand I would want ginger ale instead of juice or water, and it was the best drink of my life. I felt 0 nausea and just super comfy and relaxed and HUNGRY.

my partner said that my surgeon came out around 3:30, and gave a rundown on how things went. very good and easy surgery, no Endo though the checked everywhere, still suspected adeno (""bulky and globular"" uterus), fibroids, and an uncomplicated removal of my uterus, tubes, and cervix. she said things went well and that my partner could head in in about an hour. the hospital has little restaurant style buzzers that buzz when they can head in, and around 5 they came in. I was so happy to see them, and I guess was covered in crumbs with a big sleepy smile, and I kept asking ""did they do it? did they do it?""

Foley catheter was removed so I could pee around 5:30/5:45, and I guess I was really vibing in my oversized t shirt, waddling to the bathroom like Donald Duck pants less! I was able to pee pretty easily, and I ate some more crackers, had my IV out, and was wheeled out around 6:15. I was ready to go home. Felt ZERO nausea, and was just vibing on the drugs and graham crackers.

We stopped to get my very small amount of meds on the way home, and I was home by 7. I ate some Puffins cereal and then took a nap for a few hours. I woke up at 10:30 SO HUNGRY and was able to slowly get myself out of my bed by pulling up the railing, scooted to the kitchen, made a bowl of cereal, and apparently texted me bestie ""this is the best cereal ive ever eaten"" and sent her a picture.

I slept all night okay, with a pregnancy pillow around me to keep my legs propped up. I gotta say, I didn't need any of the mumus/overalls/rompers, but the things I used most were my old heating pad and this exact pillow: [https://babymoov.us/products/xxl-pregnancy-pillow](https://babymoov.us/products/xxl-pregnancy-pillow)

The first few days were GASSY, and someone on reddit said 'arm windmills' help -- and they were right. I rested on the couch in a pillow pile with my heating pad, and only took 1 of the meds (the second night, to relieve the diaphragm spasms from the gas pain). Lots of smoothies, soups, stews, and Advil. TONS of water and nuun to rehydrated. Every time I felt nauseas, I would eat cereal, and it went away.

Have been able to ""go"" every other day. I use half dose of Miralax in the morning coffee, 4 magnesium citrate gummies (""Calm"" gummies), double dose of fiber gummies, 1 Colace a day.

I've balanced rest with doing stuff, and am really tuning in to listen to my body. I think we learn to override our pain SO MUCH when we have endo/adeno/fibroids, so learning to listen again is helpful. I've been able to drive, am doing some basic cooking and chores, and have seen many friends. I have a few hours a day of activity then rest for the rest of the day. I go back to work as a Telehealth provider next Monday and feel like I'll be ready. The brain fog can be pretty intense (like COVID brain fog) so I'm back on my ADHD meds and that helps a lot.

and for what it's worth: I'm wearing jeans as I write this! I've been in mostly leggings, but my jeans fit normally (if not a little loose). I'm a size 10/12 usually and I realize my bloat was what always made my pants so uncomfortable. even with surgery inflammation, my jeans fit better than before surgery??

My bladder feels like it holds a normal amount of pee, and I'm not bloated to hell like I used to be.  I am having some left ovary pain, which I used to get, and my dr said this would be happening for some time while it adjusts to being pushpinned into my body lol

OVERALL FEELING AMAZING! I didn't mean to write a thesis on this, but I also am going to not doubt myself and just post it because I read allllllllll your stories before my surgery and the thorough ones offered me a lot of peace of mind. I know it's only about 2 weeks out and things can change, and I'll update if things take a turn.

ask me ANYTHING and I'm sending strength and support to anyone reading this at 3 am because they're thinking about or worried about their own surgery. <3

1n7dhfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1n7dhfq/i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an_oldfolks/,"I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.  Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn’t own a lot, and anyway, I wasn’t coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of *Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn’t like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn’t. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn’t bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn’t been updated since the 80’s, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn’t too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA’s, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident’s beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly. 

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I’ve never told anyone:

I’m terrified of old people.

I don’t know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it’s just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn’t bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading *Salem’s Lot* by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn’t need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA’s, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn’t want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch *Supernatural.* Sometimes we’d shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched *Nosferatu* at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria’s are garbage, but the Home’s food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA’s and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn’t for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don’t exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they’d quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn’t complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing *Elden Ring* and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn’t have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn’t mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn’t want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my *Beserk* brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn’t know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into *Beserk* too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. “For shift exchanges,” she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying “sure.” I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn’t have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we’d play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn’t have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I’d ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn’t really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA’s hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn’t talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn’t really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn’t want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn’t have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That’s when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won’t go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don’t know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena’s phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena’s name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn’t respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she’d ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn’t risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn’t hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

“Get up. Get over it. You have a life to live,” she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn’t a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena’s apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn’t want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn’t true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don’t think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a “Lena” living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I *knew* I wasn’t crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn’t said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn’t know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for: 

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn’t a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly’s for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn’t do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss’s office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home’s records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.  I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss’s door was locked.

It wasn’t.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA’s about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly’s screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read “archived footage”. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said “Footage moved to Secondary Storage.”

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren’t allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn’t closed the camera window.

She didn’t look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

“I always forget the damn spoon.”

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA’s in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn’t familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren’t usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that  I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss’s keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn’t even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet’s handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn’t recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.  I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don’t know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn’t care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn’t say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn’t go home. I didn’t trust my apartment was safe. 

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS’s and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled “Lena” and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly’s room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn’t remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn’t turn. It didn’t look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena’s neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly’s arms began to expand and contort. Lena’s body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly’s fingers and into her body. 

Lena’s body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly’s arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena’s mouth was open in a scream I couldn’t hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly’s hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly’s form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn’t look away. I hated it, but I couldn’t stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word “Evidence” written on it.

I was a coward. I should’ve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should’ve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I’ve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don’t require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don’t ask questions.

But I know now I haven’t run far enough. For the past month, I’ve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don’t know how much longer I can last.

There’s a reason I haven’t said the location of the Home, or even which state it’s in.

I can’t remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can’t even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there’s a blank space where it should be.

I can’t find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I’m going crazy.

But I know it’s real. I can’t forget what I’ve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it’s only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can’t say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It’s like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

It’s getting harder to say no.",1,1756902612.0,Creepystories,1,1.0,False

Bill Gibson, the way I knew him, was a very solid man. At the time of me knowing him Bill Gibson wore khaki clothes and had a leather bag strapped over his shoulder. In the leather bag Mr. Gibson, that’s what I liked to call him, carried mate which he liked to drink in-between coffees during the day. I didn’t drink mate but I drank coffee with him and we both liked to smoke cigarettes. It was a great pleasure to smoke with Mr. Gibson. He always rolled his cigarettes and I smoked straight ones. We also drank red wine and beer when it was cold and, when the first warm days would come, we drank gin-tonic. Once we drank gin-tonic in early March. Spring didn’t come for a while afterward but it was a good day nonetheless. We sat at a wooden table outside a Southwark pub, him wearing his khaki shirt and me wearing a shirt too, and we both thought it would be a good day to start drinking gin-tonic. So we started and we drank it throughout the spring every day.

We both read a lot. I read out of obsession and Mr. Gibson read out of principle. He wanted to find his right place in the world. He taught me about Brian McGee and Bill Buckley’s Firing Line and he derived much firmness out of the solidity of these old shows. He derived it out of his khaki clothes too and out of his main dream, which was to return to his country. Nobody else dreamed of returning to their country, but that is what Bill Gibson wanted. He dreamed about girls too of course, but he never talked about that. What he did talk about was institutions. He imagined going back and having the right institutions put in place to create something solid out of his country. None of us thought it a good idea that he should go back. Mr. Gibson was a very blond and tall man and it was a funny idea that he should go back to A. Nobody else returned to their countries. Only Mr. Gibson did.

When I visited his country, five years later, we didn’t get to speak except in the end. We had seen each other several times in company but we did not get to speak. On the last day he came to my hotel to say goodbye. We spoke about not getting along with new people. Most things we didn’t speak about. Someone took a picture of us in the end. It was not a bad picture. I’ll look at it one day.",2,1756902585.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False
1n7dh0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1n7dh0p/romantic_relationships_at_the_office_my_experience/,Romantic relationships at the office -- my experience,"Many people come to Reddit to ask whether they should date a coworker.

I personally have never dated a coworker.

I have, however, known a perhaps a dozen people who have *themselves* dated coworkers.

And these relationships did not have a happy ending... in fact, what almost always happened was that one person had to leave and find a new job.

*That is not to say that dating a coworker cannot have a happy ending*... it's just that I personally have not ever seen such a thing happen.
___

Many years ago I knew two people named Steve and Wendy.  

They both worked for me (I was their manager).

They did not share the same office space... rather, they worked in different offices on the same floor of the building.

Their offices were about 100 feet down the hall from one another.

If I recall correctly, they were in the early 30s... both very nice people, smart, easy going.

They were not on the same ""team,"" but once in a while they had to work together on projects, along with other colleagues.
___

They started going out for coffee, then started going out for drinks after work, that sort of thing.

I knew this because Wendy would often tell me... she was quite excited.

This went on for about two months, and from what I could see, they were both beaming.  

Wendy once told me that Steve was the greatest guy she ever met.  

Because they were adults, I presumed that they had been physically intimate, and that feelings were quite strong.

* Back in those days, there were no organization rules which cautioned against / prohibited office romances.  
* There was no one in HR who could counsel people about the potential perils (below) involved in workplace romances.
* So people were free to do whatever they wanted, and as a result, there was nothing I could say to either of them, even though I knew that what they were doing was ill-advised.
___

Long story short, one day I sent Wendy an email to ask her about a project she was working on, and I did not hear back from her.  

I gave her a call, and she didn't answer her phone.

I assumed that she was busy doing something else, so I left it alone and waited to hear back from her.

The next day I saw her walking down the hall towards me, and it was obvious that she had been crying.

She told me that she and Steve had broken up, and were no longer a couple.
___

Obviously I did not inquire because it was none of my business... and in any event, the reasons for the breakup were not important.

* What *was* important was the fact that following the break up, the two of them had to continue working with one another at the office... sometimes collaborating on a project together.
* They had to continue walking down the halls and seeing each other on a regular basis.
* They did not / not have the option of staying in their offices all day, because that was not the nature of the work that they did.
* And had they stayed in their offices all day, that would've affected their job performance, and that meant that when the time came for a six month review, there was a chance that they would not receive a good rating.

*Put another way,* **they effectively were trapped** … the nature of their work demanded that they sometimes interact, and even if they did not interact, they would often see one another every single day.

* They would each wake up in the morning, fully aware that they were going to see one another... and obviously, this was a source of great anxiety.
* And *that* was because they could not escape one another for 8 hours each day, despite the fact that it was obvious that what they needed *most* was to be separated, and alone with no contact -- not even visual contact -- so they could each deal with their feelings and emotions following their break up.

For Wendy, anyway, these feelings of anxiety were so strong that she was sometimes simply unable to do her work.
___

Over the next month, both Steve and Wendy were having problems functioning at the office.

They were often late coming in, and they were not able to complete assignments on time, among other things.

Eventually, Wendy had to leave her job and find a position elsewhere in the city.

(She told me afterwards in an email that she had been looking for a job on another floor of the big office building where we worked, but she was still afraid that she might run into Steve in the cafeteria.)

Which was a shame, because she loved what she did, and she was an excellent employee with great potential to rise in the organization.

* Obviously, there are people who can have an office romance, and if it does not work out, then they are able to carry on as before, with no particular effect on their work performance.

* This is unusual, and it takes a great deal of maturity.

For me, the story about Wendy and Steve was a cautionary tale about how people sometimes let their feelings and their emotions interfere with their ability to think critically about their situation… and about the repercussions,  should something not go according to plan.

Which is almost always what happens when feelings and emotions are involved.

The 60mg worked, maybe a bit less than 70mg but it still worked. I did however crash pretty heavily at around 7-9pm. (I take my meds around 10-11am)

still crash around 8-10pm though. (Maybe I need to have a second coffee later in the day)

No side effects except dry mouth and extra sweating.
No problems with anxiety, chest issues or blood pressure and no problems falling (and staying) asleep

I'm wondering if I should finish on 60mg since it also worked?

Or should I just finish on 70mg since I'm not having negative side effects?

With the Phase 3 efzofitimod readout almost upon us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to show what you can learn by taking a forensic and methodical approach - whether you’re a retail investor or just someone who’s curious about how these stories play out behind the scenes. Over time, I’ve found there’s real value in connecting with the broader community, keeping an eye on public forums and social media, and just asking the right questions. When you step back and piece together different voices - publicly shared, cross-checked, and never taken at face value - you often find details that don’t show up in official communications.

Across the past year, I’ve tracked a mix of patient stories - sometimes buried in a Facebook comment, sometimes laid out in a longer post on Reddit, sometimes just a small thread in a support group. In my experience, when you look at these things side by side, a few themes emerge: how patients talk about their experiences in trials, what they say about steroid tapering, and the reality of trying an investigational therapy in the real world. Just to be crystal clear - none of what follows is intended as a signal or a recommendation. This is not trading advice, it’s not an investment thesis, and it’s certainly not validated data. This is simply an educational example of the kinds of things you might notice if you go looking, and what it means to read between the lines, with the right mindset.

It’s also worth noting that there may be institutional investors and analysts who occasionally track these same “smoke signals” - not because you can act on them, but because they might highlight questions worth exploring further. Retail and institutional readers alike benefit from context, not predictions. Everything I discuss here is anonymized, drawn from the public domain, and intended purely as an educational resource.

A quick thank you to u/feythehuman from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for surfacing some of these stories and helping connect a few dots. This kind of research is genuinely global now. Each week, I end up in conversations with people in the US, Asia, Australia, Europe, and elsewhere, all following these developments from their own angle.

**Why Patient Stories Matter (But Only In Context)**

One thing I’ve learned over time is that the deeper you go in biotech research, the more you realize how much of the real story happens outside the official channels. Patient stories, shared publicly on forums and social media, aren’t a replacement for clinical data - but in my view, they can be an important (at a minimum, interesting) part of the mosaic if you read and interpret them with the right mindset. 

There’s something fundamentally different about reading how people actually experience a disease like sarcoidosis compared to reading a summary in a medical journal. The formal endpoints are crucial, but you only get the true sense of burden - the day-to-day impact on breathing, mobility, mood, and family life - when you hear it in patients’ own words. For pulmonary sarcoidosis, which is an absolutely brutal disease by any standard, these stories make it clear just how severe the unmet need really is.

In my opinion, even for those of us who are here first as investors, it pays to step back and try to understand the world from the patient’s perspective. You’re not just betting on data - you’re ultimately investing in the hope that new therapies can change real lives. Seeing this side of the story can help ground your thinking, remind you what’s at stake, and keep you focused on what actually matters.

Here are a few reasons I think patient stories are worth reading (always with a healthy dose of skepticism and respect):

- **Pattern Recognition:** If you read widely, you’ll notice certain challenges or small victories come up over and over again - struggles with steroid withdrawal, new symptoms, or even small gains in daily functioning. These recurring details can sometimes provide early clues or add context you won’t see in the top-line numbers.
- **Lived Experience:** Stories about trial participation often highlight practical hurdles: the logistics of monthly infusions, the emotional ups and downs, or the unpredictable nature of flare-ups and remissions. You see the real-world variability that clinical trials try to measure, but don’t always capture fully.
- **Language and Desperation:** The language patients use is often raw and unfiltered. You get a sense for the level of desperation in this space, the search for answers, and the deep desire for any therapy that might help. The posts are often filled with hope, anxiety, frustration, and sometimes even resignation - reminders that behind every statistic is a real person navigating an extremely difficult journey.
- **Community and Shared Learning:** These forums are also hubs of community and solidarity. Patients compare notes on medications, side effects, and even share information about competing solutions, including other clinical trials and new drugs in development. The back-and-forth isn’t just about hope - it’s about practical problem-solving and mutual support, sometimes with users sharing pictures of their own disease progression or medical results. All of this makes the experience real in a way that no clinical slide deck ever could.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** If you start seeing similar reports from unrelated users, across forums and time zones, it might suggest there’s something worth paying attention to - even if you’re not drawing hard conclusions.

I want to be very clear that in this post, I’m not going to identify any of the specific people who shared their stories, nor will I point to the exact forums where these discussions took place. That’s out of respect for privacy and to make sure no one feels exposed for sharing openly about their health. Everything here is anonymized, paraphrased, and checked for broader themes. The point is education and context - not exposure or sensationalism.

That said, if you’re interested in seeing for yourself how these conversations unfold, I’d recommend spending some time in the sarcoidosis forums on Facebook or similar public groups. Even a short scroll can give you a sense of what patients are actually dealing with, what they’re hoping for, and what living with this disease is really like. I can’t recommend it highly enough as a way to ground your perspective - whether you’re an investor, a researcher, or just someone interested in the reality of rare disease.

It’s important to keep these limitations front and center:

- **Anecdotes Are Not Evidence:** Patient stories are inherently selective. People who feel strongly - good or bad -are more likely to post, and you’ll never get a full denominator from forum threads.
- **Never Substitute for Data:** All of this should be treated as context, not as a catalyst or a call to action. In my view, you always want to keep the distinction clear: patient voices are a useful source of perspective, but not a foundation for an investment decision on their own.
- **Ethical Responsibility:** Everything I share is anonymized, paraphrased, and checked for themes. The point is education and context, not exposure or sensationalism.

If you’re genuinely interested in understanding both the science and the reality of a disease like pulmonary sarcoidosis, I’d actually recommend spending some time in patient forums - not for trading research, but to see what patients and caregivers are really living through. You’ll find, in the aggregate, an enormous amount of resilience, frustration, and sometimes hope. It’s educational on a human level, and frankly, it makes you think differently about what innovation in this space could actually mean.

Some things to consider as you read:

1. **Institutions may notice these patterns too.** some large funds, analysts, and even companies themselves probably keep an eye on public sentiment and recurring themes - not to act on single stories, but to keep their radar up for broader shifts or signals.
2. **The absence of chatter can matter.** If there’s a big problem with a trial, you might see it reflected in a change of tone or increased complaints, even before anything official is released. Silence, or a steady pattern, can sometimes be just as telling as a wave of posts.
3. **Repeated, cross-validated themes carry more weight.** One-off anecdotes don’t mean much, but when several unrelated people echo similar experiences - timing, tapering, side effects, improvements - it’s at least worth noting, even if it doesn’t rise to the level of hard evidence.

In my view, the reason I spend time on this kind of research is not to find shortcuts or signals - it’s to better understand the intersection between data, patient reality, and what it means to bet on innovation in biotech. If you’re serious about learning, or even just curious about the real-world side of this disease, I think you’ll find the exercise both humbling and eye-opening. It’s not just about potential returns; it’s about seeing the human side of the investment, and what’s really at stake as these readouts approach.

**What I Found – Themes, Cross-Checks, and Illustrative Quotes**

When you systematically go through the patient stories and discussions in the public Sarcoidosis forums, some clear patterns start to emerge - both in content and in how they’re shared over time. In my opinion, this section is the closest you can get to a real-world window into the trial, short of actual clinical data.

The strongest through-line is the experience with steroid tapering. Multiple users describe, sometimes in detail, how they struggled to reduce prednisone for years, but during this trial (almost always explicitly referenced as a monthly infusion, or named as efzofitimod), they managed to taper down or get off entirely. The timing is often specific:

- One user, posting December 2022, shares a photo of their IV and writes, “First dose of trial drug today!” The follow-ups: by January 2023, she’s posting about being on her second dose, down to 2.5mg of prednisone, thrilled with results. By March, she says, “Fourth infusion, off prednisone for the first time in years. No side effects.” These posts appear over at least five separate updates, and you can cross-reference the timeline to known trial protocol dates.

- Another participant posts in August 2024, “I have been off prednisone since December, thanks to a clinical trial - monthly infusion, no side effects, no serious respiratory issues even when I got sick.” When asked about side effects, she simply replies, “None.” Again, this aligns with the known trial schedule and protocol.

Several threads include people sharing their progress over months, not just one-off comments. You see users talking about their first infusion, their experience with each subsequent visit, and then posting again once they’ve achieved steroid withdrawal. In at least two examples, these are women from different parts of the US, referencing sites like New Orleans and talking about timelines (“started December,” “off steroids by March,” “trial ending in August”).

Credibility is further strengthened by the way different posters corroborate and comment on each other’s experiences. In many of these threads, other group members chime in with “Same here,” “My experience too,” or ask follow-up questions about dose, taper speed, or what their doctor said. There’s even the occasional cross-check where someone asks, “Is this efzofitimod?” or “Which site are you at?” - with answers confirming alignment with the study. These are not isolated voices, but part of a rolling, ongoing conversation.

There’s also a layer of realism in the challenges and setbacks. Not every story is a win - at least one person describes having to resume prednisone after a failed taper, while another talks about being excluded from the trial for being “too sick,” despite normal tests at her regular clinic. Night sweats, fatigue, and mental exhaustion also come up, echoing both the known burdens of steroid withdrawal and the emotional toll of chronic illness.

To make it real, here’s a set of direct paraphrases, each grounded in posts you provided, with dates and context:

- December 2022: “First dose of trial drug - monthly infusion. Will update.”
- January 2023: “Second dose, down to 2.5mg prednisone, no side effects.”
- March 2023: “Fourth infusion today, completely off prednisone, first time in years.”
- August 2024: “Been off prednisone since December. Monthly trial infusion. Even after a bad cold, I didn’t need steroids.”
- Across 2023-2024: “No major side effects, sometimes fatigue, but nothing like with steroids.”
- Ongoing: “Had to go back on prednisone after symptoms returned, but still made more progress than in previous years.”
- Exclusion: “Turned away from trial, told I was too sick even though all my hospital tests have been fine.”

It’s important to be upfront about the likely biases in these forums. People with strong experiences - positive or negative - are more likely to post. There’s also the reality that, formally, trial participants are often instructed not to share details during a blinded period, and you’d expect the company to discourage open posting. Yet, as anyone who spends time in these groups knows, patients frequently share anyway - sometimes just out of excitement, sometimes for support, sometimes because they’re genuinely looking for answers. In my view, the fact that these posts persist, despite likely instructions to keep quiet, actually adds a layer of authenticity. Not every post will get through, but the volume and consistency suggest a real signal rather than just noise.

What lends credibility to these posts?

- The specificity of details: timelines, dose changes, infusion schedules, site references, and repeated follow-ups.
- The presence of both successes and setbacks: not all stories are positive, and failures or struggles are not hidden.
- The back-and-forth and peer validation within threads, with group members asking for more information or clarifying what protocol or site is being discussed.
- The longitudinal nature: stories that unfold over months, not just a one-time update.
- Consistency across geographies and platforms: various regions are represented, with posts lining up with trial milestones.

A practical note on how I handle all of this: Every time I see posts like this, I make a habit of screenshotting it and saving it into a dedicated folder. Over time, this has become a catalogue - a library - of these stories, each organized by date, theme, and sometimes even the user’s journey across months. I review these regularly, often going back to see how specific participants’ stories evolve, cross-checking for updates, follow-ups, or new corroborating details. For me, it’s about building a methodical, forensic record - capturing everything as it appears and keeping it organized for later review.

And finally, a note about context: these are all unvalidated, real-world patient experiences, pieced together for educational purposes only. In my opinion, what stands out is not just the pattern of steroid-sparing and improvement, but the fact that people keep coming back to report new milestones, setbacks, and practical advice, all while openly cross-referencing the known details of the efzofitimod trial. For anyone wanting to interpret “smoke” in public data, this is an interesting complement to your research - though, as always, the final word is in the clinical results, not the forums.

**So What? What This Does (and Doesn’t) Mean**

If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ll understand that these patient accounts have the potential to offer a fascinating, but very limited, glimpse into what might be happening during a clinical trial. The key, in my view, is understanding both the value and the strict limitations of these anecdotes.

Here’s how I personally use this kind of information:

- **Context, not Catalyst:** These stories are never a reason to buy or sell. I don’t view them as trading signals, and neither should anyone else. For me, they’re a prompt to look deeper - to ask whether what I’m seeing in official communications matches what’s being experienced on the ground.
- **Hypothesis-Testing:** Patient stories can be a helpful way to sanity-check your assumptions. If the anecdotes line up with what you’d expect from the mechanism, prior data, or management’s narrative, that’s a useful consistency check - but it’s never enough on its own.
- **Pattern Recognition:** The real value is in the patterns, not in the individual accounts. When you see recurring themes across different forums, geographies, and timelines - such as consistent references to steroid tapering, lack of major side effects, or the same infusion schedules - it’s worth paying attention to. It doesn’t mean it’s statistically significant, but it may be meaningful as “smoke.”
- **Understanding Patient Reality:** One of the best uses of these stories is simply to appreciate the human reality of what’s at stake in these trials. You get a window into what life is actually like for patients, how they manage uncertainty, and how a new therapy might actually impact them day-to-day. That perspective is easily lost when you’re only reading clinical endpoints or market reports.
- **Awareness of Bias:** Always keep in mind the natural selection bias - patients who experience strong results, good or bad, are far more likely to post than those whose journey was uneventful. There’s also a chance that negative outcomes go unreported, especially if patients are discouraged from sharing during a blinded trial.

If you’re looking for practical takeaways, I’d offer the following:

1. **Treat forum anecdotes as breadcrumbs, not proof.** Let them inspire questions and curiosity, but never let them replace hard data.
2. **Corroborate across sources and time.** The more you see similar stories appear from different people, in different places, at different times, the more you can at least trust that there’s a real experience being reflected - but never as your sole evidence.
3. **Respect privacy and intent.** Always anonymize and paraphrase, and never share anything that could expose someone who didn’t ask to be spotlighted. 
4. **Check for alignment with other data.** Use these stories to see if what’s happening in real life matches the trends in the published data, management commentary, or regulatory filings.
5. **Never substitute anecdotes for analysis.** Use them to enhance your perspective, not as a shortcut to conviction.

In my view, these types of patient accounts can be valuable for anyone trying to sharpen their understanding - not just of this trial, but of how real-world research can inform a much bigger picture. They’re most useful as a window into what could be happening on the ground, and as a way to test your own priors. All of this applies to any stock, any trial, anywhere: if you’re methodical, skeptical, and willing to do the work, you’ll find plenty of these trails. They add color, sometimes raise red or green flags, and always give you more to think about - but they are never the story on their own.

Ultimately, I treat this process as one piece of a much broader toolkit - one that keeps you grounded in the real world while always returning to the fundamentals. The story will always be finished by the data, not the anecdotes, but there’s value in learning to see the whole picture.

---

**Summary**

Bringing it all together, what really matters is not any single anecdote, but the broader mosaic you build when you look across time, platforms, and individuals. These stories - from different sites, countries, and backgrounds, shared openly and then cross-validated as best as possible - show both the power and the limits of real-world research in this space. In my view, they highlight that some of the most meaningful signals aren’t obvious or dramatic. What matters is the repeated patterns, the subtle echoes, and the broader context that develops when you put all the clues together.

My advice, especially for anyone trying to get better at this process, is to stay curious and take the time to actually go looking for yourself. Spend time in the forums, read the conversations, and try to really get a sense of the patient landscape. Be an observer first - see what’s being discussed, what’s repeated, and how real people describe their day-to-day reality with a disease like sarcoidosis. Understand what a company like ATYR is actually trying to solve for - the problems, the frustrations, and the unmet needs that patients talk about when nobody is scripting the conversation. You’ll never predict a trial outcome from anecdotes, but you’ll come away with a much deeper understanding of what’s at stake and why these questions matter.

In the end, don’t trade on these stories and don’t let them dictate your thesis. But do let them sharpen your critical thinking and give you a more grounded sense of what’s actually happening on the ground. The best analysts are always looking for clues, reading between the lines, and challenging their assumptions. Just remember: clues aren’t the science, and the real work is still ahead when it comes to interpreting the results.

If you’re serious about investing in biotech, make a point to get close to the patient experience, understand what’s being attempted, and ask yourself what success would really mean for those living with these diseases. Sometimes it will work, sometimes it won’t - but in my view you’ll see the field with clearer eyes, and that’s valuable on its own.

She got a private parking ticket for overstaying at this Starbucks at a retail park in Bedford. There are signs as you drive into the car park (which she drove past as she was focusing on the road), but no sign within view of the disabled bays themselves. The one sign that is nearby points in a different direction.

Disabled parking bays are obviously close to buildings to limit the distance disabled people have to walk/navigate - however there are no signs visible between the disabled bays and the entrance. Is this grounds for disability discrimination to appeal the ticket? 

Unfortunately Starbucks has a sign saying you can give your reg plate to get longer parking, but due to her height/angle seated in a wheelchair she couldn't see it behind the counter 😩 

She has limited mobility and therefore isn't always capable of taking anything but the shortest route from A to B, and in this instance there was no sign in-between.

The New England Stories NMQ-6+6 lint roller set has been a surprising addition to my daily cleaning arsenal. Owning pets comes with the perpetual challenge of battling fur and lint, especially when living with a shaggy dog who thinks every surface is his personal lounge. I decided to give this product a shot based on its promise of 1200 sheets and upgraded handle design. Turns out, this humble lint roller does an exceptional job, but I noticed a few quirks along the way that are worth sharing.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the design feels thought through. The blue plastic handle, lightweight yet sturdy, fits snugly in my hand without causing tension after extended use. One detail I appreciate is the 360° ergonomic rotation on the handle. It glides effortlessly whether I’m swiping over the couch or maneuvering it across oddly shaped furniture. Rolling back and forth feels seamless without the handle sticking in awkward directions.

The sheets themselves are cleverly designed in two colors—blue and white—making it dead simple to locate the peeling spot, even if you’re half asleep before your morning coffee. It’s a small thing, but anyone who’s wrestled with finding the edge on a poorly designed lint roller knows how infinitely frustrating that can be.

**Ease of Use**

Switching out rollers was a breeze. With twelve rollers (six rollers plus six refills), I don’t anticipate running out anytime soon, even with daily use. One key feature is how easily the sheets tear off. I’ve tested other lint rollers that tear unevenly or leave remnants of glue behind, but this one tears cleanly without hassle.

[Check New England Stories NMQ-6+6 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0cflbg456/)

**Upsides**

- 1200 sheets is a game-changer for someone like me who uses lint rollers daily.
- The upgraded handle feels durable and ergonomic while enabling smooth 360° rotation.
- The extra stickiness means I don’t need to roll over the same area multiple times—pet hair, lint, and dust come off in one or two swipes.
- Multi-occasion usability makes it ideal for clothes, furniture, car interiors, and even bedding.
- Compact and portable—you can throw one in your bag for emergencies or keep it in your office drawer.

**Negatives**

While this lint roller impressed me overall, there were a couple of challenges I faced:

- At 2.77 pounds for all twelve rollers, it’s not the most lightweight pack to store or carry around as a whole.
- Occasionally, the adhesive sheets are so sticky they make a slight struggle out of separating them.
- For users with simpler lint-cleaning tasks (like removing fuzz rather than pet hair), the extra stickiness might feel overkill.

**Competing Products**

Let’s talk about how this lint roller stacks up against others I’ve tried. Compared to another popular product, the Scotch-Brite Lint Roller, the New England Stories model wins hands down in sheet volume. While Scotch-Brite offers good stickiness, it lacks the upgraded handle design and ergonomic rotation seen here. On the flip side, if you’re looking for something smaller and compact for travel-specific needs, products like Sticky Buddy might shine brighter. However, Sticky Buddy doesn’t bring nearly as much value to the table in terms of rollers and refills.

In terms of sheer efficiency on pet hair, this product edges out the competition thanks to superior adhesive power. Still, I could see how very casual users might prefer a standard product with less stickiness or smaller sets.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Talking price versus value, this product stands out. While I can’t quote exact prices (as they fluctuate far too often), the volume you’re getting—1200 sheets—is unmatched by most standard lint rollers. When you factor in the durability of the handle and the ease of use, this really comes across as a smart purchase for anyone juggling pets, kids, or just lint-prone living spaces. Budget-conscious buyers looking for a true workhorse in lint removal will see why this set holds appeal.

You Are Here → Stage 1: The Detonation Zone (aka The ""What the Actual F*ck?"" Phase)

This is the immediate aftermath. The bomb has gone off, and you're stumbling around with your ears ringing, trying to figure out if that's your leg or a table leg over there.

 * What it Feels Like: You're the main character in a poorly written disaster movie. You're either completely numb, operating on pure adrenaline and a diet of caffeine and spite, or you're weeping uncontrollably because you saw a dog that looked happy. There is no in-between.

 * Your Only Job Right Now: Survive. That's it. Breathe. Drink water. Try to eat a goddamn vegetable. Do not make any major life decisions that aren't about immediate safety. Your brain is a scrambled egg; it is not fit for executive functions.

 * Kickass Tip: Your mantra is ""Just for today."" Can you get through just today without lighting your life on fire? Yes. Yes, you can. Also, do not get bangs. I repeat, step away from the scissors. Bangs are not a solution; they are a cry for help that you'll have to grow out for two years.

Stage 2: The Shit-Show Safari (The Anger & Blame Phase)

The numbness is wearing off, and now you're just pissed. At your ex. At their lawyer. At your lawyer. At that one friend who said, ""Everything happens for a reason."" You want to key their car with that platitude.

 * What it Feels Like: You are a human Molotov cocktail looking for a place to land. Every song on the radio is a personal attack. You spend your nights composing brilliant, scathing emails that you are (hopefully) smart enough not to send.

 * Your Job: Find a healthy outlet for the rage before you end up in a viral YouTube freakout video. This is the time to lift heavy things, take up kickboxing, sprint until you can't feel your legs, or scream into a pillow. Anger is pure fuel. Use it to power your workouts, not your text messages.

 * Kickass Tip: Create a ""Fuck-It Bucket."" This is the opposite of a bucket list. It’s a list of all the petty, wonderful things you can do now that you're single. Eat garlic bread in bed. Watch 8 straight hours of that dumb show they hated. Leave the toilet seat in whatever goddamn position you want. It's childish, it's petty, and it's glorious.

Stage 3: The Ghost Mall (The Bargaining & Deep Sadness Phase)

The fire of your rage has died down, and now it's just cold. This is the stage of ""what ifs"" and ""if onlys."" The loneliness is a physical presence. It sits on your chest while you try to sleep.

 * What it Feels Like: You're wandering through a shopping mall at 3 AM. All the stores are closed, the lights are dim, and the only soundtrack is the sad, echoing part of a Celine Dion song. You're haunted by the ghosts of good memories, which are often more painful than the bad ones.

 * Your Job: Feel it. This is the part everyone tries to skip. Don't. You can't outrun this wave, so you might as well learn to surf it. Cry. Be miserable. This is you metabolizing the pain. If you numb it with booze, casual sex, or obsessive work, it will just be waiting for you later, bigger and uglier.

 * Kickass Tip: Implement the 5-Minute Rule. If you get the overwhelming urge to check their social media, look at old photos, or otherwise poke the wound, set a timer for 5 minutes. You can wallow for exactly 300 seconds. When the timer goes off, you must get up and do one productive thing: put a dish away, do a push-up, reply to one email. It’s harm reduction for the heartbroken.

Stage 4: The Fog Begins to Lift (The ""Oh, Right, I'm a Person"" Phase)

One day, you'll wake up and realize you slept through the whole night. Or you'll laugh at a joke and it won't feel forced. Or you'll go an entire hour without thinking about them. These moments are fragile glimmers of life.

 * What it Feels Like: You're waking up from a long, nasty flu. You're still weak, but you're starting to notice the sun is shining and you might actually be hungry for something other than emotional garbage.

 * Your Job: Start rebuilding. Who are you without them? Reconnect with friends you lost in the couple-bubble. Re-engage with a hobby you dropped. Figure out what you actually like. This is the awkward, clumsy process of re-learning how to be a ""me"" instead of a ""we.""

 * Kickass Tip: Date yourself. Seriously. Take yourself out to a nice dinner. Go to a movie alone. Buy yourself the good coffee. You need to prove to your own damn self that you are kickass company before you even think about inviting someone else to the party.

Stage 5: The Kintsugi Phase (Radical Acceptance & Rebuilding)

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer mixed with powdered gold. The philosophy is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken. This is you.

 * What it Feels Like: It's not about ""being healed"" or ""over it."" It's about integration. The divorce is part of your story. The scars are there, but they're not ugly wounds anymore; they're gold seams that prove you survived something that was meant to shatter you. You don't hate your ex anymore; you might feel nothing, or a distant, quiet sadness for what was lost.

 * Your Job: Live. Take the lessons from your Moral Inventory and apply them. Build a life that is so rich and fulfilling that your past trauma becomes a footnote, not the headline.

 * Kickass Tip: Stop telling the ""sad divorce story."" You know the one. The script you recite at parties. It's time for a rewrite. Start telling the ""badass survival and rebirth story."" The narrative of your life is yours to control. Give yourself a better script, because you're the hero of this story, not the victim.

The Fine Print: You will bounce between these stages like a goddamn pinball. You might go from Kintsugi all the way back to the Shit-Show Safari in the space of an afternoon because you smelled their shampoo on a stranger. It's okay. It's not a failure; it's the process.

This is your becoming. It's messy, brutal, and profoundly beautiful. Now, go be the badass you were forged to be.

Stuff that would have saved me years of confusion, embarrassment, and straight-up bad decisions. Things that seem obvious now but felt impossible to figure out when I was younger.

Here's what I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me before I learned it the hard way.

1. Your 20s are for figuring it out, not having it figured out. Stop panicking because you don't have a 10-year plan. Most successful people changed directions multiple times.
2. Lifting weights isn't about looking good, it's about feeling good. The confidence boost from being physically strong affects everything else in your life.
3. Learn to cook 5 solid meals. You'll save money, eat better, and people will think you're more attractive. Win-win-win.
4. Your parents were just winging it too. They didn't have all the answers. They were figuring it out as they went, just like you are now.
5. Comparison is the thief of joy .That guy's highlight reel isn't your behind-the-scenes reality. Focus on your own race.
6. Invest early, even if it's just $50 a month. Compound interest is magic, but only if you start early. Your 65-year-old self will thank you.
7. Learn to say no without explaining yourself. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stop over-explaining and giving people ammunition to argue.
8. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. Therapy isn't for broken people. It's for people who want to get better at being human.
9. Quality over quantity applies to everything. Friends, clothes, experiences, relationships. Better to have a few great things than many mediocre ones.
10. Learn basic home maintenance. Unclogging a drain, changing a tire, using basic tools. YouTube is your friend, incompetence is expensive.
11. Your job is not your identity. What you do for money doesn't define who you are. Don't let work consume your entire sense of self.
12. Sleep is not for the weak. 8 hours of sleep will do more for your productivity than 3 cups of coffee and pure willpower
13. Learn to listen more than you talk. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Ask questions, listen to answers.
14. Grooming and style matter more than you think. You don't need to be handsome, you just need to look like you give a damn about yourself.
15. Have uncomfortable conversations early. That awkward talk you're avoiding will only get more awkward with time. Rip the band-aid off.
16. Your gut instinct is usually right. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust that inner voice, even when you can't explain why.
17. Learn to apologize properly. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" isn't an apology. Take responsibility, acknowledge impact, do better.
18. Build genuine relationships before you need them. Network by helping others, not by asking for favors. Be useful, not needy.
19. Your comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there. The things that scare you are usually the things you need to do most.
20. Time goes faster than you think. That ""someday"" you keep talking about needs a date on the calendar. Someday is not a day of the week.

Which lesson hits you the hardest? Which one do you wish you'd learned sooner?

In the past when we used to be on the same continent as our parents, I was keen to travel to new places and tried to avoid to go to his family or my family every summer.   
Ever since we got married, he has been so persistent that he wants to spend around 2 to 3 weeks of the summer in his family house that he has been coming since he was a child.    
This is a nightmare for me, because it takes a day and a half to get to his family house, have to deal with his controlling mother 24/7 bear with the mess and the unhygienic way of living.  For example, if I try to cook something, his mother will literally stand to me all the time and comment etc, if I try to do the laundry it is the same. If I go to shower I need to shower as quick as possible because the shower doesnt work properly. Every move is monitored - heck, even when I try to make a coffee in the morning she is standing next to me and monitors what I am up to.

My husband does not get it that I dont want to spend every summer here. I said to him that we should either buy a house by the sea (since he loves the sea so much) since we have the money to do so, but he doesnt want. The only way would be to buy a house next to his family house so he can still comes at the same place every summer.   
Jusr fyi, I do not visit my family every summer, so I do not drag him in my family home to spend evey summer with my family. He says it’s not his problem that I do not go to my family home where my parents live every summer.  

I told him to start coming alone since I enrolled back to University and my studying was more important. He kind of indirectly forced me to come and here am I - impossible to focus on studying or writing. I asked him for us to leave earlier na she is against it. 

I just dont know what to do any more of moving forward.

1n7d56l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n7d56l/marinas_journey_to_freedom_how_one_woman_found/,"Marina’s Journey to Freedom: How One Woman Found Independence, Respect, and Inner Strength Amid Family Tensions"," Marina felt a rare sense of calm for the first time in a week. Sitting in her home office, she leaned back slightly in her chair, sorting through documents while simultaneously checking her bank balance. The number on the screen was slowly approaching the goal she had set for herself. In just a month, she would be able to buy the white SUV she had been eyeing at the dealership. She closed her eyes for a moment, imagining herself behind the wheel of her new car—the sense of independence, freedom from endless requests from her husband, and not having to adjust to his schedule. No more borrowing his car, waiting twenty minutes at bus stops, or hauling heavy folders on her shoulders. For the first time in years, Marina allowed herself to dream of a life that could be a little simpler and more comfortable.



As the evening sun dipped toward the horizon, Marina sat down beside her husband on the sofa to share the news. Oliver, not looking up from his phone, nodded distractedly.



— “Good. Just make sure it’s practical, not some toy,” he muttered without raising his head.



Marina raised an eyebrow.

— “I’ve already decided. A white SUV, economical, spacious. Perfect for my client visits.”



At that moment, the familiar clink of a cup on a saucer and a low grumble came from the kitchen. Charlotte, her mother-in-law, appeared, drying her hands on a towel and deliberately pausing in the doorway. She had an uncanny talent for showing up at exactly the moment when the young couple discussed something important.



— “Why do you need a second car?” she asked, her tone as if she were administering an exam. “One car per family is plenty. Oliver goes to work, comes home in the evening. And you—what, drive everywhere every day?”



Marina felt her shoulders tense instinctively. She knew that any word could trigger a new attack.



— “Charlotte,” she began calmly, trying not to give in to emotion, “my work involves constant travel. Three times a week I visit clients, sometimes in other towns. Public transport makes this very inconvenient.”



— “Oh, come on,” her mother-in-law waved dismissively. “We managed just fine before. Your father-in-law and I drove one car all our lives. And nothing happened. Now everyone must have a car.”



Marina noticed Oliver retreating into silence, unwilling to defend her. It irritated her further. She clenched her hands into fists.



— “With all due respect,” she said firmly, “these are my earnings, and I decide how to spend them. I need the car for work.”



Charlotte narrowed her eyes, as if trying to peer into Marina’s hidden motives.



— “Your money?” she snapped sharply. “Who bought your apartment? Who paid for your wedding? Or do you think family means everyone for themselves?”



Finally, Oliver spoke, softly:

— “Mother, don’t interfere in our affairs. Marina earns her own money and makes her own decisions.”



Charlotte glared at her son, feeling betrayed. Her eyes glistened slightly, but she did not argue further.



— “Fine. I’ll leave, then. Just remember—this won’t bring you any good,” she said, retreating with a faint rustle, leaving an almost tangible tension in the air.



For the next two weeks, the household was filled with strained silence. Charlotte spoke to Marina only when necessary, while spending long hours with Oliver in conversations where Marina felt invisible, yet under constant scrutiny. She sensed her mother-in-law’s gaze cutting across her like knives, realizing that any mistake could be weaponized.



When preparations began for Charlotte’s sixtieth birthday, the tension escalated.



— “Oliver, I’m turning sixty!” she declared loudly at breakfast. “This is a serious milestone. I want to celebrate it properly.”



— “Of course, Mum. What do you have in mind?” Oliver replied, swallowing a bite of bread and trying to stay out of conflict.



— “A restaurant,” she said. “A nice one downtown. I’ll invite all my friends, former colleagues, Aunt Helen from the suburbs, and Vladimir with his family. About twenty people in total.”



Marina choked slightly on her coffee. She understood this would be an expensive affair, but Oliver stayed silent.



— “Twenty people? Charlotte, that’s a lot of money,” she ventured cautiously.



— “And what, are you begrudging me money?” her mother-in-law squinted. “Or do you think I don’t deserve a proper celebration?”



— “No, of course you deserve it,” Marina replied, trying to remain calm.



— “No ‘of course.’ I only turn sixty once in a lifetime. I want everyone to remember this day,” Charlotte said firmly, shutting the door on any objections.



Oliver once again withdrew into himself, staring at the butter and bread with an expression that seemed to say he wasn’t there.



The next weeks were a frenzy. Charlotte called friends and relatives, finalized the menu, ordered flowers, inspected the restaurant, and planned the music. She glowed with anticipation, as if the success of her entire life depended on the evening. Marina watched from the sidelines, occasionally attempting to gently inquire about costs, but Oliver responded evasively:



— “Mum has it all under control. Don’t worry; we’ll manage somehow.”



Marina understood that any doubt she expressed would be seen as an attack, so she kept her emotions in check, continuing to save for her car.



The day of the birthday arrived. The restaurant was indeed beautiful, with panoramic windows, fresh flowers on the tables, soft lighting, and impeccable service. Guests arrived one after another, filling the hall with laughter, chatter, and a gentle bustle.



Marina had to admit: Charlotte knew how to make an impression. She flitted between tables, receiving congratulations, telling jokes, laughing openly. Guests admired her charisma and ability to host a perfect celebration.



— “Charlotte, you have such a lovely daughter-in-law!” Aunt Helen chirped, nodding toward Marina. “And she’s hardworking too, I’ve heard. A solid position in a reputable firm.”



— “Yes, hardworking,” Charlotte replied dryly. “Working. Planning to buy herself a car, while not a penny goes to her elderly in-laws. But a car for herself—no problem.”



Marina felt her cheeks burn but turned to the window, hiding her emotions. The guests exchanged glances, sensing the subtle insult. It was a deliberate attempt to belittle her, to show she was “selfish and spoiled.”



The evening continued with courses served one after another, toasts made, songs sung, and laughter shared. Charlotte remained the center of attention, occasionally casting a pointed look at Marina—a mixture of malice and expectation—but Marina ignored it, focusing inward.



When the waiter brought the bill, the tension reached its peak. He politely placed the folder with the check in front of the birthday woman. Charlotte glanced at it briefly, then unexpectedly handed it to Marina.



— “Why are you staring? Pay the bill—it will be my gift,” she said loudly, clearly for all to hear.



The room froze. Guests fell silent; conversation became awkward. Marina stared at the check, stunned. The sum was enormous, even for her accustomed spending. Oliver went pale, opening his mouth, but no words came out.



Charlotte, confident in her triumph, looked at her daughter-in-law with unmistakable glee. She had planned to humiliate Marina publicly, achieving two goals at once: shame her and block the car purchase.



Marina took a deep breath and felt the calm she had cultivated for a month return. She slowly pushed the folder aside and, looking Charlotte in the eyes, said:



— “You know what, Charlotte? I left home lightly today. No credit cards, no phone. I have more important expenses than throwing money at people you gossip about afterward.”



Her mother-in-law turned crimson with anger.



— “What are you saying?!” she hissed.



Marina continued, unwavering:



— “The money I earn is for improving my life. If someone wants to throw a party at their own expense, that’s their choice, but I will not pay for someone else’s whims, especially if they aim to humiliate me.”



Oliver tried to intervene, but Marina raised her hand:



— “No, Oliver. Today, this is my stance. And I am proud to assert it calmly, without shouting or scandals.”



Guests watched with genuine interest. Some exchanged quiet glances; others widened their eyes in surprise. Even the waiter, accustomed to eccentric clients, raised his eyebrows.



Charlotte froze. Her plan had failed. She had wanted to humiliate Marina publicly, but instead faced calm composure and firm resolve. She felt the collapse of her strategy pressing on her.



Marina felt lightness and inner triumph. She knew there would be further conversations and manipulations, but for the first time, she realized that no attempt at public humiliation could shake her confidence. She smiled, lifting her gaze to the guests and quietly added:



— “A celebration can be wonderful without forcing anyone to pay for personal ambitions.”



Guests applauded softly, some nodding in respect, while distant relatives clearly recognized it as a lesson in dignity and courage. Oliver, though embarrassed, nodded subtly. For the first time in a long while, he saw his wife as truly strong.



Charlotte was left speechless, her face revealing a mixture of anger and dismay. She attempted to continue the celebration with a smile, but her triumphant mood had vanished.



Marina, sitting at the table and observing the world around her, felt that the first step toward her independence had been taken. Soon, her SUV would be parked in the garage, and with it, the sense of freedom and control over her own life.






Over the following months, Marina bought the SUV. Sitting behind the wheel for the first time, she felt the freedom fill her every breath and movement. Each trip through the city became a small celebration: no more waiting for Oliver, no need to borrow a car, no restrictions on routes. Every kilometer symbolized autonomy—a quiet victory over past limitations imposed by her mother-in-law.



Charlotte, observing this, felt a mix of irritation and helplessness. She realized her usual methods no longer worked. Any attempt at control now met a wall of calm determination and self-assurance.



Marina understood that real independence wasn’t just about money or material objects but the ability to assert boundaries calmly and confidently, unshaken by others’ opinions or ambitions.



Slowly, the household’s atmosphere stabilized. Charlotte learned to respect Marina’s boundaries. Oliver grew to see his wife as a partner, not a mediator in family conflicts. Marina thrived in her career, traveling freely to meet clients and manage projects, experiencing the joy of life on her own terms.



One evening, as the family gathered for dinner, Charlotte unexpectedly said:



— “Marina, I… I want to thank you. For showing that one can stand their ground calmly and confidently. I’ve probably been too harsh before.”



Marina smiled gently:

— “Thank you, Charlotte. We’re all learning to live together. I’m glad you understand.”



Oliver quietly smiled:

— “See, Mum? Life can be calm without drama.”



Charlotte nodded, a subtle but meaningful acknowledgment: Marina was no longer just “the daughter-in-law” but a full-fledged family member whose opinions mattered.



From then on, life returned to normal, but on new terms. Marina no longer felt pressure or humiliation. Charlotte gradually adapted, and Oliver became an equal partner. Each learned that respect and independence were more valuable than control and manipulation.

  

Every trip in her SUV reminded Marina of that restaurant day—the day she said “no” firmly and calmly, emerging victorious. Her internal world had transformed: she no longer feared judgment or manipulation. Calmness and confidence became her foundation for new achievements.



Even as new challenges arose, Marina met them with a smile and inner strength, knowing her life belonged solely to her. True victory, she realized, was not in money, gifts, or public statements, but in the ability to remain herself, defend her boundaries, and maintain dignity and freedom.

In the following weeks, the household settled into a quieter rhythm. Charlotte, though still proud and occasionally sharp-tongued, had begun to navigate around Marina’s boundaries rather than trying to push them. She no longer made passive-aggressive remarks or staged small tests; when she needed assistance, she began asking politely, sometimes even seeking Marina’s advice. Marina noticed these subtle shifts and responded with warmth, understanding that respect was being built slowly, step by step.



Oliver, too, grew more attentive and engaged. He started involving himself in family decisions rather than letting his mother dominate the conversation. He discovered that a partnership built on mutual respect and trust made their life easier—and their home calmer. He watched Marina flourish with pride, finally seeing her not just as his wife but as a strong, independent woman capable of handling challenges on her own.



Marina’s work thrived. Each business trip became a symbol of her independence. Driving her SUV through unfamiliar streets of nearby cities, meeting clients without having to coordinate schedules with Oliver or anyone else, she felt a sense of ownership over her time and energy that she had never experienced before. Each kilometer behind the wheel reminded her of that restaurant evening—the moment when she had stood her ground and gained her dignity without shouting, without tears, and without compromise.



Even Charlotte, observing Marina’s calm confidence and seeing how much Oliver respected his wife, began to reassess her approach. She realized that commanding and controlling others was no longer effective. Respect, she noticed, had a far stronger impact than fear or intimidation. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, she began to soften. She asked Marina for advice on household matters, consulted her about gifts for distant relatives, and even complimented her on her professional achievements. Marina, in turn, treated these overtures with courteous attention, understanding that this was a fragile but important reconciliation.



One quiet Sunday evening, the three of them sat in the living room, sipping tea. Charlotte finally spoke with a sincere tone:



— “Marina, I must admit… you’ve taught me something. Standing firm doesn’t have to be confrontational. I’ve been too strict and too eager to control.”



Marina smiled gently.

— “Thank you, Charlotte. It’s a learning process for all of us. We’re finding a way to live together without stepping on each other’s boundaries.”



Oliver raised his cup with a small smile:

— “See? A little respect goes a long way.”



For the first time, the household felt genuinely balanced. Marina no longer felt like a subordinate in her own home. Charlotte, though strong-willed, had begun to see her daughter-in-law as an equal, someone whose decisions mattered. And Oliver, bridging the gap between them, finally understood the importance of mutual respect and independence.



Marina continued to drive her SUV, attend client meetings across town, and manage her projects with a newfound sense of freedom. Each trip, each completed task, each decision made without interference reinforced her sense of self. She felt empowered, knowing that she could navigate any situation—personal or professional—with poise and calm authority.



Life didn’t become free of challenges, of course. Charlotte still had her moods, unexpected comments occasionally arose, and new situations tested Marina’s patience. But now, Marina faced them with confidence, grounded in her knowledge that she could assert her boundaries and defend her independence without losing composure.



One evening, as Marina parked her SUV in the driveway after a long day of client visits, she paused to look at the soft glow of the city lights. Oliver came up beside her, handing her a cup of coffee, and whispered:



— “I’m glad we’ve reached this point. You’ve changed everything for us—for me, for all of us.”



Marina took a sip, smiling at the reflection of the lights in the windshield.

— “I feel the same, Oliver. And the best part is… our life now belongs to us. No one else sets the rules.”



Together, they watched the city hum quietly below them, feeling a rare serenity. Marina knew that life would continue to challenge her, that there would always be moments when she needed to assert herself. But she also knew, deep in her heart, that she had discovered a vital truth: independence was not merely financial or practical—it was an inner strength, a calm certainty, and the courage to be herself fully.



And as she closed the car door and walked into her home, Marina felt a deep satisfaction. Her SUV was more than a vehicle—it was a symbol of freedom, of personal power, and of the confidence to navigate life on her own terms. The restaurant confrontation, the months of tension, the subtle daily battles—they had all shaped her. She was no longer merely reactive; she was proactive, steady, and unafraid.



From that evening on, every drive became a reminder of her victory, a quiet celebration of self-respect and inner strength. The lessons she had learned, born out of conflict and challenge, now guided her daily life. She understood that the true measure of power was calm confidence, and the most significant triumphs were the ones that could not be measured in money, influence, or recognition—but in the quiet freedom to live according to one’s own principles.



And so, Marina drove on—through the streets of the city, through new projects, and through life itself—with a steady hand, an independent heart, and an unshakable sense that her life, finally, truly belonged to her.

In the weeks that followed, life at home settled into a new rhythm. Charlotte still had her moments of pride and occasional sharp remarks, but she no longer tried to dominate Marina. She began to approach her daughter-in-law with respect, occasionally seeking her advice or insight. Marina responded kindly but firmly, understanding that respect had to be mutual and consistent.



Oliver noticed the transformation too. He started taking a more active role in the household and in family decisions, learning to balance his mother’s expectations with his wife’s autonomy. He realized that supporting Marina’s independence did not diminish his bond with his mother—it strengthened their family. Slowly, a sense of harmony returned to their home.



Marina herself flourished. Each day behind the wheel of her SUV, each successful client meeting, reinforced her sense of freedom. She was no longer constrained by schedules dictated by others or by silent expectations. She could plan her days, make her own decisions, and pursue her career without interference. Her independence was now visible, tangible, and deeply satisfying.



One evening, as she returned from a particularly successful business trip, Oliver greeted her at the door with a smile.



— “You’ve changed everything for us,” he said softly. “I’m proud of how you’ve handled everything.”



Marina smiled, feeling the warmth of accomplishment.

— “It wasn’t just me,” she replied. “We’re learning together. Respect, independence, trust—these are what make a family strong.”



Charlotte, watching quietly from the living room, felt a mix of irritation and reluctant admiration. She realized that her old methods of control no longer worked, and perhaps never would. Slowly, she began to accept that Marina was no longer the timid, dependent daughter-in-law she once tried to manipulate. Marina was strong, assertive, and capable—an equal in every sense.



Over time, the dynamics in the household transformed completely. Charlotte became less controlling, more considerate, and occasionally even sought Marina’s opinion genuinely. Oliver became a more attentive husband, partner, and mediator. And Marina, with each passing day, felt more confident in her ability to navigate challenges—both professional and personal—with grace and authority.



One quiet evening, the three of them sat together over tea. Charlotte, tentatively smiling, spoke first:



— “Marina… I want to thank you. You’ve shown me that strength doesn’t always come from authority or control. Sometimes it comes from calm confidence.”



Marina returned the smile warmly:

— “Thank you, Charlotte. We all grow from each other. And I’m glad we’re finding our balance.”



Oliver raised his cup with a small grin:

— “See? Calm and respect—works every time.”



From that moment on, life in the household moved forward on healthier terms. Marina continued to pursue her career, traveling freely, managing projects efficiently, and enjoying the independence her SUV provided. Every drive reminded her of the pivotal restaurant evening—the night she first said “no” with unwavering calm, earning respect without anger, drama, or tears.



She knew there would be challenges ahead. Charlotte could still test her patience, new situations would arise, and tensions might flare occasionally. But Marina now had the inner strength to face them without fear. She had discovered a vital truth: true independence comes from self-respect, calm confidence, and the courage to live life according to one’s principles…………..
